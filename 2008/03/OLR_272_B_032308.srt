2
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:24,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Easter Sunday, March 23rd of 2008.

3
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:28,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live here in the studio.

4
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some unfortunate news a little earlier on.

5
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:39,274
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen to Part A. Big changes coming to OLR very soon, and hopefully next week we'll have more information on that for you.

6
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:43,775
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, the show goes on, and it will go on as it always has.

7
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will go on right now with Loki spreading the rumors.

8
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:49,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Horse Pick

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Copiers, Plagiarists How do they know it's in the works?

10
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't fucking know, nor do I care

11
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I think you underestimate the fanboys I'm

12
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that it'd be cool if a Kid Icarus game came out.

13
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's the game he's talking about.

14
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:17,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Animal Crossing is the game he's talking about, but if there is a Kid Icarus game in the works, I mean, they'll be pretty big, but I don't think it is the game that they're going to be announcing.

15
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it could be a game they're announcing.

16
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:21,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a game, yes.

17
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:23,046
[SPEAKER_02]: The game, no.

18
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo of America's history dating all the way back to the NES and you know no surprise this game was going to be a big seller but this was a like really big seller.

19
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:03,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is sold at a rate of more than 120 units per minute between the day it launched March 9th and March 16th.

20
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a huge selling game.

21
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:10,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ross2UT, though, is the first to point out.

22
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,726
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Debbie Downer UT right now.

23
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, still slower than Halo 3.

24
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it is kind of a good point.

25
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't sell quite as much as some of the guys on Xbox did.

26
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: But still a huge seller for Nintendo, nonetheless.

27
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

28
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:34,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And also you have to remember, too, I mean, that they don't have as many units of the Wii yet.

29
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:39,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, as of the 360, they're still number two in the U.S.

30
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, not by much, so that doesn't really make a big difference.

31
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a big deal that it didn't meet up to those Halo 3 type numbers?

32
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:56,928
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think they were ever, you know, I mean, it's, you know, it made history for Nintendo, so I think that they're more than pleased about it.

33
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:24,444
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so going back to the story earlier about Kid Icarus, would it be a game that people would recognize or not?

35
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,026
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge game.

36
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit is a character in the game.

37
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It does a good job at kind of reminding you that Kid Icarus is out there.

38
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,678
[SPEAKER_02]: What with the virtual console thing and the stages and the music.

39
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:35,800
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,409
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they need to... No.

41
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,611
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they need to do with Rob the Robot?

42
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:10,297
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to make it, like, one of those fucking, you know, RoboSapien things, or, like, fucking Furbies, where you can program the shit out of that.

43
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the, uh, what, Ibo?

44
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Ibo, yeah.

45
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, like, something like that.

46
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:16,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, like, really crazy, you know...

47
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Get people to buy that shit that wouldn't have a Wii or something like that and just go crazy with it.

48
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but, like, when I was playing Smash Bros.

49
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:36,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl and I played that subspace emissary mode and I saw the Kid Icarus thing and with the music and him flying through the air, flying down to Earth, and with the music playing, I'm like, God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game now.

50
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that was initially the first thought in my mind.

51
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we might have even been broadcasting on Justin.TV when I was doing that in the game and I seem to remember exclaiming, God damn, we need a Kid Icarus game right now.

52
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:48,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a new one.

53
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

54
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:51,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

55
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:58,369
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says if they do the new Kid Icarus, it's no doubt that they would also have to bring back the Eggplant Wizard.

56
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yes.

57
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The Eggplant Wizard was also a very memorable character.

58
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew him as the annoyingest little fucker in video gaming history.

59
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,613
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most annoying characters, seriously.

60
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,673
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's great, though, about being turned into an eggplant, though?

61
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:10,994
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

62
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:15,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that if you press down to where you can see his feet and then you slide across the floor as an eggplant.

63
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:15,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

64
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Metal Gear Solid Eggplant.

65
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

66
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I love that too.

67
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You just hope that nothing saw you.

68
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can even hold it down and jump as an eggplant, and that was great too.

69
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knew that hospitals could cure the eggplant curse?

70
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:31,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

71
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, you could also turn into an eggplant from watching too much TV.

72
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:38,555
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

73
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyhow, huge numbers for Smash Bros.

74
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:46,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl, and I'm sure this game's just going to continue to sell through Christmas, so we'll see how it holds up throughout the year.

75
00:06:48,158 --> 00:07:02,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news... Okay, well... We know we were talking about how Namco was talking about, you know, not too many people are playing their games.

76
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I should say Bandai Namco.

77
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're talking about, actually they also blamed it on the Wii too, which I think is kind of stupid.

78
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:29,340
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're talking about bringing out games that will combine the arcade and Wii titles to where I guess they'll share scores or that they'll have some sort of interactivity, but it would be for a data exchange between the different versions of the games.

79
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what I have to say about that, Neo Geo?

80
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what I have to say about that?

81
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:39,286
[SPEAKER_09]: F-Zero GX And you know what I have to say about that?

82
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing, I just wanted to join in.

83
00:07:44,089 --> 00:08:02,623
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously though, I mean, they were part of the whole Triforce system that, you know, I think that was only pretty much used for the F-Zero GX stuff, but, you know, it had cross-platform stuff between the arcade and the GameCube, so let's do something similar with SD memory cards, because those are widely available.

84
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:02,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

85
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's smart to make arcades like a gamer's hub.

86
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:34,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that kind of sounds like a big duh type of answer, but I think it's smart to kind of make your arcade games somehow talk to the console games and give gamers a reason to sort of convene in one place, in real life, outside.

87
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:37,893
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not having to use Xbox Live and rely on that type of stuff.

88
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these kind of ideas are smart.

89
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:40,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine like a Smash Bros.

90
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:45,237
[SPEAKER_09]: arcade game or something like that, like done on a huge screen, you know, with four...

91
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:51,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Joy6, you know, set up and stuff and they have like additional characters and all that stuff.

92
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Or things that unlock based on what you do on the home version.

93
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:54,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

94
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool things like that.

95
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

96
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:58,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rad.

97
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,705
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Loki, one could dream.

98
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, one could dream.

99
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens with this.

100
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:14,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Another cool thing that probably will never come to fruition, but you know, at least with all the

101
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:16,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Buzz that's going around about it.

102
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:24,456
[SPEAKER_09]: But a fan of Metroid 2 is actually working on a remake of the game that he's been working on right now for about three years now.

103
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Metroid 2 Return of Samus.

104
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:29,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome looking thing.

105
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:37,079
[SPEAKER_09]: He's using sprites from Metroid Zero Mission as well as the remake of the classic Game Boy game.

106
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,320
[SPEAKER_09]: And some other sprites.

107
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,900
[SPEAKER_09]: He's also hand drawing from the ground up.

108
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Metroid Fusion was the other game he was using.

109
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:50,988
[SPEAKER_09]: and using the program GameMaker7, the guy who goes by DrM64.

110
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:55,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And totally awesome looking game so far.

111
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:06,977
[SPEAKER_09]: They've actually got a, I guess, not really a beta or demo, but a proof of concept demo, I guess, that you can download and play straight off of a bunch of websites.

112
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:13,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're interested in checking it out, it's Metroid2Remake.blogspot.com for the website.

113
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a little YouTube that Tiger Claw sent us of this in action.

114
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat, looks like Super Metroid.

115
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine that's not the sound in-game.

116
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,615
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they actually do have an in-game... I don't think this is it, though, is it?

117
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:36,718
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's the actual game, but that's not the... Damn, the game looks good, though.

118
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:37,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Super Metroid.

119
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:41,642
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad thing.

120
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, wall jumping.

121
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:49,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve.

122
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,873
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks good.

123
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:56,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hope the project doesn't get shut down by the way it ends up.

124
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:57,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It would do, yeah.

125
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

126
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Macman says, oh shit, I thought it was going to be a Rickroll.

127
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,876
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I trust Tigerclaw's links.

128
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you other people, I don't know so much.

129
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:13,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get Rickrolled by you, so don't think I'm...

130
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Rick Roll, you get blacklisted.

131
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you Rick Roll me, I ban you.

132
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:21,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was funny like three months ago.

133
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little old now, so please do not be Rick Rollin'.

134
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Metroid 2, yes, I approve.

135
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope the project doesn't get Rick Rolled by lawyers.

136
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:31,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That would suck.

137
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:35,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like, was it the 3D remake of Chrono Trigger?

138
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's, oh, that thing looked hot, too.

139
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:40,870
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

140
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Mii's, as in the characters that you create on Wii's, were being used to advertise Easter service at a San Francisco church.

141
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

142
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:22,409
[SPEAKER_02]: They used a little Mii that looks like Jesus standing next to a bunny that looks a little grumpy.

143
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little postcard says, Come and follow me, Mii.

144
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Easter Sunday, which was today at 11 a.m.

145
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Mission Bay Community Church.

146
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:33,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

147
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clever ways of advertising.

148
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I like churches that are hip and with it.

149
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I like churches that don't feel like they're still living in the Old Testament.

150
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:47,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the one that was the wedding invitation that had the two me's on there?

151
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:48,443
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think I saw that.

152
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you open it up, it says, Wife Get.

153
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

154
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:57,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

155
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like something that Mel and Mel, my buddies, would be doing for their weddings.

156
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like something they would do.

157
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

158
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,861
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually, yeah.

159
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very cute.

160
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I like cute, innovative ways of doing things.

161
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bless you.

162
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?

163
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allergic to... Something here in the studio?

164
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you allergic to me?

165
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you allergic to Jesus?

166
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a problem.

167
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Mildly.

168
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:27,528
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

169
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully you're not allergic to mail, because this is the part of the show where you're going to read some for us as the listeners email us at mailbag at orangezonsradio.com.

170
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:41,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we get better participation this week than last week?

171
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:47,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we did get some interesting emails, and one of them is from our friend Rob with two Bs.

172
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But he didn't provide the link to the article in the email.

173
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:58,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's basically just talking about an article about the outcome of the guy who... I'm just going to read this from the start.

174
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:04,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a pretty good article on the outcome of that guy who bludgeoned a baby to death for accidentally breaking the Xbox.

175
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting stuff in that article.

176
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,348
[SPEAKER_05]: One, the article does not imply the guy was playing his Xbox at the time.

177
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:17,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, the article does not specify if the murder happened immediately after the Xbox broke or when Spellman, the convicted, discovered it.

178
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:21,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, social workers visited the house regularly.

179
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And four, the autopsy showed evidence of prior abuse.

180
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:28,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It implies a pattern of abuse that shows the man was a ticking time bomb.

181
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: As you said when the story probably came out, it wasn't really about games at all.

182
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:38,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

183
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:47,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no surprise that the media hopped all over this trying to make it a video game thing when it really had nothing to do with that.

184
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:48,474
[SPEAKER_02]: No surprise there.

185
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for the update, nevertheless.

186
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that at you.

187
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that in general, like,

188
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,202
[SPEAKER_02]: There it goes, the media again.

189
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games are evil.

190
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Big surprise.

191
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:07,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Naj linked me a story on CBBC that is actually pretty cool.

192
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more just pictures of a bunch of people, a lot of people dressed up as Mario, but also others dressed up as different characters.

193
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a giant Spyro here, which is a very well-made costume.

194
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Just

195
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,380
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:57,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of anime conventions, I was told via a text message earlier this week, I don't know if it actually ended up happening or not, because I didn't get any text messages tonight, but I'm being told that our show is right now being played at Anime Boston.

197
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:00,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's true, a big hello to you kids at Anime Boston.

198
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:07,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who sent me a text message, so I know for a fact you guys are listening in there, because I don't see anybody in chat or what have you.

199
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,099
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, my phone's in the house, so maybe that's what happened.

200
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you've got mine, text me.

201
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.

202
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:14,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Game's Characters

203
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so you guys have to dig through your luggage and get your game ones.

204
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Just gather a whole crap load of Guilty Gear cosplayers.

205
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,193
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be happy and done.

206
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, would Naruto count?

207
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:54,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Because technically they have Naruto games, but Naruto is an anime character.

208
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,321
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of a gray area.

209
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, a lot of anime characters are games in Japan, right?

210
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:01,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it counts.

211
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:03,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

212
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, yes, next email.

213
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from GS68.

214
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:17,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR Crew, since DarkSakura, if I recall correctly, isn't going to Final May this year, will you still do a panel there?

215
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the things I looked forward to last year.

216
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,495
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are invited to, then yes.

217
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:24,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why not.

218
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:26,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we always submit?

219
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought somebody submitted for us.

220
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:28,876
[SPEAKER_03]: You always have to submit.

221
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I submitted the last two years.

222
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they accepting right now?

223
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:32,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

224
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:33,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we have to submit then.

225
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:34,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

226
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:35,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, are we still going to do a panel?

227
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,791
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

228
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,991
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit about me, yes, I'm an actual DJ and I live in Las Vegas.

229
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Arcades are still alive here.

230
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually mix anime and video game music.

231
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I DJ anime conventions.

232
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:16,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my start as a DJ at FanimeCon 2002.

233
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

234
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be going to San Japan Con to meet with SmileDK.

235
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I might faint when I meet them.

236
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:23,641
[SPEAKER_05]: He he.

237
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:31,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Other conventions I'll be attending are Anime Jam in Fresno, California and Anime Vegas Con in, wait, wait for it, Las Vegas, gasp.

238
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, I have a Wii, and I will be waiting for Mario Kart Wii.

239
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that they removed snaking.

240
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well, I'll find another new strategy to overcome that muahaha.

241
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:48,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also surprised at how easy it is to find Brawl and still no Wii consoles to be found.

242
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't eaten at Olive Garden yet.

243
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have my first Olive Garden experience with OLR.

244
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:54,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only dream.

245
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, DJ Junai.

246
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,416
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

247
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: You pronounce my name right.

248
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: You win an internet and a Mudkip X3.

249
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:04,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically enough, I might actually be going to Vegas in a couple months, so it's on.

250
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Olive Garden, like what?

251
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:10,366
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good Olive Garden in town, which I hope there's got to be in Las Vegas, right?

252
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,108
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be.

253
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,209
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be an Olive Garden.

254
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's no Olive Garden in Las Vegas.

255
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:16,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That would suck.

256
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck for Vegas.

257
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:19,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Some like...

258
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to recall I was in the middle of BFE Pennsylvania and there was an Olive Garden there.

259
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if there was the Olive Garden Casino in the works.

260
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,508
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Chenai is in chat and says, yes, there is an Olive Garden.

261
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:33,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, if I get three breadsticks, does the machine spit out never-ending breadsticks?

262
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:34,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sauce confirmed that there are a few.

263
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

264
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I pronounced your name right is because I'm not Rob.

265
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:43,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

266
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:45,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rosteel UT has a good point.

267
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, why would you go to Vegas and then go to Olive Shit House?

268
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:53,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where I want to... That's actually a good point, because Vegas has so many great restaurants.

269
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck would I go to Olive Garden?

270
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you where I would want to go.

271
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:56,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

272
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I would want to go to the Rio and go to the seafood buffet.

273
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,942
[SPEAKER_05]: The massive seafood buffet that I went to on the DDR Freak Moderator trip that ate a lot of my money.

274
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:09,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go back to Quark's Bar.

275
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Get me a Warp Core Breach.

276
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do one of those myself.

277
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so going to Vegas in a couple months.

278
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:15,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

279
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:17,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go.

280
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: My 30th birthday...

281
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have to get you your present, you know.

282
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, let's have tea here.

283
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, I'd like some tea, thank you.

284
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:59,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Wish I could be listening live tonight, but I'm on a plane right now flying home, so there's not really internet access on airplanes.

285
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, years back, Rob did a review on Trace Memory for the Nintendo DS.

286
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:10,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Trace Memory is actually called Another Code outside the US for any international listeners.

287
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:13,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And he went off on how amazing the game is.

288
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

289
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But that rarely happened in Hotel Dusk.

290
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:39,265
[SPEAKER_05]: The puzzles in Hotel Dusk are generally pretty neat and are excellent ways to use the touchscreen.

291
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:44,150
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is so incredibly well written that it feels like you're actually interacting with the other people in the hotel.

292
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

293
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you who have no clue what Trace Memory is, it's a point-and-click adventure game that uses the DS hardware to the fullest.

294
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:56,923
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is filled with all sorts of little puzzles that you have to solve, and most of them are very well thought out.

295
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:07,086
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even one puzzle where you have to shut the DS just so that you can see the reflection from one side of the screen and the other in order to understand a riddle.

296
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,787
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, check out both of these games.

297
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:11,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good buys.

298
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, all, and please don't forget to save the podcast feed.

299
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:17,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll need something to listen to on the flight back.

300
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:18,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:19,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it taken care of now.

302
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:21,285
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

303
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played Trace Memory, so I don't know how I reviewed it on the show.

304
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:30,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling it was Miklatov that played it.

305
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Miklatov, not me.

306
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:39,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been advised that you need to go to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

307
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:41,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Margaritas.

308
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:42,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down with that.

309
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR, Sharon here.

310
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:55,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going through some old episodes somewhere in the late 100s and noticed that Rob at one point brought up Feel the Magic and repeatedly griped about Sprung.

311
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

312
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:28,661
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

313
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: and Tsukihime or Clannad, two of which have been fairly popular anime based off of them.

314
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, FSN and Clannad, there was no Tsukihime anime.

315
00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that just fan art?

316
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:06,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I did have one, and I actually heard of this one when the Sega CD was new, and it was called Takeru.

317
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:07,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually...

318
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:17,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd remember seeing that they were going to bring it out in the U.S., but it never did on Sega CD, if I recall correctly.

319
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,235
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I have a PC version of it that's fully translated.

320
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely heard of Clannad before, but I haven't played it myself.

321
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of the band.

322
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hope I'm not getting it confused with the band.

323
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:29,864
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm pretty sure I'm not.

324
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:30,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of the game.

325
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's Enya's sister.

326
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:33,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

327
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:36,110
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

328
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:45,665
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few of them that I've heard of, and they sort of did something like that one for the Silent Hill comics, too.

329
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,547
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they tried to, but it didn't.

330
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more just like, oh, we're going to have dramatic music with the comic book panels.

331
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that wasn't quite the same thing.

332
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving forward.

333
00:24:56,113 --> 00:25:00,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the next question involves an email you received last week that concerned the length

334
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,201
[SPEAKER_05]: of arcade shooters like Gradius being too short.

335
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:10,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely agree with Jamie that taking the time to get a high score or playthrough on one credit in games like these gives bragging rights.

336
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:21,768
[SPEAKER_05]: This is doubly true of much more difficult games like Japanese Danmaku or bullet hell shooters like Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, or Mushihime-sama.

337
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So this leads to my next question.

338
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:30,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Have any of you ever played any games from the popular PC danmaku shooter series Touhou?

339
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The Touhou game started on the PC-98 with a game called Highly Responsive to Prayers.

340
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:47,610
[SPEAKER_05]: The game series features a perpetual protagonist named Reimu Hakurei, a miko who operates an unpopular and out-of-the-way shrine in the land called Gensokyo.

341
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Toho's first appearance on Windows was the embodiment of Scarlet Devil, so if it catches your interest, I would recommend starting with that.

342
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:03,606
[SPEAKER_05]: The games are very popular for their music, art style, and curtains, fire pattern, and sense of inner-game character development.

343
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: The games are available for free download on doujinstyle.com, and I would definitely advise anyone who still has fond memories of Radiant Silvergun to check the series out.

344
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up your exemplary work, Shaoran.

345
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not played those games, but due to that well-worded free plug, I just might.

346
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:36,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen, I mean, I'm very, I'm familiar with Toho's games, but I mean, if it was PC, I hardly played it, so I was more of a, you know, like, I'd brought up Bangaio before.

347
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:37,988
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of my favorites.

348
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:42,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was more of a recent one, but I like those kind of games.

349
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I really, really love Radiant Silvergun.

350
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:49,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well then this sounds like something you ought to check out too.

351
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:55,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was actually pretty thrilled that when, that had the aforementioned DDR Freak moderatorship.

352
00:26:56,264 --> 00:27:00,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to this place called, I want to say Game Land.

353
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,467
[SPEAKER_05]: They've gone out of business since.

354
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:08,148
[SPEAKER_05]: This was probably in 2000 something.

355
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:09,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really remember when.

356
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:15,210
[SPEAKER_05]: But I found a Radiant Silvergun arcade machine and played the hell out of it.

357
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:18,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's like, ooh, Mambo A Go-Go.

358
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go play that.

359
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:20,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm like, fuck no.

360
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:21,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I played that.

361
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Mambo A Go-Go was kind of cool, though.

362
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

363
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was too busy on Radiant Silver Gun and Biohazard Gun Survivor 2.

364
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

365
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for the emails?

366
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:35,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

367
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to say no more emails.

368
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:38,126
[SPEAKER_05]: No more emails!

369
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,243
[SPEAKER_02]: She said you wanted some type of sound effects.

370
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:47,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really tragic.

371
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more humorous.

372
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:50,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

373
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send them.

374
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:58,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, we get back into the news, don't we, Loki?

375
00:27:58,829 --> 00:27:59,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do.

376
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully you haven't bought this already because if you did, you just wasted some money.

377
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:12,175
[SPEAKER_09]: But Bungie is now going to be putting out the Halo...

378
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:41,274
[SPEAKER_09]: 3 Legendary Map Pack I believe it was previously $10 and included 3 maps out for free starting at 2am this Tuesday so that sucks but hey it's free and you know what though if you're still interested in spending some money on maps there are some more coming the next map pack which is going to include a Signed Winder remake

379
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:42,439
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

380
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I only download them after they're free.

381
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to pay for them.

382
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, I used to play Halo 2 with my college buddies a lot, but we really haven't been playing Halo 3.

383
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:19,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

384
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:19,702
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

385
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:23,845
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a map that they released in the last map pack that I want to say was empty.

386
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:27,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just this big empty warehouse that you could build stuff with.

387
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:27,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

388
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, but you can build all these cool things and forge with it.

389
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:34,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, thanks, but you really didn't do anything.

390
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:36,996
[SPEAKER_09]: You just made an empty warehouse, you idiot.

391
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:38,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

392
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:41,026
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

393
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can check that out soon.

394
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:51,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And one guy who might actually be back into checking this out was the really depressed guy who had his Xbox 360 ruined by Microsoft.

395
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember this?

396
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his personalized 360.

397
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:59,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It was white clean when he did the whole Red Ring of Death fix.

398
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

399
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,242
[SPEAKER_02]: They cleared it all away.

400
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:05,704
[SPEAKER_02]: PR Nightmare, the story ended up on blogs everywhere.

401
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:06,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

402
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:08,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

403
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So he got more than he had before.

404
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:40,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he got like a care package from Bungie and also from Microsoft.

405
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Way to kiss ass.

406
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will probably be the last time you ever hear about this story on the blogs.

407
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:51,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everyone everywhere is screaming, Microsoft, fuck up my 360.

408
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a cool little care package like this.

409
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:57,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, the art's pretty cool on it.

410
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty rad.

411
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, watch this guy just turn around and sell it on eBay.

412
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:03,037
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be tragic.

413
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:04,757
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.

414
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them to draw on my Xbox now.

415
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:11,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

416
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have a service where you can send in your Xbox and get it drawn on.

417
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that is a little silly.

418
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to provide that service.

419
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:22,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay me $200 and I will customize your Xbox 360 with a Sharpie.

420
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I'm actually not joking.

421
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me your faceplate and I'll customize it.

422
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:32,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we should do that as a contest.

423
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: We should get a blank faceplate.

424
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: They have blank faceplates, right?

425
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:37,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We can customize it somehow.

426
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some of the Ace Combat ones that we can paint over.

427
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:40,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that'll work.

428
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:46,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can just get a faceplate off of a core system or something and they're white.

429
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:47,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you go.

430
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually, all the original faceplates are white.

431
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:51,314
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be fun.

432
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:52,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to do.

433
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some extra ones.

434
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:54,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

435
00:31:55,683 --> 00:32:07,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's some information that's out now about Bionic Commando Rearmed, which is the 2D-style Bionic Commando that they're coming out with.

436
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:17,571
[SPEAKER_05]: The title is supposed to be out in May, and it will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade for $10 American.

437
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:21,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will be a PC version, but they don't have a price on it yet.

438
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:27,749
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Xbox Live version is going to actually be for 800 Microsoft points.

439
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,930
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation Network one is $10.

440
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:39,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And that it will, for the PC version anyway, it will require Windows XP or Vista.

441
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

442
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:48,015
[SPEAKER_05]: At least 512 megabytes of RAM and 650 megabytes of hard drive space.

443
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:49,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

444
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: and it may or may not have unique content.

445
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:55,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It may or may not.

446
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:56,892
[SPEAKER_09]: May or may not.

447
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you for covering the full spectrum of possibilities.

448
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,954
[SPEAKER_09]: This game may or may not be good.

449
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:02,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more information.

450
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:08,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The minimum specs on this is XP Service Pack 2 or Vista.

451
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:14,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I have a pinning for 2 GHz or an AMD XP 2200.

452
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,580
[SPEAKER_05]: 512 MB of RAM, 650 MB of hard drive space.

453
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: 128MB DirectX 9C compatible card or NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or ATI equivalent DirectX 9 compatible sound card, internet connection, keyboard, mouse.

454
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Their recommended ones are actually quite a bit better, but, you know, honestly, why?

455
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:39,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

456
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's like...

457
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download minimum content or you can have the maximum content that's saying you want two gigs of free hard drive space.

458
00:33:48,377 --> 00:33:51,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just the minimum requirements versus the maximum.

459
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:59,683
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either install the entire game off the DVD or you could just run it off the DVD and some of it on the hard drive.

460
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:01,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

461
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:04,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of interesting, though.

462
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:08,948
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been some stuff leaked out from the German ratings board, the USK,

463
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, they had leaked out some stuff a while back, including the translation of Catan and Kassaron to Xbox Live Arcade.

464
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:21,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have another board game turned Xbox Live Arcade.

465
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you mean Carcassonne?

466
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Carcassonne, whatever.

467
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:25,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Casserole?

468
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You said, like, casserole.

469
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:28,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Carcassonne.

470
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:30,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

471
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to, sorry.

472
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:32,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

473
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you finished?

474
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:35,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

475
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:36,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise.

476
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:44,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, one of the games that they had on there was Ticket to Ride, which, if you've played it, it's a train-themed game.

477
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:45,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Also pretty fun.

478
00:34:46,811 --> 00:35:00,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other games that they've also, you know, were revealed on there, of course, Penny Arcades games, On the Rain, Slick Precipice of Darkness, Rugu, and Golf, Tee It Up.

479
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:05,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And at least, we don't know when they're coming, but at least they're on the way.

480
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:07,584
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you giggling at?

481
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:13,046
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD in chat says, I'm going to go play that Super Mario Goulash game next.

482
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:14,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

483
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room's funny.

484
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:17,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chat room.

485
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com Yeah, chat's just perfect.

486
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:22,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chat.

487
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:28,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love more Xbox Live Arcade games as long as they don't suck.

488
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it might be kind of cool.

489
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:36,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable 2 is going to be interacting with apparently three different Xbox Live Arcade games.

490
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:41,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was recently revealed this week in an interview with the guy behind Fable 2.

491
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:47,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And money that is won in one of the games can actually be transferred to funds in Fable 2.

492
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We already knew that.

493
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,790
[SPEAKER_02]: But Carbonated Games has made apparently some casual games.

494
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:54,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's three titles involved.

495
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:59,545
[SPEAKER_02]: One is called Keystone, one is called Wizard's Tower, and the other one is called Mage Dice.

496
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:07,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you play these games, which involve a little bit of gambling in them, you get Fable Gold in them, and you get to use that Fable Gold in your Fable game.

497
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking forward to co-op in this game.

498
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you can't wait for co-op in Fable 2, Loki.

499
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:16,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the only bad thing about Wizard's Tower is it's really just Yaris renamed Wizard's Tower.

500
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:17,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, really?

501
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:18,429
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

502
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:20,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say, that's horrible if so.

503
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if these are going to be free.

504
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:24,124
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:56,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, duh, they're gonna, of course, have, you know, stuff like that, as well as, like, I don't know, Kill Your Dog, I don't know.

506
00:36:57,497 --> 00:37:03,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, like, the original Fable sounded so freaking awesome, and then it was kinda... It was okay.

507
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

508
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm definitely interested in checking this game out, so we'll see.

509
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:18,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, there's another game that I think is... Well, okay, I never played it, but I know a lot of people did.

510
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:19,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Quest?

511
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:34,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Puzzle Quest was doing pretty well on Xbox Live Arcade, so there's actually going to be an expansion, and they're asking the players to name it for them.

512
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:47,406
[SPEAKER_05]: If you actually go onto the contest website, which is at puzzle-quest.com Ooh, actually, it's already over.

513
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: It ended on the 21st.

514
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang, that went by fast.

515
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even open when I last checked earlier this week.

516
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It ended on the 21st.

517
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:55,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, damn.

518
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:59,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to try to get our chatters to spam them with Puzzle Quest Orange or something.

519
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:00,973
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.

520
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:07,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, they said that once they've decided the name, then the expansion's going to be out in the spring over Xbox Live.

521
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So, have fun.

522
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:12,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about all the other places they hoard Puzzle Quest to?

523
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:13,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get shafted, huh?

524
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:14,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

525
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:21,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never thought Puzzle Quest was going to get an expansion or any type of microtransactions whatsoever because of the fact it was on the DS and all these other systems.

526
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:24,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of surprised at this news.

527
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just interesting.

528
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to explain it.

529
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

530
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:30,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't expecting that.

531
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you expecting an expansion?

532
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:32,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure wasn't.

533
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: An expansion?

534
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,704
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because I thought they would just hoard that out in Puzzle Quest 2 or something like that.

535
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:42,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I guess something to kill time until Puzzle Quest Galactics comes out.

536
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Galactrix or whatever the fuck they're calling it.

537
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,780
[SPEAKER_02]: The I Can't Believe It's Not Puzzle Quest?

538
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:49,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

539
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:50,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

540
00:38:50,462 --> 00:39:03,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so this weekend there's been a whole bunch of drama revolving a supposedly leaked game, Sonic Unleashed, with tons of screenshots out there available for it.

541
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:06,955
[SPEAKER_09]: People are wondering, is this an actual game that got leaked?

542
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:08,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this an April Fool's joke?

543
00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:09,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

544
00:39:10,163 --> 00:39:14,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first, you know, it started off, eh, it's probably fake, you know, who knows?

545
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: But then there's like a hundred-some screenshots for this, so I don't know.

546
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:22,548
[SPEAKER_09]: If it is fake, it's one of the most elaborate fakes I've ever seen.

547
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:34,733
[SPEAKER_09]: But then apparently now, there was news that, you know, Sega of Europe said that it is official and that they were going to be announcing it during their May Gamers Day event.

548
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:48,594
[SPEAKER_09]: and also make an official announcement at E3 but then there are some sort of wishy-washy stuff going on with that and now it's maybe not real again.

549
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:55,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at this point it's safe to say with the video out there, with the screenshots out there, I would say it's real.

550
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how it can be a fake at this point based off that video because that video is pretty kick-ass which is out there on YouTube somewhere, right?

551
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:03,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic 2.5D

552
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:32,676
[SPEAKER_09]: and also that there's going to be some stuff run in the official Nintendo magazine, the UK one.

553
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,400
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be, I guess, the cover in August for them.

554
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:47,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now we're speculating that it's coming out for the 360 and probably a version for the Wii and you can probably assume that there's a version for the PS3 if there's one coming out for the 360, so...

555
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says, hope for Sonic's future equals rising.

556
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:53,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope so.

557
00:40:53,891 --> 00:41:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the last few Sonic, you know, in creations in a row, you know, minus his appearance in Brawl, have all been very disappointing.

558
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:02,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So, God, I hope so.

559
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope.

560
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:04,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you hope, Jamie?

561
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:05,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they got it right, finally.

562
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:06,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hope.

563
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,395
[SPEAKER_09]: The screenshots are pretty awesome.

564
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:09,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... I watched the movie file.

565
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:10,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked pretty sweet.

566
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:16,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I think... Like I said, you know, if it was a hoax, I mean...

567
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the hoax game needs to come out, honestly.

568
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:27,240
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one hell of an elaborate hoax to fake, I don't know how many screenshots of this game.

569
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:28,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even a mapped level.

570
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The video followed the level all the way through.

571
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:37,966
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very unlikely that it would be an April Fool's joke.

572
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:38,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, you know what?

573
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:40,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Credit to them if it is an April Fool's joke.

574
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you fooled us.

575
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:45,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of the most convincing April Fool's jokes I've ever seen.

576
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,650
[SPEAKER_02]: April Fool's Joke

577
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:14,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our listeners may not even know this.

578
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have just saw the news earlier this week.

579
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, it came out.

580
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:23,297
[SPEAKER_02]: GoNintendo ran a report with a video from the guy who actually created the whole thing.

581
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:24,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of shows how he did it.

582
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually meant to be an April Fool's joke.

583
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:33,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently what happened is that he posted the joke in IRC trying to get some feedback from some of the folks in IRC.

584
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, is this believable?

585
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:39,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of the folks in IRC sent it to Joystick and it got out there a little bit early.

586
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:40,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops.

587
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, it is fake.

588
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Wario's Woods not coming to WiiWare.

589
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:50,168
[SPEAKER_02]: At least this one, I mean, but then again, you never know what Nintendo might have up their sleeve.

590
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:59,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not look like this, but as far as I'm concerned, whatever artists did these did a pretty darn good job, and Nintendo maybe ought to think to talking to this guy.

591
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:01,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they ought to cook something like this up.

592
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:02,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

593
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But sadly, no Wario's Woods on WiiWare anytime soon.

594
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless Nintendo's getting the last laugh, who knows?

595
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:30,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, something that came out in the April issue of UK's official Xbox magazine said that Ikaruga was out now and was getting a 9 out of 10 from the magazine with no actual release date.

596
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:35,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

597
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this real?

598
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,325
[SPEAKER_02]: April Fool's Joke

599
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's the April issue, so this hasn't... Well, the game is coming.

600
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a story on this before.

601
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:03,364
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is coming.

602
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:03,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not No Fools.

603
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:09,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for a moment, when you were talking about April Fool's, I was like, wait, they better not be taunting me with Ikaruga.

604
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hate April Fool's Day.

605
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

606
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it's going to be like this for the next two weeks.

607
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:15,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did have it out at the Tokyo Game Show.

608
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wasn't thinking that it was out quite yet.

609
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:25,000
[SPEAKER_05]: But Ikaruga is like one of the best, best shooter games ever, so that's really cool.

610
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Treasure...

611
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:31,427
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 in chat says, game publications should be banned from making April issues anymore.

612
00:44:31,487 --> 00:44:32,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree.

613
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:34,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree.

614
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:35,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just me.

615
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:48,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if I were a game publication, I would just flat up post a little editorial in my magazine saying, while certain other magazines and publications may want to...

616
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Joke about April Fools and stuff like that.

617
00:44:51,581 --> 00:45:00,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just say we don't do that and we figure that you would appreciate more accurate coverage than something that may confuse you.

618
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:00,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

619
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:07,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is I think the kind of stance we take on this show.

620
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually our jokes are pretty obvious.

621
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:13,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we're going to do one this year now in light of the other news that came out.

622
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:13,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

623
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,574
[SPEAKER_09]: The joke is we're going to stay on Live 365.

624
00:45:22,226 --> 00:45:24,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, moving on with more news then, Loki.

625
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:37,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we don't like to talk about him too much, but there was a brand new story this week about our friend Jackie Poo, or Voldemort, as you may know him.

626
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:47,523
[SPEAKER_09]: The Florida Supreme Court has sent an official notice to Jack Thompson that he now must have...

627
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:53,371
[SPEAKER_09]: An attorney to basically approve any further cases he has.

628
00:45:54,672 --> 00:46:07,918
[SPEAKER_09]: The court's ruling is basically saying that the numerous abuses that Thompson had made, including submitting pornography and stuff like that, is a relentless and frivolous pursuit for vindication of his claim that he is being victimized by the Florida Bar.

629
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:17,263
[SPEAKER_09]: And the continued ability to maintain the minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system in which the litigants and especially the attorneys must adhere.

630
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:33,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of this, basically, the motion has been made that for any lawsuit that he is now putting forward, it must be signed off by, I guess, an accredited attorney or something like that.

631
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,825
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, he needs a babysitter.

632
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:35,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

633
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:40,169
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

634
00:46:40,249 --> 00:46:40,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

635
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:46,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we'll see a lot less of him unless he gets some other retarded person to kind of help him along.

636
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's about damn time.

637
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:52,934
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

638
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:34,031
[SPEAKER_09]: and here's the best part about the whole thing after this ruling came down apparently Thompson sent out an email describing the Supreme Court's order as both good news and idiotic yeah, because he's got them right where he wants them now does he live on another planet?

639
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:40,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know speaking of crazy stuff

640
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:47,345
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that new Street Fighter movie coming out, Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, and it's getting a more full cast.

641
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Chris Klein is in it.

642
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,827
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays Guile's friend, which apparently is a big role.

643
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:52,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

644
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie.

645
00:47:54,087 --> 00:47:54,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Charlie Nash.

646
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Kristen Crook, who is the Lana Lane, right?

647
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:02,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Lois Lane?

648
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:03,129
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them.

649
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,530
[SPEAKER_02]: She's Lois Lane on Smallville.

650
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,331
[SPEAKER_02]: She's playing, no, I guess it would be Lana Lane because it was a daughter, right?

651
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

652
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:11,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch them all.

653
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:12,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

654
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:13,425
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be Chun-Li.

655
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet half the guys who watch her don't even know what her name is.

656
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:17,568
[SPEAKER_02]: They just watch her.

657
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:21,451
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to be Chun-Li and Michael Clark Duncan is going to be Balrog.

658
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this.

659
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:26,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas is going to be Vega.

660
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy with the long hair and the black eyed piece.

661
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be Vega.

662
00:48:30,378 --> 00:48:31,619
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be interesting.

663
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Neil McDonough is going to be M. Bison.

664
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:41,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never really heard that name, but then when I see his picture, I'm like, okay, that guy.

665
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:43,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen him before somewhere.

666
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:50,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with SSJ100 Matt in chat who says, this movie fails for one reason, no Kylie.

667
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of agree.

668
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:55,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this guy was in Star Trek First Contact.

669
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:56,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it looks familiar.

670
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:59,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Minority Report, Band of Brothers.

671
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, he's been a handful of films.

672
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:03,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why this movie also fails?

673
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:03,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, why?

674
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:15,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a Street Fighter movie, and anybody that thinks of Street Fighter the movie is always going to think of the last horrible Street Fighter movie that killed...

675
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:23,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized why this guy looks so familiar to me, but I almost don't want to say why.

676
00:49:23,854 --> 00:49:26,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because of one of the movies he was recently in.

677
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:29,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the last movie I saw on DVD.

678
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It was I Know Who Killed Me.

679
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:36,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually watched that on DVD.

680
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:37,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you watch that?

681
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:45,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have to see... Okay, when a film wins the award for worst movie of the year, I have to see just how bad it is.

682
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,090
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't.

683
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:51,905
[SPEAKER_09]: They give you fair warning that it sucks, so why do you need to... I like bad movies.

684
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:52,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I love Showgirls.

685
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:57,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, but it's one of those things where it's so bad, it's good.

686
00:49:57,748 --> 00:49:58,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

687
00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:04,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we actually had a discussion about this at our friend's house the other day, and the movie actually came up as Caveman.

688
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:07,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen that movie?

689
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:07,554
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

690
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:13,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really, really not a good movie, and it was one of the 70s, and like, the dinosaurs in it were all claymation.

691
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:14,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

692
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was so awful that it's a great movie.

693
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:18,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

694
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen Teenage Caveman.

695
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:23,312
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like Mystery Science Seeker 3000.

696
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Manos, The Hands of Fate.

697
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:30,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, can we please move on?

698
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

699
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some stuff.

700
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:39,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I don't know how I feel about this.

701
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:47,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, again, with all of the movies coming out from, you know, video games, and especially since the, uh,

702
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:52,713
[SPEAKER_05]: The horrible, horrible UiBull is associated with this one.

703
00:50:53,633 --> 00:51:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: The Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale is going to be out on April 15th.

704
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:08,097
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I knew this like a long time ago and I wish I had thought about this, but I figured it was an UiBull movie and no one really cares.

705
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:15,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette, and trailers.

706
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um,

707
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:27,798
[SPEAKER_05]: The suggested retail is $27.98, so look for it in the $5 bin at Walmart in a few weeks after that.

708
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone else saw the news this week.

709
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:40,104
[SPEAKER_09]: They're running a website for Postal the movie, because it's launching the same weekend as...

710
00:51:42,205 --> 00:52:10,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Indiana Jones and they have Vern Troyer dressed up like Indy and it was like I don't remember what the phrase was it was something stupid like I have a message for Indy fuck you or fuck you up or something like that I don't know I'm sure it's supposed to be parody but half of me still thinks that they literally think that they're going to beat Indiana Jones in the box office

711
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:12,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow.

712
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Delusional.

713
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:15,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

714
00:52:17,195 --> 00:52:20,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's going to happen when they go back to work Monday morning after that weekend?

715
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Vern Troyer's going to go drink some more?

716
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:33,458
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's about as delusional as Jack Thompson.

717
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:38,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically just going to be, you know, he's going to think it's a great victory for him and that, you know,

718
00:52:39,232 --> 00:52:42,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It may make him the most money out of any of his movies or some shit like that.

719
00:52:44,256 --> 00:52:47,279
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll have renewed hope for making more video game movies or something.

720
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:47,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

721
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:49,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of miss when this show had a soundboard.

722
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in our post-Life 365 era, we need to bring back the soundboard.

723
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:55,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of miss having one.

724
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

725
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

726
00:52:58,488 --> 00:52:58,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

727
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:04,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Call of Duty 4 is a very successful game.

728
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:10,233
[SPEAKER_09]: They are going to be getting a brand new Game of the Year edition, which is going to be coming out in April.

729
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:15,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, April 3rd for the Xbox 360 version.

730
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:25,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with that, there will be a brand new map pack that's going to have a few different maps of Creek, Broadcast, Chinatown, and Killhouse.

731
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:27,205
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be available for $10.00.

732
00:53:28,682 --> 00:53:33,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you might guess, in the Game of the Year edition, you get a token to download that for free.

733
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:38,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you haven't bought the game yet and are thinking about it, you may wait for this one to come out.

734
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:48,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be noted, though, that for some reason whatsoever, the PlayStation 3 version is coming out a few weeks after the Xbox 360 one.

735
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:51,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get that, but that's what's going on.

736
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:54,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

737
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:58,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

738
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:01,707
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

739
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:22,817
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have the game.

740
00:54:22,837 --> 00:54:26,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can see this little picture of the games actually kind of hanging around the collar of the shirt.

741
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get both for $12.

742
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

743
00:54:29,638 --> 00:54:30,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a neat little concept.

744
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really cool.

745
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:34,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That is strange to see at Target, though, of all places.

746
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I would not have expected this to be at Target.

747
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,560
[SPEAKER_04]: EGP Apparel.

748
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I would expect to see that maybe at, like, GameStop or something.

749
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or, you know, some other type of nerd store, like Hot Topic.

750
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:47,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nerdy, right?

751
00:54:47,322 --> 00:54:48,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

752
00:54:49,455 --> 00:54:52,776
[SPEAKER_02]: EGP Apparel.com if you want to see more about that.

753
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:54,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy the shirt and get the game for free.

754
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:56,137
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

755
00:54:56,157 --> 00:54:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very interesting.

756
00:54:57,277 --> 00:54:58,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Tower of Goo sounds funny.

757
00:54:58,538 --> 00:55:00,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Macman in chat says Target and Kmart.

758
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Tower of Goo is coming to WiiWare also.

759
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I didn't realize?

760
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize until like just last week that Destroy or Defend Your Castle game that's coming to the Wii.

761
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:18,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize that it's based off the old Flash game where you throw the guys up in the air and watch them explode into millions of pieces.

762
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:18,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

763
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:20,096
[SPEAKER_02]: XGenStudios.com slash play slash castle

764
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,733
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is so much fun, even though it's like years old.

765
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's been on the internet for like three years.

766
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me post that in chat there so our lovely chatters can take a look at that game.

767
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't get too distracted because it's time for us to open up the Skype line.

768
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,462
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, it's the part of the show where we let you guys interact with us.

769
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:11,627
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

770
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:15,029
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where you can do that and interact with us.

771
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:17,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be taking calls, I'd say, right about right now.

772
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:20,395
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

773
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:49,295
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

774
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:11,100
[SPEAKER_09]: A different homebrew kind of hack thing that they had going on.

775
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you it would take like 15 seconds for Nintendo to patch that shit.

776
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:16,521
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not the one you're thinking, too.

777
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:18,641
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this thing called a Trecha Signer.

778
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It basically allows them to create, because all the files on Wii discs are encrypted, so this will allow you to create the key and basically put your own files, make your own homebrew discs for the Wii, basically.

779
00:57:30,944 --> 00:57:31,784
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to the phones.

780
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:32,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I got somebody on hold.

781
00:57:32,925 --> 00:57:33,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

782
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:34,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

783
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:36,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's up?

784
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:37,449
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Ross DLUT.

785
00:57:37,529 --> 00:57:37,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

786
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:39,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you're really good at getting through first.

787
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like the new Raven's Dolphin.

788
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:42,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to Raven's Dolphin?

789
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he abandon our show?

790
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:48,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Raven's Dolphin, where are you?

791
00:57:49,237 --> 00:57:50,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you.

792
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:50,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm sorry.

793
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:52,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross DLUT, you're cool too.

794
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

795
00:57:53,120 --> 00:58:02,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, first off, I'm surprised you didn't mention this early on in the show when you were talking about the Gibson lawsuit bonanza.

796
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:02,507
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

797
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:07,106
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's a link that talks about the patent.

798
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:08,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it in the chat right now.

799
00:58:11,248 --> 00:58:31,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what's happening is that the diagram that goes with the patent shows a stereoscopic headset, an 8-channel mixer, effects processor, among other crazy-ass shit, and an actual musical instrument.

800
00:58:32,631 --> 00:58:34,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see the picture from that link.

801
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

802
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:41,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't want to spend too much time on that whole Gibson lawsuit because I think it's retarded.

803
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get to that actually in a few seconds.

804
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:44,980
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to say then, Loki?

805
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:48,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically, here's what Harmonix's response to the Gibson lawsuit was.

806
00:58:48,883 --> 00:58:53,606
[SPEAKER_09]: This lawsuit is completely without merit and we intend to defend it vigorously.

807
00:58:54,487 --> 00:59:00,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Gibson's patent filed nearly 10 years ago required a 3D display, a real musical instrument, and a recording of a concert.

808
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:04,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band and Guitar Hero are completely different.

809
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:10,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Among other things, they are games, require no headset, and use a controller only shaped like a real instrument.

810
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:17,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unfortunate that Gibson unfairly desires to share the tremendous success enjoyed by the developers of Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

811
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:22,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, looking at this little picture of the guitar, I mean, I know pictures and patents aren't supposed to be the end-all, be-all.

812
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a MIDI guitar.

813
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:27,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen others throughout the years, but this looks nothing like the game controller that they're using.

814
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:27,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

815
00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:37,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it looks so far removed from Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

816
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even see where Gibson's coming from.

817
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:43,548
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to win this, that's for sure.

818
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even close.

819
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even, not even.

820
00:59:49,012 --> 00:59:50,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm shocked seeing it that they'd even bother.

821
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:54,277
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, we've seen more stupid lawsuits before.

822
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:56,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um...

823
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:59,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, there was one other thing.

824
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:10,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow Six Vegas 2 came out last week, and if anybody's listening and is thinking about getting it, I would stay away from the PS3 one if you're interested in online, because the online is broken.

825
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh great, what's broken about it?

826
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:25,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm finding myself unable to get into most games, and the few games that I can get into...

827
01:00:26,728 --> 01:00:29,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I get booted off right away, and it's not just me.

828
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,492
[SPEAKER_01]: In those few games, I've talked to the people there, and they're having the same problem.

829
01:00:33,232 --> 01:00:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not me, because I'm not having the problem with Vegas 1.

830
01:00:36,494 --> 01:00:41,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not having a problem with a lot of the other PS3 games, Call of Duty 4 and stuff like that.

831
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:45,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually rather shocked, especially since the game had a release day patch.

832
01:00:49,642 --> 01:00:51,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, a patch will fix it.

833
01:00:52,304 --> 01:00:55,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be the thinking of video games in this day and age.

834
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:57,106
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

835
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the patch that came out when the game came out?

836
01:01:01,051 --> 01:01:01,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious.

837
01:01:01,873 --> 01:01:02,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I pre-ordered the game.

838
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:03,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it first day, right?

839
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:06,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go home.

840
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, immediately, PlayStation Network's like, yeah, we got a patch.

841
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:11,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Download it.

842
01:01:11,845 --> 01:01:12,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right.

843
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget it was a multiplayer patch, but apparently not.

844
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:19,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Patches should be for like what Rock Band just did.

845
01:01:20,075 --> 01:01:27,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It added a whole new feature to the thing that maybe should have been there in the first place, but oh well, it was a new feature, something new and neat.

846
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:29,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that is an acceptable patch to me.

847
01:01:29,777 --> 01:01:32,477
[SPEAKER_02]: An unacceptable patch to me is, oh, I don't know, Bully?

848
01:01:34,578 --> 01:01:35,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Or countless others?

849
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:37,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another one.

850
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:40,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing is, this isn't the first time we've seen an

851
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:47,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Ubisoft game with a patch to fix things that were either broken or they were too lazy to get in.

852
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:51,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys remember Naruto Rise of a Ninja?

853
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:56,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a week after the game came out, they came out with a Japanese language patch.

854
01:01:56,953 --> 01:01:58,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It is literally 52 megs.

855
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:01,838
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're basically unlocking it off the disc.

856
01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:02,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just ridiculous.

857
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:04,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

858
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:07,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, 52 megs doesn't sound like a key.

859
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:09,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually a key's pretty small.

860
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:13,330
[SPEAKER_09]: 52 megs, that sounds like actual dialogue to me.

861
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,990
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no possible way.

862
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:20,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the voices in the town and the cutscenes.

863
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:23,213
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more than 52 megs worth of dialogue going on there.

864
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:23,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all voices.

865
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how that could be all the dialogue.

866
01:02:31,136 --> 01:02:32,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.

867
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: You know...

868
01:02:35,311 --> 01:03:03,629
[SPEAKER_01]: either way, we don't see it as much as we did when the 360 came out I think companies are getting better about it but we're still seeing this sort of ah, suck it, rush it out, we'll patch it attitude and it's going to start hurting companies especially with these consoles getting more popular because you know the majority of them aren't going to be online it's just a numbers game

869
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:13,738
[SPEAKER_01]: and I really feel sorry for the people who are going to get stuck with unpatched versions, especially with what Rob mentioned, Bully.

870
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,219
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to suck.

871
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:21,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ross, to you too, we've got to wrap up so you can go, but any other quick thoughts you want to get out there?

872
01:03:24,782 --> 01:03:26,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

873
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:29,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

874
01:03:29,863 --> 01:03:31,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, except for the whole

875
01:03:32,074 --> 01:04:00,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Ubisoft buying Tom Clancy thing the only thing I was surprised was that they hadn't already done it yeah that's kind of I would have thought that was already a relationship that was but there you have it alright Ross have a good one buddy you do the same bye bye alright if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio any other stories you want to share with us Loki while we're waiting sure

876
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:03,372
[SPEAKER_09]: There's apparently some pretty cool mods.

877
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:04,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, never mind, we got a call.

878
01:04:05,353 --> 01:04:07,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?

879
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:09,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

880
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:10,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Rob D, guys.

881
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:13,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, long time no talk, Rob D, how are you?

882
01:04:15,558 --> 01:04:18,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I've kind of been working and all that fun stuff.

883
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:22,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I work most Sundays and I close, so that kind of disables me from actually listening to you guys.

884
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:22,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Work?

885
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:25,582
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this work thing you speak of?

886
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:28,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, uh,

887
01:04:29,978 --> 01:04:32,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to actually abandon my job and only play games for a living.

888
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

889
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,661
[SPEAKER_06]: See how that one goes for a little while.

890
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

891
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, what's on your mind tonight, Rob?

892
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:54,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've got to say, actually, just listening to RawSteelUT's call, now that Ubisoft actually owns a Tom Clancy, we're going to see Tom Clancy's, I don't know, Tom Clancy's Naughty Toad, Rise of a Ninja, or Tom Clancy's Enchanted Arms now that they actually own the property.

893
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:57,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow doubt that would happen, but...

894
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:27,154
[SPEAKER_06]: usually that's kind of like the same thing with the whole when Activision bought Blizzard or whatever the whole World of Warcraft will come to Guitar Hero tomorrow that'd be great but I gotta say the reason I called in is I don't really have a topic to discuss but I need to just express my joy as a fighting game fan of just the titles coming out this year because you've got King of Fighters 12 you've got Super Smash Brothers Brawl Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, Soul Calibur 4

895
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember a crop of fighting games.

896
01:05:30,356 --> 01:05:31,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Tekken 6?

897
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:33,559
[SPEAKER_06]: At the very least, with this pedigree.

898
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

899
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,142
[SPEAKER_06]: With this pedigree for a very long time.

900
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:38,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if all these games end up panning out to be good.

901
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:40,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That obviously remains to be seen.

902
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: As a fighting game fan, I just haven't been this excited for games, especially to see some of these franchises go online multiplayer for the very first time.

903
01:05:48,674 --> 01:05:48,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully...

904
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:52,006
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

905
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

906
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just looking at some screenshots for the other day for King of Fighters 12, and it looks pretty hot, I gotta say.

907
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:28,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they redrew all the animations for all that, so I'm looking forward to seeing how they'll actually turn out.

908
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:36,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Trucker Terry is back, so for all the Terry Bogard, Ingrish, Hey Come On Come On fans, that should make many of them pleased.

909
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:36,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

910
01:06:36,828 --> 01:06:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

911
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:43,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of old school fighting games from SNK, you know how your pick, your classic game of the week last week was The Last Blade.

912
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:50,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went, they have it on GameTap 1 and 2, so I went and played it for a little bit, just because I had never really played it before.

913
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:50,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

914
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:54,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I was using a keyboard, and fighting games with keyboards are always kind of wonky.

915
01:06:54,942 --> 01:06:58,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to really use a joystick, but I had fun while I was playing.

916
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a really stylish game.

917
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely stylish.

918
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:03,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure out any of the fatalities, though.

919
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:05,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the part I was looking forward to doing, but

920
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:11,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to derail, but what do you think about the whole Street Fighter 4?

921
01:07:11,348 --> 01:07:17,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's shaping up to be pretty awesome, or is it just like Street Fighter 2 10 years later, or what do you think?

922
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:32,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's nice to see that they're actually modernizing the look, and I think this is an important step for the franchise, that they're moving finally from sprites to some modern graphics that aren't done by, what was that company that did Street Fighter EX?

923
01:07:33,343 --> 01:07:35,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Akira or something like that?

924
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember, frankly.

925
01:07:38,273 --> 01:08:03,882
[SPEAKER_06]: to me it all depends on how the game plays you can't really determine until the game actually comes out I think it's going to be disappointing if the game doesn't really come out with anything particularly new in the fighting game engine especially since SNK has been changing up their fighting game engine practically every year and with King of Fighters 11 they really pulled out all the stops with the super cancels well not the super cancels because that's been there for a while but the dream cancels the saving shifts um

926
01:08:06,206 --> 01:08:11,527
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of things that actually changed the gameplay and just really helped it out as a franchise.

927
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:15,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd really like to see how the game plays.

928
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:22,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering I really doubt that it'll actually make any kind of a splash in American arcades, we'll probably have to wait until it comes out whenever it does.

929
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:25,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think American arcades can be saved, Rob?

930
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:29,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

931
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Not with how online play has just proliferated over here.

932
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:41,516
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, I don't think that's really as much of a concern since they're not really into shooters as much as we are, certainly.

933
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:46,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't had Xbox Live, or at least they don't support Xbox Live as much as we do.

934
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:53,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I really doubt you can get gamers that gathered again out of their homes.

935
01:08:54,238 --> 01:09:02,940
[SPEAKER_02]: You can count how long ago it was when arcades were still like, they might have been getting closer on its last legs, but this show started due to hanging out in an arcade, so

936
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:04,265
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of sad.

937
01:09:05,926 --> 01:09:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I have fond memories of playing Neo Geo games and playing, you know, the old X-Men arcade game, Turtles in Time, especially.

938
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:11,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

939
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:12,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

940
01:09:12,392 --> 01:09:14,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still play Neo Geo arcade.

941
01:09:14,794 --> 01:09:17,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they have a Neo Geo arcade machine at Jim Boy's Tacos.

942
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:18,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen that?

943
01:09:18,817 --> 01:09:19,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't eat at Jim Boy's.

944
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:22,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but, well, okay, well, they have one there.

945
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be worth looking at.

946
01:09:24,462 --> 01:09:26,203
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bajillion Jim Boys around, too.

947
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:26,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

948
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:28,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know which one you mean.

949
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:29,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one over on...

950
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:30,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Folsom and Sunrise.

951
01:09:30,726 --> 01:09:31,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

952
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:33,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know that makes no sense to our other listeners, but anyway.

953
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:42,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I used to go to Rico's Pizza and play the DDR there while I was eating pizza and 18 Wheeler Pro Trucker.

954
01:09:43,294 --> 01:09:47,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, remember when pizza parlors had hella arcade games in them?

955
01:09:48,077 --> 01:09:53,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was like pizza slash arcade and now, like, you're lucky to go to a round table and see, like, two games and a pinball table.

956
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:53,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

957
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:54,702
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lucky to see that.

958
01:09:54,742 --> 01:09:57,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we were just talking about, just for the pinball aspect, we were talking, because...

959
01:09:58,237 --> 01:09:58,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Crane Games

960
01:10:24,537 --> 01:10:25,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sad.

961
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:34,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Pizza Parlor was where I first played Street Fighter 2, so... And actually, the first character I ever played as was Dhalsim, or as my mom called him, Mr. Stretchy Arms.

962
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've always kind of had a soft spot in my heart for Pizza Parlor arcade games.

963
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:42,643
[SPEAKER_05]: My first Street Fighter 2 was at a 7-Eleven.

964
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,764
[SPEAKER_02]: My first Street Fighter 2 was at a college arcade.

965
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:51,385
[SPEAKER_05]: My college arcade... I can still remember the lineup for the longest time.

966
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:52,466
[SPEAKER_05]: We had...

967
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:57,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyber, not, what am I thinking of?

968
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember, Cyberstorm was it?

969
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:03,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sort of like a virtual on ripoff, sort of.

970
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:10,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had Killer Instinct, we had World Cup Soccer 94, which became my favorite table and I own one now.

971
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:20,017
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Dark Stalkers, we had KOF 94, and a bunch of other machines that I usually ignored.

972
01:11:21,517 --> 01:11:47,281
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says yeah I remember when 7-Elevens had arcade games here and I was going to say it wasn't a 7-Eleven but the same type of thing a little convenience store chain was one of the first places I played Mortal Kombat 2 good times 7-Eleven actually went out of business in Alabama a long time ago I was really surprised when I moved out here and saw 7-Elevens but I would go to any one of them and there would always be some sort of game whether it worked or not was another story but there would be a game there

973
01:11:48,356 --> 01:11:49,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was weird.

974
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:51,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can find good arcade machines, though, at TrekStops.

975
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I found Derby Owner's Club at TrekStops.

976
01:11:55,162 --> 01:11:55,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

977
01:11:55,902 --> 01:11:59,946
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, Rob D., we've been on the phone a while now, so I've got to ask you so we can get some more calls.

978
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:00,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last thoughts?

979
01:12:00,827 --> 01:12:01,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other things you want to say?

980
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:05,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... How I dunk!

981
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:06,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just end it there.

982
01:12:07,152 --> 01:12:08,133
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, have a good one, Rob.

983
01:12:08,153 --> 01:12:08,733
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys later.

984
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:09,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

985
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess he was getting some bad echo on the line.

986
01:12:12,236 --> 01:12:13,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that happened.

987
01:12:13,277 --> 01:12:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Happened, happened, happened.

988
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:14,779
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

989
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, uh...

990
01:12:16,872 --> 01:12:18,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give us a call if you want.

991
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,773
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

992
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:21,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

993
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what was that story you were going to read for us earlier?

994
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:34,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently there's some really cool mods, character mods you can have for the PlayStation 3 version, or actually the PC version also of Unreal Tournament 3, including Master Chief.

995
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: They also have the guy from Crysis.

996
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:43,617
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also some, of course, Marcus Fenix and Cloud...

997
01:12:44,429 --> 01:12:45,030
[SPEAKER_09]: and Spawn.

998
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:50,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, the one for Halo, I gotta say, looks better than the Xbox 360 version.

999
01:12:52,476 --> 01:12:53,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones.

1000
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:54,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1001
01:12:54,298 --> 01:12:54,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1002
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:56,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sweet Jesus, I finally got in.

1003
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,101
[SPEAKER_08]: It's DJ Dark Knight.

1004
01:12:58,182 --> 01:12:59,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, DJ Dark Knight.

1005
01:12:59,142 --> 01:12:59,723
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

1006
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:01,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

1007
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I was surprised y'all guys didn't talk about Guitar Hero DS.

1008
01:13:06,129 --> 01:13:07,150
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

1009
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,611
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have arrived late to the show.

1010
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:09,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It was early in Part A.

1011
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:18,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I remember I saw a peripheral about it, and all I could think of is, ugh, major cramps for that game, I swear.

1012
01:13:19,117 --> 01:13:19,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1013
01:13:20,878 --> 01:13:21,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1014
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:29,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's going to be just like you're holding the guitar, usually, but I think it would be very comfortable, actually, because the keys are sideways.

1015
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like on top.

1016
01:13:30,905 --> 01:13:36,849
[SPEAKER_09]: That would cramp your hands, but your hand actually slides through like a little Velcro holder thing.

1017
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:37,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1018
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:39,130
[SPEAKER_09]: It still looks like a carpal tunnel nightmare to me.

1019
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:39,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1020
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:39,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1021
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, like I said, it'll probably work out, but just me, I know in my case, the way my hands are, I know it's not going to work too well for me.

1022
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:53,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking about something else that totally slipped my mind because that was the main thing I wanted to talk about.

1023
01:13:55,527 --> 01:13:57,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about the live 365 thing.

1024
01:13:57,168 --> 01:13:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: That does suck.

1025
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:00,309
[SPEAKER_08]: That does suck major balls, I know.

1026
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks and it's nice.

1027
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:08,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing from people who are offering to help pay for the increased fees and all that, which I think is really nice.

1028
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:17,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want everybody to understand part of the reason that we're leaving is because we disagree with the rate increase of such significance and the fact that

1029
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:23,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just time for the station to have a kick in the butt and try something a little different.

1030
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:26,389
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been doing it the same way for five and a half years.

1031
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:30,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trying to see the positives in what is kind of otherwise a depressing thing.

1032
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:35,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's really going to suck because it displaces our weeknight shows, at least for right now.

1033
01:14:35,496 --> 01:14:37,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're hoping we can take them with us wherever we end up.

1034
01:14:38,339 --> 01:14:42,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's going to be some growing pains.

1035
01:14:42,262 --> 01:14:45,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hoping in the long run it actually ends up as a good thing.

1036
01:14:46,624 --> 01:14:50,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I gotta say, if you ever need a spot for Shoutcast, we got lines open.

1037
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:52,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

1038
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:56,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of people are saying Shoutcast, and it's definitely a possibility.

1039
01:14:58,209 --> 01:15:00,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We have ideas, and we'll see what happens.

1040
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:04,911
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing about Shoutcast, too, is you gotta pay for music licensing if we were gonna do something like that.

1041
01:15:06,872 --> 01:15:09,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, we're all in video game music.

1042
01:15:09,193 --> 01:15:14,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I think no matter what happens, unfortunately, we're gonna have to get rid of our licensed music in terms of

1043
01:15:14,588 --> 01:15:15,088
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1044
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:40,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1045
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:43,111
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to video game music, it feels differently to me.

1046
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:45,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, you know, it seems like a different realm.

1047
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go underground with video game music.

1048
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:48,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'd be okay.

1049
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:50,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1050
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:51,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1051
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, good luck on that one.

1052
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:53,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1053
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:59,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, other than that, though, of course, me being the Phantasy Star Universe fanatic that I'm finally back on the game and whatnot.

1054
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:02,035
[SPEAKER_08]: It's officially White Day in the game and whatnot.

1055
01:16:02,655 --> 01:16:09,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep meaning to sign on and just kind of like play around in Phantasy Star Universe and see if I, I don't know, like it again.

1056
01:16:10,883 --> 01:16:12,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But I keep getting sidetracked.

1057
01:16:12,744 --> 01:16:13,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid WoW and stuff like that.

1058
01:16:14,826 --> 01:16:17,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Gary said you can't really enjoy it unless you get the expansion, of course.

1059
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:21,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get the expansion, then yeah, you can enjoy the newer stuff.

1060
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:29,640
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, if you still just have the basic ones, you won't be able to do all the new stuff and whatnot.

1061
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Expansion is what?

1062
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:30,280
$20?

1063
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:30,280
$15?

1064
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:30,280
$20? $20?

1065
01:16:32,874 --> 01:16:33,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know.

1066
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:35,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know.

1067
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:38,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I know on live you can download it.

1068
01:16:38,438 --> 01:16:39,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1069
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:41,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have to uninstall it.

1070
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:42,520
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 bucks?

1071
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

1072
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:44,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

1073
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:54,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I still play that game because it keeps me from playing it.

1074
01:16:54,308 --> 01:16:56,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only game I play on my PlayStation 2 now.

1075
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:56,869
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the sad part.

1076
01:16:58,427 --> 01:16:59,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play anything else on it.

1077
01:17:00,188 --> 01:17:00,768
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

1078
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:03,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share, Dark Knight, with our listeners?

1079
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's about it.

1080
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,310
[SPEAKER_08]: But permission to plug?

1081
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:09,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hell, why not?

1082
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:10,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we like you.

1083
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:12,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1084
01:17:12,693 --> 01:17:16,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of blend my voice to two shows on a radio station called This Is Genius Radio.

1085
01:17:17,534 --> 01:17:19,735
[SPEAKER_08]: One is my show called DJ Dark Knight's Ninja Dojo.

1086
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:26,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And another one is called Anime Damashii on there, which is hosted by the Rob D, me, Foodie Monster.

1087
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:31,848
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess the others, which is basically anime podcast shows.

1088
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:34,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Tune in if you like.

1089
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,930
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a podcast out and everything.

1090
01:17:36,811 --> 01:17:37,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1091
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:38,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it.

1092
01:17:39,432 --> 01:17:39,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

1093
01:17:39,972 --> 01:17:40,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy your Easter.

1094
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:41,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk to y'all later.

1095
01:17:41,713 --> 01:17:42,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good one.

1096
01:17:43,194 --> 01:17:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1097
01:17:43,654 --> 01:17:43,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1098
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:45,635
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

1099
01:17:45,735 --> 01:17:46,276
[SPEAKER_02]: One more call?

1100
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:47,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do one more call.

1101
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1102
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:51,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno mas.

1103
01:17:51,358 --> 01:17:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1104
01:17:57,446 --> 01:18:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are going to be doing a break from live broadcasting for a little while and going to tape, we will be sure to have more time for calls next week as we say goodbye to Life Thieves 5.

1105
01:18:07,552 --> 01:18:11,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Because believe it or not, next week is going to be our last show on Life Thieves 5, no matter what.

1106
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:12,775
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of odd.

1107
01:18:13,676 --> 01:18:15,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of scary, in a way.

1108
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:16,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1109
01:18:17,878 --> 01:18:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1110
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:19,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Loki's attitude.

1111
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:19,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

1112
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1113
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any other last minute stories for us, Loki?

1114
01:18:24,502 --> 01:18:24,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1115
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:32,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this week in the U.S., Virtual Console will be getting King's Night on the NES and Powerball on Genesis.

1116
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what either one of those are.

1117
01:18:36,151 --> 01:18:37,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, that was something else.

1118
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:38,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saving it for later.

1119
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1120
01:18:42,978 --> 01:18:43,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

1121
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:48,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, what have we got here?

1122
01:18:49,172 --> 01:18:56,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently some idiot is working on Mac OS X or something that resembles Mac OS X for the PSP.

1123
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:57,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1124
01:18:58,881 --> 01:18:59,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1125
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:08,170
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some homebrew thing that someone made apparently that will remove duplicate channels that you may have from playing import games.

1126
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of neat.

1127
01:19:10,272 --> 01:19:12,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

1128
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:14,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1129
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:25,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Some rumors from EGM, including Tecmo Bowl is heading to the Wii, and the classic version of the game is coming to the DS.

1130
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:33,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently Warren Spector's new Disney project that he's working on is a platformer, and the goal is to give Mario a run for his money.

1131
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,140
[SPEAKER_09]: The star of the big platformer would be none other than Mickey Mouse.

1132
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:39,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1133
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:41,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting.

1134
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:42,662
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1135
01:19:43,717 --> 01:19:43,997
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1136
01:19:44,017 --> 01:19:47,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're actually going to go ahead and close the Skype line because I just realized we are running a little bit long.

1137
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:53,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already midnight on the East Coast, 9 o'clock here, so we'll take plenty more calls next week.

1138
01:19:53,299 --> 01:19:53,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

1139
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:58,159
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts, though, in the meantime, because we're about ready to wrap up.

1140
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:00,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight?

1141
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Milkshake.

1142
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,841
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I would really like my appetite back.

1143
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:08,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1144
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:11,422
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is this chair is really uncomfortable.

1145
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:12,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

1146
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:13,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

1147
01:20:14,216 --> 01:20:17,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if I can find another fluffy chair like DarkSakura's for cheap, I'll get one of those.

1148
01:20:17,781 --> 01:20:22,969
[SPEAKER_09]: This is metal, and that's why I keep standing up, because it... Oh, I'm sorry.

1149
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1150
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:51,102
[SPEAKER_02]: and help Independent Radio break through because we don't have advertising dollars.

1151
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,063
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have big magazines behind us.

1152
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:53,883
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any of that.

1153
01:20:54,403 --> 01:20:56,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to do it.

1154
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:01,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

1155
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:03,166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's DarkSakura.

1156
01:21:03,846 --> 01:21:04,506
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Loki.

1157
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,268
