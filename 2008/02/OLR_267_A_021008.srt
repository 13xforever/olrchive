00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:25,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 10th, 2008, Xbox HD DVD gets a price cut, old favorites are revealed for Street Fighter 4, and is an Oscar-nominated movie soon becoming a video game?

2
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:36,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:45,044
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:50,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:52,290
[SPEAKER_02]: She is unfortunately out with sickness.

8
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,853
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been having, you know, just...

9
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Subway was out of white bread, I had wheat, and wheat tastes like cardboard.

10
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:27,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that bad.

11
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:28,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Bread is bread.

12
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:31,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even really wheat bread.

13
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:34,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they took white bread and kind of dyed it brown.

14
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is Subway.

15
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't expect huge differences.

16
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Did your cat scratch you or something?

17
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I see big old claw marks.

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's my cat.

19
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry you hear that.

20
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:49,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because when she gets up in her tube sometimes, she starts to freak out.

21
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's playing and stuff, so what do I try to do?

22
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I try poking at her all the time.

23
00:01:56,056 --> 00:02:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried petting her on her head, but then she just grabs her claws and she kind of catches me sometimes.

24
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:01,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did.

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks a lot more painful than it actually was.

26
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:08,500
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, also joining us tonight, you might have heard his voice there just a minute ago.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Puppy, also known as Black Lab, or Ryan, depending on whatever we want to call him.

28
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Puppy?

29
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:15,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I am tired.

30
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:22,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some insomnia this week and kind of capped it off with,

31
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting woken up at 2.30 in the morning last night by gunfire.

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun!

33
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:28,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear about the gunfire.

34
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Were your neighbors, like, fighting or something?

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what's the deal?

36
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:31,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

37
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably something in the mall parking lot.

38
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:33,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

39
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:34,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

40
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:35,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

41
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:40,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been like just a crazy week in everybody's neighborhood.

42
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:46,513
[SPEAKER_02]: There was gunfire in your neighborhood, and the house across the street from the studio here burned down a couple days ago.

43
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:52,676
[SPEAKER_05]: On the outside, it makes Rob's house much easier to find to get here.

44
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:55,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's unfortunate for those that affected.

45
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:59,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I didn't even notice it because that house was so run down to begin with.

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, really?

47
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It burned down?

48
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't tell.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

50
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyhow, let's...

51
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:07,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not talk about neighborhood drama.

52
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about our gaming week.

53
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start it off with how was your gaming week and we'll go ahead and start off with Loki tonight.

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:12,853
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

55
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,515
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I'd like to say I have brought back the Ever360.

56
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:17,717
[SPEAKER_03]: It is back to life again.

57
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:18,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

58
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,560
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick was I needed more heat.

59
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:27,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't stop until I got to about 850 degrees to 1,000 degrees and sure enough, that worked.

60
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:29,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I have six working 360s.

61
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:30,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

62
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just loaded, aren't you?

63
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:32,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

64
00:03:34,048 --> 00:04:02,690
[SPEAKER_03]: and then let's see I played this week more Smash Brothers Brawl and that's pretty awesome I actually got to dive in a little bit to the subspace emissary mode and it's pretty fun they have some really crazy looking enemies in the game just some weird stuff but it's pretty cool and then I've unlocked Rob the Robot we went through the challenge but I actually took off work half a day to go visit one of my customers who really wanted to play the game so

65
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,762
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

66
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:34,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

67
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:35,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

68
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, if I play through the entire Subspace Emissary stuff and then finish all the other crap, I might get bored with the game a little bit.

69
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually need to play some people.

70
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:52,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than Smash Bros., I also played Silent Hill Origins, actually, on the PSP.

71
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back to try that again.

72
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,579
[SPEAKER_03]: and pretty cool.

73
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:02,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm looking forward to it coming out on PlayStation 2 because I just don't like being tethered to my TV with a little cable.

74
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be a little bit better if I have a little bit more room to play.

75
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also played a lot of Burnout Paradise.

76
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Still trying to knock people off of the leaderboards for the Showtime rankings.

77
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:24,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how listeners will add us on Xbox Live because they enjoy the show and so on.

78
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:27,625
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of want to play a game with us occasionally or what have you.

79
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:33,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Loki makes it his mission to dominate our listeners in whatever game he's playing.

80
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh no, I can't get beat by no listener.

81
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to control the burnout map.

82
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now I have about 26 of the roads, so I still have a ways to go.

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

84
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, other than that, played a little bit more DotStream on the Game Boy Advance.

85
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty fun.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's pretty much it.

87
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, tried playing Crysis again.

88
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:05,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually uninstalled Crysis, reinstalled Crysis, tried to get that last level to fucking work again, and sure enough, it does not work.

89
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, I can't pass that last level in the game because it glitches out, and it stops working.

90
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I am sick of Crysis, although I did load up the...

91
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:20,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The physics, a little custom map that someone made to play the physics of the game.

92
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:24,867
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually released a new version of the map last week.

93
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was fun.

94
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can slingshot barrels in the people and stuff and catapult things.

95
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love that.

96
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that though, I fucking hate the last level of Crysis.

97
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they not test it at all?

98
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just really broken.

99
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:56,618
[SPEAKER_03]: which is bad because the rest of the game is pretty cool but it's just that last level right as you're about to finish the game and kind of get the payoff from playing through the entire thing oh no, you can't do that that would be too easy so I don't know

100
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,135
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

101
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:50,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3 Halo 3

103
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with the updates that Halo 3 finally added, and are going to add in the near future, I still will be playing Call of Duty 4 instead.

104
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty bold statement, that it's better than Halo 3.

105
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:36,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually found it much more enjoyable than Halo, just because there's a lot more reality to it.

106
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:43,720
[SPEAKER_05]: As opposed to, oh, armored space guys punching each other in a grossly malformed way.

107
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:50,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other than Call of Duty 4, I sadly have fallen back into my Puzzle Pirate habit.

108
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:51,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucker.

109
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

110
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,552
[SPEAKER_02]: How has Puzzle Pirates changed?

111
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you were last addicted to the game, what, about two years ago?

112
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:02,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I stopped playing it about a year ago because I didn't have the time to anymore.

113
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And then apparently a lot of stuff changed in that year.

114
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:14,197
[SPEAKER_05]: They brought a bunch of new puzzle games in and added some new player versus environment stuff.

115
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:22,667
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's getting popular and I just found out, they just made an announcement that they're selling game cards at Target now.

116
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So they must be making it big or something.

117
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:25,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

118
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:29,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm noticing with the facial hair that you're starting to sprout here, you're starting to look like a pirate a little bit.

119
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,790
[SPEAKER_05]: This was much longer earlier this week.

120
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

121
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I could just throw on an eye patch for a party.

122
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great radio too to talk about puppies' look.

123
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a little facial growth that makes him look like a pirate.

124
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:46,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they can see it on Justin TV because you're blonde.

125
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:48,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably stand right in front of the camera and they wouldn't see it.

126
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you go give them a nice close-up when you're done?

127
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Give a nice close-up of your mug there.

128
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a nice little mug shot there.

129
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:57,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

130
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Rez, various board games.

131
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Rez incredible?

132
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it is.

133
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish that I had a high-def TV to play it on.

134
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:08,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

135
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and it's sexy.

136
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to rub it in, but yeah, you really do want one.

137
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,725
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have surround sound, too, when you're playing it.

138
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:16,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

139
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:19,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously almost dug up my old surround sound system that's kind of crappy.

140
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:20,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually hooked up here in the garage.

141
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:25,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost brought that into the house just to play Res HD with, but I'm going to get a new sound system when I get my tax refund.

142
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:32,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I thought about getting a better TV with my tax refund, but I've got other stuff that I need to pay for first.

143
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:32,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

144
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,623
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now go supermodel for the camera.

145
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:36,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about my gaming week.

146
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:43,350
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to mention in chat room, because this didn't come up earlier, TigerClaw says, Sky, I just realized OLR is competing against the Grammys.

147
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

148
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:46,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I mean, the Grammys...

149
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

150
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I find them to be incredibly irrelevant.

151
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that article on Dig earlier this week about the biggest Grammy snubs of all time?

152
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting.

153
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:04,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows how there's all these big name artists that always get snubbed by the Grammys when there's people that were more deserving.

154
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

155
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

156
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought up tax refunds earlier.

157
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:15,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious, in our chat room, those that are getting tax refunds, if there's anything in gaming that you're contemplating spending your tax refund on.

158
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So let us know in our chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com.

159
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:19,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read those in just a little bit.

160
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, my gaming week.

161
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly spent, besides Poker Smash, playing a couple different games.

162
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,949
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft, of course.

163
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I talk about that a lot here on the program, but it has been a lot of my gaming week recently.

164
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really went to the next level this week.

165
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many hardcore WoW addicts we have that listen to the game, but tonight...

166
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:36,151
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

167
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:54,883
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

168
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:12,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only have 10 people in our guild that can even do it.

169
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So I notice it's tough to really arrange the times to go in there.

170
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did an awesome job.

171
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:23,508
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody that does know WoW, we killed Attuneman, we killed Morose, and we killed Maiden today.

172
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our first weekend, we killed three of the bosses in Karazhan, which is pretty awesome.

173
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, I'm sure there's lots of people out there who go, Whoa, my guild killed four bosses, so fuck you.

174
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,573
[SPEAKER_05]: My guild killed it all in one night.

175
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:38,415
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, when we were mostly casual players, it was pretty awesome.

176
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good times.

177
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait until you try to move on to 25-man content and you've got three different groups going to Karazhan at once and they're like, oh, we don't want to split up, we don't want to go all together and then you'll end up breaking apart.

178
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:50,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

179
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama, drama, drama.

180
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't want drama.

181
00:12:52,858 --> 00:13:03,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all, most of us actually live here in the area and our guild was formed mostly from real-life people like my boyfriend is in the guild and like Irene is in the guild but she's not level 70 yet.

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other people you've heard on this show are in the guild and yeah, good times.

183
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're finally doing that stuff.

184
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:09,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

185
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:14,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at chat room, seeing what folks are saying they're going to spend their tax refunds on here.

186
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

187
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, my tax rebate is going towards an HD camera.

188
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:29,341
[SPEAKER_02]: GS191 says, I'll probably spend my welfare, I mean stimulus package check on a new PC.

189
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:30,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

190
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:31,963
[SPEAKER_02]: After that thing was passed.

191
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:38,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already spending that on a new computer because I need something at home that can run AutoCAD.

192
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:38,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

193
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

194
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DMN's going to use his refund to come visit the show.

195
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: He's coming back to Sacramento.

196
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:44,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Scary.

197
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:44,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.

198
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:48,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use that refund to pass it to the children.

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:48,879
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

200
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:49,360
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

201
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,082
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:10,603
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

203
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they just have to pay rent.

204
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: They can choose to battle your creature with one from their hand.

205
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's all these enhancements cards that'll increase your strength, your defense.

206
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a game where you really have to think before you play.

207
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of fun.

208
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very unique concept.

209
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting to see it on the Xbox 360.

210
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, they didn't really change a lot from the first game, and the animations are not really...

211
00:14:54,202 --> 00:15:02,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything to jump and scream about in this new age of gaming or whatever you want to call it with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

212
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the Eye of Judgment and there's very intricate battles that happen.

213
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:11,030
[SPEAKER_02]: For all the shit we give that game on this show, the battles look kind of cool when the cards do battle.

214
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:18,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Cold Sept, it's like if a monster attacks with the claws, you see big claw marks go across the card.

215
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:19,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically like Pokemon.

216
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in high definition.

217
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like, literally the cards do battle.

218
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of amusing.

219
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:28,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's incredible English in the game.

220
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:32,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, like, one of the lines is something like, I had to escape the poverty or something.

221
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:36,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, like, very literal translations in some of the cutscenes.

222
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cool.

223
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for me, I think this game is mostly a second chance for people who missed it on the PlayStation 2.

224
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not a full-price Xbox game.

225
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:46,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that middle tier.

226
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:46,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $39.99.

227
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:51,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not quite as much as you pay for a brand new Xbox 360 game.

228
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:52,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good deal.

229
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't own Cold Sept on PlayStation 2.

230
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,026
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends a couple years ago did.

231
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,466
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got exposed to it the first time.

232
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,547
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a lot of nights just playing Cold Sept.

233
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:08,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like in Magic, as you go through and battle monsters, you get to keep some of their cards and build them into your deck.

234
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pretty intricate game.

235
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the Xbox One also has the new Xbox Live mode.

236
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

237
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:22,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and apparently, uh, poor old Sheevum finally got his Xbox 360 and got, that's one of the games he's been playing all the time now.

238
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,900
[SPEAKER_05]: After he got Rez, of course.

239
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:31,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at Portal Combat in our chatroom says, Cold Sept is the only game you can play while reading Entertainment Weekly.

240
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the game's that boring.

241
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not a fast-paced game.

242
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You read Entertainment Weekly.

243
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

244
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:39,730
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell's wrong with you?

245
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,530
[SPEAKER_02]: You read Entertainment Weekly?

246
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,930
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

247
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:41,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

248
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:41,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

249
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:44,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for my gaming week.

250
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:46,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else anyone wants to share with their gaming week?

251
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,133
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people out there that actually paint cats.

252
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that have to do with games?

253
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:55,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's creepy.

254
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:57,938
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do during this program?

255
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we pay you to surf the internet?

256
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:02,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

257
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:06,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's housekeeping, obviously, there's no Jamie here tonight, sadness.

258
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to give her a call a little later in the show so she can participate in one of her regular segments.

259
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news is, tonight...

260
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,754
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:17:42,651 --> 00:18:10,571
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the cool thing about it so I'm really looking forward to it it'll be coming up in part B so stick around and make sure you're in our chat room other than that just the usual plugs for us on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio our live journal at Orange Lounge we have a Facebook community called the OL Army so search us out there help us spread the word about independent radio and independent podcasting and that's it now Loki do you think you can take some time away from Painted Cats to read us some news stories I think I can

262
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:19,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had this for a while now, the Xbox 360 arcade model, the one replacing the core.

263
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now Japan's going to get a chance to have it as well.

264
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get theirs March 6th.

265
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:35,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the arcade system is the one that features no hard drive, but it has a memory unit, as well as five Xbox Live Arcade games.

266
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:37,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to actually cost 27,800 yen.

267
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,052
[SPEAKER_03]: which is about $20 less than we'd pay for it in the United States.

268
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:51,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully that will help drive more Xbox 360 sales because right now they're hurting.

269
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the one that doesn't have a hard drive, right?

270
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:55,678
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't have a hard drive.

271
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would think all the games that people are interested in playing in Japan probably require that hard drive.

272
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

273
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess Blue Dragon doesn't require a hard drive.

274
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for game saves and stuff.

275
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost Odyssey...

276
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of the more Japanese-centered game.

277
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think Lost Odyssey requires a hard drive.

278
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, or Devil May Cry.

279
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess none of those games do.

280
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:16,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's just PlayStation 3.

281
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:18,014
[SPEAKER_03]: They require the hard drive for that.

282
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

283
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:32,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep thinking Final Fantasy XI as well, which was really probably the first Japan-centric game that I can think of, anyway, to come out on the Xbox 360 on both shores, even though it was an already existing game, so it wasn't that hard to get out here, I'm sure.

284
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried all sorts of bundles in Japan, and so far it hasn't really helped.

285
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've only sold, like, what,

286
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, look, I want to play a game.

287
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, I can't save it unless I buy a card.

288
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:17,089
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT in chat says, if a series of top-notch Japanese games don't do it, this won't.

289
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:23,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff coming out that's kind of, you would think, appeals.

290
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,174
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to generalize to say a lot of this, too.

291
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It really appeals to the Japanese audience, you know, like Lost Odyssey.

292
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:30,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hear that game didn't do so well over there.

293
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get very good reviews over there, but, you know, I don't know if,

294
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:46,176
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at GameStop getting Cold Sept, the guy who was actually thinking of buying Cold Sept, actually he was holding it up when I walked up to the counter reading the back of the box, and I told him that was the game I wanted.

295
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:49,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But he told me he was excited about Lost Odyssey as well.

296
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I am excited about Lost Odyssey, although I have low expectations for it.

297
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I only see it as probably going to be slightly better than Enchanted Arms.

298
00:20:59,703 --> 00:20:59,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

299
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:02,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we will see.

300
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of people are really into this game.

301
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Black is also coming out for the Xbox Originals.

302
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Black for Black History Month.

303
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

304
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, I'm trying to find, you know.

305
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to be funny and failing miserably.

306
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:44,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be funny.

307
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I, that was a little, I don't know.

308
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be weird if they did try to tie it in that way?

309
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be more insulting to the game or to Black History?

310
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:54,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Black History.

311
00:21:54,218 --> 00:21:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying the game was not that great?

312
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good, but it's not, it has nothing to do with Black History Month.

313
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

314
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:08,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'm just being your normal crazy self.

315
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Always controversial, Loki.

316
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:15,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're getting some download content for Mass Effect coming March 10th.

317
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:20,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a brand new set of missions called Bring Down the Sky.

318
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:25,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It has actually a brand new race that they're introducing as well in there.

319
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:28,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they're calling it the

320
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:32,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Batarians, Batarians, Batarians, whatever.

321
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:34,267
[SPEAKER_03]: They look like an ant.

322
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sort of.

323
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:41,769
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got like a bunch of eyes and a weird little bat nose.

324
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they look like a quasi-bat-ant thing.

325
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, whatever.

326
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:56,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you'll be able to, you know, go to the colony and actually be able to save them and stuff.

327
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:59,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, gigantic space bats, I guess that's what they're saying.

328
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:03,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to be 400 Microsoft points or $5, so that's not bad.

329
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to add about 90 minutes to the game.

330
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:10,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, there's going to be 50 achievement points you can earn from it as well.

331
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:25,560
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, I remember reading about this, though, is it's midway through the game, so if you have a save that's kind of towards the end of the game, you might already have passed the ability to play this, so you have to start a new game, which kind of blows, but

332
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:30,113
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you had just one save file to begin with, you're already failing at RPG.

333
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,274
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT in our chat room makes a good comment.

334
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:39,696
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he will wait for the special edition of the game with all the download content included since we all know it's coming.

335
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:41,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But for how long?

336
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:45,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how much DLC is coming for Mass Effect.

337
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,619
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, it could be two years until that edition is released, right?

338
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably be a year because that's what they've done with some of the other ones.

339
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I haven't really noticed Microsoft Games doing that where they come out with content.

340
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you didn't see Perfect Dark come out with another Perfect Dark Zero or something like that.

341
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: But there have been others.

342
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was Oblivion, Marvel.

343
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:02,637
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a few.

344
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:07,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, Marvel and Call of Duty, that's all Activision.

345
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so they tend to do that.

346
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,584
[SPEAKER_03]: But Microsoft does not.

347
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

348
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, would that be Bioware's decision?

349
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:18,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would be their decision.

350
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just say buy it.

351
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:21,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

352
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,539
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really desperate for download content, otherwise, save that $5 for a new game.

353
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

354
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that $5 down towards Resident Evil.

355
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:32,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

356
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to spend $5 on 90 minutes of entertainment, or do you want to spend $5 on an Xbox Live arcade game?

357
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:48,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That could end up being a lot more fun, or at least, I don't know, not many Xbox Live arcade games that are 400 Microsoft points, but still, it'd be a lot more fun than 90 minutes.

358
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:50,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd spend it on food.

359
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 HD DVD Player

360
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,280
[SPEAKER_02]: For you math whizzes, that means the HD DVD player is now costing $130.

361
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So the HD DVD player has been dropped to $130 in the US and Canada.

362
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:18,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was even cheaper if you looked on Amazon a couple days ago.

363
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:24,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon was running an $80 deal for a little while, probably trying to clean out their inventory in recent HD DVD...

364
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:25,606
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

365
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:57,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I own an HD DVD player, I have for quite a while, and I kind of think it's over, and I'm kind of sad.

366
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I bought the wrong one this time.

367
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted one just for Matrix, but I'll wait.

368
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if inevitably Blu-ray wins in a year or so, and I don't mean these preemptive Blu-ray wins.

369
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Blu-ray wins when HD DVD folds, you know what I mean?

370
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,698
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens in a year or whatever, then Matrix will come out on Blu-ray.

371
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:17,198
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it will.

372
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:18,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it will, of course.

373
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars movies will all come out too.

374
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:34,503
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

375
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Rad isn't on DVD.

376
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:35,264
[SPEAKER_02]: What isn't?

377
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:35,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Rad.

378
00:26:35,404 --> 00:26:35,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Rad.

379
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad was awesome.

380
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Rad?

381
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:06,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad is a BMX bike movie.

382
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:09,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those, you know, fight for the underdogs thing.

383
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:17,672
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an entire sequence where they did a musical dance number using BMX bikes at a school prom or homecoming or something like that.

384
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:18,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

385
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Cop Rock out on DVD?

386
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:21,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

387
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,456
[SPEAKER_02]: That needs to be out on DVD.

388
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a TV show.

389
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rad and Gleaming the Cube is another one that was pretty cool.

390
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I gotta love the 80s movies.

391
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:29,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Gleaming the Cube, I remember.

392
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:30,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love the 80s movies.

393
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:32,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I know Gleaming the Cube?

394
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a trailer for it on Pump Up the Volume.

395
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,174
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know that.

396
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, as an independent radio person, you know that's one of my favorite movies ever, is Pump Up the Volume.

397
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's for another time.

398
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:48,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Monster Squad, Rad, and Gleaming in a Cube.

399
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:50,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Do yourself a favor, watch them.

400
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:55,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they were really cool back in the 80s, and they're not so cool now, but hey, it's nostalgia, so.

401
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang, Joshi16's got a good point.

402
00:27:58,845 --> 00:27:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wizard?

403
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:00,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Is The Wizard out on DVD?

404
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

405
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:02,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've seen it.

406
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it did finally come out.

407
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,530
[SPEAKER_03]: They were released in August or something.

408
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It took them a while, but it finally did.

409
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't own it.

410
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to put that on my birthday wish list.

411
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, wait until high def.

412
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: High def wizardry.

413
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:14,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

414
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:23,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need a high def Super Mario 3 or whatever that... Remember the lame announcer?

415
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I want to be able to have, you know, he touch my breasts in 7.1.

416
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

417
00:28:34,352 --> 00:28:37,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So another game getting some download content, Project Gotham Racing 4.

418
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:42,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to bring some brand new cars as well as some new modes and of course more achievements.

419
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:46,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the downloads, they're going to have one that's free.

420
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:48,056
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Free Challenge Pack.

421
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:54,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a playable hydrogen powered pergo flux car, I guess.

422
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:00,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourist mode where you just drive around the city and admire the scenery with no goal whatsoever.

423
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And free roam cat and mouse mode.

424
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the free roam stuff is pretty cool.

425
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,116
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking a little page from Burnout Paradise.

426
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:09,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, seven unlockable achievements.

427
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:29,153
[SPEAKER_03]: The Premium Challenge Pack, which is going to be $5 or 400 Microsoft Points, includes 700 new cars, including the 1987 BMW M3 E30 DTM and the World Challenge Arcade Mode with 20 new events in three themed chapters and three more unlockable achievements.

428
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And these will be available on Valentine's Day.

429
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:39,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing Says Love Like A Downloadable Hydrogen Car

430
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: She wouldn't touch the 360.

431
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,183
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't know how to do that stuff.

432
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:09,785
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't even figure out how to play a DVD on there.

433
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:11,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

434
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

435
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to go back and read some comments from chat.

436
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot about this DVD release.

437
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:21,568
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big DVD release that came out this week.

438
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:24,609
[SPEAKER_02]: NYRfan says, I saw The King of Kong the other day.

439
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see King of Kong yet?

440
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get that DVD?

441
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

442
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoop-de-doo.

443
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But they made me buy Donkey Kong for the week because they were going to do this big King of Kong contest thing.

444
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Never fucking paid me for it.

445
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they ended up not doing it.

446
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided not to do it.

447
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, where's my five bucks?

448
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:46,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

449
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:49,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, thanks, bastards.

450
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:50,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

451
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

452
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:56,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Joshi16 in chat says about The Wizard coming out in high def someday.

453
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So much batter in HD.

454
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:00,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

455
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:01,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they should call it.

456
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The It's So Batter edition.

457
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it needs to be in 3D.

458
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be awesome.

459
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know they're doing that with a lot of... Power glue!

460
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:14,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're doing that with a lot of old Disney movies at least.

461
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:15,213
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming back out in 3D.

462
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:15,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Toy Story.

463
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:17,234
[SPEAKER_02]: All those are going to come out in 3D.

464
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Toy Story is easy because they just have to render it with two camera angles.

465
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:22,596
[SPEAKER_03]: That's simple stuff.

466
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:23,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

467
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:24,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Child's Play.

468
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:28,458
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Loki's going to go home and make Toy Story 3D for all of you.

469
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a sequel.

470
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I can crap it out in a sec.

471
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:32,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That's easy.

472
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:33,995
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

473
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:36,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

474
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:37,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

475
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else that's going to be making its way to Xbox very soon.

476
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this, here you go.

477
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:43,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a movie that needs to be in HD.

478
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:45,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is out in HD yet.

479
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:45,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron.

480
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:46,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

481
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:47,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron is winner.

482
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,740
[SPEAKER_02]: and Tron, of course, the original Tron.

483
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is already out on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

484
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all knew this game was coming.

485
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Discs of Tron.

486
00:31:57,861 --> 00:31:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

487
00:31:58,321 --> 00:31:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: The other Tron arcade game.

488
00:32:00,142 --> 00:32:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be coming out on Xbox Live and it makes its way when?

489
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:04,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, this week.

490
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,504
[SPEAKER_02]: February 13th is the big day for Discs of Tron.

491
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how would you feel if Nelly got you Discs of Tron for Valentine's Day?

492
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be much cooler.

493
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking hate Discs of Tron.

494
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

495
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the Tron games.

496
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

497
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:18,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Disoftron is awesome.

498
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of a game that it was very much like.

499
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:25,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, it's really just an over-glorified Pong.

500
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've seen the movie, you remember that disc thing they would play?

501
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that little dance and they'd throw the disc in the air and it would bounce off the wall or whatever and hit the platform and make part of it disappear.

502
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately you're trying to make your opponent disappear.

503
00:32:37,236 --> 00:32:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that, but a real game.

504
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:41,758
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have that at Disneyland, like actual discotron.

505
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:43,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be cool?

506
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't necessarily... I mean, they could do it with some sort of motion capture stuff where they

507
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in black lights, one person's on the other side, and you make the motion like you're throwing a disc, and it makes the image of a disc go.

508
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:57,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that'd be kind of cool.

509
00:32:58,065 --> 00:32:58,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

510
00:32:59,265 --> 00:32:59,746
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do it.

511
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:00,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

512
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,268
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to make sure the platform actually falls out from underneath you.

513
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you fall to your untimely death at the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean.

514
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you become a slave at Disneyland.

515
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

516
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,452
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it could be like that, you remember that game show they had on Game Show Network?

517
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Arcade.

518
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,074
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, Russian Roulette.

519
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember that.

520
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:18,875
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Game Show Network.

521
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:19,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that show.

522
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:26,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Hosted by Mark L. Wahlberg, which is like, how do you describe Mark L. Wahlberg?

523
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he's the total, like...

524
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, what's a word to describe him?

525
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he hosts that Moment of Truth show now, too.

526
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:33,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Douche.

527
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you ever need, like, a total asshole to host your game show, like, Markel Wahlberg's the guy to call.

528
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:42,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was awesome on, and I mean that as a compliment.

529
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:50,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So he hosted Russian Roulette, and you would pull, and I know we have an international audience, so maybe not everybody has heard of this show, although they probably stole it from another country.

530
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You would...

531
00:33:51,480 --> 00:34:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, as people missed questions, lights would light up on the ground, including one that you were standing under, and you had to pull the lever and spin the lights, and if the light landed on you, then the floor would open and you fell.

532
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously, in the game show, you just fell a few feet onto some padding.

533
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:08,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

534
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:09,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

535
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:09,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish.

536
00:34:10,704 --> 00:34:11,684
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to believe that.

537
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:12,684
[SPEAKER_02]: How awesome would that be?

538
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, they fell through a wood chipper, but that's, you know.

539
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:20,406
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

540
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:50,418
[SPEAKER_03]: you win $100 oh I want the money fuck you you're going through the floor I'm keeping the $100 sorry to get off track here Grand Theft Auto 4 the website's actually been relaunched for the game including some new video footage that they have of it one is a mock commercial for a wireless communications company including where they say that there's no drop calls and they have reliable handsets where the guy throws a handset at someone's head and stuff it's pretty fun

541
00:34:50,942 --> 00:35:03,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you want, there is a lovemeet.net quiz, which is going to be the fictional kind of eHarmony or whatever website that's going to be in the game for dating people.

542
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:07,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can take your quiz and figure out what personality type you have.

543
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:12,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we did this at work and we came up with pervert, so that was kind of funny.

544
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming they're going to be adding some more content to the website as the weeks go along.

545
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

546
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:53,738
[SPEAKER_03]: The site that was running Destructoid was actually going to have a list of the achievements as well until Rockstar said, uh-uh, don't put those up there.

547
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:58,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they wouldn't be threatened by lawyers.

548
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: They decided not to put the content up there and kind of retracted their original articles.

549
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:12,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad a large, well-established, respectable website like Destructoid will also run away with their tail behind their legs when threatened.

550
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:17,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I'm referring to like a year-old drama, but...

551
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Faceit, that's a history of this show that will never be let down.

552
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt, I just had to work that in there.

553
00:36:23,412 --> 00:36:32,274
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, and I think also to their, you know, defense, you probably won't put that stuff up anyway because it would spoil a lot of the game.

554
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:40,196
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically, you know, said, hey, you know, in the respect for this game coming out in a few months here, just not put this up yet because that will spoil a lot of the story for the game.

555
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to spoil a game like this.

556
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome.

557
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's also some minigames you can play in it as well.

558
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:46,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them, they mentioned DARTs.

559
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:51,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Poole, and some other game.

560
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

561
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:17,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this stuff would be on PartnerNet or something like that.

562
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:22,298
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's out there on the public internet, it's free information.

563
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:26,419
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from an insider that works at Rockstar.

564
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do that.

565
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's public information, they have nowhere to complain.

566
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's an actual leak like this, they have the right to take it down.

567
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:43,722
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN is anticipating there will be a 15-gamer score achievement called Bitch Better Have My Money.

568
00:37:45,668 --> 00:38:07,755
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN also predicts a 30 gamerscore for lukewarm coffee I hope there is an achievement that pokes fun at hot coffee There really should be There should be an achievement like hot coffee and it's actually you go buy coffee You actually do buy hot coffee Or you blow up a Starbucks or whatever they call it in Grand Theft Auto A little parody name or something That'd be funny

569
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:09,386
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

570
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're getting live in our work here pretty soon.

571
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:43,795
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you think you can kill in 15 minutes?

572
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:46,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kill quite a few people.

573
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:53,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually in Saints Row I can rack up a score of 20 or more if we're playing just rockets.

574
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,684
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just all out, we usually end up being around 10 to 15 kills.

575
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we do teams, like six-man teams, oh man, we're going to own everybody.

576
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:06,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, because we have so much experience in this game.

577
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll learn all the little nuances.

578
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not even going to be fun.

579
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I don't think anyone's actually going to want to play online during our breaks.

580
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:17,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll force them to, though.

581
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be up to that challenge.

582
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:22,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know how y'all feel about this, but I don't know.

583
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:28,528
[SPEAKER_02]: As cool as Grand Theft Auto is, it's not really my kind of game, but this is one I could definitely play a lot of online.

584
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:32,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Street Fighter 4, and this is going to be a fun one I bet to play online pretty soon.

585
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:41,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, it's really no replacement for the arcade, and I think we all need to remember that, because sadly arcades are dying and they're turning into ticket-spitting machine heaven.

586
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:47,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Street Fighter 4, like it or not, it will be online, and what makes it very cool is that

587
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

588
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all back, the original eight fighters in Street Fighter 4.

589
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:13,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some scans from Famitsu Magazine that actually show them in their new art style, and it's pretty rad.

590
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's even some more stuff with Crimson Viper.

591
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:19,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just the original eight are going to be in Street Fighter 4.

592
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:20,203
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more.

593
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: The family's growing.

594
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:24,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone did post the achievement list, I guess, on Destructoid.

595
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

596
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I retract everything I said.

597
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:29,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoilers ahead.

598
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:30,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I retract everything I said.

599
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,791
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an achievement for demolishing 20 buildings using only your rocket launcher.

600
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:35,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, how do you know it's legit?

601
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my next question.

602
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:40,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That's someone's blog, I guess.

603
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:42,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

604
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:45,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So take with a grain of salt, in my opinion.

605
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:45,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

606
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:47,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to say any others?

607
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

608
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of town, stay hidden for six days.

609
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:54,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the achievements.

610
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:58,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if there's anything real quick for the hot coffee.

611
00:40:58,852 --> 00:40:59,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anything on here.

612
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

613
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:06,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's probably not going to be in there.

614
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:07,697
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a nice thought.

615
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:09,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the hooker one on there.

616
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is legit or not.

617
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:30,150
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm saying when it shows up on somebody's little blog, I'm not saying that it's necessarily a lie, but you do kind of have to take it with a grain of salt because there are people out there that want to lie, and especially probably because of the lulls that people are having over the whole, well, they know the list, but they can't spoil it.

618
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:30,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

619
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think there would be a lot more achievements than that there, too.

620
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:38,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's an achievement that says, I get it, and I'll read the first letter of each achievement name.

621
00:41:38,702 --> 00:41:39,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fake.

622
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:40,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fast.

623
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:44,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, uh... You're stupid for believing this.

624
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:45,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you suck donkey cock.

625
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:45,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, lovely.

626
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:46,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it says.

627
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

628
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:47,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

629
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Although that would be cool if that was real.

630
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Rockstar really should do that.

631
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:54,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's their hidden thing to piss off the senators.

632
00:41:54,811 --> 00:42:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, when you take the first letter of each word, it says, you know, senators are all gay or something.

633
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.

634
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you suck, Donkey Kong.

635
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:04,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't trust anything.

636
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:04,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

637
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:05,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

638
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

639
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:06,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice touch there.

640
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Loki got pwned.

641
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get pwned.

642
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:12,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's legit!

643
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I think they might cut T-Hawk.

644
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,440
[SPEAKER_02]: The characters, nobody really used.

645
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:47,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I would bet some of the Street Fighter 3 characters are going to be in this too.

646
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:49,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be epic.

647
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:50,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to have a ton of fighters.

648
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:52,026
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of room for everybody.

649
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they don't put Dan in it, there's going to be a riot.

650
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a riot.

651
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:59,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tigerclaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if Akuma is in Street Fighter 4.

652
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

653
00:43:01,252 --> 00:43:04,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Shang Long has to be in it.

654
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:06,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you must beat Shang Long to stand a chance.

655
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:08,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, forget it.

656
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:16,384
[SPEAKER_03]: One game which we thought for a second there, we thought, oh my god, hell froze over, but Duke Nukem Forever.

657
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:32,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there was an interview for the Dallas Business Journal where 3D Realms President Scott Miller confirmed all sorts of stuff including that Duke Nukem Forever was coming in 2008 and that Duke Nukem 3D was going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

658
00:43:34,179 --> 00:44:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the stuff they said we haven't officially announced any platform for Duke Nukem Forever but of course hitting the big three makes most sense PC, PS3, and 360 and he said 3D Realms is negotiating with Microsoft to get a release window of sometime this year on the title that's of course for Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade and he confirmed that Duke Nukem Forever would be coming out in 2008 to home consoles

659
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:11,302
[SPEAKER_03]: But shortly after he was claimed to have said all this stuff, 3D Realms was like, uh-uh, we never said that.

660
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:28,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, which they said, George Broussard of 3D Realms said, In what appears to be an unfortunate turn of events, there seems to have been some confusion between what was off the record and what was not.

661
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:33,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose we're used to dealing with the gaming press and not mainstream press.

662
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesson learned.

663
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:39,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know if that means that... Yeah, it is actually coming out in 2008, but... Shh!

664
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:41,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We never said that!

665
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that type of thing, or... I think they're more afraid of the space-time continuing damage that would come from actually confirming this game.

666
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:56,994
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically said the release date is still when it's done and will be until that appropriate moment.

667
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Platforms have not been finalized or announced.

668
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You can... It'll be done when it's done...

669
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:04,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop asking!

670
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:05,572
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the question, though.

671
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just put that on a big piece of paper and fax it to any website.

672
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:17,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, this will be an instant purchase for me, but, I mean, do I really care anymore about... I mean, this isn't like some huge epic game anymore.

673
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:19,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of, eh, whatever.

674
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:22,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's limping along to the finish line.

675
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd buy it just to see how terrible it actually turns out to be.

676
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:29,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not going to be... I mean, it's going to be borderline terrible.

677
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Duke Nukem 3D was borderline terrible, but...

678
00:45:33,388 --> 00:45:35,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, Duke Nukem 3D was kind of rad.

679
00:45:36,089 --> 00:45:38,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rad, but see, it had the cops, shooting hookers.

680
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the B-movie.

681
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool for the same reason Evil Dead is cool.

682
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I meant.

683
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's also cool because they use a lot of lines from Evil Dead as well.

684
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:47,475
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

685
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:48,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

686
00:45:49,036 --> 00:45:49,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

687
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:53,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that's not cool is going down and burning things down.

688
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:59,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's even more not cooler is to brag about it on the Internet.

689
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:02,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you know for this, we've got to give out another one of these.

690
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:09,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, it's another Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award.

691
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:19,314
[SPEAKER_02]: The Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award this week goes to a user on GameFAQs, and their name is JediKnight12345.

692
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:32,419
[SPEAKER_02]: JediKnight12345 made a post in the current events section of the GameFAQs forums, and what he was doing is he was asking the folks on the forums if he should burn down a school and a church.

693
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened a little later in the town of Palmyra, Missouri?

694
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,066
[SPEAKER_02]: He burned down a church.

695
00:46:41,948 --> 00:46:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this boy was arrested on suspected arson charges.

696
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:49,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know his real name because he is under the age of 18 and they withhold that kind of stuff.

697
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:53,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't give out the stupid award by his real name.

698
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But he certainly, if he's over the age of like four, he's old enough to know better.

699
00:46:57,743 --> 00:46:58,244
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

700
00:46:59,324 --> 00:47:00,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at that age, you should know better.

701
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:04,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really need more reason not to go on the GameFAQs forum?

702
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:09,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad for GameFAQs, because everybody's just using this as a reason to attack them.

703
00:47:09,648 --> 00:47:12,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, well that's what he gets for going to GameFAQs, ha ha ha.

704
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:14,770
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm like, okay, ha ha.

705
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Their community was...

706
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,971
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

707
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:48,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they wouldn't be anonymous like they are on the internet.

708
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:52,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't catch me, I'm on GameFAQs.

709
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:56,669
[SPEAKER_02]: AmazeSatsuma says, 12345, how did you know the combination for my briefcase?

710
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:11,332
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, as if even just asking about it wasn't bad enough, it should also be noted that JediKnight12345 went back to the forum and bragged that he had in fact burned a church and school down.

711
00:48:12,093 --> 00:48:13,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And he posted pictures of it!

712
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:15,185
[SPEAKER_02]: on GameFAQs.

713
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to the users of GameFAQs credit, other forum posters immediately went and found the local news station in this area and contacted them and the authorities and all that and contacted people that could do something about it and turn this guy in, basically.

714
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:34,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hooray to the GameFAQs users that turned this guy in.

715
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You are exempt from the Stupid Award this week.

716
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Jedi Knight 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, it's your Stupid Award.

717
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:40,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, you're stupid.

718
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:43,137
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

719
00:48:43,976 --> 00:48:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

720
00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:14,652
[SPEAKER_02]: He played too much Dracula, or Castlevania, throwing the holy fire and learned how to start fires.

721
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So playing too much WoW as a mage.

722
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:17,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

723
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:21,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So the complete idiocy of this guy makes me angsty.

724
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,863
[SPEAKER_03]: He fires a magic missile into the darkness.

725
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,026
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this brings on the FUs of the week.

726
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your FUs of the week, please.

727
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:42,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my FU of the week goes to a headache that's coming on right about now, and that sucks.

728
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:44,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate getting headaches on Sundays.

729
00:49:45,037 --> 00:49:46,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always on Sundays.

730
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:49,060
[SPEAKER_03]: But not having anything to do with this show, of course.

731
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I get headaches on Sundays.

732
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're allergic to Sunday.

733
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:55,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allergic to the holy day, I guess.

734
00:49:57,006 --> 00:49:57,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear that.

735
00:49:58,026 --> 00:49:59,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Poppy, do you have any FUs you'd like to give this week?

736
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:04,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, FU to insomnia, letting me get about a

737
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:19,411
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 hours of sleep over the course of four nights, and FU to the charger from my laptop for going up, and now my laptop is running on battery power until it eventually dies.

738
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:21,192
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to Sears.

739
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:33,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to give too many details about purchases I made a while ago, but oh my god, I had to go back to the store like twice in one day to clear up this issue that I was having that, you know, wasn't even like my fault with Sears.

740
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

741
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

742
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:08,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably wouldn't guess Juno as the game.

743
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

744
00:51:10,286 --> 00:51:11,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they make a game based off Juno?

745
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:12,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand it.

746
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:15,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Teaching little girls about pregnancy adventures?

747
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:20,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Juno, but I hear it's about teenage pregnancy or whatever.

748
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:21,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure how that makes a game.

749
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:25,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they make a game out of Napoleon Dynamite?

750
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how they'd make a game out of that either.

751
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:28,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Juno to me...

752
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Feels like it might be this year's Napoleon Dynamite.

753
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:37,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really funny now, but when it comes out on video, there's going to be a big backlash against it.

754
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:37,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you wait.

755
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:41,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

756
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:51,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there is a panel at DICE, the summit going on in Las Vegas right now, during the Intellectual Property Migration Specialists.

757
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:59,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It says people are making a game based off Juno just to cater to the casual market.

758
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: and they didn't specify really anything about the game but apparently it was I don't know he said it's probably going to be following Nexon's free to play business model so I don't know so it would be like little mini games for free or something I'm sorry this is probably going to be about as good as that Dirty Dancing game that came out or possibly the what was it that one based off Prince's Bride

759
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryoma in our chatroom says, Sky, Juno is a lot less stupid than Napoleon Dynamite.

760
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:37,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Napoleon Dynamite I hated.

761
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Juno, so I thought Napoleon Dynamite was funny.

762
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:49,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was like the most hilarious movie ever made, but I did find some things very amusing in that movie, like the grandma especially, you know.

763
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Make me another Quesadilla.

764
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she got in the dirt bike accident, it was really funny.

765
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:56,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

766
00:52:58,055 --> 00:52:58,516

776
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:41,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it look like some sort of hippie game, I don't know.

777
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:45,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I fast-forward all commercials, so what makes it look so horrible?

778
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:47,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the music that they picked for it.

779
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:50,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's... I don't remember what the name was.

[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Balloon Pop for the Wii.

815
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cheap puzzle game, so that's kind of neat.

[SPEAKER_03]: There's $80 peripherals.

821
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:51,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was $90 for the drum sets.

822
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:51,733
[SPEAKER_03]: No, $80.

823
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:53,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still expensive, though.

824
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

825
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

826
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:58,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

827
00:58:58,523 --> 00:58:58,723

830
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how popular wrestling is over in Japan.

831
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have their own wrestling league over there because I've seen some YouTubage.

832
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:20,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to experience the American version, there you go.

833
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also coming out on PlayStation 3, by the way.

834
00:59:22,828 --> 00:59:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And it appears to be one of the bigger releases this week in Japan.

835
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot else.

836
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also coming out on the Wii.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's another Sega Pachinko Game.

845
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:54,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I need to know.

846
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:56,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Kimikis comes out as well.

847
00:59:58,168 --> 00:59:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Poison Pink.

848
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:01,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like it could be kind of fun.

849
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And another wrestling game, Wrestle Angels Survivor.

850
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:05,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Good price.

851
01:00:06,572 --> 01:00:07,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a good TV show.

852
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:09,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be a price reduction on that.

853
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that one.

854
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:11,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

855
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what's coming out on the handhelds on the Nintendo DS.

856

[SPEAKER_02]: Digimon Championship, a game called Happy Happy Clover comes out as well.

857
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:29,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And just in time for Valentine's Day, Otomeki Koi Kakume Love Revo DS comes out as well.

858
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:33,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything of note for you guys over in Japan.

859
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:37,868
[SPEAKER_02]: A Medal of Honor as well coming on the Sony PSP, Medal of Honor Heroes that is.

860
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:38,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And

861
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:41,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Where would your life be without another Gundam game?

862
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:46,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile Suit Gundam, Giren no Yabu, Axis no Koei comes out.

863
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a Korean date, actually.

864
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:49,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That must have already come out in Japan.

865
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:52,685
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it, your Japanese release dates.

866
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:54,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

867
01:00:56,247 --> 01:01:04,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're a little bit late to, say, returning your books to a library, if you happen to be in this neck of the woods here,

868
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:31,766
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually can play DDR to possibly avoid late fees apparently the story is of a librarian's annual patron appreciation day where he lets attendees to avoid overdue fines by donating non-perishables to a local soup kitchen or playing a quick game of DDR pay for play system, they didn't really discuss that

869
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:34,017
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

870
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where this is.

871
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:06,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go there and play DDR for their late fees.

872
01:02:06,616 --> 01:02:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking paying me money for that.

873
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:12,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly a creative method.

874
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it that.

875
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:14,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

876
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:14,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

877
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll leave it at that.

878
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:17,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's creative.

879
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a pretty creative game.

880
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:23,300
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of people that loved Myst Online.

881
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:29,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they don't have much longer to love this game because GameTap will be shutting down Myst Online in 60 days.

882
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:37,129
[SPEAKER_02]: They made the difficult decision earlier this week that Myst Online Uru Live will be going down in 60 days.

883
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:40,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's somewhere in April when the game will be coming down.

884
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really cool is Rick Sanchez, who has actually been on our show before.

885
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:46,975
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on almost about a year and a half ago.

886
01:02:47,655 --> 01:02:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually posts on the GameTap forums and kind of had to make that very difficult post because, you know, like any MMO, there's rabid fans.

887
01:02:56,104 --> 01:02:57,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Myst Online is no exception.

888
01:02:58,586 --> 01:03:02,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It had its share of rabid fans, and they're not happy to hear about the game going.

889
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,394
[SPEAKER_02]: People want refunds and so on and so on.

890
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:10,979
[SPEAKER_02]: MistOnline.com will stay active as a tribute to what was in the game.

891
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:17,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Rick's post, he said they were looking at, quote, a wide variety of possibilities for maintaining the game.

892
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:23,709
[SPEAKER_02]: He swears up and down they're not just a bunch of evil corporate types who do nothing but count pennies and wear Brooks Brothers suits.

893
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I don't know how many of you guys have played MistOnline.

894
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:31,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked it out a couple months ago for the sake of reviewing it on the show.

895
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:41,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I noticed about the game is that there are real live people that play the game in a making the story work type of capacity.

896
01:03:41,352 --> 01:03:47,860
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if you were a new person, you could go to these classes in Myst Online to learn about the world of Myst.

897
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,641
[SPEAKER_02]: and it wasn't an automated thing.

898
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually someone there.

899
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:56,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I went in there, the person said, you know, hello, Sky, are you, because that's an online name I use as most of you know.

900
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:59,245
[SPEAKER_02]: The person said, hello, Sky, are you here for the class today?

901
01:03:59,605 --> 01:04:00,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yes.

902
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:01,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, okay, just take a seat over there.

903
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:02,726
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get started soon.

904
01:04:02,966 --> 01:04:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's crazy.

905
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:08,248
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have people in and I imagine that's got to be a very expensive thing to maintain.

906
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:16,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say kudos to GameTap for giving it a try and if the rest of you are pissed off, be pissed off at the fact that people didn't play it.

907
01:04:17,378 --> 01:04:18,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it shut down.

908
01:04:18,518 --> 01:04:24,201
[SPEAKER_02]: If your MMO doesn't have enough people playing it to keep it running, it shuts down.

909
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:28,162
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, though, the rabid fans will find a way to maintain it.

910
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:40,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've had that experience before when I played Myth a long time ago, and when Bungie finally shut down the servers for Myth 2, like,

911
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:43,602
[SPEAKER_05]: God, how long ago was that?

912
01:04:43,702 --> 01:04:44,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Too long ago.

913
01:04:45,144 --> 01:04:56,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't more than a month before players had brought up their own servers that Bungie actually endorsed and said, hey, you're free to go ahead and play these servers now.

914
01:04:56,494 --> 01:04:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll turn the other cheek for this one.

915
01:04:59,632 --> 01:05:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Josie16 in chat, chat.org.com says, Missed Online was well thought through.

916
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad to see it go.

917
01:05:06,517 --> 01:05:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the problem with Missed Online, even though they had the class and everything, I found it very hard to just get in and go.

918
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:25,130
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I think the reason why WoW, like, one reason WoW is so fucking popular is that I don't know how many of you have sat down to play it, you know, despite how you feel about the game, but you can get up and running in World of Warcraft relatively quickly.

919
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:28,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's kind of a learning curve as you level from levels 1 to 10, right?

920
01:05:29,032 --> 01:05:31,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people are like, oh, you can get to level 10 in an hour.

921
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:36,596
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because level 1 to 10 is really the learning curve for noobs, and it really walks you through the game.

922
01:05:37,637 --> 01:05:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the same bitch as Final Fantasy XI.

923
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:46,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if Final Fantasy XI didn't have the Final Fantasy name in front of it, that was a very hard game to just get up and running in, to kind of figure out.

924
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when we first bought Final Fantasy XI, Loki?

925
01:05:48,523 --> 01:05:50,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought it the day it came out on the PC.

926
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:51,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It was back when we were living together.

927
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:53,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so lost the first day.

928
01:05:54,586 --> 01:05:57,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that the world extended beyond the first little area.

929
01:05:57,868 --> 01:05:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like,

930
01:05:58,578 --> 01:05:59,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna kill bunnies for the rest of my life!

931
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:00,059
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fun!

932
01:06:15,163 --> 01:06:19,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go into, what's the thing after, it's Ronfro's the first area.

933
01:06:19,386 --> 01:06:24,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go into Lathene Plateau, and you try to kill a bunny there, and they just murder you.

934
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:27,430
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I just got raped by a bunny.

935
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you hate me so much?

936
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:30,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now I remember.

937
01:06:30,712 --> 01:06:31,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

938
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad I didn't have to deal with that.

939
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:36,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was fun.

940
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:37,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss it.

941
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:39,116
[SPEAKER_03]: But not really.

942
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

943
01:06:41,817 --> 01:06:46,739
[SPEAKER_03]: One game I'm probably not going to miss either is Midway's brand new This is Vegas!

944
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:54,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently if you're too, I don't know, poor to go to Vegas to be a whore or to gamble, you can do it in this game.

945
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's awesome.

946
01:06:56,882 --> 01:06:59,983
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really say what it was that you would be doing in this.

947
01:07:00,844 --> 01:07:06,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently you would be able to live out your fantasies in Vegas by fighting, gambling, driving, and partying.

948
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:09,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Strangely, no mention of hookers.

949
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:10,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

950
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, in the trailer though, there was hooker-like people.

951
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so this is Vegas, coming to Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

952
01:07:23,764 --> 01:07:31,969
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm just, I'm wondering if people are going to start doing, you know, this is Sparta, and this is Vegas.

953
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's somewhere on YTMND already.

954
01:07:37,613 --> 01:07:38,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's already there.

955
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:39,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

956
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird idea for a game, but.

957
01:07:43,032 --> 01:07:44,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel.

958
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Press release put out this week from D3.

959
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mentioning the forthcoming sequel to the game.

960
01:08:15,896 --> 01:08:17,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the quote from the press release.

961
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:28,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The company will also be releasing video games based on Aardman's popular Shaun the Sheep character in 2008 alongside the eagerly awaited follow-ups to the best-selling Ben 10 and Puzzle Quest.

962
01:08:29,226 --> 01:08:33,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Now see, I don't know what I'm more excited about, sequel to Puzzle Quest or Shaun the Sheep.

963
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:39,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never fucking heard of it, but that sounds pretty awesome, I gotta say.

964
01:08:39,827 --> 01:08:40,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheep.

965
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:44,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember Ben 10 being that popular, but okay.

966
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:52,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently it was popular enough for them to make a live-action movie about, even though the only reason I know that is because I watch too much Cartoon Network.

967
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:54,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something that's more popular in another country, I don't know.

968
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:58,276
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never heard of it personally, so there you go.

969
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:01,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what 12-year-olds are watching these days other than Hannah Montana.

970
01:09:01,598 --> 01:09:02,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

971
01:09:04,295 --> 01:09:13,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure this... Don't get me started on how fucking nuts it is that, like, the theaters are, like, packed with little girls and their moms going to see Hannah Montana.

972
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know that movie is, like, crushing everything.

973
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:17,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear people talking about it at work all the time.

974
01:09:17,683 --> 01:09:19,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a movie.

975
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a recording of a concert.

976
01:09:21,726 --> 01:09:22,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

977
01:09:22,146 --> 01:09:22,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

978
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like... Not a movie.

979
01:09:24,387 --> 01:09:26,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about how the DS prints money.

980
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:29,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Miley Cyrus has money coming out her ass.

981
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:29,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

982
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

983
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder when she's going to do a cover of her dad's achy breaky heart.

984
01:09:36,884 --> 01:09:37,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Or duet.

985
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:39,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

986
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:56,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this is pure coincidence that I have this story, but apparently Mastiff has licensed the rights to the Major League Eating I didn't even know there was Major League Eating, but apparently they're going to make a Major League Eating game.

987
01:09:57,296 --> 01:09:59,297
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will play out like a fighting game.

988
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,205
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll show people on screen eating.

989
01:10:05,486 --> 01:10:08,227
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have a mastery of offensive and defensive weapons.

990
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like watching this show on Justin TV.

991
01:10:10,388 --> 01:10:11,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to watch people eat.

992
01:10:12,529 --> 01:10:14,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I am having dinner, okay?

993
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:15,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

994
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:18,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not like, oh, it's the fish.

995
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:20,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, food good.

996
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,059
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do that one day on the show, though.

997
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you will have offensive and defensive weapons, including burps, belches, and mustard gas.

998
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:37,684
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like the ultimate 12-year-old boy game.

999
01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Tee hee fart!

1000
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:40,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, seriously.

1001
01:10:40,284 --> 01:10:41,065
[SPEAKER_03]: That is horrible.

1002
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:50,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the technical mastery necessary to avoid emptying one's stomach and vividly colored reversals of fortune.

1003
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: As they like to put it.

1004
01:10:54,769 --> 01:10:55,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1005
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:59,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was worth the effort to even make that eloquent.

1006
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:01,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, are you that desperate for licenses?

1007
01:11:01,312 --> 01:11:03,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is Mastiff, so, you know, I guess so.

1008
01:11:04,213 --> 01:11:08,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they just came out with a Top Gun DS game, like, not too long ago.

1009
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:10,996
[SPEAKER_02]: A little late.

1010
01:11:12,496 --> 01:11:16,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So, last week we had Major We, and this week we have Major Eating.

1011
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:17,398
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.

1012
01:11:18,258 --> 01:11:19,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think it would go the other way around.

1013
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:21,339
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

1014
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddamn, if this isn't a story that won't ever go away, is Apple's getting into gaming.

1015
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Apple's getting into gaming.

1016
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Newsflash, Apple's kind of already... Well, A, Apple went into gaming a long time ago and didn't do too hot.

1017
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Pippin, hello.

1018
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:39,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple's already, like, they're getting their big toe.

1019
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're putting their big toe in the water and saying, hmm, me...

1020
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,422
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some pretty awesome games on the iPod now, like Peggle on the iPod.

1021
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I've officially reviewed it on the show or whatever, but Peggle on the iPod is pretty awesome.

1022
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:53,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a system that game was made for.

1023
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:54,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty awesome game on the iPod.

1024
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:59,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And Phase, basically Guitar Hero for your iPod of sorts.

1025
01:11:59,229 --> 01:11:59,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero?

1026
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,970
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?

1027
01:12:01,311 --> 01:12:02,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Guitar Hero.

1028
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:03,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Amplitude.

1029
01:12:04,092 --> 01:12:04,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

1030
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Amplitude.

1031
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:09,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, more people probably know what I'm talking about when I talk about Guitar Hero.

1032
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:11,217
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to educate them.

1033
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:15,215
[SPEAKER_02]: HitStun in chat says apparently the iPod version of Peggle is great.

1034
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:15,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1035
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:18,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Peggle is probably the best game you can get on the iPod right now, honestly.

1036
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:29,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I love Sonic the Hedgehog and all that stuff too, but Peggle, just because of the nature of, you know, how you rotate the gun to fire down the... It's like, imagine if Plinko was a game.

1037
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:31,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what Peggle is.

1038
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:34,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can rotate the little gun with the dial.

1039
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:35,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It works perfectly.

1040
01:12:35,929 --> 01:12:36,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1041
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:40,697
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a, like, online version of Price is Right, the game.

1042
01:12:40,737 --> 01:12:41,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1043
01:12:42,098 --> 01:12:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of rad.

1044
01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:43,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1045
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Use the touch wheel to spin the big wheel.

1046
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hold on.

1047
01:12:45,559 --> 01:12:46,139
[SPEAKER_02]: We got derailed.

1048
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from Apple to talking about Price is Right.

1049
01:12:48,740 --> 01:13:04,405
[SPEAKER_02]: A trademark apparently was filed on February 5th that now has the room reels going again because Apple has updated its trademark to now include toys, games, and playthings, namely handheld units for playing electronic games and

1050
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:17,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamheld units for playing video games, standalone video game machines, electronic games other than those adapted for use of television receivers only, LCD game machines, electronic educational game machines, toys, namely battery-powered computer games.

1051
01:13:18,237 --> 01:13:18,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety Net

1052
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:36,241
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be.

1053
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.

1054
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1055
01:13:58,798 --> 01:13:59,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame!

1056
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand.

1057
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:04,719
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to make it pink and pretty and stupid idiots will buy it.

1058
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Brace yourself.

1059
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I am agreeing with Loki.

1060
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Me of all people.

1061
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are an Apple fanboy.

1062
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:25,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not think that Apple... I think they got lucky with the iPhone jumping into a completely new market, but they... I think if they try to get into gaming, they're going to fail.

1063
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't...

1064
01:14:28,553 --> 01:14:32,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Style and design is not going to win when it's the software that sells the game.

1065
01:14:32,896 --> 01:14:36,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not necessarily talking about the MacBook Air and stuff like that, just that.

1066
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:42,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying they choose to go aesthetics over functionality for a lot of stuff.

1067
01:14:42,762 --> 01:14:44,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

1068
01:14:44,783 --> 01:14:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that works for some people, I guess.

1069
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:54,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is I don't think it's going to work for a console system or it's going to work for a handheld system because they're going to want to change it constantly.

1070
01:14:54,589 --> 01:14:54,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

1071
01:14:56,395 --> 01:15:01,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the PlayStation 3 does the same damn thing, but still, you can't.

1072
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to get confusing, and they're going to want to do a ton of different things.

1073
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:09,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like the PSP, but they're going to change it a lot more.

1074
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:17,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like you can release a new system like you can release a new version of an iPod, and it'll still have the same technology and functionality.

1075
01:15:18,582 --> 01:15:23,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they'll end up releasing something new six months later, and it won't be able to be backwards compatible.

1076
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:25,715
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1077
01:15:46,562 --> 01:15:50,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised if you see the iPod go a little further into gaming.

1078
01:15:50,424 --> 01:15:54,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I could totally see them putting out a controller or something that plugs into the iPod.

1079
01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense, I think.

1080
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:57,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's as far as it's going to go.

1081
01:15:57,948 --> 01:16:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them releasing a whole new thing.

1082
01:16:00,629 --> 01:16:03,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it as some type of extension or enhancement for an iPod.

1083
01:16:04,191 --> 01:16:06,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1084
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:10,514
[SPEAKER_05]: The best games that will ever come out for an iPod will probably be made...

1085
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:17,081
[SPEAKER_05]: by random people, not by Apple, that use the iPod Touch's touchscreen functionality.

1086
01:16:17,222 --> 01:16:19,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, apparently, PopCap might be it.

1087
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense, because the type of games that PopCap puts out is perfect for the iPod audience.

1088
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:25,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1089
01:16:26,025 --> 01:16:26,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?

1090
01:16:26,405 --> 01:16:26,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Casual stuff.

1091
01:16:26,945 --> 01:16:28,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

1092
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:29,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Pirates on an iPhone.

1093
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:30,907
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1094
01:16:31,403 --> 01:16:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Part A is about over and we're going to be getting into Part B tonight.

1095
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, if I haven't mentioned yet, in Part B tonight, I've mentioned this a lot actually, we're going to be playing a brand new game we've never played before here on the show.

1096
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:46,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in chat can play and possibly win tonight.

1097
01:16:46,866 --> 01:16:47,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be amazing.

1098
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get to that in Part B, we have to do one more segment here in Part A. And for that, we have to bring somebody special on the line.

1099
01:16:57,687 --> 01:16:59,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, caller, are you there on the line?

1100
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:00,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1101
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:02,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jamie, how are you feeling?

1102
01:17:04,195 --> 01:17:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling stuff that I can't say on the air.

1103
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:07,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1104
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just kind of feeling a little sick this week, basically?

1105
01:17:13,786 --> 01:17:15,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It's viral.

1106
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never any fun.

1107
01:17:18,691 --> 01:17:21,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry to hear that you're sick, but you'll be back next week, right?

1108
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will.

1109
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't want to get you guys sick.

1110
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:27,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about my co-workers so much.

1111
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:27,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.

1112
01:17:29,364 --> 01:17:30,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I got it from my co-workers.

1113
01:17:31,946 --> 01:17:32,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

1114
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to go back and get some more of them sick then, right?

1115
01:17:36,288 --> 01:17:39,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I figured if they were going to get sick, they would have already gotten sick from it.

1116
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1117
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:43,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, Jamie, we just couldn't do this segment without you.

1118
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:46,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the end of Part A, as you may know from listening or what have you.

1119
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,297
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to do the classic game of the week.

1120
01:17:49,337 --> 01:17:50,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get in the music.

1121
01:17:55,367 --> 01:18:00,488
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura, what classic game have you picked for the listeners to celebrate this week?

1122
01:18:02,048 --> 01:18:06,189
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic game of the week is one of my personal favorites.

1123
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:13,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ys III, where it's from Ys, which is, you know, being Ys III, it is the third in the series.

1124
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:16,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one's actually different from the other two.

1125
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:19,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone else was a big fan of it.

1126
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,033
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm right, this was out on MSX.

1127
01:18:21,133 --> 01:18:21,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

1128
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:28,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I got used to the Super Nintendo version, but it was also out on PC Engine.

1129
01:18:28,618 --> 01:18:31,880
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've actually got the Duo version of this somewhere.

1130
01:18:33,301 --> 01:18:37,945
[SPEAKER_01]: But the special thing about this one is that it's sort of a departure in gameplay from the previous ones.

1131
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:41,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

1132
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:42,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

1133
01:18:43,128 --> 01:18:43,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, go ahead.

1134
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:52,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with this one is that the previous ones were the whole top-down, you know, old-school Zelda-style, you know,

1135
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:57,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Overhead View, and this one had primarily side-scrolling.

1136
01:19:00,628 --> 01:19:08,013
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to actually mash a button to swing the sword and to attack, and you also had rings that you could equip for different special effects.

1137
01:19:08,774 --> 01:19:13,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having magic, you would use your ring power.

1138
01:19:13,637 --> 01:19:15,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a pretty cool game.

1139
01:19:15,559 --> 01:19:20,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, I thought, unique for the time and the type of RPG that it was.

1140
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:23,406
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also had, like, some really fantastic music.

1141
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:25,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this game a whole lot.

1142
01:19:26,807 --> 01:19:28,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a listen to the music real quick.

1143
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:39,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one thing I should say about this game, a very common mispronunciation of the title, right?

1144
01:19:39,531 --> 01:19:42,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it looks like Y's, because it's just the letter Y. It's Ys.

1145
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:43,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Ys.

1146
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:44,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1147
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:53,817
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if you actually look at the name, the Japanese title, Romana, it says Isu.

1148
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:54,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1149
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:55,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that help?

1150
01:19:55,879 --> 01:20:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the most recent Ys game, if I'm not mistaken, because I think we brought it up on a previous edition of the show, they ported, or I guess they made a new version of this game for the PSP, right?

1151
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:11,411
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm right, I think it was Ys V, technically, the Ark of Napis Simp.

1152
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:21,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a Windows one that was like a remake of Ys III, which was the Earth of Stalkana.

1153
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like an expansion of Ys III.

1154
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

1155
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:31,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you know, this game is so classic that it still continues to live on today in sequels.

1156
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:33,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

1157
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:39,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, anyone who's got, you know, Super Nintendo, if you can find this one, you should be able to find it really cheap still.

1158
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:40,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend picking it up.

1159
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:41,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun game.

1160
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:42,712
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1161
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:44,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someday a virtual console?

1162
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:45,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1163
01:20:46,394 --> 01:20:50,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so, but we'd probably get Ys I and II before we got Ys III.

1164
01:20:50,356 --> 01:20:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

1165
01:20:52,037 --> 01:20:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1166
01:20:52,738 --> 01:20:52,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1167
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it, boys and girls.

1168
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:59,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week, Wanderers from Ys, the third game in the series.

1169
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:06,245
[SPEAKER_02]: The music you were hearing was from the MSX version, but you can find it also on Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx, if I'm not mistaken?

1170
01:21:06,745 --> 01:21:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1171
01:21:07,305 --> 01:21:07,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1172
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:08,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it was a Turbo CD.

1173
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:09,410
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1174
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:12,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jamie, we look forward to having you back in the house next week.

1175
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:14,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest up and feel better, and say hi to Dan for us.

1176
01:21:16,211 --> 01:21:17,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's in there playing Smash Brothers.

1177
01:21:17,852 --> 01:21:18,152
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1178
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:21,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys have the new Smash Brothers, right?

1179
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we don't have it.

1180
01:21:24,173 --> 01:21:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of ours brought it over, and so they've been going through the whole adventure mode in there with the amazingly compatible team of Samus and Pikachu.

1181
01:21:35,095 --> 01:21:35,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1182
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:42,842
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1183
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:07,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see how it is.

1184
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,529
[SPEAKER_01]: You wait until I'm out, and then you do the new stuff.

1185
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:16,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because we have to fill time, because you're not here to give us your viewpoint and interrupt Loki when he's talking.

1186
01:22:16,894 --> 01:22:17,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1187
01:22:17,274 --> 01:22:18,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cry.

1188
01:22:19,816 --> 01:22:20,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, DarkSakura, we love you.

1189
01:22:20,997 --> 01:22:22,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play in the game tonight.

1190
01:22:23,218 --> 01:22:24,499
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be funny if you win.

1191
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:26,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't ever get the show to pull up on my laptop.

1192
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, that's a bummer.

1193
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:28,762
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1194
01:22:29,662 --> 01:22:30,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DarkSakura, take care.

1195
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:31,704
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week, okay?

1196
01:22:31,724 --> 01:22:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1197
01:22:32,885 --> 01:22:33,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

1198
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:33,465
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1199
01:22:33,485 --> 01:22:33,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

1200
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Auf Wiedersehen.

1201
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:36,487
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1202
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for this Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:44,474
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a quick break, though, and we'll be back with plenty more.

1204
01:22:44,955 --> 01:22:46,296
[SPEAKER_02]: However, here's the deal.

1205
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to close all my chat windows here.

1206
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:59,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be asking a qualifying question to qualify for tonight's game in Part B. Basically, one contestant will be coming in via the Skype line.

1207
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:02,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give you a question, very similar type of question you might hear in tonight's game.

1208
01:23:03,332 --> 01:23:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you think you know the answer you're going to send me the answer in a private message in the chat room if you don't know how to send me a private message ask somebody and you are going to send me your phone number and by sending me your phone number that is consent that you approve of us calling you please make sure you are by your phone in the next hour or so

1209
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:45,986
[SPEAKER_02]: and that we don't get any surprises of mommy or daddy picking it up so don't submit an answer to this if you do not have control over your own phone so here it is this is the qualifier question you're gonna send me the correct answer to this question and then you are going to send me your phone number if you want to play and we'll pick somebody randomly out of those that submit the correct phone number so here it is and I'm putting this in the podcast because I felt those listening in the podcast might want to play along

1210
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the qualifying question.

1211
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:51,531
[SPEAKER_02]: What game is this music from?

1212
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't yell it out in chat or you're giving it away for everybody.

1213
01:24:01,213 --> 01:24:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the correct answers.

1214
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:04,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, one of these is the correct answer.

1215
01:24:05,033 --> 01:24:06,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the answers you have to choose from.

1216
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: A, Nightmare on Elm Street.

1217
01:24:09,534 --> 01:24:11,075
[SPEAKER_02]: B, Halloween.

1218
01:24:11,595 --> 01:24:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: C, Friday the 13th.

1219
01:24:20,558 --> 01:24:20,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1220
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:42,615
[SPEAKER_02]: After tonight's break.

1221
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:45,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
