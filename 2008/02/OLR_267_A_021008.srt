00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Today, February 10th, 2008, Xbox HD DVD gets a price cut, old favorites are revealed for

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Street Fighter IV, and is an Oscar-nominated movie soon becoming a video game?

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,840
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Radio.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,120
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,660
and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,640
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Summers.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
She is unfortunately out with sickness.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,640
She's been having, you know, just the sickness, the plague and stuff, so she can't be here

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,400
tonight because she's worried she's contagious and doesn't want to give it to us.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,760
So of course we understand, and we're kind of thankful that she's not here to spread

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,080
it to us.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
But she will be back next week.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,040
Meanwhile, we do have the one and only Loki, tech master, one and only.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
Yeah.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
How you doing?

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Good.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Good.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Eating a sandwich.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,080
But the problem is Subway was out of white bread, and I had wheat, and wheat tasted like

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
corn.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Oh, no.

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,360
Subway was out of something?

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,680
Wheat tastes like cardboard.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
It's not that bad.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Bread is bread.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,280
Yeah, but it's not even really wheat bread.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
It's like they took white bread and kind of dyed it brown.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, it is Subway.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,760
I wouldn't expect huge differences.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,320
Does your cat scratch you or something?

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,800
I see big old claw marks.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Yes, that's my cat.

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Well, that's because once she gets up in her tube sometimes, she starts to freak out, but

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,240
she's playing and stuff, so what do I try to do?

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,880
I try poking at her all the time.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,920
I try petting her on her head, but then she just grabs her claws and she kind of catches

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
me sometimes.

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Gotcha.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
And she did.

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,280
It looks a lot more painful than it actually was.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
All right, well, also joining us tonight, you might have heard his voice there just

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,640
a minute ago, it's Puppy, also known as Black Lab, or Ryan, depending on whatever we want

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
to call him.

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
How are you, Puppy?

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I am tired.

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Tired?

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,800
I had some insomnia this week, and kind of capped it off with getting woken up at 2.30

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,040
in the morning last night by gunfire.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Oh, fun!

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Sorry to hear about the gunfire.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,280
Were your neighbors fighting or something?

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,520
I don't know, it was probably something in the mall parking lot.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,560
Okay, I gotcha.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Interesting.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,680
You know, it's been just a crazy week in everybody's neighborhood.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,360
There was gunfire in your neighborhood, and the house across the street from the studio

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,080
here burned down a couple days ago.

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,680
On the outside, it makes Rob's house much easier to find to get here.

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
That's unfortunate for those that affected.

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,040
I didn't even notice it, because that house was so run down to begin with, it's like,

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
really?

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
It burned down?

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Couldn't tell.

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,920
All right, well, anyhow, let's not talk about neighborhood drama, let's talk about our gaming

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
weeks.

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
We'll start it off with how was your gaming week, and we'll go ahead and start off with

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Loki tonight.

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
How was your gaming week?

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,040
First off, I'd like to say I have brought back the Ever360, it is back to life again.

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Hooray!

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,400
The trick was I needed more heat.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,280
I didn't stop until I got to about 850 degrees to 1,000 degrees, and sure enough, that worked!

77
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,800
So now I have six working 360s, hooray!

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,120
You're just loaded, aren't you?

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,280
And then, let's see, I played this week more Smash Bros. Brawl, and that's pretty awesome.

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I actually got to dive in a little bit to the subspace emissary mode, and it's pretty

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
fun.

82
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,920
They have some really crazy-looking enemies in the game, just some weird stuff, but it's

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,120
pretty cool.

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,960
And then I've unlocked Rob the Robot, we went through the challenge, but I actually took

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,600
off work half a day to go visit one of my customers who really wanted to play the game,

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,840
so I took it down there and we played it for five hours.

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
He went through all the...

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
It didn't get old after five hours.

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,360
No, no, I didn't play it for the full five hours, I just kind of watched him for a little

90
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,080
bit, but we played through the challenges and trying to unlock some of that stuff, and

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,640
doing two-player co-op in the subspace emissary stuff.

92
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,080
But I don't know, the challenges weren't that hard, because we actually figured out what

93
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,320
to do without reading, obviously, because it's all in Japanese, but I don't know.

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,800
It's pretty cool.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,320
I think, though, if I play through the entire subspace emissary stuff and then finish all

96
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,760
the other crap, I might get bored with the game a little bit.

97
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,620
So I actually need to play some people.

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,360
Other than Smash Brothers, I also played Silent Hill Origins, actually, on the PSP.

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,480
I went back to try that again.

100
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
And pretty cool.

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,240
I actually am looking forward to it coming out on PlayStation 2, because I just don't

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,920
like being tethered to my TV with a little cable, so it might be a little bit better

103
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,080
if I have a little bit more room to play.

104
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,660
And then, I also played a lot of Burnout Paradise, still trying to knock people off of the leaderboards

105
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,340
for the Showtime rankings.

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,320
I love how listeners will add us on Xbox Live, because they enjoy the show and so on, they

107
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,080
just kind of want to play a game with us occasionally, or what have you, whereas Loki makes it his

108
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,400
mission to dominate our listeners in whatever game he's playing.

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,880
He's like, oh no, I can't get beat by no listener.

110
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,040
I've got to control the Burnout map.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Right now I have about 26 of the roads, so I still have a ways to go.

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,040
But let's see, other than that, I played a little bit more DotStream on the Game Boy

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Advance.

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Pretty fun.

115
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,920
And I think that's pretty much it.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh, I tried playing Crysis again.

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,240
I actually uninstalled Crysis, reinstalled Crysis, tried to get that last level to fucking

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,760
work again, and sure enough, it does not work.

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,040
Still, I can't pass that last level in the game because it glitches out, and it stops

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
working.

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,440
So, I am sick of Crysis, although I did load up the physics little custom map that someone

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,720
made to play the physics of the game.

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,000
They actually released a new version of the map last week, and that was fun, because you

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,400
can slingshot barrels and the people and stuff, and catapult things, and you gotta love that.

125
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,340
But other than that, though, I fucking hate the last level of Crysis.

126
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,640
Did they not test it at all?

127
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,480
I mean, it's just really broken, which is bad, because the rest of the game is pretty

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,880
cool, but it's just that last level, right as you're about to finish the game and kind

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,440
of get the payoff for playing through the entire thing.

130
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,460
Oh no, you can't do that.

131
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,020
That would be too easy.

132
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,560
So I don't know.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,040
I know you check out a lot of the new Xbox games that come out.

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Did you check out Poker Smash this week?

135
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Nope.

136
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
No.

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,800
I like a NYR fan in our chatroom, his description.

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
Of course, I haven't introduced the chat yet, but it's chat.orangelandradio.com.

139
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,600
We tape live on Sunday nights at our website, orangelandradio.com.

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,240
So remember, you are listening to live radio.

141
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,960
It's NYR fan, and chatroom says, Poker Smash is like Planet Puzzle League, but you make

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
poker hands.

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
That's kind of true.

144
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Did you play Puppy?

145
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Any Poker Smash?

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,960
No, it never really got any interest from me.

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,240
I thought it was going to be kind of lame, but it's actually kind of a unique sort of

148
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
puzzler.

149
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,060
I guess that's a good description of it.

150
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,760
It's like Planet Puzzle League, but the whole poker element kind of makes you think on two

151
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,840
different levels, which is very scary.

152
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
And I got thrown off by the colors when I first started playing, but then I realized

153
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,600
that the colors were just another way of designating the pink ones or queens, the yellow ones or

154
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
tens and so on.

155
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,160
But you still have to consider the suits of what you're dropping, so I know it makes it

156
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,000
sound really complicated, but it's easy to get easy combos, but it's much harder to get

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
the more difficult combos, if that makes sense.

158
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
I was kind of surprised.

159
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Anyway.

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Sorry.

161
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Puppy, how was your gaming week?

162
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,620
Most of my week has been involved with Call of Duty 4 since I finally got a hold of it.

163
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,040
Even though I rented it through Gamefly, I'm probably going to end up keeping it anyways,

164
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,960
because I found that it's much better than Halo 3.

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,780
Even with the updates that Halo 3 finally added and are going to add in the near future,

166
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,000
I still will be playing Call of Duty 4 instead.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
That's a pretty bold statement, that it's better than Halo 3.

168
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,240
I actually found it much more enjoyable than Halo, just because there's a lot more reality

169
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,600
to it, as opposed to, oh, armored space guys punching each other in a grossly malformed

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
way.

171
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,840
And then, other than Call of Duty 4, I sadly have fallen back into my puzzle pirate habit.

172
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Sucker.

173
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Yeah.

174
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Well, how has Puzzle Pirates changed?

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
Because you were last addicted to the game, what, about two years ago?

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, well, I stopped playing it about a year ago, because I didn't have the time to anymore.

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
And then, apparently a lot of stuff changed in that year.

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,720
They brought back, they brought a bunch of new puzzle games in, and added some new player

179
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,320
versus environment stuff, and it's getting popular, and I just found out, they just made

180
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,120
an announcement that they're selling game cards at Target now, so they must be making

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
it big or something.

182
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Nice.

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm noticing with the facial hair that you're starting to sprout here, you're starting to

184
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,760
look like a pirate a little bit.

185
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,320
This was much longer earlier this week, though.

186
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
I see.

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,560
But, yes, I could just throw on an eyepatch for a party.

188
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,880
It's great radio, too, to talk about Puppy's look.

189
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Yeah, because I mean, even-

190
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,520
He's got a little facial growth that makes him look like a pirate.

191
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
I don't know if they can see it on Justin.TV, because you're blonde.

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
I could probably, well, yeah, I could probably stand right in front of the camera and they

193
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
wouldn't see it.

194
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Yeah, why don't you go give them a nice close-up when you're done, then?

195
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Yeah.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Go give them a nice close-up of your mug there.

197
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Give them a nice little mug shot there, you know, side view.

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Yeah.

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
All right.

200
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

201
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Um, uh, rez, uh, various board games, and-

202
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,640
Isn't rez incredible?

203
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Of course it is.

204
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I love rez.

205
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,720
I really wish that I had a high-def TV to play it on.

206
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh.

207
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I do, and it's sexy.

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
I hate to rub it in, but yeah, yeah, you really do want one.

209
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
You need to have surround sound, too, when you're playing it.

210
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
That's true.

211
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,000
I seriously almost dug up my old surround sound system that's kind of crappy.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
It's actually hooked up here in the garage.

213
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,960
I almost brought that into the house just to play rez HD with, but I'm going to get

214
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,080
a new sound system when I get my tax refund.

215
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,400
Yeah, I thought about getting a better TV with my tax refund, but I've got other stuff

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,920
that I need to pay for first.

217
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Gotcha.

218
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
All right.

219
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Now go supermodel for the camera.

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I'll talk about my gaming week.

221
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,440
First, I want to mention in chat room, because this didn't come up earlier, Tiger Claw says,

222
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Sky, I just realized, OLR is competing against the Grammys.

223
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Who cares?

224
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Seriously.

225
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,080
I mean, the Grammys, I don't know.

226
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,800
I find them to be incredibly irrelevant, and I think, like, did you see that article on

227
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Digg earlier this week about the biggest Grammy snubs of all time?

228
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It's pretty interesting.

229
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,160
It shows how, like, there's all these big name artists that always get snubbed by the

230
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Grammys when there's people that were more deserving.

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Well, whatever.

232
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,760
Forget it.

233
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,080
And I brought up tax refunds earlier.

234
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm curious in our chat room, those that are getting tax refunds, if there's anything in

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,240
gaming that you're contemplating spending your tax refund on.

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
So let us know in our chat room, chat.orangewormsrated.com.

237
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
I'll read those in just a little bit.

238
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,640
But first, my gaming week, mostly spent, besides Poker Smash, playing a couple different games.

239
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
World of Warcraft, of course.

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
I know I talk about that a lot here on the program, but it has been a lot of my gaming

241
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,720
week recently.

242
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,280
And it really went to the next level this week.

243
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,560
I don't know how many hardcore WoW addicts we have that listen to the game.

244
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,920
But tonight, or I'm sorry, yesterday marked our first 10-man raid into Karazhan, which

245
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
is...

246
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, you're just moving on.

247
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I know.

248
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
It's weird.

249
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Like, I've never done endgame content in an MMO before, because Final Fantasy XI, oh my

250
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
God.

251
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
I mean, it just takes forever to get there, and WoW it does, too.

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,540
But I don't know, I guess more people I know play WoW for whatever reason.

253
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,280
So we finally got to the endgame content in that game, and it's something else.

254
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
It's just a whole other challenge.

255
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,640
Enjoy it while you can, because...

256
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,560
When Wrath of the Lich King comes out, then all that stuff gets antiquated, I know.

257
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Oh, of course.

258
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,420
So, and we only have 10 people in our guild that can even do it.

259
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,060
So I notice it's tough to really arrange the times to go in there, but we did an awesome

260
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,160
job for anybody that does know WoW.

261
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,880
We killed Attuneman, we killed Moros, and we killed Maiden today.

262
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,040
So in our first weekend, we killed three of the bosses in Karazhan, which is pretty awesome,

263
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
and apparently is...

264
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,720
You know, I'm sure there's lots of people out there that go, whoa, my guild killed four

265
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
bosses, so fuck you.

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Fuck you.

267
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
My guild clearly all in one night.

268
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,920
For us, when we were mostly casual players, it was pretty awesome.

269
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,900
So good times.

270
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,220
Just wait until you try to move on to 25-man content, and you've got three different groups

271
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,960
going to Karazhan at once, and they're like, oh, we don't want to split up, we don't want

272
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,520
to go all together, and then you'll end up breaking apart, and...

273
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh, no.

274
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Drama, drama, drama.

275
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
No, we don't want drama.

276
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
We're all...

277
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,640
Most of us actually live here in the area, in our guild-less form, mostly from real-life

278
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
people.

279
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,800
Like, my boyfriend is in the guild, and Irene is in the guild, but she's not level 70 yet.

280
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,520
Some of the other people you've heard on this show are in the guild, and yeah, good times.

281
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
So we're finally doing that stuff.

282
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Let's see.

283
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,940
Looking at chat room, seeing what folks are saying they're gonna spend their tax refunds

284
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,000
on here.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's see.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,520
SSJ100Matt says, my tax rebate is going towards an HD camera.

287
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,840
GS191 says, I'll probably spend my welfare, I mean, stimulus package check on a new PC.

288
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
That's right.

289
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Yeah.

290
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
After that thing was passed.

291
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,520
I'm already spending that on a new computer, because I need something at home that doesn't...

292
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
That can run AutoCAD.

293
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Nice.

294
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
All right.

295
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,440
Oh, DMN's gonna use his refund to come visit the show.

296
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
He's coming back to Sacramento.

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Scary.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, boy.

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We'll use that refund to move.

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hide the pets and the children.

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
All right.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
No, just kidding.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
Also, okay, there's other games I've been playing besides MMO.

304
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
I also picked up a game on the Xbox 360.

305
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,280
I can't remember if I've talked about this previously on the show, but it's a game called

306
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,880
Cold Step Saga, and it's the sequel to a PlayStation 2 game that was simply called Cold Stepped,

307
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,960
and I think I did mention this once on the show.

308
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,320
I love this description of the game I've read on the internet.

309
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
It's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

310
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,960
I think that's the best way to describe the game.

311
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,840
You basically have a deck of cards, and you can customize them, and you move around this

312
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,720
board, and you lay down your creatures, and basically laying down a creature is kind of

313
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,920
like owning property in Monopoly, and you can level up the square, which is like buying

314
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,560
houses or a hotel, and you make your creatures more powerful, but when an opponent lands

315
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,340
on your square, it's not that they just have to pay rent.

316
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,740
They can choose to battle your creature with one from their hand, and then there's all

317
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,320
these enhancements cards that'll increase your strength, your defense.

318
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,840
So it's kind of a game where you really have to think before you play, and it's a lot of

319
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
fun.

320
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,320
I think it's a very unique concept.

321
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,900
It's kind of interesting to see it on the Xbox 360.

322
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,000
For me, they didn't really change a lot from the first game, and the animations are not

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,480
really anything to jump and scream about in this new age of gaming or whatever you want

324
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,680
to call it with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

325
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You look at the Eye of Judgment, and there's very intricate battles that happen.

326
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,120
For all the shit we give that game on this show, the battles look kind of cool when the

327
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,480
cards do battle.

328
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,160
Here in Coldsept, it's like, you know, if a monster attacks with the claws, you see

329
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,640
big claw marks go across the cards.

330
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,680
So it's basically like Pokemon, just in high definition.

331
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,520
Well, like, literally the cards do battle.

332
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
It's kind of amusing.

333
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,080
And there's incredible Engrish in the game.

334
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I think one of the lines is something like, I had to escape the poverty, or something

335
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,080
I don't remember, like very literal translations in some of the cutscenes, but it's cool.

336
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,880
I mean, for me, I think this game is mostly a second chance for people who missed it on

337
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,120
the PlayStation 2, because it's not a full-price Xbox game.

338
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
It's like that middle tier.

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,080
It's $39.99, so it's not quite as much as you pay for a brand new Xbox 360 game.

340
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,400
It's a pretty good deal.

341
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,360
I actually didn't own Coldsept on PlayStation 2.

342
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,280
One of my friends a couple years ago did.

343
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
That's how I got exposed to it the first time.

344
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,900
We spent a lot of nights just playing Coldsept.

345
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,320
By the way, just like in Magic, as you go through and battle monsters, you get to keep

346
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
some of their cards and build them into your deck.

347
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,120
So it's a pretty intricate game, and of course the Xbox One also has the new Xbox Live mode.

348
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,080
Yes, and apparently poor ol' Jeevan finally got his Xbox 360, and that's one of the games

349
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,280
he's been playing all the time now, after he got rezzed, of course.

350
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,000
Looking at Portal Combat in our chatroom says, Coldsept is the only game you can play while

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
reading Entertainment Weekly.

352
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't think the game's that boring.

353
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,120
I mean, it's not a fast-paced game.

354
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,920
You read Entertainment Weekly.

355
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I know.

356
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
What the hell's wrong with you?

357
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
You read Entertainment Weekly?

358
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Oh, I'm kidding.

359
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
All right.

360
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
That's it for my Gaming Week.

361
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,080
Anything else anyone wants to share with their Gaming Week?

362
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
There's people out there that actually paint cats.

363
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,880
What does that have to do with games?

365
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Anything?

366
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
That's creepy.

367
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,760
What do you do during this program?

368
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,360
Do we pay you to surf the internet?

369
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes.

370
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,660
Yeah, we don't pay you at all.

371
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,240
Tonight's housekeeping, obviously, there's no Jamie here tonight.

372
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Sadness.

373
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,400
We're going to try to give her a call a little later in the show so she can participate in

374
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,740
one of her regular segments, but the good news is tonight we have a brand new game.

375
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,120
We've never played on the show before.

376
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,840
It's something brand new.

377
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,440
Here's the cool thing.

378
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,300
You might remember last week we had a copy of Res HD that we were unable to give away

379
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,880
on the show because the person who won it didn't have an Xbox 360, whatever, didn't

380
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
want it.

381
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
It's back in the prize pool tonight.

382
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,440
Tonight, everybody that is in our chat room at chat.orangehontraded.com and listening

383
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
to the show has a chance to win.

384
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Everybody can play this game tonight.

385
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
That's the cool thing about it.

386
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm really looking forward to it.

387
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,040
I'll be coming up in Part B, so stick around and make sure you're in our chat room.

388
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,820
Other than that, just the usual plugs for us on MySpace at Orange Honch Radio, our live

389
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,640
journal at Orange Lounge, we have a Facebook community called the OL Army, so search us

390
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
out there.

391
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,960
Help us spread the word about independent radio and independent podcasting, and that's

392
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
it.

393
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
Now, Loki, do you think you can take some time away from Painted Cats to read us some

394
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,440
news stories?

395
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,000
I think I can.

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,280
We've had this for a while now, the Xbox 360 arcade model, the one replacing the core.

397
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,560
Well, now Japan's going to get a chance to have it as well.

398
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,240
They're going to get theirs March 6th, and of course, the arcade system is the one that

399
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,040
features no hard drive, but it has a memory unit, as well as five Xbox Live arcade games.

400
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:45,280
It's going to actually cost 27,800 yen, which is about $20 less than what we paid for it

401
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,000
in the United States.

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,320
Hopefully, that will help drive more Xbox 360 sales, because right now they're hurting.

403
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
But this is the one that doesn't have a hard drive, right?

404
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
No, it doesn't have a hard drive.

405
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
I would think all the games that people are interested in playing in Japan probably require

406
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
that hard drive.

407
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Probably.

408
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I mean, like Blue Dragon.

409
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,640
Well, I guess Blue Dragon doesn't require a hard drive.

410
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,680
It's just, you know, for game saves and stuff, it's got to, you know, have a game.

411
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Lost Odyssey.

412
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm trying to think of the more Japanese-centered game.

413
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,360
Well, I don't think Lost Odyssey requires a hard drive.

414
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
I guess not, or Devil Might Cry.

415
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,680
I guess none of those games do.

416
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,800
No, that's just PlayStation 3.

417
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
They require the hard drive for that.

418
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
All right.

419
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I don't know.

420
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I guess that's true.

421
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,240
I keep thinking Final Fantasy XI as well, which is really probably the first Japan-centric

422
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,280
game that I can think of, anyway, to come out on the Xbox 360 on both shores, even though

423
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,440
it was an already existing game, so it wasn't that hard to get out here, I'm sure.

424
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,600
They've tried all sorts of bundles, though, in Japan, and so far hasn't really helped.

425
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,720
I mean, they've only sold, like, what, a quarter-million yen last year, so...

426
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,200
Pika Uno in our chat room actually lives in Japan and is quick to point out some of the

427
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
facts.

428
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,560
The Blue Dragon bundle that they actually sold over there was a core pack.

429
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,480
He says all bundle packs in Japan are cores, so...

430
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,240
Which is kind of ironic, because it was the original core that didn't even have a memory

431
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,160
unit or anything, so it's like, oh, Blue Dragon, oh, but you gotta buy a memory unit.

432
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh, darn.

433
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
Oh, hey, it's just like the PS2 was.

434
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
Oh, hey, look, I want to play a game.

435
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Oh, wait, I can't save unless I buy a card.

436
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Dope.

437
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,200
RossdielUT in chat says, if a series of top-notch Japanese games don't do it, this won't.

438
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,360
I guess that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff coming out that's kind of, you

439
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,360
would think, appeals, and you really have to generalize to say a lot of this, too, really

440
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,120
appeals to the Japanese audience, you know, like Lost Odyssey, but I hear that game didn't

441
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,560
do so well over there.

442
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,280
It didn't get very good reviews over there, but, you know, I don't know if...

443
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,040
When I was at GameStop getting cult-stepped, the guy who was actually thinking of buying

444
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,760
cult-stepped, actually, he was holding it up when I walked up to the counter reading

445
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,600
the back of the box, and I told him that was the game I wanted, but he told me he was excited

446
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,720
about Lost Odyssey, as well, so there is a little bit of a bug going on.

447
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,560
I am excited about Lost Odyssey, although I have low expectations for it.

448
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,480
I only see it as probably going to be slightly better than Enchanted Arms.

449
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,800
Well, we will see.

450
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,340
Meanwhile, also in Xbox 360 news, there are some new classic video games making their

451
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,140
way to the Xbox Live Classic downloads very soon.

452
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,360
I think there might be some type of tie-in.

453
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,080
I think the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game must be coming out soon, because some of the

454
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,360
games that have been announced to the Xbox originals, Pirates, as well as Ninja Gaiden,

455
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,880
so more Ninjas and Pirates jokes abound, but also another Xbox classic, Black, and I know

456
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,340
a lot of people are really into this game.

457
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,980
Black is also coming out for the Xbox originals.

458
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,600
Black for Black History Month.

459
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
I don't know about that.

460
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,920
I am just trying to find you.

461
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,400
You are trying to be funny and failing miserably.

462
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I am not trying to be funny.

463
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
That was a little...

464
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,560
I don't know.

465
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Somebody might think that...

466
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,520
Wouldn't that be weird if they did try to tie it in that way?

467
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,680
Would that be more insulting to the game or to Black History?

468
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Black History.

469
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
Are you saying the game was not that great?

470
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
It was good, but it has nothing to do with Black History Month.

471
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
All right.

472
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,560
It would just be like, huh, Black, huh.

473
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't know.

474
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
I am just trying...

475
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Just being your normal crazy self.

476
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I am just trying to figure it out.

477
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Always controversial, Loki.

478
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
I don't know what I am talking about.

479
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,520
So we are getting some download content for Mass Effect coming March 10th.

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,640
It's a brand new, I don't know, set of missions called Bring Down the Sky.

481
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,640
It has actually a brand new race that they are introducing as well in there, and I guess

482
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,520
they are calling it the Batarians.

483
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
The Batarians.

484
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Yeah.

485
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Batarians.

486
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Batarians.

487
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Whatever.

488
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
They look like an ant.

489
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I mean, sort of.

490
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,040
They've got like a bunch of eyes and a weird little bat nose.

491
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,360
Actually they look like a quasi-bat ant thing, I don't know, whatever.

492
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:56,240
So you'll be able to, you know, go to the colony and actually be able to save them and

493
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
stuff.

494
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Yeah.

495
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,520
Gigantic space bats, I guess that's what they are saying.

496
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,400
It's only going to be 400 Microsoft points or $5, so that's not bad, and it's going to

497
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,080
add about 90 minutes to the game, and also there's going to be 50 achievement points

498
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,880
you can earn from it as well.

499
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,360
One thing, though, I remember reading about this, though, is it's midway through the game,

500
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,800
so if you have a save that's kind of towards the end of the game, you might already have

501
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,560
passed the ability to play this so you have to start a new game, which kind of blows,

502
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,320
but if you had just one save file to begin with, you're already failing at RPG.

503
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,040
RastioUT in our chat room makes a good comment, he says he will wait for the special edition

504
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,280
of the game with all the download content included, since we all know it's coming.

505
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
But for how long?

506
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,040
We don't know how much DLC is coming for Mass Effect.

507
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,600
In other words, it could be two years until that edition is released, right?

508
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,920
It'll probably be a year, because that's what they've done with some of the other ones,

509
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,400
although I haven't really noticed Microsoft games doing that, where they come out with

510
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,840
content, because you didn't see Perfect Dark come out with another Perfect Dark Zero or

511
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
something like that.

512
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
But there have been others.

513
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,720
PCN, Marvel, there's a few.

514
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,240
Marvel and Call of Duty, that's all Activision, so they tend to do that, but Microsoft does

515
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
not.

516
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,640
Would that be Bioware's decision?

517
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, it would be their decision.

518
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,920
I would just say, buy it.

519
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,280
If you're really desperate for download content, otherwise save that $5 for a new game, huh?

520
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,340
That's what I'm saying.

521
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,840
Put that $5 down towards ResHD.

522
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Exactly.

523
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,060
Do you want to spend $5 on 90 minutes of entertainment, or do you want to spend $5 on an Xbox Live

524
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Arcade game?

525
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,160
That could end up being a lot more fun, or at least, I don't know, not many Xbox Live

526
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,200
Arcade games that are 400 Microsoft points, but still, it'd be a lot more fun than 90

527
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
minutes.

528
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,760
I'd spend it on food.

529
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,400
Well, you could also put that $5 towards a brand new Xbox 360 HD DVD player, and you

530
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,120
know what, thanks to this recent news, that $5 gets you one-twenty-sixth of the way there.

531
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,800
For you math whizzes, that means the HD DVD player is now costing $130, so the HD DVD

532
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,680
player has been dropped to $130 in the US and Canada.

533
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,380
Actually, it was even cheaper if you looked on Amazon a couple days ago.

534
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,380
Amazon was running an $80 deal for a little while, probably trying to clean out their

535
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,580
inventory in recent HD DVD versus Blu-ray news not looking good for HD DVD, and I'm

536
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,300
sure this is just another fallout of that.

537
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,880
If you can't beat the news, you've got to drop the price, right?

538
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
This is how they're going to make this look that much more attractive.

539
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,660
So of course, as you all know, HD DVDs have been kicked, punched, and everything this

540
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,880
year thanks to all the Blu-ray news, so this is certainly a welcome kick in the pants for

541
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,900
HD DVD owners, hopefully to drive some more sales and therefore more software.

542
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,140
I own an HD DVD player, I have for quite a while, and I kind of think it's over and I'm

543
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
kind of sad.

544
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,460
I think I bought the wrong one this time.

545
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,540
I wanted one just for Matrix, but I'll wait.

546
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:09,860
Well, if inevitably Blu-ray wins in a year or so, and I don't mean these preemptive Blu-ray

547
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
wins.

548
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,020
Blu-ray wins when HD DVD folds, you know what I mean?

549
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,780
If that happens in a year or whatever, then Matrix will come out on Blu-ray.

550
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
You know it will.

551
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Oh, it will.

552
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Of course.

553
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,340
Then the Star Wars movies will all come out too.

554
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,740
Everything, just like in DVD.

555
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,860
I mean, just, I think we're at a point where like everything is out on DVD, right?

556
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,760
Is there any movies, like big, big movies, maybe Chad's going to have to help me here.

557
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,380
Any big, big movies that are not out on DVD at this point?

558
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,220
I mean, I was reading some article earlier this week that one of the companies, I don't

559
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,460
know if it's Universal or what, has sold their entire back catalog to some company to make

560
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
custom DVDs.

561
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,220
So in other words, if you want a movie made at any point in time by, I want to say it

562
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,300
was Universal, this company will make a DVD for you, even if it's some obscure ass movie

563
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,780
from the 60s that didn't do very well.

564
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
Rad is a non-DVD.

565
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
What is it?

566
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Rad.

567
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,380
Rad?

568
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Rad was awesome.

569
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
What is Rad?

570
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,560
Rad is a BMX bike movie.

571
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,500
It's one of those, you know, fight for the underdogs thing.

572
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,500
They had an entire sequence where they did a musical dance number using BMX bikes at

573
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,180
a school prom or homecoming or something like that.

574
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
It was awesome.

575
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,900
Is Cop Rock out on DVD?

576
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
I don't know.

577
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
That needs to be out on DVD.

578
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
That was a TV show.

579
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,780
But Rad and Gleaming the Cube is another one that was pretty cool.

580
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,660
Oh, I gotta love the 80s movies.

581
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,060
Gleaming the Cube, I remember.

582
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Gotta love the 80s movies.

583
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
You know how I know Gleaming the Cube?

584
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,340
Because there's a trailer for it on Pump Up the Volume.

585
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,780
That's how I know that.

586
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,460
Which as an independent radio person, you know that's one of my favorite movies ever,

587
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
is Pump Up the Volume.

588
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,220
But anyway, that's for another time.

589
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,680
Monster Squad, Rad, and Gleaming the Cube.

590
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,140
Do yourself a favor, watch them.

591
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,020
I know they were really cool back in the 80s and they're not so cool now, but hey, it's

592
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
nostalgia.

593
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,860
Hey, Josie16's got a good point.

594
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
The Wizard?

595
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Is The Wizard out on DVD?

596
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Yes, it is.

597
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I think I've seen it.

598
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I think they did finally come out.

599
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
They were released in August or something.

600
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
It took them a while.

601
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,740
It took them a while, but it finally did.

602
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
I don't own it.

603
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,020
I need to put that on my birthday wish list.

604
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Hey, wait until High Def.

605
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
High Def Wizardry.

606
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
That's true.

607
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,820
High Def Super Mario 3 or whatever that is.

608
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,060
Remember the lame announcer?

609
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:32,820
Yes, I want to be able to have, you know, He Touched My Breaths in 7.1.

610
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,420
Moving on.

611
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,140
So another game getting some download content, Project Gotham Racing 4.

612
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,260
It's going to bring some brand new cars as well as some new modes and of course, more

613
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,580
achievements.

614
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,780
Of the downloads, they're going to have one that's free.

615
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,640
It's called the Free Challenge Pack.

616
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,980
It has a playable hydrogen-powered pergo-flux car, I guess, tourist mode where you just

617
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,540
drive around the city and admire the scenery with no goal whatsoever, and free roam cat

618
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
and mouse mode.

619
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,300
See, the free roam stuff is pretty cool.

620
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,820
They're taking a little page from Burnout Paradise and of course, seven unlockable achievements.

621
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,340
The Premium Challenge Pack, which is going to be $5 or 400 Microsoft points, includes

622
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:24,260
700 new cars including the 1987 BMW M3 E30 DTM and the World Challenge Arcade mode with

623
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:30,140
20 new events in three themed chapters and three more unlockable achievements.

624
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,660
And these will be available on Valentine's Day.

625
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:40,060
Because nothing says love like a downloadable hydrogen car.

626
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,740
Hey, that's the love for the environment, okay?

627
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,140
Maybe if, you know, ladies want to get something for their husbands, not to be stereotypical,

628
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm sure there's a lot of girl Project Awesomeers out there.

629
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
I got you this free download content.

630
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Oh, thanks.

631
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Thank you.

632
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,100
If Nellie bought you the content, you'd be happy, wouldn't you?

633
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
No, I wouldn't.

634
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
I'd be like...

635
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
You're a bad husband.

636
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,800
All right, she wouldn't touch the 360.

637
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,380
She doesn't know how to do that stuff.

638
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,220
She can't even figure out how to play a DVD on there.

639
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,860
All right, let's see, also, I want to go back and read some comments from chat.

640
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,620
I forgot about this DVD release.

641
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,820
This is a big DVD release that came out this week.

642
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,060
A NYR fan says, I saw the King of Kong the other day.

643
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Yeah.

644
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Did you see King of Kong yet?

645
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Did you get that DVD?

646
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,480
Nope.

647
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,180
But they made me buy Donkey Kong for a week because they were going to do this big King

648
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,620
of Kong contest thing.

649
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,140
Never fucking paid me for it.

650
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,940
And then they ended up not doing it.

651
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,060
So we decided not to do it.

652
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,060
I'm like, where's my five bucks?

653
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Sorry about that.

654
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,060
I'm like, thanks, bastards.

655
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Nice.

656
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Let's see.

657
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:58,080
Oh, joshi16 in chat says, about the wizard coming out in high def someday, so much batter

658
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,080
in HD.

659
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Exactly.

660
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,380
That's what they should call it, the it's so batter edition.

661
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,500
Oh my God, it needs to be in 3D.

662
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
That'd be awesome.

663
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Hey, you know they're doing that with a lot of old Disney movies, at least, are coming

664
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
back out in 3D.

665
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,740
Toy Story, all those are going to come out in 3D.

666
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Toy Story is easy because they just have to render it with two camera angles.

667
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,140
That's simple stuff.

668
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Sorry.

669
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
Child's Play.

670
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,180
In fact, Loki's going to go home and make Toy Story 3D for all of you.

671
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:36,300
I'll make a sequel, I can crap it out in a sec.

672
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,540
Let's see, moving on.

673
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,620
Something else that's going to be making its way to Xbox very soon.

674
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,460
Now this, here you go.

675
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,780
Here's a movie that needs to be in HD.

676
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,900
I don't think this is out in HD yet.

677
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Tron.

678
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
That'd be cool.

679
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Tron is winner.

680
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
Of course.

681
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,100
Tron, of course, the original Tron, that game is already out on the Xbox Live Marketplace,

682
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,000
but we all knew this game was coming, Disks of Tron.

683
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,300
That's right, the other Tron arcade game.

684
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,420
That is going to be coming out on Xbox Live and it makes its way when?

685
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,740
Why this week.

686
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,900
February 13th is the big day for Disks of Tron.

687
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,540
Now how would you feel if Nellie got you Disks of Tron for Valentine's Day?

688
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
That would be much cooler.

689
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
I fucking hate Disks of Tron.

690
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
What?

691
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,700
I don't like the Tron games, I'm sorry.

692
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Disks of Tron is awesome.

693
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,260
Disks of Tron was, I'm trying to think of a game that it was very much like.

694
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,540
It's kind of like, it's really just an over glorified pong.

695
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,020
And if you've seen the movie, you remember that disc thing they would play, they did

696
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,620
that little dance and they'd throw the disc in the air and it would bounce off the wall

697
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,580
or whatever and hit the platform and make part of it disappear.

698
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,300
And ultimately you're trying to make your opponent disappear.

699
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,860
It's like that, but a real game.

700
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:45,500
They should have that at Disneyland, like actual Disks of Tron, wouldn't that be cool?

701
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,640
They could do it with some sort of motion capture stuff where you're in black lights,

702
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,100
one person's on the other side and you make the motion like you're throwing a disc and

703
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,140
it makes the image of a disc go, I mean, that'd be kind of cool.

704
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Good times.

705
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,140
They could do it.

706
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
I don't know.

707
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,020
They just need to make sure the platform actually falls off from underneath you.

708
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,860
And then you fall to your untimely death at the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean.

709
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,020
And then you become a slave at Disneyland.

710
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
The end.

711
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,620
No, it could be like that, you remember that game show they had on Game Show Network?

712
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Nick Arcade.

713
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
No, no, no.

714
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Russian Roulette.

715
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Oh, I remember that.

716
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,380
On the Game Show Network where they have that show.

717
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,820
Directed by Mark L. Wahlberg, which is like, how do you describe Mark L. Wahlberg?

718
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,180
He's the total, like, just, what's a word to describe him?

719
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,780
You know, he hosts that Moment of Truth show now, douche.

720
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:39,740
Like if you ever need like a total asshole to host your game show, like, Mark L. Wahlberg's

721
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
the guy to call.

722
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,260
And so he was awesome on, and I mean that as a compliment.

723
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,380
So he hosted Russian Roulette and you would pull, and I know we have an international

724
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,340
audience, so maybe not everybody has heard of this show, although they probably stole

725
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,700
it from another country.

726
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,980
You would, basically, you know, as people missed questions, lights would light up on

727
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,140
the ground, including one that you were standing under, and you had to pull the lever and spin

728
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,300
the lights, and if the light landed on you, then the floor would open and you fell.

729
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,020
Now obviously in the game show you just fell a few feet onto some padding.

730
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
Yeah.

731
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Yeah.

732
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
I wish.

733
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
We'd like to believe that.

734
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
How awesome would that be?

735
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:20,140
In my mind, they fell through wood chipper, but that's, you know.

736
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Alright.

737
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
You win $100!

738
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
Oh, I want the money!

739
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Yeah, fuck you!

740
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
You're going through the floor!

741
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,140
I'm keeping the $100!

742
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,060
Sorry to get off track here.

743
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,220
Grand Theft Auto IV!

744
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,580
The website's actually been relaunched for the game, including some new video footage

745
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,420
that they have of it.

746
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:44,140
One is a mock commercial for a wireless communications company, including where they say that there's

747
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,940
no drop calls and they have reliable handsets, where the guy throws a handset at someone's

748
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
head and stuff.

749
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,100
It's pretty fun.

750
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:57,980
Also, if you want, there is a Lovemeat.net quiz, which is going to be the fictional kind

751
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,060
of eHarmony or whatever website that's going to be in the game for dating people.

752
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,180
You can take your quiz and figure out what personality type you have.

753
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,220
I know we did this at work and we came up with pervert, so that was kind of funny.

754
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,460
And I'm assuming they're going to be adding some more content to the website as the weeks

755
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,340
go along.

756
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,540
We're coming up on the April 29th date, which is when the game comes out.

757
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,660
Can't wait!

758
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,540
Some other stuff has come out about it as well.

759
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,980
Some leaked information, apparently, about the multiplayer details, including some of

760
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:40,820
the deathmatches that they have planned, co-op, team-based head-to-head battles, online races.

761
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,440
They had some names for them as well, Cops & Crooks, Bomb the Base, and Hangman's Noose.

762
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,820
The site that was running Destructoid was actually going to have a list of the achievements

763
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,940
as well until Rockstar said, uh-uh, don't put those up there.

764
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,360
So they wouldn't be threatened by lawyers, they decided not to put the content up there

765
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,460
and kind of retracted their original articles.

766
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:10,460
I'm glad a large, well-established, respectable website like Destructoid will also run away

767
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,620
with their tail behind their legs when threatened.

768
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:19,140
And yes, I'm referring to a year-old drama, but face it, that's a history of this show

769
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,380
that will never be let down.

770
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,620
Sorry to interrupt, I just had to work that in there.

771
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:30,620
And I think also to their defense, you probably wouldn't want to put that stuff up anyway

772
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,700
because it would spoil a lot of the game.

773
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,860
They basically said, hey, in respect for this game coming out in a few months here, just

774
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,260
not put this up yet because that will spoil a lot of the story for the game.

775
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,140
You don't want to spoil a game like this, it's going to be awesome.

776
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,320
Oh, there's also some minigames you can play in it as well.

777
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,780
Some of them, they mentioned Darts, you'll be able to play Pool, and some other game.

778
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,020
I don't know.

779
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,020
You know what though, here's the thing, if they got that list of achievements from a

780
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,100
press copy of the game or something, then I'd say they have no right to post them up

781
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
on the internet.

782
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:08,140
But if they're extracting them from the Xbox.com website or whatever because one of the Rockstar

783
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,020
employees went on with this copy of the game or something, I don't know.

784
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,340
I'm sure that's what's happened before with some other games.

785
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,980
I'm sure this stuff would be on PartnerNet or something like that.

786
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Right.

787
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,020
I would say if it's out there on the public internet, it's free information put up.

788
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,700
No, this is from an insider that works at Rockstar or something else on the internet.

789
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,180
Yeah, can't do that.

790
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,940
If it's public information, they have nowhere to complain, but if it's an actual leak like

791
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,180
this, then yeah, they kind of have the right to take it down.

792
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,300
DMN is anticipating there will be a 15 gamer score achievement called Bitch Better Have

793
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
My Money.

794
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Who knows.

795
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,500
DMN also predicts a 30 gamer score for Luke Warm Coffee.

796
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,040
I hope there is an achievement that pokes fun at hot coffee, there really, really should

797
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
be.

798
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,260
Like there should be an achievement like hot coffee, and it's actually you go buy coffee.

799
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,500
You actually do buy hot coffee.

800
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Coffee from here.

801
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,500
You blow up a Starbucks or whatever they call it in Grand Theft Auto, a little parody name

802
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
or something.

803
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
That'd be funny.

804
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Very cool.

805
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,820
Well, I know you must be looking forward to the multiplayer in this game.

806
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Oh, fuck yeah.

807
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,420
We're going to own the world in this game.

808
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm telling you, we...

809
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,260
Is this something you're looking forward to dominating the listeners on your season?

810
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Oh, yeah.

811
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,980
I'm telling you, because we at work, we've been playing Grand Theft Auto, at least on

812
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,180
the PSP and multiplayer, for two years now, and now we've switched to Saints Row to kind

813
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,820
of bring ourselves up to speed on, you know, 360 multiplayer games and stuff, like Grand

814
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Theft Auto.

815
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,220
But as soon as Grand Theft Auto comes out, man, we're playing this twice a day for fifteen

816
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,580
minutes each, and we're getting live in our work here pretty soon, so...

817
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,020
How much do you think you can kill in fifteen minutes?

818
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,700
I can kill quite a few people.

819
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,460
Usually in like Saints Row, I can rack up a score of twenty or more if we're playing

820
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
just rockets.

821
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:59,820
It's just all out, we usually end up being around, you know, ten to fifteen kills, but

822
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,940
if we do teams, like six man teams, oh man, we're going to own everybody, seriously, because

823
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,260
we have so much experience in this game, and we'll learn all the little nuances, it's just

824
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,180
not even going to be fun.

825
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,500
But you know, I don't think anyone's actually going to want to play online during our breaks.

826
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,220
I'll force them to, though.

827
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,700
I will be up to that challenge.

828
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,580
Well, I don't know how y'all feel about this, but I don't know.

829
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,540
As cool as Grand Theft Auto is, it's not really my kind of game, but this is one I could definitely

830
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,300
play a lot of online, it's Street Fighter IV.

831
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,720
And this is going to be a fun one, I bet to play online pretty soon, although it's really

832
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,160
no replacement for the arcade, and I think we all need to remember that, because sadly

833
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,780
arcades are dying and they're turning into ticket-spitting machine heaven.

834
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,160
But you know, Street Fighter IV, like it or not, it will be online, and what makes it

835
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,420
very cool is that, in a way, you're going to get to relive the past, because it was

836
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,900
announced this week that all the old Street Fighter II characters are coming back in Street

837
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,940
Fighter IV.

838
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,540
So it's not just Ryu, it's not just Ken, it's not just Chun-Li, as they originally said,

839
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:08,380
but you're also getting Guile, Blanca, Zangief, Dalsium, E. Honda, they're all back, the original

840
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,900
eight fighters in Street Fighter IV, and there's some scans from Famitsu Magazine that actually

841
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,420
show them in their new art style, and it's pretty rad.

842
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,180
And then there's even some more stuff with Crimson Viper, so it's not just the original

843
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,940
eight are going to be in Street Fighter IV, there's more, the family's growing.

844
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,780
Someone did post the achievement list, I guess, on Destructoid.

845
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:31,160
Oh wow, so uh, well then I retracted everything I said.

846
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,860
They have an achievement for demolishing 20 buildings using only your rocket launcher?

847
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,820
Wait, how do you know it's legit?

848
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,180
That's my next question.

849
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,340
That's someone's blog, I guess.

850
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,300
Okay, well I could be, so take with a grain of salt, in my opinion.

851
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Yeah.

852
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,220
You want to say any others?

853
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,580
Let's see here, out of town, stay hidden for six days, that's one of the achievements.

854
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,660
Let me see if there's anything real quick for the hot coffee, I don't see anything on

855
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,540
here.

856
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:08,300
Let's see here, yeah it's probably not going to be in there, but it's a nice thought.

857
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,900
I like the hooker one on there.

858
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,700
I don't know if this is legit or not.

859
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,940
See, I'm saying when it shows up on somebody's little blog, I'm not saying that it's necessarily

860
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,020
a lie, but you do kind of have to take it with a grain of salt, because there are people

861
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,260
out there that want to lie, and especially probably because of the lulls that people

862
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,260
are having over the whole, well they know the list but they can't spoil it, you know

863
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
what I mean?

864
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,220
I wonder if there would be a lot more achievements in that there too.

865
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,340
Because there's an achievement that says I get it, and I'll read the first letter of

866
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:44,340
each achievement name, yeah it's fake, it says you're stupid for believing it, yeah

867
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,300
you suck donkey cock, yeah that's what it says, nice, okay, although that would be cool

868
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,500
if that was real, like Rockstar really should do that, like that's their hidden thing to

869
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
piss off the senators, like you know, when you take the first letter of each word it

870
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,640
says you know, senators are all gay or something, you know, I don't know, yeah you suck donkey

871
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,280
cock, don't trust anything, yeah, nice, nice, okay, nice touch there, yeah look you got

872
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,440
pwned, I didn't get pwned, oh my god it's legit, going back to Street Fighter 4 for

873
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,100
a minute, something we do know a little more about, RossdielUT in chat asks, oh no Cammy,

874
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,260
no not at this time, only the classic 8 Street Fighter 2 characters have been announced,

875
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,660
that doesn't even include boss characters, but honestly I don't know, if I were a betting

876
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,620
man I would think you're going to get all your 2 characters, all the super characters

877
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,840
meaning the bosses and Cammy and all them as well, I don't know, they might cut, did

878
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,640
anybody really use T-Hawk, I don't know, I think they might cut T-Hawk, the characters

879
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,060
nobody really used, I bet some of the Street Fighter 3 characters are going to be in this

880
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,220
too, oh of course, I think it's going to be epic, I think it's going to have a ton

881
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,420
of fighters, there's plenty of room for everybody, and if they don't put Dan in it

882
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,980
there's going to be a riot, there will be a riot, yeah, Tigerclaw says I wouldn't

883
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,620
be surprised if Akuma is in Street Fighter 4, absolutely, and of course, Shang Long has

884
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,940
to be in it, because you must beat Shang Long to stand a chance, anyway, forget it.

885
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,240
Well one game, which we thought for a second there, we thought, oh my god, hell froze over,

886
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:22,700
but Duke Nukem Forever, apparently there was an interview for the Dallas Business Journal,

887
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,340
where 3D Realms president Scott Miller confirmed all sorts of stuff, including that Duke Nukem

888
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,580
Forever was coming in 2008, and that Duke Nukem 3D was going to be coming to Xbox Live

889
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,440
Arcade, and some of the stuff that he said, we haven't officially announced any platform

890
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,660
for Duke Nukem Forever, but of course, hitting the big three makes most sense, PC, PS3, and

891
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,540
360, and he said 3D Realms is negotiating with Microsoft to get a release window of

892
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:59,380
some time this year on the title, and that's of course for Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade,

893
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,620
and he confirmed that Duke Nukem Forever would be coming out in 2008 to home consoles, but

894
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,340
shortly after he was claimed to have said all this stuff, 3D Realms was like, uh-uh,

895
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:20,380
we never said that, and apparently, which they said, the George Bressard of 3D Realms

896
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,540
said, in what appears to be an unfortunate turn of events, there seems to have been some

897
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,860
confusion between what was off the record and what was not. I suppose we're used to

898
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:36,400
dealing with the gaming press and not mainstream press. Lesson learned. So, I don't know if

899
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,340
that means that, uh, yeah, it is actually coming out in 2008, but shhh, we never said

900
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:47,180
that, you know, that type of thing, or... I think they're more afraid of the, uh, the

901
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,420
space-time continuing damage that would come from actually confirming this game. They basically

902
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:57,620
said the release date is still when it's done and will be until that appropriate moment.

903
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,460
Platforms have not been finalized or announced. You can... It'll be done when it's done and

904
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,940
stop asking. But here's the question, though. Anyone still... Just put that on a big piece

905
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,260
of paper and fax it to any website. Granted, this will be an instant purchase for me, but,

906
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,980
I mean, do I really care anymore about... I mean, this isn't like some huge epic game

907
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:23,460
anymore, just kinda, eh, whatever. It's limping along to the finish line. You'd buy it just

908
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,900
to see how terrible it actually turns out to be. Oh, it's not gonna be... I mean, it's

909
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,540
gonna be borderline terrible. Like, Duke Nukem 3D was borderline terrible, but, um, it'll

910
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,700
be awesome. Wait a minute, Duke Nukem 3D was kinda rad. It was rad, but see, it had the

911
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,260
cops shooting hookers. It had the B movie, like, it's cool for the same reason Evil Dead

912
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,860
is cool. Yeah, that's what I meant. Let's put it that way. Well, it's also cool because

913
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,980
they use a lot of lines from Evil Dead as well. True, true, true. Alright. I don't know.

914
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,420
Well, one thing that's not cool is, uh, going down and burning things down. And, uh, what's

915
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,980
even not cool, er, what's even more not cooler is to brag about it on the internet. And,

916
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:06,500
uh, so you know for this, we've gotta give out another one of these. That's right, it's

917
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,540
another Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award. The Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award this

918
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:22,180
week goes to a user on Game Facts. And their name is Jedi Knight 12345. Jedi Knight 12345,

919
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,100
uh, made a post in the current events section of the Game Facts forums. And what he was

920
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,820
doing is he was asking the folks on the forums if he should burn down a school and a church.

921
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:42,020
And what happened a little later in the town of Palmyra, Missouri? He burned down a church.

922
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,700
And so this boy was arrested on, uh, suspected arson charges. We don't know his real name

923
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,380
because he is under the age of 18 and they withhold that kind of stuff. Uh, so we can't

924
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,140
give out the stupid award by his real name but he certainly, if he's over the age of

925
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,220
like 4, he's old enough to know better. You know what I mean? Even at that age you should

926
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,540
know better. Do we really need more reason not to go on the Game Facts forums? Seriously.

927
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,580
I feel bad for Game Facts because everybody's just using this as a reason to attack them

928
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,460
like, you know, well that's what he gets for going to Game Facts, hahaha. You know, I'm

929
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:19,940
like okay, haha. Their community was terrible long before anyone cared. Well, seriously

930
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,660
though, this idiot could have been out there anywhere, you know, on any website. I swear,

931
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,460
if any of our listeners ever do anything this stupid, I will find you and beat you up myself

932
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,260
and it will not be pleasant. Do not do, don't do stupid things and if you're thinking about

933
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,540
doing something stupid, please call someone and ask for help. Yeah, how long is it going

934
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,140
to be before someone actually cleans? And don't log onto the internet and post on a

935
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,100
forum. Pick up the phone and call 911 and turn yourself in. Seriously. But that, then

936
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,660
they wouldn't be anonymous like they are on the internet. Can't catch me, I'm on Game

937
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:58,940
Facts. Amaze Satsuma says 12345, how did you know the combination for my briefcase? By

938
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,340
the way, Jedi, as if even just asking about it wasn't bad enough, it should also be noted

939
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:10,440
that Jedi Knight 12345 went back to the forum and bragged that he had in fact burned a church

940
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:17,440
and schooled down and he posted pictures of it on Game Facts. Now, to the users of Game

941
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,800
Facts credit, other forum posters immediately went and found the local news station in this

942
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,980
area and contacted them and the authorities and all that, you know, contacted people that

943
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,340
could do something about it and turned this guy in basically. So, hooray to the Game Facts

944
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,560
users that turned this guy in, you are exempt from the stupid award this week. However,

945
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,860
Jedi Knight 12345, it's your stupid award. Congratulations, you're stupid. There you

946
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:49,860
have it. In fact, this is just like a really stupid, stupid thing to do and this just makes

947
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,700
me mad that now, you know, he's probably going to come back and it's going to get somehow

948
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,940
tied back into the fact that he was a gamer. Oh, of course. You know, oh, he played too

949
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,420
much. What's a game where you set fire to things? Is there a game where you set fire

950
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,060
to things? There's got to be. Grand Theft Auto. He played too much Grand Theft Auto.

951
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,060
Too much Crackdown? Molotov Cocktage. He played too much Crackdown. He played too much Dracula,

952
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,220
throwing, or Castlevania, throwing the holy fire and learned how to start fires. So, playing

953
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:22,220
too much WoW as a mage. Geez. So, the complete idiocy of this guy makes me angsty. He fires

954
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:36,180
a magic missile into the darkness. You know this brings on the FUs of the Week. Loki,

955
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,420
your FUs of the Week, please. My FUs of the Week goes to a headache that's coming on right

956
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,220
about now and that sucks. I fucking hate getting headaches on Sundays and it's always on Sundays,

957
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:52,700
but not having anything to do with this show, of course. It's just I get headaches on Sundays.

958
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,820
Maybe you're allergic to Sunday. I'm allergic to the holy day, I guess. Sorry to hear that.

959
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:03,620
Puppy, do you have any FUs you'd like to give this week? FUs to Insomnia, letting me get

960
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:10,620
about ten hours of sleep over the course of four nights, and FUs to the charger from my

961
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:17,620
laptop for going up and now my laptop is running on battery power until it eventually dies.

962
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,540
My FUs of the Week goes to Sears. I don't want to give too many details about purchases

963
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:28,740
I made a while ago, but oh my god, I had to go back to the store twice in one day to clear

964
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:35,740
up this issue that I was having that wasn't even my fault with Sears. Ugh, horrible. Sears

965
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,140
is on my shit list this week. I had to speak to like five different people, three on the

966
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,140
phone, two in the store. It was horrible. But the last person I spoke to, it doesn't

967
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,420
always go this way, the last person I spoke to could have fixed everything the very first

968
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:56,420
time if I talked to that person first. Freaks. Let's move on with more news. Well, if I told

969
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:02,180
you that an Oscar-nominated game was coming, or a game based off an Oscar-nominated movie

970
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:09,180
coming out soon, you probably wouldn't guess Juno as the game being... I don't know. Why

971
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,620
would they make a game based off of Juno? I don't understand it. Teaching little girls

972
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:19,660
about pregnancy adventures? I haven't seen Juno, but I hear it's about teenage pregnancy

973
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,700
or whatever. I'm not exactly sure how that makes a game. Did they make a game out of

974
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:30,700
Napoleon Dynamite? I'm not sure how they'd make a game out of that either. Juno to me

975
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,820
feels like it might be this year's Napoleon Dynamite. It's really funny now, but when

976
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:40,820
it comes out on video, there's going to be a big backlash against it. Just do wait. So,

977
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,980
I don't know. Apparently, there is a panel at DICE, the summit going on in Las Vegas

978
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:53,980
right now, during the intellectual property migration specialists. It says people are

979
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:00,980
making a game based off Juno just to cater to the casual market. And they didn't specify

980
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:08,980
really anything about the game, but apparently it was... I don't know. He said it was probably

981
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:17,740
going to be following Nexon's free-to-play business model. So, I don't know. So it would

982
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:23,740
be like little mini-games for free or something? I'm sorry. This is probably going to be about

983
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:30,740
as good as that Dirty Dancing game that came out, or possibly the Princess Bride. Ryoma

984
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:38,300
in our chat room says, Skye, Juno is a lot less stupid than Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't

985
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,260
seen Juno, so I thought Napoleon Dynamite was funny. I didn't think it was the most

986
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,780
hilarious movie ever made, but I did find some things very amusing in that movie, like

987
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:53,860
the grandma especially, you know? Make me another Questadilla. And when she got in the

988
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,180
dirt bike accident, it was really funny. Forget it. Forget it, forget it. Let's talk about

989
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,220
some other games that are coming out around the world and will start tonight in the UK,

990
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,740
because usually Jamie does those dates, but she can't tonight. So I will be doing UK dates

991
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,700
for you guys this week. Coming out in Europe, Battalion Wars 2 makes its way to the Wii

992
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,020
on the 15th, along with 8-Ball All-Stars and the DS. Castlevania, the Dracula X Chronicles

993
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,740
is a big game that came out here a little while ago. Europe, you're finally getting

994
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,820
it on the PSP on the 15th, as well as Coded Arms Contingent, also on the PSP. Cooking

995
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,340
Mama 2 finally comes out on the Nintendo DS for you guys. Not as bad of a delay, though.

996
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:36,840
We just got it here about a month ago. Cruis'n makes its way to the Wii. I'm sorry. Dragon

997
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:42,940
Ball Z, Budokai Tekenshi 3 comes out on the Wii. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Elements

998
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:49,260
comes out on the Xbox 360. Coming out on the DS, a big title, Final Fantasy XII Revenant

999
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,140
Wings, which Loki was kind enough to get me for Christmas, and I still haven't played.

1000
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,940
I'm very sorry, Loki. But I feel like I need to finish Final Fantasy XII on console first.

1001
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:04,380
I will. Soon. Multi-platform wise, you got a game called Jumper coming out on PlayStation

1002
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:12,340
2 and the Xbox 360. NBA 08 on the PlayStation 3, coming out on the Wii as well. The Destiny

1003
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:18,880
of Zorro. That sounds like it could suck. Lastly, but certainly not leastly, where would

1004
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,420
you Naruto fans be without a release for you? Naruto Ninja Destiny in the UK on the DS on

1005
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:33,420
the 15th of February. In the US, we're getting quite a few things coming out, including Lost

1006
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,780
Odyssey, that we've been seeing some pretty strange commercials for on TV. It makes it

1007
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,180
look like some sort of hippie game, I don't know. I fast-forward all commercials, so what

1008
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,580
makes it look so horrible? It's the music that they picked for. Yeah, I don't remember

1009
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:53,880
what the name was. I don't know, it's just... But it's something about White Knight talking

1010
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:00,660
backwards. Huh. Interesting. God, I wish I remembered the name of that song. I don't

1011
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,740
wish I remembered the name of that song. It's horrible. Anyways, so that's... Now you know

1012
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:11,820
I gotta look it up on YouTube, so... So that's coming out in the US on the 360. Today, actually,

1013
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,540
Professor Layton and the Curious Village made its way out onto the DS. Also this week, Conflict

1014
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:27,580
Denied Ops on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. On the PC, Penumbra, The Black Plague.

1015
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:33,860
That's coming out. Jumper, a Griffin story on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and the Wii. It's

1016
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,900
kind of a side story to the movie, which I hear the movie sucks, by the way, so... Why

1017
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:47,220
am I not surprised? Dungeon Explorer, Warriors of the Ancient Arts for PSP and DS. Dark Messiah

1018
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:56,000
of Might and Magic Elements on Xbox 360. Space Force Captains on PC. There's also a new episode

1019
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,380
of the Sam & Max game, Episode 203, The Night of the Raving Dead. That's, of course, on

1020
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:13,100
PC. Carrier Strike Force on PC. 13th Century Death of Glory. Wipeout Pulse on the PSP.

1021
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:19,100
Innocent Life of Futuristic Harvest Moon, Special Edition on PlayStation 2. Yay! Futuristic

1022
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:27,940
Harvest Moon. Yeah, it was on PSP before. RPG Maker VX on PC. And finally on PlayStation

1023
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:35,780
2, and they moved it up quite a bit from March. Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation

1024
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:42,540
2. It moved up a whole friggin' month. Here's what I love about live radio. We've got YouTube

1025
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,920
right up here. We've got the chat room to help us find things on YouTube. Here's a little

1026
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,300
piece of the Lost Odyssey TV commercial. And that funny, I mean, obviously, what horrible

1027
00:56:50,300 --> 00:57:08,020
radio, but Loki's talking about the strange audio. Oh, these are classic songs. Oh, this

1028
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:21,060
is Jefferson Airplane. That was pretty rad. White Rabbit, my Jefferson Airplane. There

1029
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:27,580
it is, right there on the side. Sorry, I am not up on my Jefferson Airplane. Okay. Also,

1030
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,740
this week, or next weekend, I want you to go get some CDs. I want you to get Jefferson

1031
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:38,900
Airplane. I want you to get Fog Hat. I want you to get some Pink Floyd, and Journey for

1032
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:45,700
good measure, because you know I can't go get some Clean's Clearwater Revival. I want

1033
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:51,740
you to smoke a big bonk. Just kidding, we don't endorse that. Some other fun stuff,

1034
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,140
of course, this is the scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff, but oh, I forgot to mention

1035
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:05,100
also the cobalt blue and black DS that came out today as well. Anyways, Go Diego Go Safari

1036
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:12,740
Rescue 1 PlayStation 2, and the Wii. Got to pick that one up. There was also a Dora the

1037
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,700
Explorer game coming out, but I don't really care what that is. Bloom Pop on the Wii. What

1038
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,540
was that parody of Dora the Explorer they had on Saturday Night Live? I don't remember

1039
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,820
that. I think I, like, wet myself laughing. It was so freaking hilarious, because, you

1040
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:34,060
know, forget it. I'll save that for another show. Anyways, Bloom Pop for the Wii. It's

1041
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:39,980
a really cheap puzzle game, so that's kind of neat. Rock Band, they're getting the stand-alone

1042
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,780
drum sets. They're supposed to be coming out this week as well, so look for those. $90

1043
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:52,940
peripherals. There's $80 peripherals. I thought it was $90 for the drum sets. No, $80. It's

1044
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:01,860
still expensive, though. Yeah. And that's it. Sorry. Alright, let's move on to Japanese

1045
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:10,620
release dates. Coming out in Japan on the 14th of February on the Xbox 360, WWE Smackdown

1046
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,900
vs. Raw 2008. I don't know how popular Rasslin' is over in Japan. I think they have their

1047
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,040
own wrestling league over there, because I've seen some YouTubage. But if you want to experience

1048
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,900
the American version, there you go. It's also coming out on PlayStation 3, by the way, and

1049
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,660
appears to be one of the bigger releases this week in Japan. There's not a lot else. It's

1050
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,580
also coming out on the Wii. But if you're not a Rasslin' fan, you can get Medal of Honor,

1051
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,820
Heroes 2. It does come out on the Nintendo Wii. By the way, there's also a bundle with

1052
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:40,740
the Wii Zapper making its way to Japan. On the PlayStation 2, Decapo! The Origin comes

1053
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:48,980
out. Another Pachinko game, Jisen Pachislot, Hisoho Selection, Salomon Kintaru, Slaughter

1054
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,780
Kintaru, Oreno Sora. Yes, that's one name. It's another Sega Pachinko game. That's all

1055
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:00,680
you need to know. Kimikiz comes out as well. Poison Pink. That sounds like it could be

1056
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:08,260
kind of fun. And another Rasslin' game, Wrestle Angels Survivor. Good price. It might be a

1057
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,820
price reduction on that. I don't know about that one. Interesting. Let's see what's coming

1058
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:18,580
out on the handhelds on the Nintendo DS. Digimon Championship. A game called Happy, Happy Clover

1059
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:28,060
comes out as well. And just in time for Valentine's Day, Otomeki Koikakume Love Revo DS comes

1060
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,180
out as well. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything of note for you

1061
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:37,540
guys over in Japan. Medal of Honor as well coming on the Sony PSP, Medal of Honor Heroes

1062
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:43,540
that is. And where would your life be without another Gundam game? Mobile Suit Gundam, Giren

1063
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:49,060
no Yabu, Axis no Koei comes out. Oh, that's a Korean date actually. It must have already

1064
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:56,620
come out in Japan. There you have it. Your Japanese release dates. Sweet. Well, if you're

1065
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:02,840
a little bit late to, say, returning your books to a library, if you happen to be in

1066
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,900
this neck of the woods here, of the story here, you actually can play DDR to possibly

1067
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:16,940
avoid late fees. Apparently, the story is of a librarian's annual patron appreciation

1068
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:23,860
day, where he lets attendees to avoid overdue fines by donating non-perishables to a local

1069
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:31,020
soup kitchen or playing a quick game of DDR. And the exact pay-for-play system, they didn't

1070
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,680
really discuss that, but a 16-year-old who was apparently in the article needed a C grade

1071
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:44,820
on her dance performance to erase a $14 fine from a record. So, that's pretty cool. Yeah,

1072
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:51,180
I wonder how high they would go for late fees to be erased. Even though I never actually

1073
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,860
went to a library in my life. That just proves that library late fees are stupid. Look, you

1074
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:02,620
maybe ought to go volunteer to do some DDR for people's late fees. Fuck that. I don't

1075
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,740
even know where this is. I'm not going to go there and play DDR for their late fees.

1076
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:13,260
It's fucking paying me money for that. It's certainly a creative method. I'll give it

1077
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:22,460
that, I guess. Also, a pretty creative game. There was a lot of people that loved Myst

1078
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,340
Online. Unfortunately, they don't have much longer to love this game because GameTap will

1079
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,900
be shutting down Myst Online in 60 days. They made the difficult decision earlier this week

1080
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:39,020
that Myst Online Uro Live will be going down in 60 days, so that's somewhere in April when

1081
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:44,220
the game will be coming down. And what's really cool is Rick Sanchez, who has actually been

1082
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,420
on our show before. He was on, I want to say about a year and a half ago. He actually posts

1083
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:53,180
on the GameTap forums and kind of had to make that very difficult post because, you know,

1084
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:58,760
like any MMO, there's rabid fans. And, you know, Myst Online is no exception. It had

1085
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,100
its share of rabid fans. And they're not happy to hear about the game going. People want

1086
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:09,300
refunds and so on and so on. MystOnline.com will stay active, you know, as a tribute to

1087
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:14,780
what was in the game. And, you know, in Rick's post, he said they were looking at, quote,

1088
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:19,460
a wide variety of possibilities for maintaining the game. He swears up and down they're not

1089
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,860
just a bunch of evil corporate types who do nothing but count pennies and wear Brooks

1090
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,340
Brothers suits. So, you know, and honestly, I don't know how many of you guys have played

1091
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:32,300
Myst Online. I checked it out a couple months ago for the sake of reviewing it on the show.

1092
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:37,580
And what I noticed about the game is that there are real live people that play the game

1093
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:42,700
in a, you know, making the story work type of capacity. For instance, if you were a new

1094
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:48,300
person, you could go to these classes in Myst Online to learn about the world of Myst. And

1095
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,700
it wasn't an automated thing. There was actually someone there. Like when I went in there,

1096
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,140
the person said, you know, hello, Sky, are you, because that's the online name I use

1097
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,660
as most of you know. The person said, hello, Sky, are you here for the class today? And

1098
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,460
I was like, yes. And they're like, okay, just take a seat over there. We'll get started

1099
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,660
soon. You know, like it's crazy. They actually have people in and I imagine that's got to

1100
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:12,260
be very expensive thing to maintain. So I say kudos to GameTap for giving it a try.

1101
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,300
And if the rest of you are pissed off, be pissed off at the fact that people didn't

1102
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,940
play it. That's why it shut down. If your MMO doesn't have enough people playing it

1103
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:27,200
to keep it, you know, running, it shuts down. In the end though, the rabid fans will find

1104
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:37,180
a way to maintain it. I've had that experience before when I played Myth a long time ago

1105
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:48,100
and when Bungie finally shut down the servers for Myth 2. It wasn't more than a month before

1106
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,740
players had brought up their own servers that Bungie actually endorsed and said, hey, you

1107
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,580
know, you're free to go ahead and play these servers now.

1108
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:02,580
We'll turn the other cheek for this one. Let's see. Josie16 in chat, chat at orangeonshooter.com

1109
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:07,660
says, Myst online was well thought through. Too bad to see it go. The problem with Myst

1110
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:12,140
online, even though they had the class and everything, I found it very hard to just get

1111
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:16,660
in and go. You know, like I think the reason why WoW, like one reason WoW is so fucking

1112
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,180
popular is that I don't know how many of you have sit down to play it, you know, despite

1113
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:24,420
how you feel about the game, but you can get up and running in World of Warcraft relatively

1114
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,820
quickly. You know, there's kind of a learning curve as you level from levels 1 to 10. You

1115
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,700
know, that's why people are like, oh, you can get to level 10 in an hour. That's because

1116
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,460
level 1 to 10 is really the learning curve for noobs and it really walks you through

1117
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,340
the game. You know, and I have the same bitch as Final Fantasy XI. I think if Final Fantasy

1118
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,580
XI didn't have the Final Fantasy name in front of it, that was a very hard game to

1119
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,500
just get up and running in, you know, to kind of figure out. Remember when we first bought

1120
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,780
Final Fantasy XI, Loki, we bought it like the day it came out on the PC. It was back

1121
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,700
when we were living together. We were so lost the first day. I didn't realize that the

1122
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,700
world extended beyond the first like little area. I was like, when I went there and there

1123
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:04,380
was like a whole like, you know, the plat, was it the Lathine Plateau or whatever. I'm

1124
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:09,540
like, holy crap. And then like later on when you're playing the game, you're like, oh

1125
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,900
wow, this world's even bigger. I'm gonna kill bunnies for the rest of my life. This

1126
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,340
is fun. And then like you go, then you go into, what's the thing after, it's Ronfro

1127
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:22,300
is the first area. Then you go into Lathine Plateau and you go into Lathine Plateau and

1128
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,820
you try to kill a bunny there and they just murder you. You're like, I just got raped

1129
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:33,340
by a bunny. Why do you hate me so much? Oh, now I remember. That's right. I'm so glad

1130
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:41,860
I didn't have to deal with that. That game was fun. I miss it. But not really. Alright.

1131
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:47,420
One game I'm probably not gonna miss either is Midway's brand new, this is Vegas. And

1132
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:53,340
apparently if you're too, I don't know, poor to go to Vegas to be a whore or to gamble,

1133
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:59,220
you can do it in this game. So that's awesome. They didn't really say what it was that you

1134
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:04,500
would be doing in this. Apparently you would be able to live out your fantasies in Vegas

1135
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:12,420
by fighting, gambling, driving, and partying. Strangely no mention of hookers. Well, I don't

1136
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:20,100
know, in the trailer though, there was hooker-like people. But yeah, so this is Vegas coming

1137
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:27,620
to Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. You know, I'm just, I'm wondering if people are going to start

1138
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:37,660
doing this is spot on. This is Vegas. I'm sure it's somewhere on YTMND already. I'm

1139
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:43,340
sure it's already there. I don't know. It's a weird idea for a game, but... Well, here's

1140
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:48,480
something that will be coming out soon, and this is really not a surprise to anyone who

1141
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,380
has played the game Puzzle Quest or one of its thousand ports. It's out on every freaking

1142
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:58,600
system out there. But it is a great game. I mean, really, it kind of took a great idea,

1143
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,380
which is like, you know, bejeweled, and just put a whole new spin on it that made it even

1144
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:08,620
better. Puzzle Quest is just great, and Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel. It

1145
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:14,740
was a press release put out this week from D3. It was mentioning the forthcoming sequel

1146
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:19,460
to the game. Here's the quote from the press release. The company will also be releasing

1147
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,660
video games based on Artiman's popular Shaun the Sheep character in 2008, alongside the

1148
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:29,820
eagerly awaited follow-ups to the best-selling Ben 10 and Puzzle Quest. Now, see, I don't

1149
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:36,340
know what I'm more excited about. Sequel to Puzzle Quest or Shaun the Sheep? I've never

1150
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,660
fucking heard of it, but that sounds pretty awesome, I gotta say.

1151
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:44,140
Sheep. And I don't remember Ben 10 being that popular, but okay.

1152
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:49,340
Well, apparently it was popular enough for me to make a live-action movie about, even

1153
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:52,380
though the only reason I know that is because I watch too much Cartoon Network.

1154
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,180
Maybe something that's more popular in another country, I don't know. But I've never heard

1155
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,460
of it personally, so there you go.

1156
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,500
Who knows what 12-year-olds are watching these days, other than Hannah Montana?

1157
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:09,300
Okay. I'm sure this, don't get me started on how fucking nuts it is that like, the theaters

1158
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:13,700
are like packed with little girls and their moms, soon to see Hannah Montana. Like, you

1159
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,940
know that movie is like crushing everything. And I hear people talking about it at work

1160
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,940
all the time.

1161
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,620
It's not a movie, it's a recording of a concert.

1162
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,700
I know, it's crazy.

1163
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,700
It's not a movie.

1164
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:28,700
We want to talk about how the DS prints money. Dude, Miley Cyrus has money coming at her

1165
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,700
ass, okay?

1166
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:37,020
That's it. I wonder when she's going to do a cover of her dad's achy breaky heart, or

1167
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,020
duet.

1168
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,020
Nice.

1169
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:47,460
I'm sure this is pure coincidence that I have this story, but apparently Mastiff has licensed

1170
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:54,060
the rights to the Major League Eating, I didn't even know there was Major League Eating, but

1171
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,540
apparently they're going to make a Major League Eating game. The game will play out like a

1172
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:06,540
fighting game, and it will show people on screen eating. Using, you will have a mastery

1173
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,820
of offensive defensive weapons, just like watching this show on Justin TV. You get to

1174
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,820
watch people eat.

1175
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:21,820
Hey, I am having dinner, okay? Whatever. I'm not like, oh, it's the fish! Mmm, food good!

1176
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,060
You should do that one day on the show, though.

1177
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,060
You really should.

1178
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:29,980
So, you will have offensive and defensive weapons, including burps, belches, and mustard

1179
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,980
gas.

1180
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:35,060
This sounds like the ultimate small power-up.

1181
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,980
This sounds like the ultimate, like, twelve-year-old boy game.

1182
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,980
Teehee fart!

1183
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:45,860
You know, like, seriously, that was horrible. And, of course, the technical mastery necessary

1184
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:51,900
to avoid emptying one's stomach in doodly colored reversals of fortune. As they like

1185
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
to put it.

1186
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,900
Wow.

1187
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
Yeah.

1188
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,100
There was this, I don't think it was worth the effort to even make that eloquent.

1189
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,380
Really, are you that desperate for licenses? Well, it is Mastiff, so, you know, I guess

1190
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:11,500
so. I mean, they just came out with a Top Gun DS game, like, not too long ago. A little

1191
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,500
late.

1192
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:18,300
So, last week we had Major Wee, and this week we have Major Eating. That's nice. You'd

1193
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,340
think it would go the other way around. That's all I have to say.

1194
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:27,580
God damn, if this isn't a story that won't ever go away as, Apple's getting into gaming!

1195
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,660
Oh my God, Apple's getting into gaming.

1196
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:34,260
Hey, Newsflash. Apple's kind of already, well, A, Apple went into gaming a long time ago

1197
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,660
and didn't do Too Hot. Pippin, hello. Apple's already, like, they're getting their big toe,

1198
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,580
like, they're putting their big toe in the water and saying, hmm, me with. Like, they've

1199
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:47,680
got some pretty awesome games on the iPod now, like Pagle on the iPod. I don't know

1200
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,020
if I've officially reviewed it on the show or whatever, but Pagle on the iPod's pretty

1201
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:54,240
awesome. Like, that's the system that game was made for, you know. That's a pretty awesome

1202
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,180
game on the iPod. And, Faze, you know, basically Guitar Hero for your iPod, you know, of sorts.

1203
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,540
Guitar Hero? What are you talking about?

1204
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,540
Well, because, you know, you have to.

1205
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,020
It's not Guitar Hero, it's Amplitude.

1206
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,660
Okay, whatever, it's Amplitude. But, you know, sadly, more people probably know what I'm

1207
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,780
talking about when I talk about Guitar Hero. So.

1208
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,500
When we need to educate them.

1209
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,300
Hitstun in chess is apparently the iPod version of Pagle is great. It really is. I think Pagle's

1210
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,100
probably the best game you can get on the iPod right now, honestly. You know, and I

1211
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,140
love Sonic the Hedgehog and all that stuff, too, but Pagle, just because of the nature

1212
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:29,140
of, you know, how you rotate the gun to fire down the, it's like, imagine if Plinko was

1213
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:34,460
a game. That's basically what Pagle is. And you can rotate the little gun with the dial.

1214
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:37,020
It works perfectly. So.

1215
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,620
We need a, like, online version of Price is Right the game. That would be awesome.

1216
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,620
That would be kind of rad. Anyhow.

1217
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,940
Use the touch wheel to spin the big wheel.

1218
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:50,180
Well, hold on. We got to rail. We went from Apple to talking about Price is Right. A trademark

1219
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:55,580
apparently was filed on February 5th and now has the room rails going again because Apple

1220
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:02,580
has updated its trademark to now include toys, games, and playthings, namely handheld units

1221
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,460
for playing electronic games, handheld units for playing video games, stand-alone video

1222
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:11,020
game machines, electronic games other than those adapted for use of television receivers

1223
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:16,500
only, LCD game machines, electronic educational game machines, toys, namely battery-powered

1224
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,940
computer games.

1225
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:24,140
I seem to recall earlier this year I made a prediction on the show, or I should say

1226
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:27,980
late last year, that somebody was going to step up and challenge Nintendo's dominance

1227
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,260
in the handheld market and it wasn't going to be Sony or Nintendo. Of course at the time

1228
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:35,580
I think I said it wasn't going to be Apple either, but two out of three ain't bad. This

1229
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,620
could be. It could be.

1230
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:42,060
This is going to be such an abortion of a game system. It's not even funny. I mean,

1231
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:46,020
seriously, this is from the guys that thought, you know what, having a CD-ROM drive in our

1232
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,420
laptop, that would be stupid. What are we thinking? I mean, this is going to be a game

1233
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,100
system that's not going to have a cartridge slot or anywhere to put the games in. You're

1234
01:13:55,100 --> 01:14:01,700
going to have to download the Wi-Fi from your computer or some shit. Lame! They don't understand.

1235
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,060
They're just going to make it pink and pretty and stupid idiots will buy it.

1236
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,420
Brace yourself. Brace yourself.

1237
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,660
Withholding justice.

1238
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:12,300
I am agreeing with Loki. Me of all people.

1239
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,420
And you are an Apple fanboy of the highest caliber.

1240
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,460
I do not think that Apple, I think they got lucky with the iPhone jumping into a completely

1241
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:26,760
new market, but they, I think if they try to get into gaming, they're going to fail.

1242
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:32,900
I just don't, style and design is not going to win when it's the software that sells the

1243
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:32,900
games.

1244
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,540
And I'm not necessarily talking about the MacBook Air and stuff like that, just that.

1245
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:44,240
I'm just saying they choose to go aesthetics over functionality for a lot of stuff. And

1246
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,260
I don't know. I mean, that works for some people, I guess, but the problem is I don't

1247
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:52,300
think it's going to work for a console system or it's going to work for a handheld system

1248
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,260
because they're going to want to change it constantly. I mean, you know, the PlayStation

1249
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:03,460
3 does the same damn thing, but still, you can't. It's just going to get confusing and

1250
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,060
they're going to want to do a ton of different things. It's going to be like the PSP, but

1251
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:09,900
they're going to change it a lot more.

1252
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:14,560
And it's not like you can release a new system like you can release a new version of an iPod

1253
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,580
and it'll still have the same technology and functionality. Because they'll end up releasing

1254
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:24,940
something new six months later and it won't be able to be backwards compatible with the

1255
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,580
previous games.

1256
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,340
And, you know, go ahead and try to take on Nintendo. I mean, sure, they need someone

1257
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,220
to do it, but, you know, you had other people try, too, like Gizmondo. They thought that

1258
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,580
they could take on Nintendo and that failed.

1259
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,660
This is all I'm going to say, is that I will withhold judgment until it comes out, like,

1260
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,020
you know, a good critic will. You know, you can't really judge it, tell the final things

1261
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:50,020
out. But I wouldn't be surprised if you see the iPod go a little further into gaming.

1262
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,420
Like, I could totally see them putting out, like, a controller or something that plugs

1263
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,420
into the iPod.

1264
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,180
That makes more sense, I don't think.

1265
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,900
But I think that's as far as it's going to go. I don't see them, like, releasing a whole

1266
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,980
new thing. I see it as some type of extension or enhancement for an iPod. That's it.

1267
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:09,460
Yeah, and, I mean, the best stuff, the best games that will ever come out for an iPod

1268
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:15,780
will probably be made by random people, not by Apple, that use, like, the iPod Touch's

1269
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,100
touchscreen functionality.

1270
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:22,180
Which, apparently, PopCap might be it. Which makes sense, because the type of games that

1271
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:26,300
PopCap puts out is perfect for the iPod audience, right? Am I right?

1272
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,300
Yeah, casual stuff.

1273
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,780
Yeah. So there you have it.

1274
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:30,660
Puzzle Pirates on an iPhone, hmm.

1275
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:35,260
All right. Anyhow, part A is about over and we're going to be getting into part B tonight,

1276
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,460
which, by the way, if I haven't mentioned yet, in part B tonight, I've mentioned this

1277
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,300
a lot, actually. We're going to be playing a brand new game we've never played before

1278
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:47,220
here on the show. Everybody in chat can play and possibly win tonight. It's going to be

1279
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:52,260
amazing. But before we get to that in part B, we have to do one more segment here in

1280
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:57,580
part A. And for that, we have to bring somebody special on the line.

1281
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,180
Oh, caller, are you there on the line?

1282
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,180
Yo.

1283
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:04,140
Hey, Jamie, how are you feeling?

1284
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,500
I'm feeling, um, stuff that I can't say on the air.

1285
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,860
I see. So you're just kind of feeling a little, uh, you know, a little sick this week, basically?

1286
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,580
It's viral.

1287
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:20,340
Ugh. That's never any fun. Well, sorry to hear that you're sick, but you'll be back

1288
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,340
next week, right?

1289
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:25,780
Yes, I will. I didn't want to, I just didn't want to get you guys sick. I don't care about

1290
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,780
my co-workers so much.

1291
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,780
Yeah.

1292
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:31,540
I'm just kidding. Because I got it from my co-workers, so.

1293
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:36,420
Oh, snap. So you're going to go back and get some more of them sick then, right?

1294
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,060
No, I figured if they weren't going to get sick, they would have already gotten sick

1295
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,060
from it.

1296
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:43,820
Alright. Well, anyway, Jamie, you know, we just couldn't do this segment without you.

1297
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,660
We're at the end of part A, as you may know from listening or what have you. We've got

1298
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,340
to do the Classic Game of the Week, so let's get in the music.

1299
01:17:50,340 --> 01:18:00,140
And Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the listeners to celebrate this

1300
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
week?

1301
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:08,100
The Classic Game of the Week is one of my personal favorites. It's Ys III, where it's

1302
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:15,100
from Ys, which is, you know, being Ys III, it is the third in the series. So this one's

1303
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,580
actually different from the other two. I don't know if anyone else was a big fan of it. If

1304
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:25,340
I'm right, this was out on MSX. It was, I got used to the Super Nintendo version, but

1305
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:33,500
it was also out on PC Engine. In fact, I've actually got the Duo version of it somewhere.

1306
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,140
But the special thing about this one is that it's sort of a departure in gameplay from

1307
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,140
the previous ones.

1308
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,140
Very cool.

1309
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,140
How?

1310
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,140
Sorry, go ahead.

1311
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:50,620
Well, with this one is that the previous ones were the whole top-down, you know, old-school

1312
01:18:50,620 --> 01:19:01,420
Zelda-style overhead view. And this one had primarily side-scrolling. You'd have to actually

1313
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:06,580
mash a button to swing the sword and attack, and you also had rings that you could equip

1314
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:12,220
for different special effects. So instead of having, like, magic, you would use your

1315
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:17,940
ring power. And it was a pretty cool game. It was very, I thought, unique for the time

1316
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:23,580
and the type of RPG that it was. But it also had, like, some really fantastic music. I

1317
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,940
love this game a whole lot.

1318
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:35,980
Let's take a listen to the music real quick. Now, one thing I should say about this game,

1319
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:40,900
a very common mispronunciation of the title, right, because it looks like Y's, because

1320
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,980
it's just the letter Y.

1321
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:42,980
It's Y's.

1322
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,980
Yeah, it's Y's. So.

1323
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:51,980
Yeah. In fact, if you actually look at the name, the Japanese title romanized, it says

1324
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,980
Isu.

1325
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,980
So.

1326
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,980
Very cool.

1327
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:55,980
Does that help?

1328
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,700
Now, the most recent Y's game, if I'm not mistaken, because I think we brought it up

1329
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:02,260
on a previous edition of the show, they ported, or I guess they made a new version of this

1330
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,260
game for the PSP, right?

1331
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:12,660
There's, if I'm right, I think it was Y's V, technically, the arc of Mappus, Mappus

1332
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:20,140
3. And then there was a Windows one that was like a remake of Y's V, which was the arc

1333
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,140
of Spelcona.

1334
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,140
Wow.

1335
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:27,020
It was more like an expansion of Y's V.

1336
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,980
I gotcha. So basically, you know, this game is so classic that it still continues to live

1337
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,980
on today in sequels.

1338
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:37,580
Pretty much. I mean, and anyone who's got, you know, Super Nintendo, if you can find

1339
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,220
it and should be able to find it really cheap still, I recommend taking it up. It's a fun

1340
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,220
game.

1341
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:46,260
All right. Maybe someday a virtual console? Who knows?

1342
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,300
I would hope so, but we'd probably get Ys I and II before we got Ys III.

1343
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,340
I guess that's true. All right.

1344
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,340
Yeah.

1345
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:58,060
Well, there you have it, boys and girls, your classic game of the week, Wanderers from Ys,

1346
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,940
the third game in the series. The music you were hearing was from the MSX version, but

1347
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:06,660
you can find it also on Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx, if I'm not mistaken?

1348
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,660
Yep.

1349
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:08,660
Very cool.

1350
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,660
Yep, it was a Turbo CD.

1351
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,900
Well, Jamie, we look forward to having you back in the house next week. Rest up and feel

1352
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,700
better and say hi to Dan for us.

1353
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,780
Oh, well, he's in there playing Smash Brothers.

1354
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:21,420
All right. Oh, you guys have the new Smash Brothers, right?

1355
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:26,820
Yeah. Well, we don't have it. A friend of ours brought it over and so they've been going

1356
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:34,340
through the whole adventure mode in there with the amazingly compatible team of Samus

1357
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,340
and Pikachu.

1358
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,340
Who would have thought?

1359
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:45,740
What was it? Team Bishonen. They have the Bishonen Assault Squad, which is Pit and Link.

1360
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,140
Wow. That sounds kind of fun.

1361
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,100
And then the Fire Emblem team.

1362
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,260
So do you approve of Super Smash Brothers Brawl after seeing it last week in studio

1363
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,460
and experiencing it at your own house this week?

1364
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,460
I quite approve.

1365
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,620
All right. Very nice. There you have it. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, we're going to go

1366
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:03,820
ahead and take our break and a brand new game for our listeners in Part B tonight. I'm sorry

1367
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,540
you don't get to hear it, but we'll fill you in afterwards, okay?

1368
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,540
Oh, I see how it is. You wait until I'm out and then you do the new stuff.

1369
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:14,420
Well, because we have to fill time because you're not here to give us your viewpoint

1370
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:17,260
and interrupt Loki when he's talking. Just kidding.

1371
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,260
I'm just going to cry.

1372
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:23,780
Aw, Dark Soccer, we love you. You should play in the game tonight. It would be funny if

1373
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,780
you win.

1374
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,940
I can't ever get the show to pull up on my laptop.

1375
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,380
Aw, that's a bummer. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, take care. We'll see you next week,

1376
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,380
okay?

1377
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,380
Okay. Bye.

1378
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,380
All right. Bye-bye.

1379
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,380
Auf Wiedersehen.

1380
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:41,100
All right. That's going to do it for this Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio. We're

1381
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,820
going to take a quick break, though, and we'll be back with plenty more. However, here's

1382
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:50,660
the deal. I got to close all my chat windows here. We're going to be asking a qualifying

1383
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:57,460
question to qualify for tonight's game in Part B. Basically, one contestant will be

1384
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,380
coming in via the Skype line. So I'm going to give you a question, very similar type

1385
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,500
of question you might hear in tonight's game.

1386
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,380
And if you think you know the answer, you're going to send me the answer in a private message

1387
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:11,500
in the chat room. If you don't know how to send me a private message, ask somebody. And

1388
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,860
you are going to send me your phone number. And by sending me your phone number, that

1389
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,860
is consent that you approve of us calling you, please make sure you are by your phone

1390
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:23,940
in the next hour or so, and that we don't get any surprises of Mommy or Daddy picking

1391
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:28,820
it up. So don't submit an answer to this if you do not have control over your own phone.

1392
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,660
So here it is. This is the qualifier question. You're going to send me the correct answer

1393
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:37,140
to this question, and then you are going to send me your phone number if you want to play,

1394
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,220
and we'll pick somebody randomly out of those that submit the correct phone number. So here

1395
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,100
it is. And I'm putting this in the podcast because I felt those listening in the podcast

1396
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:52,100
might want to play along. Here is the qualifying question. What game is this music from?

1397
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:59,100
I wouldn't yell it out in chat or you are giving it away for everybody. Here are the

1398
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,720
correct answers. I'm sorry, one of these is the correct answer. Here are the answers you

1399
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:12,720
have to choose from. A. Nightmare on Elm Street. B. Halloween. C. Friday the 13th.
