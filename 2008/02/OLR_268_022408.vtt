WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.060
Today, February 24th, 2008, community games come to Xbox Live and Zune, Microsoft officially

00:20.060 --> 00:25.140
abandons HD DVD, and Nintendo reveals that there is much more in store for the Wii Balance

00:25.140 --> 00:32.520
board.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.480
Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.520
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.520 --> 00:42.520
lifestyle.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.360
Yes, we are back from an unexpected vacation last week, we'll tell you more about what's

00:46.360 --> 00:50.380
going down in just a little bit, but it wouldn't be a show if I couldn't introduce my lovely

00:50.380 --> 00:55.480
co-host over there as the one and only Happiest Bunny on the Farm, Ms. Dark Sakura, Jamie

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
Summers.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
Yo.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
I'm satiated.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.480
You're satiated?

01:00.480 --> 01:01.480
That's good.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
Yes.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.680
I've had a mostly unsatisfactory day as far as things to dine on.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.960
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.760
I've had a power bar and ice cream until this year.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
That's not healthy.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
That's all we had.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Oh, sorry to hear it.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.440
So, I'm going to be going to the store tomorrow.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
How about you, Loki?

01:22.440 --> 01:24.080
Are you well fed today?

01:24.080 --> 01:28.320
I just had McDonald's because it was on the way.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.840
The one and only tech master, Loki.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
You always have McDonald's.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
I don't always have McDonald's.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.840
You use the spice up once in a while.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.560
Try Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, oh, you did have Subway.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
I don't like Carl's Jr.

01:37.560 --> 01:42.440
Carl's Jr. is actually pretty nasty, but Jack in the Box, that's also pretty nasty.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.520
McDonald's, it's nasty, but in smaller portions, so I don't know.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.600
Burger King, now that's the only fast food that's not so nasty.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.760
I haven't had Burger King in a long time.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.760
I don't know.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.360
There's one really, really good thing that they would occasionally have on their menu.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.360
What's that?

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
I actually miss.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
What's that?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.640
Those chicken sandwiches that were on the long buns.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
Oh, okay.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.640
You had that Italian one.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
Oh, my God, that was so good.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
You know, it's so funny.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.120
We're a video game podcast, yet we keep talking about food.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.120
It's like the two go hand-in-hand.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
I'm not sure.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.520
It's because our modern society is patterned around food and feeding.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.840
Well, hello to everybody in our chat room at chat.orangelaundryradio.com.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.240
Also we're live on Justin TV with our webcam, and they have a chat room as well.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
We try to keep an eye on it.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.600
It's justintv.com slash orangelaundryradio that always has the video archive of our shows.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.960
You can see our smiling faces, or tonight, according to one of our chatters, frowning

02:34.960 --> 02:37.120
face.

02:37.120 --> 02:42.720
It's a comment from a NYR fan in chat, chat.orangelaundry.com, says, Rob sounds sad this week.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
I'm not sad.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
I'm just sick.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.880
If it's not one thing, it's another.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.400
Last week, we weren't here with the show.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.840
What happened is that I was in Long Beach.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.800
William and I were away for the weekend.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.600
We went to the Star Trek tour in Long Beach.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.600
Shut up.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.600
Don't laugh.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.600
It was awesome.

02:58.600 --> 03:02.680
But what wasn't awesome was my car breaking down over the grapevine on the way there.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.480
So I had to find a mechanic in Long Beach Saturday morning, paid him like $450 to fix

03:07.480 --> 03:08.480
my car.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.600
But they did do a lot on my car.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.280
And then as I was driving home, one of the stinking lights came on again.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.240
Something's wrong with something in the oil, and I would explain it, but it would bore

03:17.240 --> 03:18.240
you to tears.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.320
I've probably told like 50 different people about what's going on.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.340
So needless to say, I couldn't rush home on Sunday, and I made it back late.

03:24.340 --> 03:26.680
So unfortunately, we didn't have a show on Sunday.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.980
And now this week, I'm sick.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.240
So if it's not one thing, it's another.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.920
And then we're starting late tonight, I mean, podcast listeners, you guys don't hear a difference.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.580
But for those listening live tonight, we're about 15 minutes late because the Wi-Fi in

03:37.580 --> 03:40.620
studio wasn't working and some of our computers couldn't get online.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.000
So it's just February's broken.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I want a refund.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.240
And then Jamie wasn't here two weeks ago.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.040
I mean, February's just broken.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.040
That's because I was sick.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.040
I know.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
It was nasty, too.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.200
And then we're up against the Oscars tonight.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.200
Yeah, fuck them.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
Oscars suck.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.200
But who cares?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
Who cares about the Oscars?

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
It's not even a good name.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.320
It's not got people sucking each other's, anyway.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.360
Why do they call the Oscars anyway?

04:01.360 --> 04:02.360
Who's Oscar?

04:02.360 --> 04:05.280
It's the award, but it's actually the Academy Awards.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.120
Yeah, you could probably read it on Wikipedia.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.240
Why did they name it after somebody named Oscar?

04:09.240 --> 04:11.080
I think it's short for something.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.720
Oscar is short for something?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.440
I don't know.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.920
Let's just talk about our gaming week, shall we?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.800
Let's be better than those Oscars.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
How was your gaming week?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.240
What games would you give an Oscar to this week, Dark Soccer?

04:22.240 --> 04:27.200
Did some Half-Life 2 and lots of Ragnarok.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.360
Now I have another character over 100.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.360
Rebirth, by the way.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
Addict.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
So.

04:35.360 --> 04:45.440
And I played, I looked at my copy of Imagine Babies, laughed and put it back up.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.320
And then, although it spawned an interesting conversation about whether or not you could

04:49.320 --> 04:52.080
raise them like Pokemon.

04:52.080 --> 04:56.760
And I thought it was kind of silly.

04:56.760 --> 05:04.420
And then there was also some more burnout going on in my house, but I think that Dan's

05:04.420 --> 05:05.420
getting tired of it.

05:05.420 --> 05:10.680
I think it'd be cool, though, if you could raise them like Pokemon and then have them

05:10.680 --> 05:12.960
fight in underground baby cage matches.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.680
That would be great.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.920
It'd be like cockfighting, but with babies, put little razor blades on their feet.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.280
The babies couldn't actually fight because they don't have any motor coordination when

05:24.280 --> 05:26.000
they're that little.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.040
That's why you pop them up on crack and then, you know.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.320
You have a one-year-old battle when they're old enough to walk.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.320
Yeah.

05:33.320 --> 05:38.380
And then I played Wedding the Game, which was me just sitting there going, how much

05:38.380 --> 05:41.400
more can I drink?

05:41.400 --> 05:43.400
That's about it.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.420
Let's see, this week I played a few things.

05:46.420 --> 05:51.480
I got around to playing some Lost Odyssey, and that game is pretty awesome.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.280
Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy VIII, just not necessarily, well, I guess a little bit

05:56.280 --> 06:00.520
like the gameplay, but more of just the environment reminds me of Final Fantasy VIII.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.660
But it's good, and I like the game.

06:03.660 --> 06:09.960
And I played more Burnout, Paradise, because it's available, and I don't know.

06:09.960 --> 06:14.480
Mainly this entire weekend, or actually the entire week for that matter, I've been trying

06:14.480 --> 06:21.280
to get this other 360 of mine to work, and it's not three-ringed anymore, but it freezes

06:21.280 --> 06:24.280
up every now and then.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.680
It was freezing up after about 30 seconds when I take it to work, however before that

06:28.680 --> 06:30.760
it would run for like nine hours straight.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.760
Just fine.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.320
So, I got really frustrated with that, but I think I may have figured out what it was.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.040
Maybe it's allergic to your job.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.560
No, well, I think it would be.

06:39.560 --> 06:47.000
I had these screws in it that were too large, so it was causing the board to bend too much.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.200
So I replaced them with some different stuff.

06:49.200 --> 06:56.520
I did a 12-volt mod on the fan, and also put heat sinks on the different chips in there,

06:56.520 --> 07:01.840
and made heat sinks out of pennies and aluminum tape for the bottom of the board.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.840
So hopefully with all that stuff done, it should work.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.540
If not, I've already soldered in a fan connector for additional fans, and I just found my own

07:09.540 --> 07:16.840
Dremel today, so I can cut the case open to put a 120mm fan on it.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.720
Other things I've been playing.

07:19.720 --> 07:25.040
I actually was trying out, and we'll get to some of this stuff later, the XNA community

07:25.040 --> 07:29.460
games, and they had a few that were pretty cool, some that really sucked.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.120
One of which that was pretty cool was the dishwasher.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.800
I knew it would be the dishwasher.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
That game was awesome.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.040
The minute I played that game, I was like, this is Loki's dream game right here.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.880
This is not my dream game, but it totally could be a TV series or something like that.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.480
It was just really, really cool.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.520
Something you would see on Adult Swim.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.120
But absolutely bloody game.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.920
It kind of reminds me a little bit also of Alien Hominid or something like that.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.800
That's the exact same thing I thought.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.920
That's so funny.

07:56.920 --> 08:02.040
But less shooting, more slashing with swords and stuff.

08:02.040 --> 08:09.280
Other things I tried, I tried Gummy Car or Jelly Car, where the fuck it was called.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.440
It was okay.

08:10.440 --> 08:15.440
I didn't really, I mean it was a neat idea, but not executed too well.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.040
You know what makes Jelly Car hilarious is when you realize that all the noises or some

08:20.040 --> 08:25.280
guy doing it in his microphone, like, boop boop boop boop boop, meow meow meow meow.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.280
That's great.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.280
I'm sorry.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.880
I laughed my ass off playing Jelly Car.

08:28.880 --> 08:33.640
It's very customizable, with its little completely different looks, like you can play the blueprint

08:33.640 --> 08:37.320
looking things or the, you can kind of completely change the look of the game and the options.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Check it out.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
Oh, I didn't even play with the options.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.760
Oh yeah, you can mess with the options and make the game look completely different.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
It's great.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
That's cool.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.240
Other than that though, it was alright.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.920
Some of the levels seemed kind of broken, but whatever.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.040
Then there was Culture, which was neat.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.800
I don't know, it's an interesting puzzle game, I guess, with flowers.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.920
Pretty flowers.

08:57.920 --> 09:05.000
And then, gosh, I played that, was it Little Gamers, I think it was called?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.100
That was okay.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.480
That's actually just based off of a webcomic, I guess.

09:09.480 --> 09:15.520
And it was okay, but it just reminded me a lot of, like, there wasn't a lot of movement

09:15.520 --> 09:16.520
or dodging you can do.

09:16.520 --> 09:21.120
It was just kind of shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, and very bloody.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.560
But hey, that's cool.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.980
And I don't know, that was pretty much it though.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.160
There were some games that they showed off at Game Developers Conference that I wish

09:31.160 --> 09:39.240
were on there, like iSheep or, what was it, there was a dancing one, like a breakdancing

09:39.240 --> 09:40.240
thing.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.320
Now, wait a minute, did you, and I'm sorry, I ran in the house and you were talking about

09:43.320 --> 09:46.680
your game a week, but I didn't hear anything about N. Didn't you play N this week on X

09:46.680 --> 09:47.680
Motion Life?

09:47.680 --> 09:48.680
No.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.680
I thought you loved that game.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.440
I love N, but I haven't gotten a chance to download it, and I really, I mean, I've played

09:53.440 --> 09:59.000
it before, so, you know, it's not, it's not like I'm, I don't know, I don't know what

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
it is.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.320
Also, finally, I was going to say I played Space Invaders Extreme, I actually was playing

10:04.320 --> 10:07.740
that this afternoon, and awesome game.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.240
Really needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game or something like that, and it's coming out

10:11.240 --> 10:15.840
the DS and on PSP as well, so, absolutely cool.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.600
All the stuff in the game kind of goes with the music, like when you're firing and stuff,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.640
it's all in time with the music, and, you know, stuff kind of remixes a little bit,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.720
a little like Musaguchi and stuff.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.240
They have little bonus things that go in there, plus the backgrounds are all really flashy

10:29.240 --> 10:30.240
and stuff.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.360
It'll be cool.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.120
Definitely worth picking up when it comes out.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.760
So you're all done with your gaming week?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.760
Yes.

10:36.760 --> 10:41.400
Then I will move on to mine, because I just want to say I did play N this week on Xbox

10:41.400 --> 10:45.360
360, and it was kind of cool, well, at least I should clarify, I only played the demo,

10:45.360 --> 10:49.280
I didn't play the full version, I don't want to give the false impression or anything,

10:49.280 --> 10:53.400
but I played the demo of N, because I remember Loki spoke very highly of this game, and I

10:53.400 --> 10:57.560
remember playing it a little bit on the free web thing or whatever.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.380
Here's the problem I had with N, is that I played it after I played those Xbox community

11:01.380 --> 11:04.560
games, and I was kind of playing it going, you know what, I don't think I want to spend

11:04.560 --> 11:08.360
$10 on this, especially after just playing those other things that are potentially, I

11:08.360 --> 11:11.440
mean I guess we don't know much about pricing, I think we'll get into it later in the show,

11:11.440 --> 11:15.520
but potentially these other games are going to be free or, you know, very low cost.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.220
And if you haven't tried those Xbox Live community games, I recommend doing that, since they

11:19.220 --> 11:21.400
are timed demos.

11:21.400 --> 11:26.000
But I think, and it's kind of fun, I just think $800 is the wrong price point, I think

11:26.000 --> 11:29.120
$400 would have been a little more appropriate, I probably would have bought it for $400,

11:29.120 --> 11:34.160
especially when you consider it's based off a free web game, just, I don't know, I feel

11:34.160 --> 11:38.800
like I've played a lot of free games on the web like it, although there's a certain sense

11:38.800 --> 11:42.800
of humor to N that I think is really funny, like I watch, I like watching a little stick

11:42.800 --> 11:47.440
guy get blown to bits, and it certainly has a very, you know, kind of action pace, I just,

11:47.440 --> 11:51.280
I don't know, in this day of those microtransactions, you really kind of think about every point,

11:51.280 --> 11:54.200
and I just don't think it was worth $800.

11:54.200 --> 11:59.520
Something that was money well spent, I am madly in love with Lost Odyssey, this is the

11:59.520 --> 12:03.580
game I have totally been waiting for on the 360, and I know, you know, I'm going to admit,

12:03.580 --> 12:07.600
I am kind of biased, well I don't want to say I'm biased, but I definitely have a preference

12:07.600 --> 12:11.520
towards Japanese RPGs, that's no big secret, those are the type of games I like, I don't

12:11.520 --> 12:16.400
play a lot of sports games, I like these type of games, and so, you know, the Xbox 360 has

12:16.400 --> 12:22.240
been sorely lacking in this department, we've had Blue Dragon, which was, eh, it was okay,

12:22.240 --> 12:28.360
but it wasn't great, it was a good game, not a great game, and then we had Enchanted Arms,

12:28.360 --> 12:33.120
same thing, decent, I think better than a lot of people gave it credit for, but it started

12:33.120 --> 12:37.960
to get a little monotonous towards the end, Lost Odyssey, I'm loving it, like, it's tearing

12:37.960 --> 12:41.760
me away from wow, which is saying something, you know, because you hear about how much

12:41.760 --> 12:46.160
I've been playing World of Warcraft lately and doing this stuff, I cannot put down Lost

12:46.160 --> 12:49.840
Odyssey, and it's funny because I've been reading reviews, because I'm kind of curious,

12:49.840 --> 12:52.440
I usually don't read a lot of reviews on the internet, but I was kind of curious what the

12:52.440 --> 12:56.200
critics think of Lost Odyssey, and I was very surprised to see on Metacritic that the game

12:56.200 --> 13:00.040
only has like a 76 or something like that, I am shocked!

13:00.040 --> 13:06.040
This is like an old school RPG, you know, it's so old, everyone's complaining that it's

13:06.040 --> 13:11.040
like very old, but yet when you go back to the RPGs of the past, like all the Final Fantasy

13:11.040 --> 13:15.520
games, they really didn't change much between each other, and you don't have to innovate

13:15.520 --> 13:19.920
on something, don't try and reinvent it if it's good in the first place.

13:19.920 --> 13:24.640
And here, here's a comment in chat I have to respond to, chat.orgiliterator.com, rawstealut

13:24.640 --> 13:28.560
says, so Sky likes games that are all the same, no, that's your perception of these

13:28.560 --> 13:32.480
types of games, I look at sports games, I look at these Madden games, and I go, pfft,

13:32.480 --> 13:35.080
they're all the same to me, these games are all the same.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.920
It's the story that go along with it, I mean it's not necessarily the combat and stuff,

13:38.920 --> 13:43.760
it's just kind of, yeah, it's fun, or you know, it's grinding or whatever, but, um...

13:43.760 --> 13:49.200
You know, and I've heard people say it reminded them too much of Final Fantasy, and I'll admit,

13:49.200 --> 13:53.160
there's a lot in this game that reminds me of Final Fantasy X, I wouldn't call it Final

13:53.160 --> 13:57.480
Fantasy VIII because it has a good combat system on like VIII, Final Fantasy X it really

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
reminds me of.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.480
I like the combat system.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.960
And you know, it does, it innovates it on it enough, where like, I love the ring thing

14:02.960 --> 14:06.680
because it makes you pay attention to kind of what's going on, you know, to make sure

14:06.680 --> 14:12.760
you get the perfect hits and all that stuff, and the game is just gorgeous, it is like

14:12.760 --> 14:19.240
playing a Final Fantasy type game on a next-gen system, but without a whiny, spiky-haired

14:19.240 --> 14:23.120
guy as the lead character, instead you get more of a, you know, badass, not gonna talk

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
type guy.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.120
Besides, I don't know if you heard, and I'm pretty sure this is not in the show role,

14:27.120 --> 14:32.840
but Final Fantasy XIII, what, Spring 2010 is when they said?

14:32.840 --> 14:35.160
So I'm glad we have games like this to hold this over.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
Exactly.

14:36.160 --> 14:41.420
You know, if you enjoy Japanese RPGs in the slightest, you are doing yourself a disservice

14:41.420 --> 14:43.800
by not at least checking out Lost Odyssey.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.960
Don't listen to reviewers, because their big complaints are, they don't like these type

14:47.960 --> 14:52.600
of games in the first place, which, fine, this game is not gonna win you over to the

14:52.600 --> 14:57.680
Japanese RPG world, it's not, so, you know, if you already, if you don't like the Final

14:57.680 --> 14:59.160
Fantasy games, you're not gonna like this.

14:59.160 --> 15:04.240
That's why they have places that rent games, because, you know, just because one guy doesn't

15:04.240 --> 15:08.560
like it doesn't mean you should base your opinion on that one guy, I mean, you know,

15:08.560 --> 15:13.240
some of these reviews I read are just like, oh, well, this game's been done so many times,

15:13.240 --> 15:14.240
that's why I hate it.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
No?

15:15.240 --> 15:16.240
Well, who cares?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
Action movies.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.080
Oh my god, it's an action movie with guns in it.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.680
Oh, should I not go see it, because this one had guns too?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.240
It's just beautiful to watch.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.440
My roommate who doesn't play a lot of games, you know, he's, the game he's been playing

15:27.440 --> 15:31.120
a lot lately is Cold Sep Saga, that's the one game he's been getting really into lately,

15:31.120 --> 15:35.600
because he likes the more puzzle-type games, but he's been watching me play Lost Odyssey,

15:35.600 --> 15:39.080
and he's always kind of, like, appreciated the Fantasy games too, and he's just like,

15:39.080 --> 15:40.080
this game is outstanding.

15:40.080 --> 15:44.880
He's just like, the way it moves, and we were kind of talking about it, the fluidity of

15:44.880 --> 15:52.000
the game and the way the battle systems just look gorgeous, the in-game battles are phenomenal.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.680
So I totally like this game, I love this game, you know, and I will kind of put this out

15:58.680 --> 16:02.320
there as a disclaimer, I'm only about eight hours in, I haven't had a chance to really

16:02.320 --> 16:03.380
fully immerse myself.

16:03.380 --> 16:08.180
It could be one of those games that gets shitty and monotonous as it goes on, that is a possibility,

16:08.180 --> 16:12.160
but for right now, I'm saying there's money well spent, and I fully enjoy the eight hours

16:12.160 --> 16:15.000
I've put in so far, which is more than some games I've dropped six months on.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.360
My only gripe in the game is these dreams that you have, which are basically reading

16:20.360 --> 16:25.040
a bunch of text, and there's no real cutscene, I would think with a game that, you know,

16:25.040 --> 16:30.040
is four to slong, that they would at least do some sort of cutscene with the in-game

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
engine.

16:31.040 --> 16:35.840
It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, that detail or something, but seriously,

16:35.840 --> 16:40.640
I don't want to read, you know, all this stuff in the game, and I know it's optional to get

16:40.640 --> 16:41.800
some of the backstory stuff, but...

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
You know what's funny?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.800
Have you actually read it, though?

16:43.800 --> 16:44.800
Have you actually read it?

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
I have read it.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.080
I thought the writing was amazing in those little stories, and I kind of get it, though,

16:51.080 --> 16:55.320
I think I would like to see maybe a little more of the animation side, but I don't know,

16:55.320 --> 16:59.000
there's something about that whole using your imagination book thing, you know, that you

16:59.000 --> 17:00.560
don't really see in video games.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.560
I don't know.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
I kind of don't mind.

17:02.560 --> 17:07.000
Like, if they did the cutscenes more like, you know, folklore a little bit, where it's

17:07.000 --> 17:10.360
actually like a comic book and stuff, in fact, that's how I remember they were describing

17:10.360 --> 17:15.000
the cutscenes in, or at least the dreams and stuff in this game, and there is actually

17:15.000 --> 17:19.200
a part where you do have a dream, and it is a cutscene, that kind of thing, but I would

17:19.200 --> 17:23.480
have appreciated it more like that, you know, it doesn't even have to be anything, it'd

17:23.480 --> 17:26.760
be just still pictures or whatever, just a little bit more effort put into it other than

17:26.760 --> 17:28.920
just having text.

17:28.920 --> 17:32.220
One more fangasm over this game and then I promise I'll shut up, and you can send your

17:32.220 --> 17:38.120
emails about what a fanboy I am, okay, the voice acting in this game is actually really

17:38.120 --> 17:42.580
good, and I'm using the English soundtrack, shock and awe, like, English voice acting

17:42.580 --> 17:47.160
in these games is usually pretty terrible, but I actually think it's very well voice

17:47.160 --> 17:53.440
acted so far, I am, I'm like, just shocked, so, and my roommate had said the same thing,

17:53.440 --> 17:57.220
he's like, wow, the voice acting is actually pretty good, the comic relief guy especially

17:57.220 --> 18:02.000
is pretty funny, and I, just the way the cutscenes are done, all the comic book stars are, I

18:02.000 --> 18:06.300
could sit here for an hour and have a fangasm about how wonderful I think Lost Odyssey is,

18:06.300 --> 18:10.080
but I'm gonna play it more, and I'll let you know if it starts sucking, okay, I'll keep

18:10.080 --> 18:13.800
an open mind about it, but, whatever, I'm totally fanboy over this game, I'll admit

18:13.800 --> 18:14.800
it.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.320
I've also been playing the same XNA games that Loki earlier spoke of, and I'll wait

18:18.320 --> 18:23.340
for more thoughts on that when we get to the stories tonight, otherwise I've been playing

18:23.340 --> 18:24.340
Wow!

18:24.340 --> 18:27.240
X-Saga as well, I mentioned that a little earlier, my roommate's been playing a lot

18:27.240 --> 18:32.560
of that, but I have two, just a real different kind of game, still think they could've pulled

18:32.560 --> 18:37.300
it off on Xbox Live Arcade and it would've been better suited for that, but, it's kinda

18:37.300 --> 18:40.900
one of those games that's really hard to put down, but, I, seriously, rounds in Cold

18:40.900 --> 18:46.440
Step Saga can go on for like an hour and a half, it's crazy, but I'm having a good time.

18:46.440 --> 18:51.040
I guess I'll do it for my gaming week, I don't have a lot else to share, so, then let's get

18:51.040 --> 18:58.880
to tonight's housekeeping, we wanted to formally apologize for last week's show, or lack thereof,

18:58.880 --> 19:03.240
you know, what can we say, get what you pay for, it's a free show, so sorry, and we're

19:03.240 --> 19:06.360
here tonight, and actually, I gotta admit, tonight we're only gonna do a short show,

19:06.360 --> 19:10.200
we're gonna do like, just one part, there's not gonna be part A, part B, just because

19:10.200 --> 19:15.720
of the fact I'm sick, I'm having a hard time being here, any other week, probably would've

19:15.720 --> 19:18.980
just canceled it, but we didn't wanna go two weeks without a show, because consistency

19:18.980 --> 19:24.280
is important, and a lot of, not a lot, but sometimes I've been asked by other podcasters

19:24.280 --> 19:28.200
like what, you know, because we've been doing this for like, we've been podcasting ever

19:28.200 --> 19:31.600
since, you know, it was first out pretty much, and we've been doing internet radio for six

19:31.600 --> 19:34.400
years and people say, you know, what's your trick, what do you do to keep listeners, I'm

19:34.400 --> 19:39.760
always like consistency, it's all about consistency, if you're not consistent, then people will

19:39.760 --> 19:42.840
go look elsewhere, I mean, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, because there's lots

19:42.840 --> 19:46.360
of great independent shows out there, but that's how you lose listeners, is that if

19:46.360 --> 19:50.280
you're inconsistent, then people look elsewhere to fill in time, so I hate, I hate missing

19:50.280 --> 19:56.620
a show, but it had to be done, so, that's that, otherwise, you can join our Myspace

19:56.620 --> 20:00.560
community at Orange Launch Radio, our Facebook community is the OLRME, and our LiveJournal

20:00.560 --> 20:05.460
community is Orange Launch, one other thing I wanna plug, completely has nothing to do

20:05.460 --> 20:09.880
with video games, but it's another passion of mine, something I've been getting into

20:09.880 --> 20:16.320
over the past six months is these ORGs, these online reality games, where people play games

20:16.320 --> 20:21.680
based on reality shows on web forums, if that makes sense, there's a lot of strategy involved,

20:21.680 --> 20:25.460
if you're like into the strategical thinking that goes behind a lot of shows, such as like

20:25.460 --> 20:29.680
Survivor and Big Brother and all those, you know, types of shows that are on TV, these

20:29.680 --> 20:33.040
games are a lot of fun, and I've met a lot of really interesting people playing them,

20:33.040 --> 20:37.600
I am gonna be hosting a game on LiveJournal, I'm actually co-hosting with somebody you

20:37.600 --> 20:41.400
might recognize from this show, Shane, so if you want more information on that, we're

20:41.400 --> 20:45.000
looking for some new players, people that might be into this, so if this sounds like

20:45.000 --> 20:48.700
something you might be into, it's certainly much different from a video game, but check

20:48.700 --> 20:54.360
it out, we're taking applications right now, it's SurvivorLJ, just ran that all together,

20:54.360 --> 21:00.440
SurvivorLJ.LiveJournal.com, so there you go, I hope some of you guys will check that out,

21:00.440 --> 21:04.360
maybe sign up to play, LiveJournal's free and all that good stuff, you do have to have

21:04.360 --> 21:07.840
a LiveJournal account to play, but they're all like free, and many of us use it, and

21:07.840 --> 21:09.480
we've been on there for a long time.

21:09.480 --> 21:13.640
Okay, I will shut up now and do some video game news, actually I'm not gonna shut up

21:13.640 --> 21:16.680
because I'm doing video game news, but I'll shut up about my personal life.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.280
First off, I want to cover some things we missed last week since we didn't have a show

21:19.280 --> 21:24.240
last week, some of the stories we missed last week, one of them is a rumor that Netflix

21:24.240 --> 21:29.120
is soon going to be streaming to the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, and this is based

21:29.120 --> 21:33.000
off some type of survey that Netflix has been conducting recently, and the question that

21:33.000 --> 21:36.640
was in the survey was this, quote, if as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly

21:36.640 --> 21:41.960
watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS3 or Xbox 360, how likely would you

21:41.960 --> 21:44.480
or anyone in your household be able to do that?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.840
Hmm, so who knows about that?

21:46.840 --> 21:53.340
Rumor says that there could be a special Netflix disc that could cost as little as $3 will

21:53.340 --> 21:55.000
enable this all to work.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.320
So I don't know, this could be interesting.

21:57.320 --> 22:01.320
It's not too incredibly surprising when you consider Netflix is already doing those PC

22:01.320 --> 22:06.760
downloads where you can watch the movies if you have a Netflix account on your PC.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.300
This seems like a logical next step, but then again, would Microsoft and Sony want to lose

22:10.300 --> 22:12.400
those dollars if they could pocket themselves?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.560
I don't know, but it would be a very formidable alliance.

22:15.560 --> 22:20.940
EA is rumored to be working on The Sims 3, and this is actually not a rumor because that's

22:20.940 --> 22:26.400
according to The Sims studio creative director Rod Humble, and this was on the forum called

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
Quarter to Three.

22:28.400 --> 22:33.520
He says, Rod Humble says there will be new information soon.

22:33.520 --> 22:37.400
In other news, Madden 2010, scheduled for next year.

22:37.400 --> 22:41.640
I know, it's kind of obvious news when you think about it, but at the same time it's

22:41.640 --> 22:44.400
been a while since I've heard anything about The Sims.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.960
Anything that ever was kind of like Sims news was another expansion for an existing Sims

22:48.960 --> 22:49.960
game.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.600
They should have Sims 3 where I can import my Spore characters and attack the Sims characters.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.040
Yet another way to kill Sims.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.720
I would like to see if Sims 3 comes to light, maybe some type of link between the PC and

23:00.720 --> 23:01.720
the consoles.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
I don't know.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.200
Maybe that's just the console fan in me, because The Sims is kind of at heart a PC game, even

23:07.200 --> 23:09.920
though they've had all those spin-offs on systems and such.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.560
The Sims is kind of a PC game, but it would be kind of neat.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.200
I'm all about connectivity between all the crap I have and my friends have.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.840
One other story we missed last week, which I think is kind of funny, there are some filmmakers

23:20.840 --> 23:27.640
that are going to be producing a documentary about the E.T. landfill.

23:27.640 --> 23:32.000
For a quote from the Auburn University students who are putting this together, quote, we are

23:32.000 --> 23:35.360
proud to announce our upcoming documentary, E.T.'s March.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.280
Over the course of a week this March, we will go on a road trip from Auburn, Alabama to

23:39.280 --> 23:40.980
El Paso, Texas.

23:40.980 --> 23:45.640
From there, we will take the actual path of those 14 trucks took that faithful day into

23:45.640 --> 23:48.040
the heart of Alamogordo, New Mexico.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.240
Along the way, we will take in the video game culture of our great country.

23:51.240 --> 23:55.240
The documentary will be released for free via the internet this summer.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.140
I almost went to school there.

23:57.140 --> 24:01.440
I think it's kind of interesting that they're going to make a whole documentary about this.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.800
Of course, video game documentaries, King of Kong did very well.

24:05.800 --> 24:06.800
Who knows?

24:06.800 --> 24:07.800
The DVD should be out now, I think.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.800
It is out.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.800
I still haven't seen it.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.800
I haven't.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
I still haven't seen it.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
I need to borrow it.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.800
It's an interesting watch.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.800
I need Netflix it or something.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
I really want to see it.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.160
I feel like I'm totally missing something.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
I'll loan it.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.160
Okay, cool.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.200
I'll also loan you this other one I have that's really stupid.

24:21.200 --> 24:30.120
It's about the first, they claim they're the first ever internet radio show about games.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.000
It's uber stupid.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I actually watch the DVD.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.440
It's a game review show.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
It's lame.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
Oh, whatever.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.480
Let's get to this week's news.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.760
That's all I really want to touch on from last week.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.720
Last week, actually, ironically enough, was a little bit of a slow news week because this

24:45.720 --> 24:49.820
week we started getting into Game Developers Conference and some big bombshells dropped

24:49.820 --> 24:50.820
at GDC.

24:50.820 --> 24:51.820
Correct?

24:51.820 --> 24:52.820
Yes.

24:52.820 --> 24:55.760
Unfortunately, this year they didn't have keynotes from a bunch of other people like

24:55.760 --> 24:59.600
Nintendo and Sony and stuff like that, but Microsoft was there and they were doing their

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
keynote.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.360
Their big thing they announced, of course, was the Xbox Live Community Arcade.

25:04.360 --> 25:11.540
It will be kind of an easy way for people that develop games in XNA to share their games

25:11.540 --> 25:13.080
with the world.

25:13.080 --> 25:18.120
It'll allow people that are members of, I think, live, I'm not sure if it's just the

25:18.120 --> 25:25.080
XNA community, to rate their games and basically give feedback and that kind of stuff.

25:25.080 --> 25:32.360
Also, they will be able to sell their games or offer them free and that kind of stuff.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.320
Tons and tons and tons of stuff out there.

25:34.320 --> 25:39.320
Of course, they said, now 10 million people on Xbox Live get to play your game.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.420
It's all user created content.

25:41.420 --> 25:48.560
They put up a brief sampling of about nine games or so on there, including some of what

25:48.560 --> 25:54.740
we talked about, Jelly Car and Dishwasher and stuff like that.

25:54.740 --> 25:58.920
Pretty cool stuff and very exciting, especially if you're into game development and stuff

25:58.920 --> 25:59.920
in XNA.

25:59.920 --> 26:03.360
As far as I'm aware, I think the software is free and all you have to do is pay for

26:03.360 --> 26:06.680
the membership if you want to upload your games, $100 a year.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.960
So if you're really interested in that stuff, I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will probably all

26:10.960 --> 26:12.800
over this kind of thing.

26:12.800 --> 26:17.360
I seem to recall he was creating some type of Crazy Eights game from what I was following

26:17.360 --> 26:18.640
on a show, but who knows?

26:18.640 --> 26:21.480
Now maybe that he'll be able to post it to the world, he might finish that up.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.480
I don't know.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
I'll have to ask him.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.960
It'll be a little while.

26:24.960 --> 26:30.720
And then, of course, other things that they announced to go along with that is that you

26:30.720 --> 26:33.920
will finally be able to game on your Zune as well.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.880
They're going to allow XNA games to come to the Zune and you'll be able to play them kind

26:37.880 --> 26:42.840
of similar to playing stuff on an iPod or something like that.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.720
And they said, of course, XNA Zune games can also support custom soundtracks since it is

26:46.720 --> 26:53.800
an MP3 player and you'll be able to take your games from Windows to Xbox to Zune.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.440
And you haven't really announced anything else additional to that.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.520
Now, I don't know if it's just me.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.920
This news is fucking huge, this news.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.920
This is huge.

27:02.920 --> 27:10.120
I think a lot of us saw this coming, but I kind of see this as kind of a turning point

27:10.120 --> 27:14.600
in gaming and I think this is what is going to set the Xbox 360 really apart from its

27:14.600 --> 27:16.120
competitors right now.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.120
You know what I mean?

27:17.120 --> 27:18.120
Well, they said also...

27:18.120 --> 27:19.120
I think this is huge news.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.360
They said at the end of this year they're going to have 1,000 games on Xbox 360 and

27:23.360 --> 27:27.120
that's not including the Xbox Live community games.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.040
You know what this is?

27:29.040 --> 27:32.000
This is YouTube, but with video games.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.480
Yeah, it's YouTube of games that they were...

27:34.480 --> 27:36.480
And that's kind of what it's going to turn into.

27:36.480 --> 27:42.160
And I know people's opinions is that a lot of the user stuff is crap.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.920
You know, a lot of user-made stuff is crap and you look on YouTube and yeah, a lot of

27:44.920 --> 27:45.920
YouTube is crap.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.480
There's 14-year-old girls doing their blogs and shit.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.480
No one wants to watch that.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.200
I understand that a lot of it's crap, but you know, at the same time I think these people

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
are actually...

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
I mean, YouTube is free.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.640
Any idiot with a camera can go and shoot something and throw it up on YouTube.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.360
This you actually pay membership, you know, you have to have the tools to develop the

28:01.360 --> 28:02.360
games and stuff like that.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.500
You have to be somewhat intelligent to even do this.

28:04.500 --> 28:08.140
It's not an easy thing to just throw something together and put it on there and stuff.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.240
I would be really interested to see this stuff on here because a lot of it is going to be

28:11.240 --> 28:12.240
independent games.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.200
You're going to have people that are developing some of these free web games to put it on

28:15.200 --> 28:18.280
there now and they can make a little bit of money off of it and that kind of stuff.

28:18.280 --> 28:23.000
I think that's great and also at the same time, it's something that Sony or Nintendo

28:23.000 --> 28:26.540
doesn't have that they can brag about.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.940
This is something you can play these games if you want.

28:28.940 --> 28:34.460
They're optional, obviously, but on top of the two games that we get released each week

28:34.460 --> 28:37.500
on Xbox Live Arcade, now you're going to have a ton of these games that are going to be

28:37.500 --> 28:41.000
available on there and yes, some of them will be crap, but you know what?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.280
That's why you can do your research out there.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.060
Obviously, they will not be requiring demos, I don't think, for these things, but some

28:48.060 --> 28:57.980
of them will have demos available so you can test them out and plus also read the ratings.

28:57.980 --> 29:04.680
For those that say that the user-created games are crap, fucking go check out that Dishwasher

29:04.680 --> 29:06.480
game and the Jelly Car game.

29:06.480 --> 29:11.180
Put it next to some of the things that they're actually charging money for on Xbox Live Marketplace.

29:11.180 --> 29:15.340
They've got some crappy games on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

29:15.340 --> 29:18.760
There is certainly some good stuff that can come of this, absolutely, and there's a lot

29:18.760 --> 29:23.040
of great independent games that, you know, so I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot

29:23.040 --> 29:25.520
of crap that you're going to have to weed through, but I think this whole community

29:25.520 --> 29:29.260
kind of aspect of it where it's the peer review, I think that's kind of a smart way to kind

29:29.260 --> 29:30.260
of weed it out.

29:30.260 --> 29:31.260
Not everything independent is crap either.

29:31.260 --> 29:34.660
I mean, look at, you know, N Plus started off as an independent game.

29:34.660 --> 29:39.040
You have two Mickey Fighters, that started off as an independent game.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.640
You have, you know, Everyday Shooter.

29:42.640 --> 29:47.340
Just a ton of stuff out there that, you know, was independent stuff is now becoming mainstream

29:47.340 --> 29:49.060
and it's not bad.

29:49.060 --> 29:54.200
It's just, you know, a lot of times it costs a lot of these people a lot of money to develop

29:54.200 --> 29:57.920
these games and if they don't have a lot of money to put into them, they can't, you know,

29:57.920 --> 29:58.920
get a wide release for them.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.660
Now, this is allowing people that may not have the funds to advertise their game or

30:02.660 --> 30:06.880
do anything like that to do a lot smaller scale and, you know, advertise their stuff

30:06.880 --> 30:10.760
on websites and that kind of thing and then throw it on this, you know, community arcade

30:10.760 --> 30:15.220
and have a lot of people actually get to play their game instead of just not ever hearing

30:15.220 --> 30:16.220
about it.

30:16.220 --> 30:20.060
And I do think that the fact that these games are going to be playable on Zune, I think

30:20.060 --> 30:24.140
that's huge too because I think Microsoft can really be positioning themselves to do

30:24.140 --> 30:26.260
a game handheld if they want.

30:26.260 --> 30:31.220
Imagine if Microsoft releases a portable gaming handheld, not necessarily a Zune, but something

30:31.220 --> 30:35.580
that is more along, you know, is strictly a gaming machine, imagine they release it

30:35.580 --> 30:40.200
and they support XNA on this handheld, boom, this thing comes out, it instantly supports

30:40.200 --> 30:45.560
thousands of games that you can get, I mean, that's what I think is big and I kind of see

30:45.560 --> 30:50.440
like this could be Microsoft positioning the chess pieces and kind of seeing how much this

30:50.440 --> 30:52.180
takes off.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.460
How many people do this and put this on their Zune?

30:54.460 --> 30:57.060
How many kind of get into this whole thing?

30:57.060 --> 31:01.760
So I kind of think this is big news and we're really looking down the next couple years

31:01.760 --> 31:02.760
of gaming.

31:02.760 --> 31:08.540
Maybe I'm running around screaming like a lunatic cultist, which is fine, but I think

31:08.540 --> 31:11.700
this is huge and I look forward to seeing some of the games that are going to come out

31:11.700 --> 31:12.700
from this.

31:12.700 --> 31:17.700
What do you think they would call it if they did a Microsoft handheld?

31:17.700 --> 31:19.940
A Microsoft handheld system?

31:19.940 --> 31:20.940
Yeah.

31:20.940 --> 31:29.120
The, not the Xbox, but the X brick, no, I don't know, I have no idea, X game, I have

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
no idea.

31:30.120 --> 31:35.360
It could be like the X paper, I don't know.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.740
Paper, rock, scissors, I don't know.

31:37.740 --> 31:38.740
X book says frisbee.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.740
That's kind of funny.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.120
Yes, make it sound like a Mac product.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.120
There you go.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.160
I'd sell it.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.160
You never know.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.480
What about something like Xbox Go?

31:49.480 --> 31:53.420
Something really quick to the point, Xbox Go, doesn't that make you, doesn't that kind

31:53.420 --> 31:57.860
of have the ring of, hey, it's an Xbox product, but you go and you take it places.

31:57.860 --> 31:59.740
I think that's a fine name.

31:59.740 --> 32:02.980
I'm going to trademark that name right now so Microsoft can't use it.

32:02.980 --> 32:03.980
Just kidding.

32:03.980 --> 32:10.620
Well, I have some interesting news, and you know, everybody, well, for the most part loves

32:10.620 --> 32:11.620
Portal.

32:11.620 --> 32:16.620
It's been a big, big internet phenomenon, especially with that psychotic song at the

32:16.620 --> 32:23.020
end of the game that's so funny, but that song, Still Alive, is going to be in a rock

32:23.020 --> 32:25.860
band.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.260
That's cool.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.380
This was a triumph.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.060
Now we've got to get Mo back.

32:32.060 --> 32:33.060
Yeah.

32:33.060 --> 32:35.260
You realize we've got to download this song.

32:35.260 --> 32:37.220
See, we've got a whole band going right here.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.780
Loki can play the drums.

32:38.780 --> 32:39.780
You enjoy bass, right?

32:39.780 --> 32:40.780
You can play bass.

32:40.780 --> 32:41.780
I'll play whatever guitar.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.860
Actually, I usually play the drums when we play at the house.

32:43.860 --> 32:45.340
Well, then you two can fight over it.

32:45.340 --> 32:46.340
I don't really care.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.540
I'll play regular guitar.

32:47.540 --> 32:48.540
I'm just not singing.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.700
Well, Mo can sing because she's got a pretty voice.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.900
She can do the singing, and we'll have ourselves a little OLR house band.

32:53.900 --> 32:54.900
It'll be fun.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.180
And you know what?

32:56.180 --> 33:00.860
Maybe by the time that comes out, we'll have the rock band stage kit, and we can have the

33:00.860 --> 33:02.860
smoke and the lights.

33:02.860 --> 33:03.860
Hell yeah.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.860
Rob almost snorted his coffee.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.740
Are you really wasting money on that stage kit?

33:06.740 --> 33:09.980
I want to get it because it sounds so stupid that I have to get it.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.620
It's one of those things.

33:11.620 --> 33:12.940
I'm not spending money on it.

33:12.940 --> 33:15.460
I'll use store credit, obviously.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.460
That is money that you could spend on something more better.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.460
More better.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.460
Yes, more better.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.740
Okay.

33:23.740 --> 33:24.740
I'm sick.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.620
Leave me alone.

33:26.620 --> 33:28.380
I spend money on stupid things, though.

33:28.380 --> 33:29.380
I don't know.

33:29.380 --> 33:32.580
I'll have to look at it to see what it is, because if it's something really retarded,

33:32.580 --> 33:34.260
I don't know if it works out.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.540
Now the chat room is up in arms.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.540
Loki must sing.

33:36.540 --> 33:37.540
Loki must sing.

33:37.540 --> 33:38.540
Can I finish my story?

33:38.540 --> 33:39.540
Loki must play vocals.

33:39.540 --> 33:40.540
Yes, you may.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.540
Okay.

33:41.540 --> 33:47.660
Well, it was also stated, though, that they've confirmed that another portal is in the works.

33:47.660 --> 33:52.540
In fact, the words Portal 2 were actually used.

33:52.540 --> 33:57.260
In other news, Madden 2010, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts III, and all these other

33:57.260 --> 33:58.260
games confirmed.

33:58.260 --> 34:02.500
Well, here's the thing about, you know, the Portal 2 thing.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.260
It was kind of like, you know, her comment was, oh, I think that they've announced this

34:06.260 --> 34:07.260
already.

34:07.260 --> 34:10.460
She didn't say that, you know, they have, but obviously they're going to make a Portal

34:10.460 --> 34:11.460
2, duh.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.580
I mean, oh my god, a sequel to a game that made a lot of money?

34:14.580 --> 34:15.580
Hmm.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.900
I always think it's funny that it was a throwaway to begin with, pretty much, wasn't it?

34:18.900 --> 34:22.220
I mean, it was more of a nod to an old project.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.220
Yeah, really.

34:23.220 --> 34:25.860
Well, I think it's because we all know it's coming.

34:25.860 --> 34:26.860
Hello.

34:26.860 --> 34:31.740
I mean, Portal, little game with not that big a budget, I don't think, has humongous

34:31.740 --> 34:37.420
success and practically a cult following, duh, it's going to have a sequel.

34:37.420 --> 34:41.580
It's kind of last year's Katamari Damacy.

34:41.580 --> 34:45.540
Let's just hope they don't run it into the ground like they did Katamari.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.540
That's my only concern.

34:46.540 --> 34:49.500
Like, can too much Portal be too much of a good thing?

34:49.500 --> 34:50.500
Absolutely.

34:50.500 --> 34:54.340
Too much Portal when you're intoxicated is too much of a good thing.

34:54.340 --> 35:00.180
I fully support Portal 2, but when we start getting, you know, Portal DS, Portal PSP,

35:00.180 --> 35:01.180
Portal your brain out.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.180
Could you imagine Portal DS?

35:03.180 --> 35:05.940
Yeah, it would be all sorts of lame.

35:05.940 --> 35:12.300
Yeah, no, I just stick to the formula that works, make little improvements as you need

35:12.300 --> 35:13.580
to, that's fine.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.940
How about multiplayer Portal?

35:15.940 --> 35:19.340
There you go, might be kind of fun.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.580
That would be a processing nightmare.

35:21.580 --> 35:25.420
Just put a giant knife on the end of the Portal gun, there you go.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.420
Yeah.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.420
Portal deathmatch.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
Giant bayonet.

35:28.420 --> 35:32.460
Imagine what a Portal deathmatch would be like.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.460
With no actual...

35:33.460 --> 35:34.460
Confusing as hell.

35:34.460 --> 35:35.780
With no actual weapon.

35:35.780 --> 35:41.180
Of course, the comparison between Portal and Katamari leads AJ Mix in our chatroom to say,

35:41.180 --> 35:43.180
me and my Portal.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.180
That would be cute.

35:44.180 --> 35:49.620
Active Dad says, Portal 5 Disney Edition.

35:49.620 --> 35:53.020
Oh lordy.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.020
We'll see what happens.

35:54.020 --> 35:57.940
A game that I'm kind of looking forward to, strangely enough, Fable 2, even though the

35:57.940 --> 36:01.020
first one kind of lost interest in that for a little while.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.020
I'm all over this game.

36:02.020 --> 36:04.260
I am all over some of these more recent announcements.

36:04.260 --> 36:08.000
You know, I think this is great, and one of the huge things that they announced in Fable

36:08.000 --> 36:10.820
2, co-op play.

36:10.820 --> 36:14.620
It's pretty big for a somewhat role-playing adventure game.

36:14.620 --> 36:19.900
You get co-op play, so if you and someone else own Fable 2, you can suddenly go into

36:19.900 --> 36:24.660
their single-player world, do your thing, and then leave.

36:24.660 --> 36:25.660
Kind of like the...

36:25.660 --> 36:26.660
Do they spread rumors about them?

36:26.660 --> 36:27.940
Well, the same idea, like in Crackdown.

36:27.940 --> 36:31.260
If somebody's playing the game, you just kind of hop in and join, hello, and leave.

36:31.260 --> 36:38.500
Well, the demo that they showed, actually, Jamie, the woman, or Peter's character, who

36:38.500 --> 36:42.660
was a woman, her husband was kind of pissing this other guy off, so he shot him in the

36:42.660 --> 36:43.660
head with a gun.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.660
That's great.

36:44.660 --> 36:52.140
And now, you know, his character's child or whatever will be put into an orphanage, seriously,

36:52.140 --> 36:54.300
and you can visit and stuff.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.300
That's crazy.

36:55.300 --> 36:59.900
I just hope it's one of those things that doesn't sound really good, and then the execution

36:59.900 --> 37:00.900
of it is kind of...

37:00.900 --> 37:03.420
Because, like, to me, that was kind of the first Fable game.

37:03.420 --> 37:08.180
I'm like, this sounds great, and then I played it, and I'm like, this plays mediocre.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.180
It's going to be awesome.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.700
I kind of hope that it's...

37:10.700 --> 37:16.860
Yeah, I have very high hopes, so I'm hoping I'm not let down, but I am a little bit worried.

37:16.860 --> 37:21.460
Also, you know, you have the little doggy companion that follows you and all that good

37:21.460 --> 37:29.500
stuff, and also, this is big, Xbox Live mini-game that will interact with the full Fable 2 game.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.580
In other words, I guess it's some type of, like, little gambling game that you can play,

37:32.580 --> 37:35.760
and they're actually going to release this game a couple weeks before Fable 2 actually

37:35.760 --> 37:39.540
hits shelves, so you can actually start building gold in the gambling game that you will be

37:39.540 --> 37:40.940
able to spend in Fable 2.

37:40.940 --> 37:43.300
Yeah, it's a game that they had in the first Fable game.

37:43.300 --> 37:50.180
It was called Keystones, like, compared to Craps meets Roulette, and yeah, you can earn

37:50.180 --> 37:52.220
lots of money and be rich and stuff.

37:52.220 --> 37:56.180
What's also cool, though, when you're doing co-op, you actually earn experience, and you

37:56.180 --> 38:00.900
split your golden items, and when you're, like, introducing someone into the co-op game,

38:00.900 --> 38:03.040
you can decide on what the split is going to be like.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.740
If you want to, say, for example, help someone out, you could give them 100% of the gold

38:06.740 --> 38:12.820
and 100% of, you know, item drops or whatever, or you can do 50-50, so that's kind of neat.

38:12.820 --> 38:16.780
What would happen, though, if a really high-level advanced character came into your world and

38:16.780 --> 38:18.820
gave you an Uber sword?

38:18.820 --> 38:21.900
Is there anything to safeguard the game from essentially cheating like that?

38:21.900 --> 38:25.340
I don't know about that, but, you know, if it's like some Final Fantasy games, you can

38:25.340 --> 38:30.020
only be, you have to be a certain level before you can use, you know, X sword, but yeah,

38:30.020 --> 38:31.020
I mean, sure, why not.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.540
Anything back to the first Fable, it's been so long.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.780
It's what we did in Crackdown, you know, someone would come in with a rocket launcher and give

38:35.780 --> 38:38.560
it to you, and there you go, now you have a rocket launcher, it makes the game a hell

38:38.560 --> 38:40.620
lot easier, so.

38:40.620 --> 38:47.460
Well, I'm looking forward to this game and checking it out, that's pretty cool, and I,

38:47.460 --> 38:51.000
it's kind of funny, the whole Xbox Live connection, you know what it reminds me of?

38:51.000 --> 38:56.220
It reminds me of the Pocket Station, like, remember Chocobo Breeding and Final, or, it

38:56.220 --> 38:59.780
wasn't Chocobo Breeding, it was some type of, like, raise your Chocobo, like, a Tamagotchi

38:59.780 --> 39:03.140
type thing that you could have on a little Pocket Station for Final Fantasy VIII?

39:03.140 --> 39:04.140
Yes.

39:04.140 --> 39:07.420
Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that, but instead of something in your pocket on the go, it's

39:07.420 --> 39:08.420
Xbox Live.

39:08.420 --> 39:11.460
I don't know, I don't know, that's the comparison I get in my mind.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.280
The great thing about the Pocket Station game is it'll play itself, so all you have to do

39:14.280 --> 39:19.820
is just leave it on a Playstation system and just leave it, like, running for days at a

39:19.820 --> 39:20.820
time.

39:20.820 --> 39:23.340
Boom, you come back and you have, like, thousands of items.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.340
Awesome.

39:24.340 --> 39:27.700
Nice, well I'm looking forward to Fable 2.

39:27.700 --> 39:31.700
Another game that's coming out here pretty soon in the US will be Wii Fit.

39:31.700 --> 39:36.540
Nintendo has officially announced a date for it, it's going to be coming out May 19th,

39:36.540 --> 39:44.060
and also around the same time the WiiWare service will be launching in the US, May 12th,

39:44.060 --> 39:48.020
and they did have a press release and stuff, of course, you know, this game is insanely

39:48.020 --> 39:55.880
popular in Japan right now, just absolutely selling millions of copies, and I'm sure we'll

39:55.880 --> 40:00.180
do the same over here, just, you know, leave them to announce...

40:00.180 --> 40:03.540
It's going to keep Wii Mania alive in soccer mom's households.

40:03.540 --> 40:06.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just leave them to announce another...

40:06.500 --> 40:10.500
See, I knew this was coming out this time, in fact, you know, I know when some other

40:10.500 --> 40:16.840
games are coming out, but I can't say that, but yeah, Wii Fit's going to be doing awesome

40:16.840 --> 40:20.740
and there'll be some other games before it that'll be even more awesome, so...

40:20.740 --> 40:24.260
I'm looking in the chat room and, let's see, who called it Wii Fat?

40:24.260 --> 40:27.500
Somebody called it Wii Fat, I think it was GS68, somebody...

40:27.500 --> 40:29.420
It'd be like an eating game.

40:29.420 --> 40:35.260
Yeah, eat as much as you can, then get on the balance board, and then I'm very happy

40:35.260 --> 40:39.900
that we finally have a date for WiiWare, finally, kind of after all this speculation, oh, it's

40:39.900 --> 40:43.660
going to be out last Christmas, oh, I guess first quarter, oh, second quarter, now we

40:43.660 --> 40:48.220
have a date, so that's finally when Nintendo will kind of be, you know, showing us what

40:48.220 --> 40:49.220
they have there.

40:49.220 --> 40:52.500
Get on board with what everyone else has been doing for years already.

40:52.500 --> 40:57.140
In a way, but, you know, I don't know, Nintendo often can surprise, you know, they can do

40:57.140 --> 41:01.460
this shit later and sometimes surprise us, so we'll see, we'll see, it all depends on

41:01.460 --> 41:03.460
the quality of the games, in my opinion.

41:03.460 --> 41:08.140
Well, it's something else that they're enacting is something called, it's a payment service

41:08.140 --> 41:14.940
called Wii Connection Pay and Play, so it's that you can buy the WiiWare stuff with Wii

41:14.940 --> 41:15.940
Points.

41:15.940 --> 41:21.300
I think that's kind of interesting, I mean, they say that there's already, you know, we've

41:21.300 --> 41:24.420
got that with a virtual console, pretty much, but.

41:24.420 --> 41:28.100
This is a little different, though, this is actually for online play in certain games,

41:28.100 --> 41:32.900
you have to pay with Wii Points, and it's for download content and that kind of thing.

41:32.900 --> 41:33.900
I've, I've.

41:33.900 --> 41:34.900
That's what I was getting to.

41:34.900 --> 41:35.900
Oh, go ahead.

41:35.900 --> 41:39.260
That's okay, we've pretty much already said it.

41:39.260 --> 41:45.420
I've heard this concept said before for what Xbox Live should have done, is that, especially

41:45.420 --> 41:49.220
for these retro arcade titles that, you know, you play them once and you're kind of done,

41:49.220 --> 41:53.360
like wouldn't it be nice if you actually only played a quarter to play Tron, or, oh, here's

41:53.360 --> 41:54.360
a great example.

41:54.360 --> 41:58.900
I love Tron, but Disks of Tron, that game gets old a little bit fast for me.

41:58.900 --> 42:02.740
I don't know, it was one of those games that's better left in my memories of being a seven-year-old,

42:02.740 --> 42:09.900
is Disks of Tron, so I wish I could have only paid 25 cents to play it once and then be

42:09.900 --> 42:14.380
done with it, and not have it permanently for five dollars, if that makes sense.

42:14.380 --> 42:19.420
So hearing that Nintendo might be adopting a model like this, that's kind of interesting

42:19.420 --> 42:20.420
to me.

42:20.420 --> 42:23.780
I don't really have a better word, but interesting.

42:23.780 --> 42:29.900
Do you think that's a better price model, Dark Sakura, to do more pay-to-play?

42:29.900 --> 42:30.900
It depends.

42:30.900 --> 42:35.220
I think that there should be the option of having the full thing and then having the,

42:35.220 --> 42:39.260
it should either be pay for all of it or pay-to-play.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.660
Like a, give you a choice.

42:41.660 --> 42:45.980
Gerardimo in chat asks a good question, says, but Rob, isn't that what the demos are for?

42:45.980 --> 42:49.100
Kinda, but what if you can get really far on one quarter?

42:49.100 --> 42:51.220
I mean, that's how the old-school arcades work.

42:51.220 --> 42:52.980
Sometimes you're really good at the game naturally, you know?

42:52.980 --> 42:54.780
I took this news as something totally different.

42:54.780 --> 42:58.260
I thought that this was going to be, like, extended services that they're going to be

42:58.260 --> 43:02.460
adding to, like, we say, for example, voice chat or something in a game, and you would

43:02.460 --> 43:06.100
have to pay extra for that kind of thing, because they were saying that, I thought they

43:06.100 --> 43:13.260
were saying that this was actually going to be used in disc-based games as well as, you

43:13.260 --> 43:19.260
know, the WiiWare games and stuff, but I guess I read that wrong, I don't know.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.140
Because I was understanding, you know, okay, their service kind of sucks right now as far

43:23.140 --> 43:27.300
as what they have available online, and so some stuff they were going to add later on,

43:27.300 --> 43:30.700
or in order to finance that, they were going to charge for some of the services, like,

43:30.700 --> 43:35.180
say for example, you know, leaderboards or friends lists or something like that online,

43:35.180 --> 43:38.820
similar, like, live services, but, oh well.

43:38.820 --> 43:46.740
Well, one of the other things I was going to bring up is that there is the whole Nintendo

43:46.740 --> 43:53.140
channel, we're supposed to be getting that over here and in Europe, which will let you

43:53.140 --> 43:58.700
get to screenshots, videos of new games, play demos of DS titles, and then after you've

43:58.700 --> 44:03.180
played for an hour, you can rate it, but you only, of course, do that through the Nintendo

44:03.180 --> 44:11.540
channel, and it'll keep track of what you play, what you use to find new games, so it'll,

44:11.540 --> 44:18.180
it's basically more like, it's like TiVo, I guess, for your games, you know, it sees

44:18.180 --> 44:23.060
what types of games you've been looking into and says, well, here's others, you know.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.780
That's kind of interesting.

44:25.780 --> 44:30.900
And then the WiiWare games will be stored on the console and accessed through the channel

44:30.900 --> 44:34.940
on the Wii menu, and you can store them on your SD cards.

44:34.940 --> 44:40.340
You'll get manuals online, too, from the Wii Shop channel, so you can check them out so

44:40.340 --> 44:46.620
that you know what you're paying for before you do it.

44:46.620 --> 44:50.780
And you can only get them, of course, through your Wi-Fi connection, and they're, again,

44:50.780 --> 44:53.460
going to be based on, like, what you like.

44:53.460 --> 45:00.380
Another thing that they're launching in Japan that we're probably not going to get is another

45:00.380 --> 45:05.780
type of channel that shows TV program listings so that you can see what you want to watch.

45:05.780 --> 45:10.420
I mean, then again, we basically already have that already built into cable, you know.

45:10.420 --> 45:11.420
TV Guide channel.

45:11.420 --> 45:13.420
Yeah, the TV Guide channel.

45:13.420 --> 45:18.000
But, and it doesn't really say anything else about that, but they're saying that they're

45:18.000 --> 45:20.700
not going to bring it out anywhere else yet.

45:20.700 --> 45:21.700
Huh.

45:21.700 --> 45:22.700
Interesting.

45:22.700 --> 45:27.500
Yeah, I doubt we're going to get that, since I think it's all for Japanese channels anyways,

45:27.500 --> 45:30.780
unless we really care what's on Japanese TV, I don't know.

45:30.780 --> 45:33.780
You know, between everything Jamie's saying here about what's coming to the Wii and what

45:33.780 --> 45:36.540
we were talking about earlier with the XNA Creators Club, this is going to be a really

45:36.540 --> 45:38.220
big year for digital distribution.

45:38.220 --> 45:42.580
And then if the Netflix thing turns out to be true, this is a big, big year for download

45:42.580 --> 45:43.580
stuff.

45:43.580 --> 45:45.300
I think that's the way everything's going.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.080
I think we've all known that for quite some time.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.080
This is kind of interesting.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.660
To see it actually happen?

45:49.660 --> 45:50.660
Yes.

45:50.660 --> 45:51.660
Yeah.

45:51.660 --> 45:52.660
Yeah.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.420
It's one thing to talk about, and it's one thing to see how it plays out, if that makes

45:54.420 --> 45:55.420
sense.

45:55.420 --> 46:01.580
Well, I'm also curious to see how the Wii Balance Board plays out, and apparently, according

46:01.580 --> 46:06.780
to Reggie Fils-Aime, over 10 Wii Balance Board games are in development.

46:06.780 --> 46:10.700
The most common problem with a peripheral, they come out, there's only one or two games

46:10.700 --> 46:11.700
for it.

46:11.700 --> 46:14.940
If that game fails, the whole damn peripheral fails, they obey the bots, it feels like they

46:14.940 --> 46:16.260
wasted their money.

46:16.260 --> 46:21.600
Now it seems like, you know, when these peripherals come out, a company's throwing a lot of money

46:21.600 --> 46:25.200
behind it to try and make them take off, and that's certainly one thing that they're doing

46:25.200 --> 46:27.260
with the Wii Balance Board.

46:27.260 --> 46:30.220
Maybe the fact that it's already done so well in Japan helps, who knows?

46:30.220 --> 46:35.700
But Reggie Fils-Aime commented in something he was speaking to with IGN, he said, quote,

46:35.700 --> 46:39.740
there are over 10 games in development that take advantage of the Balance Board.

46:39.740 --> 46:43.740
All we know so far would be Wii Fit, and then the skiing game that Namco's putting out,

46:43.740 --> 46:45.200
but who knows what else?

46:45.200 --> 46:48.700
Could it be that the other Wii Balance Board games are some of these download titles that

46:48.700 --> 46:50.340
you'll be able to play?

46:50.340 --> 46:52.060
Or another WarioWare game?

46:52.060 --> 46:55.180
Oh, I bet a WarioWare game's a given, actually.

46:55.180 --> 46:57.700
That's a good thought.

46:57.700 --> 47:04.780
To kind of go back to that last story we were talking about, Nintendo's Takashi Aoyama,

47:04.780 --> 47:08.420
actually they were saying, his description of the service was that Nintendo will begin

47:08.420 --> 47:13.440
collecting fees for some services that will allow us to adapt flexibility.

47:13.440 --> 47:19.180
So in other words, it's subsidizing additional services like new channels and stuff like

47:19.180 --> 47:20.180
that.

47:20.180 --> 47:23.540
And it will be something that's on boxes, like they said that it's going to be an orange

47:23.540 --> 47:26.540
logo that's going to be right next to the Wi-Fi Connect logo.

47:26.540 --> 47:28.780
So I think this is something additional.

47:28.780 --> 47:34.060
It's not just like an arcade kind of format where you pay X amount of Wii points to play

47:34.060 --> 47:37.080
a game or something like that online.

47:37.080 --> 47:40.940
So I don't know, we'll have to see when it finally comes out.

47:40.940 --> 47:47.060
SSJ100Matt says, why couldn't anyone bring back the Sega Activator?

47:47.060 --> 47:49.660
Speaking of peripherals, it didn't do so hot.

47:49.660 --> 47:55.940
Well, that's another reason why games like Para Para didn't really take off either.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.100
They had similar type of peripherals.

47:58.100 --> 48:01.300
Hey, I have an activator.

48:01.300 --> 48:05.940
I had one and I disassembled it because I was going to turn it into a Para Para controller.

48:05.940 --> 48:06.940
Isn't that ironic?

48:06.940 --> 48:11.500
I had no time in my life that I owned an activator.

48:11.500 --> 48:18.180
Anyways, so another game that of course we're looking forward to pretty soon is Mario Kart

48:18.180 --> 48:27.660
Wii, and luckily the rest of the world knows when it's coming out, except the US.

48:27.660 --> 48:29.360
Isn't that ironic?

48:29.360 --> 48:35.500
But apparently though, Mario Kart Wii will be hitting Japan on April 10th.

48:35.500 --> 48:40.300
Also coming to Europe the day after on the 11th.

48:40.300 --> 48:41.300
So that's pretty awesome.

48:41.300 --> 48:46.220
Of course it's going to be bundled with the Wii Wheel, a piece of plastic crap that you're

48:46.220 --> 48:50.100
going to stick the remote in, however you do not need to use that to play the game.

48:50.100 --> 48:55.660
In fact, you'll have as many control options as Smash Bros. did, so that's awesome, including

48:55.660 --> 48:57.020
GameCube and Classic Controllers.

48:57.020 --> 49:02.060
Okay, if I used logic, if it's coming out the same week in Japan and Europe, wouldn't

49:02.060 --> 49:04.900
it be logical to say that's going to be the same time frame we get it here?

49:04.900 --> 49:09.180
I mean, that would be my guess.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.500
I can't comment on that.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.860
You bastard, you know, don't you?

49:12.860 --> 49:16.340
You're just afraid of a Katamari redo.

49:16.340 --> 49:17.340
Alright fine.

49:17.340 --> 49:18.340
I know when it's coming out.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.340
Okay, tell me this.

49:19.340 --> 49:20.340
Am I right or am I wrong?

49:20.340 --> 49:21.340
You're wrong.

49:21.340 --> 49:22.340
But you're close.

49:22.340 --> 49:23.340
Oh, shiz.

49:23.340 --> 49:24.340
You're wrong.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.340
Alright, fair enough.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.820
We'll leave it at that.

49:27.820 --> 49:28.820
I know when.

49:28.820 --> 49:29.820
I know when.

49:29.820 --> 49:30.820
I know, I know, I know.

49:30.820 --> 49:31.820
What?

49:31.820 --> 49:32.820
Soon.

49:32.820 --> 49:33.820
You're a bitch.

49:33.820 --> 49:34.820
I know.

49:34.820 --> 49:35.820
Heart.

49:35.820 --> 49:40.740
Well, I have some fun news and stuff that actually I can say when it's coming out because

49:40.740 --> 49:42.740
it already has.

49:42.740 --> 49:46.940
And this is our UK Virtual Console.

49:46.940 --> 49:51.420
And this is pretty cool because this is actually, speaking of the Activator, this is a game

49:51.420 --> 49:53.900
that I bought with my Activator.

49:53.900 --> 49:55.300
Was Eternal Champions.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.300
Nice.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.980
I love Eternal Champions.

49:57.980 --> 50:01.180
That game is, actually I love Eternal Champions CD a lot more.

50:01.180 --> 50:02.740
That was a really good transition.

50:02.740 --> 50:09.420
No, I'm just saying for the Activator, that was a really good transition.

50:09.420 --> 50:10.420
That's all.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.420
Oh, okay.

50:11.420 --> 50:12.420
I just want to take time out to acknowledge that really good transition.

50:12.420 --> 50:13.420
Thank you, Rob.

50:13.420 --> 50:14.420
You're welcome.

50:14.420 --> 50:19.460
I feel very confident now in my announcing skills.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.540
Thank you.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.740
As if an endorsement from me is what's needed.

50:23.740 --> 50:24.740
Alright, I'll shut up.

50:24.740 --> 50:25.740
I'm ruining the show.

50:25.740 --> 50:26.740
No, you're not.

50:26.740 --> 50:32.340
Anyway, Eternal Champions is like one of those, like, if you have wanted violence in video

50:32.340 --> 50:34.100
games, this is what did it, you know.

50:34.100 --> 50:40.740
You had your over-kills, you know, how each level would have like this, like, you know,

50:40.740 --> 50:45.780
super destructive violent move and you had people from all over the world and all through

50:45.780 --> 50:53.100
time you had a robot kickboxer and a caveman and like, what's your face that had the really

50:53.100 --> 50:55.180
cool snake look and dress thing?

50:55.180 --> 50:56.180
She was really cool.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.180
I didn't play it.

50:57.180 --> 51:00.220
And there was one guy who, I can never remember what he was called, but I always called him

51:00.220 --> 51:08.180
Darkman because he had the hat and the coat and everything, but this is just a really,

51:08.180 --> 51:15.220
really fun game, but it's going to be, it's 800 Wii points, really, really fun, but this

51:15.220 --> 51:18.380
also raises a question that I was thinking of.

51:18.380 --> 51:20.620
Which is?

51:20.620 --> 51:26.020
Do we have any Sega CD games that have come out on Wii?

51:26.020 --> 51:27.940
Sega CD?

51:27.940 --> 51:28.940
Not that I can think of.

51:28.940 --> 51:36.340
If we're getting Turbo Duo games, and why can't we get...

51:36.340 --> 51:38.460
Night Trap on virtual consoles?

51:38.460 --> 51:43.300
Please say we can have, or, dude, I want Criss Cross Make Your Own Video.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.300
Rob?

51:44.300 --> 51:45.300
What?

51:45.300 --> 51:47.900
I have that game.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.340
I have that one too.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.900
And the Marky Mark and the Funky Munch one?

51:50.900 --> 51:51.940
I have that one too.

51:51.940 --> 51:52.940
That is awesome.

51:52.940 --> 51:53.980
Dude, you didn't bring those over.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.220
We need to play it one night.

51:55.220 --> 51:58.340
Well, if I can find where we put them, but you know what I need to bring over?

51:58.340 --> 51:59.340
What?

51:59.340 --> 52:00.340
Because I think that you would like this one.

52:00.340 --> 52:01.340
What?

52:01.340 --> 52:02.340
Do you like Information Society?

52:02.340 --> 52:03.720
I guess.

52:03.720 --> 52:08.900
I have one of the karaoke CDs that came on the Sega CD.

52:08.900 --> 52:09.900
Anyway.

52:09.900 --> 52:17.100
So, also out for UK Virtual Console, and this is also super happy, Phantasy Star 2.

52:17.100 --> 52:20.660
Which is another 800 Wii Points game.

52:20.660 --> 52:25.460
And it's actually, I'd have to say, probably tops to me in the series, because it had Nae

52:25.460 --> 52:27.500
in it, and she was really cool.

52:27.500 --> 52:31.940
DJ Dark Knight in Chat would like you to know the girl's name was Jetta Max.

52:31.940 --> 52:32.940
That was it.

52:32.940 --> 52:38.100
And I should have remembered that, because my favorite character on Gem was Jetta.

52:38.100 --> 52:40.900
But that's another story.

52:40.900 --> 52:42.700
Plus it's a pretty cool car.

52:42.700 --> 52:43.700
Okay.

52:43.700 --> 52:44.700
Alright.

52:44.700 --> 52:54.820
But for the Phantasy Star games, it was like, you know, you had your different viewpoint

52:54.820 --> 52:59.520
where you played from behind the characters and could attack for your different scenes

52:59.520 --> 53:02.620
and your little dungeon crawl areas.

53:02.620 --> 53:03.620
You know, it was really cool.

53:03.620 --> 53:08.940
I mean, pretty, I'd have to say, the story wasn't all that great, but it was just a fun

53:08.940 --> 53:10.760
game to play.

53:10.760 --> 53:20.140
And moving forward, we also have Street Gangs that was a Nintendo NES game for 500 points,

53:20.140 --> 53:28.780
and it's not worth, and actually, the cool thing about this is, you want to know what's

53:28.780 --> 53:29.780
super cool about it?

53:29.780 --> 53:30.780
What?

53:30.780 --> 53:32.820
The River City Ransom is what it is.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.380
Ah, okay.

53:34.380 --> 53:35.380
Yep.

53:35.380 --> 53:40.100
Which, the Japanese name of it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.

53:40.100 --> 53:41.100
That sounds fun.

53:41.100 --> 53:43.500
When you phrase it that way, that sounds a lot of fun.

53:43.500 --> 53:47.060
I have to tell you this, and if I can find my copy of it, because I only have a burn

53:47.060 --> 53:53.660
of it, I haven't been able to find an original yet, is it has voice on the PC Engine Duo

53:53.660 --> 53:54.660
version.

53:54.660 --> 53:55.660
Wow.

53:55.660 --> 54:01.900
You know, the scenes where you go inside and go order food, you know, they start off the

54:01.900 --> 54:05.860
adashimase, and then talk to you all cutesy and everything.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.780
When the guys die, do they actually say, barf?

54:09.780 --> 54:11.300
They make more punch noises.

54:11.300 --> 54:12.300
Do they?

54:12.300 --> 54:13.300
Like, ooh.

54:13.300 --> 54:17.900
Because that's all I remember is in the NES one, when you killed people, they'd go barf.

54:17.900 --> 54:27.380
Well, I will have to, if you would like, I would have to find my burn of the PC Engine

54:27.380 --> 54:29.700
Duo ones that you can see.

54:29.700 --> 54:33.500
It just adds a completely different element to the game, having the voice with it, but

54:33.500 --> 54:35.500
anyway, that's just me.

54:35.500 --> 54:41.140
One weekend, we need to have a marathon gaming session with Jamie's Rare Fucking Games

54:41.140 --> 54:45.520
Weekend or something, where we just play these obscure-ass video games that we've been talking

54:45.520 --> 54:46.520
about all night long.

54:46.520 --> 54:49.060
I have a ton of obscure games for the Wii.

54:49.060 --> 54:52.740
And we could raise money for charity, like all those marathon gamer people do.

54:52.740 --> 54:55.900
You know what game I'd have to bring you, if I can find my copy of it?

54:55.900 --> 54:57.580
Psychic Storm.

54:57.580 --> 55:01.700
And this game has a subtitle.

55:01.700 --> 55:07.140
Dan calls it I Get Pissed Off, because when they say Psychic Storm, they say it in a very

55:07.140 --> 55:11.460
thick accent, and Dan thinks they're saying I Get Pissed Off.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.020
And there's another one that I'm going to have to get from a friend of mine that I think

55:14.020 --> 55:20.700
I've talked about on the show before, that's called Silphia, where it's a shooter game

55:20.700 --> 55:22.180
with fairies.

55:22.180 --> 55:23.340
Interesting.

55:23.340 --> 55:27.140
I would be actually, like maybe we could do something where we bring in a whole stock

55:27.140 --> 55:31.300
of games, and we'll play each game for an hour, and we let the chat vote on which game

55:31.300 --> 55:32.300
we'll play next or something.

55:32.300 --> 55:35.180
Dude, you know it's going to be over as soon as I put Dracula X in, because you won't get

55:35.180 --> 55:36.180
me off that game.

55:36.180 --> 55:38.140
Maybe save that for last.

55:38.140 --> 55:39.140
Who knows?

55:39.140 --> 55:46.060
But anyway, the last game on the list is Adventure Island, for 500 Wii points, and Adventure

55:46.060 --> 55:47.860
Island is just, it's classic.

55:47.860 --> 55:54.980
I mean, it's, I don't mean, today it's, you know, maybe kind of, you know, more repeat,

55:54.980 --> 55:58.580
repeat, repeat, but Adventure Island is one of the major classics, so I'm glad that's

55:58.580 --> 55:59.580
in there.

55:59.580 --> 56:01.180
That is one of the first NES games I actually remember playing.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.980
It's also technically a Wonder Boy game.

56:03.980 --> 56:04.980
That's right.

56:04.980 --> 56:11.940
I know, though, that series spawned one of my favorite games, Wonder Boy Monster Land.

56:11.940 --> 56:15.420
You know, actually, one game I loved in the Adventure Island series was Super Adventure

56:15.420 --> 56:16.420
Island.

56:16.420 --> 56:17.420
Did you ever play that on Super Ninja?

56:17.420 --> 56:20.060
And you know what I loved about Super Adventure Island was the music.

56:20.060 --> 56:23.820
I thought it had one of the best soundtracks, and years later, I figured it out.

56:23.820 --> 56:26.900
Do you know why Super Adventure Island had such a kickass soundtrack?

56:26.900 --> 56:27.900
Yuzo Koshiro.

56:27.900 --> 56:28.900
Huh?

56:28.900 --> 56:34.220
Well, I'll tell you what, though, I've got the TurboGrafx Adventure Island cue card.

56:34.220 --> 56:35.220
Fun.

56:35.220 --> 56:36.220
That's pretty cool.

56:36.220 --> 56:41.380
But, um, you know, though, I would really, really like to see, um, is, uh, I haven't

56:41.380 --> 56:50.300
seen, at least as far as I've paid attention, I haven't seen any of the Alex Kidd games.

56:50.300 --> 56:51.500
Maybe someday.

56:51.500 --> 56:55.560
I would personally like to see Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.340
You seem to bring that up every chance you get.

56:57.340 --> 56:58.340
You want Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

56:58.340 --> 56:59.340
It's a great game.

56:59.340 --> 57:00.340
One of these days, it's gonna be my classic game.

57:00.340 --> 57:01.340
Alright.

57:01.340 --> 57:02.340
Not anytime soon.

57:02.340 --> 57:07.300
Alright, well, if that's all that's coming to the Virtual Console, then we will move

57:07.300 --> 57:10.780
on with what is coming to a store near you around the world.

57:10.780 --> 57:13.900
We'll start with Japan and the Japanese release dates.

57:13.900 --> 57:19.820
Coming out on February 28th, Call of Juarez and the Idolmaster live for you on the Xbox

57:19.820 --> 57:20.820
360.

57:20.820 --> 57:25.320
Idolmaster is pretty big over in Japan, and so it's a pretty big title coming out this

57:25.320 --> 57:26.920
week for them.

57:26.920 --> 57:33.640
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, nothing, but you do get Guitar Hero 3 next week, so

57:33.640 --> 57:35.420
stay tuned for that.

57:35.420 --> 57:41.820
Also in Japan, coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Choro Q Wii, sorry, Koro Q Wii.

57:41.820 --> 57:45.780
Remember, part of the fun is listening to me horribly mispronounce Japanese names, especially

57:45.780 --> 57:46.780
when I'm sick.

57:46.780 --> 57:49.060
The Koro 2 games are fun.

57:49.060 --> 57:54.540
Also coming out, more games in the Simple Wii series, the block Kuzushi and the Wai

57:54.540 --> 57:56.820
Wai Combat are coming out.

57:56.820 --> 58:03.200
Also Uchi Suri, Sega Bass Fishing will be coming out as well on the Nintendo Wii in

58:03.200 --> 58:04.200
Japan this week.

58:04.200 --> 58:08.620
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3 Take Down comes out.

58:08.620 --> 58:09.940
I think that's a price reduction, though.

58:09.940 --> 58:12.440
I don't think that's actually a new release.

58:12.440 --> 58:16.840
Final Approach 2, First Priority comes out from one of my favorite companies, Princess

58:16.840 --> 58:19.720
Soft comes out there.

58:19.720 --> 58:23.460
Also coming out, lots of price reductions, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed Underground

58:23.460 --> 58:24.460
2.

58:24.460 --> 58:30.460
I like this title, Night Wizard the Video Game, Denial of the World is coming out.

58:30.460 --> 58:31.460
That sounds like fun.

58:31.460 --> 58:32.460
It sounds so emo.

58:32.460 --> 58:33.460
It does.

58:33.460 --> 58:34.460
Denial of the World.

58:34.460 --> 58:35.460
Deny.

58:35.460 --> 58:44.340
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Soma Bringer, as well as Akajawa Jiro Mystery, Yasu Kiyoku

58:44.340 --> 58:47.020
is coming out as well.

58:47.020 --> 58:55.980
Coming out on the PSP in Japan is nothing but a new pouch in mint green.

58:55.980 --> 58:59.660
Enjoy that, but no games.

58:59.660 --> 59:00.660
That's it.

59:00.660 --> 59:02.780
The U.S. is getting in quite a few things.

59:02.780 --> 59:08.860
Potapon on the PSP, it's a pretty cool rhythm game, also a bit of action thrown in there.

59:08.860 --> 59:16.160
On the 360 and PC, no PS3 version for this, Frontline's Fuel War, another military first

59:16.160 --> 59:18.140
person shooter.

59:18.140 --> 59:22.380
Lost Via Domus coming to Xbox 360, PC, and PS3.

59:22.380 --> 59:24.300
Good spin off of this show.

59:24.300 --> 59:30.500
Turning Point, Fall of Liberty on 360, PC, and PS3, kind of an alternate World War II

59:30.500 --> 59:31.500
shooter game.

59:31.500 --> 59:37.500
Naruto Ninja Destiny on the DS, it's a Naruto 3D fighter game.

59:37.500 --> 59:42.460
The Sims 2 Free Time for PC.

59:42.460 --> 59:48.060
Lost Planet Extreme Condition on the PS3, which includes bonus characters like Mega

59:48.060 --> 59:52.700
Man, Frank from Dead Rising, and some of the other characters from the PC version.

59:52.700 --> 59:58.740
Plus, it's only $39.99, so pretty good price for a game that came out a year ago.

59:58.740 --> 01:00:04.100
Destroy All Humans Big Willy Unleashed for the Wii, looks awesome, I love the Destroy

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.820
All Humans series.

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:13.340
Mazes of Fate DS, it's an RPG, kind of a traditional one for the DS there.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:20.140
Agatha Christie's and Then There Were None for the Wii, an adventure game.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:25.140
Let's see here, Arma Gold Edition for PC.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:31.620
Heavenly Guardian for PlayStation 2, it's kind of an anime style 2D shooter game.

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:37.700
Puzzle Guzzle for the PSP, that's another...

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.700
Puzzle Guzzle?

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.700
Puzzle Guzzle.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.060
That is the dumbest name I've ever heard for games, sorry to the makers of Puzzle Guzzle,

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060
whoever you are.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060
It's huge tech.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.820
But that's a bad name, that's a bad name.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:54.140
Some GameStop exclusive stuff, Fantasy Aquarium, yes, you can raise all sorts of different

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.420
fish and sea life, including dolphins.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.580
Sea Man 3, I was just going to say, can you raise a Sea Man?

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.660
I don't know if you can.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:10.320
This actually is also coming out, not GameStop exclusive, Block is Portable Steam Bot Championship.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.940
This is actually a game that was in that Steam Bot Chronicles game, which I thought was very

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:21.200
niche anyways, and now you can play it away from the game, yay, I guess.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:31.340
And let's see, Bubble Bobble Doubleshot on the DS, hopefully with level 30 as well.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.340
And let's see...

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.340
I see what you did there.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.340
Exactly.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:41.540
Brain Assist, that's coming out on the DS from Sega, yet another brain training game.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:47.960
Sega Bass Fishing for the Wii, that's not necessarily using the Dreamcast fishing rod,

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.380
but you can pretend with the Wii Remote.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:58.420
And Spitfire Heroes Tales Royal Air Force for the DS by Destineer, because they put

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.100
out a lot of shit.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:08.420
And I believe that's it, but I like this title that's coming out next week, though, it's

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:15.880
a horse riding sim, but if you say the name of the title a little bit, it sounds weird.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.880
Let's Ride Friends Forever.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.460
Don't say that out loud really fast, because that sounds really, really bad.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:33.820
Oh, and Tigers, or Pets, Wild Animals, Tigers game, yes, because now you can raise tigers.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.500
Oh, and Bratz Super Babies, I forgot about that.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.380
Hey, Jamie, let's go ride friends forever.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.460
Only friends let friends ride friends.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.500
Nice.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.180
Oh, is that it for US releases?

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:58.140
Uh, yeah, and this isn't really a game, but the extra guitars for Guitar Hero 3 are coming

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:04.780
out for PS3 and the Wii now, so, um, if you're looking for extra guitars, there you go.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.700
Is that a copy of Bejeweled I'm seeing on the table over there?

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.020
That's actually already been given away, I just haven't gotten to the post office yet.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.020
I was like...

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.700
What was the week you were here?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.980
I think I'm baffled by that, but that's okay.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980
Bejeweled 2, even better.

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980
Yes.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:18.980
You know what I thought?

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.340
Um, you guys were talking about obscure games.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.060
This isn't really obscure, but I guess it's obscure now.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060
Commander Keen.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.060
Ooh!

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.060
Play some of that.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.060
I remember those.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.500
Bunch of, uh, EGA colored games, that'd be fun.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.860
You know, you know what other game, though, I was thinking about just the other day?

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.620
Was Jazz Jackrabbit.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.740
How about Jill of the Jungle?

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.740
I remember that game.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.740
The game was rad.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740
That's what it is.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.740
How about him?

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.740
You know me, though, my favorite PC game is so super obscure right now.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.420
Anyway.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.260
On the 28th, we have Lost on PC.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.340
Um, yay.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:01.700
29th, um, we have, uh, 8 Ball All-Stars on DS.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.780
We have, uh, Asterix at the Olympic Games comic series.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.820
And then we have, like, a French version, I think.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.020
Because it's in, because the, uh, title's in French.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.180
We have Beautiful Katamari on the 29th on Xbox 360.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.180
Blacksite Area 51.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:23.940
We have Bleach, Shattered Blade, and the Blade of Fate, um, Wii and DS, respectively.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.820
Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.940
Fish Tycoon.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:32.860
My brain's still wrapping around that, sorry.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.700
Frontlines Fuel of War on Xbox 360 and PC.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.980
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on Wii.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:46.300
Um, Jamster All-Stars, King of Clubs, Lost, um, yeah.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:53.460
Lost Odyssey, Lost Planet Extreme Condition, Namco Museum on DS, Persona 3, SpongeBob Atlantis

01:04:53.460 --> 01:05:00.260
SquarePants, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empire, and Zoo Hospital.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.300
All right, sounds like an exciting week over there.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.660
That's a, that's a long wait for Beautiful Katamari.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.980
I would say so.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.980
Wow.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.980
Poor, poor guys over here.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.780
Epic and Apogee, or 3D Realms now, they really need to go back and remake a lot of their

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.980
older games, like Shareware stuff.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.980
Seriously.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.380
Those are some IPs that need to be, be gone and revisited, seriously.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.380
Yeah.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.820
Who doesn't want a new Jill of the Jungle 3D shooter, or something?

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.540
Hey, you know, people are looking for that, uh, good female heroine.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:37.660
Well, hey, speaking of new IPs, uh, based on old ideas, possibly, um, Activision apparently

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:42.580
has filed a trademark for a game name called DJ Hero.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.500
You just couldn't stop there, could you?

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.260
You just have it going.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.300
You know, I think a lot of us have seen this coming for a long time, and of course the

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:53.500
reason why, you know, a lot of us, remember, Orange Launch Radio, hello, look at our name.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.900
We started a long time ago as a station dedicated to music-based video games, and one of them

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.060
specifically was Beatmania, and I think a lot of us called this a long time ago when

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.060
we started seeing Guitar Hero's success.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.060
It's only a matter of time.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.500
If Konami's gonna sit on it and not do anything with it, somebody else is gonna pick it up

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500
and run with it, and I think that's what we're gonna see happen.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.920
I mean, well, I'm sure Konami's gonna license, you know, the rights for their controller-type

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.660
design and that stuff, but they've already done one here, so we know that they have trademarks

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:25.060
and, you know, copyrights in place for stuff like that, like Beatmania, but, um...

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:30.300
I think Sega does also have the Kraken DJ1 licensed over here, too.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:35.100
But here's what I'm wondering, though, with this, is, um, really all they're doing, and

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.500
I mean, this isn't that big of a surprise, because most buying games are like that, too.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:44.660
All they're really doing is just swapping out guitar for, you know, a turntable and

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.660
buttons.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.660
I mean, if that's what they're gonna be doing with this.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:53.100
They're really whoring that Guitar Hero franchise and kind of running it into the ground, I

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.880
think.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.620
I think it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.180
I don't think it's gonna be a clone of Beatmania.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.160
I mean, they're not gonna do that, but it's gonna be interesting to see kind of what happens

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.160
with it, what they decide to change.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.620
I hope it's Kraken DJ!

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.500
I think you're gonna see something like frequency amplitude, but with a different type of controller.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.220
I don't think that's what it's gonna be.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.660
But we'll see.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.660
I hope.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:16.280
I hope it's something different.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.380
I'm thinking this is gonna be announced at E3 this year.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.380
Wait for it.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.380
I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380
Oh, nothing.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380
Go ahead.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.220
So, Microsoft is officially, well, along with everyone else...

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.220
Wait, I gotta say this.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.220
This is a very good point.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.220
A.J.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.380
Mixx says, this isn't a Harmonic 6 Activision.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.660
True point, but, you know, still, it could be something like that.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.660
That's all.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.660
Okay.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.100
So, Microsoft, as well as everyone else, is pretty much getting up on HD DVD.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:53.620
Rightly so, they have stopped supporting their HD DVD players.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:57.180
They will, of course, still warranty the product and stuff like that, but they're no longer

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.460
manufacturing them.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.860
In other news, and, you know, this hasn't really made it out there that well, other

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:10.740
than a rumor, they have dropped the price of $50, you know, and that's official, so...

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.420
So, you're gonna actually get one so I can hang out with my laser disc player and the

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.420
Betamax in our closet.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.420
I mean, if you're looking for something cheap...

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.620
I kind of laughed because I saw an ad on the Xbox 360 not even, like, six hours ago that

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.780
said HD DVD player now only $129, and I just kind of snickered.

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.780
Yeah.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.020
There's a lot of good movies out on HD DVD, though, but...

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.020
$50.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.020
Good luck finding them, though.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.500
I know GameStop's not carrying them anymore and they're not selling their movies.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.220
In fact, they had a pretty good deal, buy two, get two free type thing, but...

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.220
Damn it.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:46.060
I need to start looking for these deals, because I need to stock up on HD DVDs now that my

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.300
player isn't gonna be able to do shit.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.460
I only own, like, four HD DVD movies.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.460
Yeah.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.460
Thank God I have Stardust.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.460
I love that movie.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.460
And Batman Begins.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.580
Oh, I hope that that comes out.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.300
See, I think if you can get a hold of one of these for pretty dirt cheap, I mean, just

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.300
hold out.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.300
It's just like UMDs, man.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:05.940
Those UMD movies, they're dirt cheap, because no one wants them, and, you know, people start

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:10.980
trying to get rid of these things and I think you'll be able to find them pretty, you know,

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.980
cheap.

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:15.020
Plus, I mean, there's no real difference between those and Blu-ray movies anyways as

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:19.500
far as, you know, image quality goes, so I don't think you're gonna notice.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.980
Well, I don't know about some of you guys, but me as somebody who picked up an HD DVD

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:29.420
player, I'm mad that it's all over and that makes me angsty and that means it's time for

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.420
the FUs of the Week.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:53.940
My FUs of the Week goes towards this stupid, clearly compensating for something, man driving

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.100
a truck.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.020
We had a very, very rainy day.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:06.100
It was very rainy, very windy, kind of nasty, and there's this one particular turn where

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:10.780
it's a little sharper than I think that it needs to be to turn, and it's pretty much

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:17.540
a two-lane left turn, and so this one guy was in the inside lane and I was in the outside

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.540
lane.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:25.420
Well, when we turned in, he basically cut me off in the middle of the turn, which isn't,

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.820
you know, just rude.

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.060
It's incredibly dangerous.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.340
It's something that only an idiot would do.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:39.060
So he cuts me off and then he starts to spin out, and then I start to spin out because

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:44.860
I was trying to, you know, avoid the tail end of these retarded, you know, small penis

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.340
truck.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:54.940
So in his spinning out and me losing control, and I actually, I, you know, steered into

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.940
it and managed to get myself straightened out.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:03.780
By the time I got my car, you know, back lined up and everything was fine, he swung out again,

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:11.420
and if I hadn't stopped when I did, then he would have pretty much taken off my bumper.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:17.940
So the other really kind of scary part about this is that, you know, there's that, well,

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.580
I'm sure those of us in the room know, there's that ditch on the side, and I didn't want

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.580
to go in that ditch, that would have gotten my car dirty.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:34.740
But it was just really the fact that there are people who should have to take psychological

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.020
exams before they are permitted to drive.

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.820
That's what I have to say.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:48.060
This person driving this truck was clearly of poor judgment, very, very poor driving

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.180
skills and substandard intelligence.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.540
So F you to stupid people who drive.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.580
My FUs ought to be pretty obvious this week, F you to being sick, F you to my car not working

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:06.620
completely right when I pay a lot of money for my car, and F you to the Wi-Fi here not

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:10.060
working and just F you to February.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.060
That's it.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:18.220
F you to my 360 sort of working, or at least playing games with me, and once I think it's

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:22.780
working, you know, I've tested it extensively, I take it to work, it starts up, ten seconds

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.500
later it freezes.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.900
It really fucking pisses me off because I can't figure out what's wrong with it, although

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:34.020
I'm getting close to where there's nothing more I can fix on it, so I'm going to have

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:38.620
to cut a hole in the side of it, just because I think that's necessary that I get the Dremel

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.620
out.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.220
And it'll look cool.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:46.340
As it is, it sounds like a jet coming out of that thing now that I've, you know, twelve

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.660
of modded the fan.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.700
Alright, is that it?

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.420
Yeah, and that broke an intercooler too because I took it apart.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.420
Is that it?

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.420
Yes, but...

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.420
That's fine.

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:03.020
Alright, let's keep moving on with the news.

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.980
You know, for supposedly being a short show tonight, I don't think we're going to be that

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:06.980
short of a show.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.980
We'll see.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.780
It's just kind of like one long show.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780
That's right.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.780
It'll be fun, right, Jamie?

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780
Fun?

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.060
Yeah, fun.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.060
We're having fun, right?

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.060
The more you have fun, the more drunk I am.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.060
No, I'm kidding.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.060
Right.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.060
Anyway, um...

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.660
We're fans of the Commodore 64, wouldn't you say?

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.660
Fuck yes we are!

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.660
I love the Commodore 64.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.660
By we, I mean Rob.

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:29.660
I get...

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.460
The Commodore 64 was my first gaming system, okay?

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:37.060
I mean, I had an Atari 2600, but I played tons of games on Commodore 64.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.060
I love the C64.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.060
My first one makes me cry.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.940
It was the Odyssey.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940
That would make me cry too.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:51.900
Anyway, the Commodore 64 is coming to the European Virtual Console later this year.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:58.060
The first two games to be out are Iridium and International Karate.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:06.500
So it looks to me like they're also going to be charging for them 500 Wii points.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:12.900
There's not any kind of notice as if we're going to be getting them over here.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:21.580
And I think the other thing that they've recently announced is Master System games.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.380
I hope some of the classic Commodore 64 games come out, but then again, I think about it,

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:29.300
and a lot of the games I played on Commodore 64 were ports of arcade games and things that

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.340
are out in various other types of ways now, so I don't know.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.140
But there were some old C64 games that were kind of fun, but a lot of them required a

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.140
keyboard.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140
I just want Impossible Mission, okay?

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140
That's what I want.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:44.380
I want more than anything.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.740
Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel, or is it?

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.460
It seems like they've taken a game that was already in development and slapped the Puzzle

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.180
Quest name on it.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:15:00.260
The game is called Galactrix, and it's now being called Puzzle Quest Galactrix.

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:04.340
Is it possibly D3 just using the Puzzle Quest name to sell copies of a game that might not

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.540
have sold much otherwise?

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:13.100
I don't know, but it looks interesting, because now instead of having squares in a more bejeweled-ish

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:18.500
type of setting, now it looks like you have hexagons, and I don't know if it's hexic or

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500
what the deal is.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.500
It's Galactrix.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.500
It's not hexic.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.740
It's clearly different.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:28.300
But apparently now it has a whole sci-fi theme as opposed to a fantasy theme.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.100
You know what?

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.100
I don't know.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.380
I'm going to withhold judgment until I play it.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.980
It does look like it has spells and all that good stuff from the old one, but you know

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.780
what they say about too much of a good thing.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.900
Don't oversaturate the market with all these sub-par puzzle games that you slap the name

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.060
Puzzle Quest on or you're going to be in trouble.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.060
That's all I think.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.060
But I don't know.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.060
Puzzle Quest?

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.060
Bookworm Adventures?

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:49.060
This game might be kind of fun, so we'll see.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.780
Dude, Bookworm Adventures is rad.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780
Don't be knocking Bookworm Adventures.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780
Besides, there's two different people.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.340
You're talking PopCap Games.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:59.500
Somebody else that apparently likes to take PopCap Cans and remake them.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.180
Puzzle Quest is just like Bejeweled.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:05.900
I mean, that's the only reason Nelly plays it, so I don't know.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.660
Rob with Two Bees in Chat says, I want Puzzle Quest Pirates Booty.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.180
We need a good pirate puzzle game.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.300
Oh wait, we have puzzle pirates.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.740
So EA, being the pompous asses that they are, decided, hey, we're fucking EA.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.540
We're going to try to buy Take Two.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:22.500
We're going to offer you two billion dollars.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:34.660
Anyway, of course, Take Two looked at it and said, no, sorry.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.940
You know why I think this is interesting?

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.460
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Take Two own 2K games?

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.420
Yeah, Take Two owns 2K games.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:44.980
They also own Rockstar.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.220
Basically buying this would have EA would have a monopoly on those sports games.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.620
I was going to say, if that happened, EA would have a sports monopoly.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.260
That's crazy talk.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.660
No, that's EA talk.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.060
I mean, it's not surprising to hear about all these murders.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.260
Our games may not be great, but you have no other choice.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.140
I think it's interesting that Take Two just said, no.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.140
That's not good.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.220
When your companies look at being bought like that, though, sometimes it's not good.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.220
I mean, I don't know.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.220
Well, it was unsolicited.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.540
I mean, you know, they weren't saying, hey, who wants to buy us?

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:21.940
EA is just like, hey, we've got $2 billion.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:24.540
We want to buy you because Grand Theft Auto is awesome.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.940
But, see, that's the thing.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:32.780
I think 2K and Take Two, they may have had financial trouble earlier, but I think they're

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.100
going to make a turnaround, especially with Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.100
They're going to make all sorts of money with that shit.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.820
I don't know.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.540
This reminds me of the whole Microsoft Yahoo thing that's been going on the past couple

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.700
of weeks, where apparently Microsoft's been trying to buy Yahoo, but Yahoo's been kind

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.220
of saying no, or the stockholders have been saying no.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.220
Very interesting stuff.

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.060
It's like just because you have the money doesn't mean they're going to sell to you.

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.220
I mean, it's true.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:59.020
If I was Take Two, I'd be like, fuck you, I'm not going to sell my company $2 billion.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:03.380
Well, in other news, though, Orange Lounge Radio is up for sale for the highest bidder.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:06.200
We will take $2 billion, trust each.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200
I don't care.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:12.020
We'll put EA presents EA's Orange Lounge Radio by EA.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.020
I really don't care.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.540
We would sell out like that.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.300
I will talk, hell, presented by Madden, Madden's Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.620
I don't give a crap.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.860
$2 billion, man.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.500
I do whatever they want with this show.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.500
I quit.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:30.660
Can you imagine Madden's Orange Lounge Radio?

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.180
I'd be foaming at the mouth.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:36.180
Featuring the gay guy, the angry man, and the woman who...

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.020
We'll build a room of money.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.020
Who I love and adore.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.320
You want to know what sucks is that I wasn't thinking about what all to spend that much

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320
money on.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.540
I was thinking about, well, technically I was, but I was thinking pay off credit cards,

01:18:52.540 --> 01:19:00.820
pay off student loans, buy a house, and then move to Europe.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.860
Act Deaf has made the first bid for Orange Lounge Radio at $2.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.500
We need more money.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.620
Let's sell the station on eBay.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:09.860
That would be fun.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.900
Dude, you want to?

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:17.900
When we're ready to just call it quits, which, you know, we've been doing this six years.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.300
Who knows when it's going to happen?

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:23.140
When we finally decide to call it quits, I say we sell it all on eBay to the highest

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:33.260
bidder and just have a good...spend all the money on a goodbye party with crack and hookers.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:40.340
We should do random eBay stuff because it's like, I don't know if you know when they were

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:45.820
having all this stuff on the Gorillaz website, they actually sold 2D shoes on eBay.

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:46.820
Nice.

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.100
So we could do stuff like that.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.100
Like I have...

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.340
Okay, I need to say something.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.420
Chat room, knock it off.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.820
We didn't say the station is actually for sale, so bidding is not up to $50, okay?

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.820
Shut up.

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.820
I'll sell a date.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.820
I'll go out with somebody.

01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.820
You're married.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:03.500
So my husband will be fine with it.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.180
I get free food and we get money.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.180
What's bad about that?

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:12.780
I'll tell you what, Rob, because you know how that one Guitar Hero controller or Guitar

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:18.060
Hero game or whatever was sold for like thousands of dollars because some father took it away

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.180
from his pot smoking son, supposedly?

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:26.180
Well that copy of Bookworm Adventures, that copy was stolen from the President of the

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.820
United States.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.820
From his secret bunker where he's holding Bin Laden.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:36.620
I think that we should put that on eBay and see how much money we can get.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.780
And there's an image of the Virgin Mary in the plastic.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.260
Oh yes, there is.

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:47.660
By the way, just so that you know, there's a chance that we may have Dan next week.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660
Nice.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.660
Dan the man.

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:50.660
Yes.

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Have we even...

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.860
My God, in the six year history of the show, has Dan ever been on it?

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.860
Once.

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.860
Yes he has.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.860
Once.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:57.860
I wasn't there.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:58.860
Once.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.860
I wasn't there when it happened.

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.860
I think you were.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:01.860
No, it was a week that you...

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:02.980
I was gone and the show turned...

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.700
This is way back in the day before the podcast.

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:05.920
This is the day of the apartment.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.880
This was when you guys, you guys did the show from your apartment and you ended up watching

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.300
a biography of Ron Jeremy while the show was going on.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.300
No, Dan was at your guys' old place.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.180
Dan was at your guys' old place before.

01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.900
Oh, he did come to the show once there.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:21.900
That's right.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.060
Because we have the picture from the webcam.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.060
I remember that.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.060
I remember that.

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.060
That's true.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.580
The Ron Jeremy thing was great because we were like, dude, the stories are just not

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.580
all that great.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.580
Let's just watch porn.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.300
Or watch, you know, porn documentary.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.740
Oh, the days.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.700
The good old golden days of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.380
Rastiel Ute says, Loki, we know that's bullshit.

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.100
W.A. doesn't know what a book is, much less bookworms.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.860
Yes, but see, you know, it's cute and he likes cute things, so...

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.260
Hey, dates don't mean you have to go get nookie or anything.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.260
Chat room.

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.260
Pervs.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.900
All right, let's get to the mailbag segment of the show.

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.200
I'm sure the mailbag's very full after not having a show last week, so Dark Soccer's

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.860
had to be super selective in what she picks out to read tonight.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.900
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:20.800
Hi, so that Lucky Nuts guy emailed me back, the one who I was kind of upset with for my

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.740
comments about physics.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:31.540
So he said he was sorry for making me angry and they were just poking some fun.

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:36.960
I was just, I'm just going to let you know that I go on PMS-related tangents quite regularly

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.140
and if you're going to deal with women, you've just got to get used to it.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:49.900
We have that going on, although I have to say that it was more or less of a WTF moment,

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.940
so don't worry about it, whatever.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.940
So next actual email.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:58.100
Hi, O.L.R. team.

01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.100
We're a team now?

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.100
Yes.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.100
Okay.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.820
We put the EA in team.

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:07.060
Does that mean that we have to go on team buildings and have the company pay for lunch?

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.060
Maybe.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.060
We don't have a company.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.060
We're lunch money.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.060
Yeah, we do.

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:13.060
Anyway.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.660
I have been listening to the podcast since sometime last year when I discovered it while

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.580
browsing for websites that were formatted for the PSP.

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.220
Yeah, Lucky, another one.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:27.060
I won't go into a long dribble here, but suffice to say, I really enjoyed listening to you

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:31.060
rambling on about games, the Olive Garden, and Moist Cake.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.740
Since I travel a lot doing my job, it's hard to play all the games or even to keep up with

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:39.560
what's going on, what's coming out all the time, knowing that I'm missing out on something

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:46.060
but not knowing what is worse than listening to O.L.R. and hearing how great Burnout Paradise

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.220
and COD4 must be.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.320
So thanks Ego++ to you.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:56.900
The last few weeks, I have been riding a daily ferry from Margarita Island in Venezuela to

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.420
Coach Island where I'm teaching.

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:03.260
I'm a kiteboarding instructor, and that's when I usually get to listen to the podcast

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.740
on my PSP.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:09.680
Since I work in Spain during the summer months, I can't listen to O.L.R. live due to the time

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.620
shift, but if my internet connection doesn't fail on me this weekend, I might make it to

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.020
listen to you live this Sunday.

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.620
After all, Venezuela is at least on the same side of the globe.

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.020
Finally, a short question.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:25.220
You've already mentioned Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once, and I was wondering if you

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.580
could maybe get him over to the Skyline to drop in for a quick chat.

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.000
His video reviews are a weekly highlight for me, and I would love to see O.L.R. chat with

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
him for a while.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I doubt it.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
He's in Australia.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And busy.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It is.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Thanks and keep up the independent, informative, and very funny show.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.940
And this is from MVH808.

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:45.940
That was very nice.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.940
Thank you.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.940
Next email.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.500
Hey folks, at the O.L.R. headquarters.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.140
I've got two quick questions here.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:54.140
First is for Loki.

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:58.020
I know this show doesn't condone shady topics, but bear with me.

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:02.980
I originally purchased a Wii key for my Wii because people in my home like to mall discs,

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:07.100
and I'd rather have backup copies lying around than $50 discs.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.580
So what is your thoughts on this mod chip?

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:14.380
Well, which Wii mod chip do you use, and how hard is it to install one of these because

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:17.260
I have not the slightest experience in soldering?

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:21.860
Also, how many Subway sandwiches with white bread would I have to bribe you with to install

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:22.860
mine?

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.100
Do you use ham and cheese?

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.100
No.

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.100
No.

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.100
I have a Cyclo-Wiz.

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.540
I think it's Cyclo-Wiz V2, I don't know.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:36.900
Whatever the second series, V version 2, I think, is what it was.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:42.180
They're really friggin' tiny, and it was kinda scary trying to solder it.

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:48.060
But the thing about the soldering, though, is it actually, the one I have, it has a thing

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.100
called quick solder, and basically there's two points on the board that you fill up these

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100
holes with solder.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.320
Of course, you have to put flux on the board because the solder didn't want to stick to

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.380
it at first.

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.020
And then once you've got that on there, the chip is basically on there, and what you can

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:10.020
do is you tin two wires and solder them onto three really, really, really tiny points on

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.860
the board and connect it to the chip.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:21.100
It wasn't easy at all, and I got lucky, I guess, that it worked just fine.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.420
Just be careful, I guess.

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.740
But don't electrocute yourself.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.860
You're not going to electrocute yourself.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.500
And remember, you're going to void your warranty.

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:34.380
Yeah, you will void your warranty, but to be honest, I wouldn't worry too much.

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:40.500
Just worry about bridging stuff that you shouldn't, like, those three points on the board that

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.780
you would be soldering wires to are really close together, so if you put too much solder

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:49.500
on there, they will bridge each other, and it just won't work, but, you know, you can

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:56.960
always take the solder off there and also make sure you don't lift any of the traces

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.820
on there as well by putting too much heat on there.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:07.940
Just be careful, use really, really, really small gauge wire, like, I think I used 30

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.340
gauge wire, I think, I can't remember, really, really tiny stuff.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.340
And then...

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.620
An YR fan in chat confessed, I electrocuted myself once.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620
Be careful.

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.660
Just, yeah, be careful with that stuff.

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:23.540
I love the CycloWiz, I mean, they're the only ones that were running, you know, at

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:29.300
initially Smash Brothers, so I was able to import Smash Brothers that way, and also they

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.740
were one of the first to be able to use Super Mario Galaxies, so I like them.

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.060
Weeki's pretty good, I guess, because I was going back and forth between Weeki and CycloWiz,

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:43.940
but I ended up, you know, with a CycloWiz, so, you know, like I said, just be careful,

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:47.660
also if you don't own one yet, you're going to need a tri-wing screwdriver, so be sure

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.900
to buy one of those.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:55.100
We know about Nintendo and having specially assembled stuff.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.100
Yep, they love the tri-wing, I don't know why.

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:03.860
Well, the next question says, second question is a show related one.

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.740
I liked Puppy in studio last week when he actually spoke and enjoyed another perspective.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:12.020
I wondered as a permanent part of the show if you guys had ever thought about having

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.460
a fourth chair with a rotating guest.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:18.340
I mean, one person wouldn't always be relied on to be there and you'd always have a fresh

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.620
perspective from someone.

01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:23.460
I just thought it was a really cool idea and figured I would pitch it over there to sit

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.460
on.

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:30.980
Well, we do have guests fairly regularly, but...

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:36.140
Okay, my mic's been totally off that whole time.

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:38.900
Probably been able to hear me a little bit.

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:39.900
Shit, where was I?

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:43.900
Oh, yes, I was saying, I think the door is like already kind of open for people to come

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:48.460
in and, you know, have that, and I think the reason why we don't add a fourth guest permanently

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.260
is it just makes the kind of, like the credits and everything that goes in the show, it just

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.340
kind of makes it too long, you know what I mean?

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:59.100
And plus, you know, Loki and Dark Sakura have kind of, and myself, we've made this part

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.340
of our routine.

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:03.660
I mean, to have somebody else give up their Sunday, I mean, that's a lot.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.860
Every Sunday just about, I mean, give or take, obviously we weren't here last week, but give

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.500
or take every Sunday for the past six years, that's a huge commitment that not many people

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.500
can take.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:17.020
So it's hard to say we want to, you know, add somebody on a very permanent basis, but

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:21.820
the door's always open to our guests and I remember back in the day there were some people

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.500
that it seemed like they were here every week for a while.

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500
Yeah.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.740
I want to say like DDR Angel was here at least every other week for a while and when he was

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:36.980
here, Shane was here every week, you know, just depends on what's going on that week.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.700
It's more or less the, do I have anything else going on?

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:40.700
Let's go to OLR.

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:44.540
I've been trying to get other people to come on though, that's why I'm really hoping Dan

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:50.180
makes it next week because it'll be cool to kind of fuss at him, I think, inside into

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.940
my bizarre marriage, but anyway.

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.780
Love the show guys, hope Sakura is feeling better and this came from J-Rod and thank

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.540
you, I am feeling much better two weeks later.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:04.100
I was feeling like crap the other week, it was not pretty and also because I have to

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:08.260
read it, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.260
breadsticks.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.260
Nice.

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.260
Shall I move on?

01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.260
Sure.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:17.260
Hello, Rob, Jamie and Loki.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.660
Just thought I would chime in with my thoughts about the game you played last week, one versus

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.660
the chat room.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.540
That was the week you weren't here, Jamie.

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.540
I understand that.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.060
Just thought I'd fill that in.

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.060
Okay.

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:33.060
It was badass and officially my favorite game of the show.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:36.660
It allows all the live listeners a chance to play and win, not just the caller.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.220
For podcast people, it's fun too just because trivia gets you thinking.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.040
By the way, I agree with that person who said there should be a Bimani edition.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.140
Also three random thoughts.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:49.460
One, I laughed so hard at Rama's little loop.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:53.020
Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video remix.

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.020
Okay.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.520
Two, every time you guys spot a fly in the studio, you should all give a girly squeal

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.340
on the count of three just for shits and giggles.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.260
It hasn't been that bad lately, actually.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.260
This one's for me.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:06.940
It says you should call your mom and talk about the Wii with her on the show just because

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.460
Rob's talk with his mom a while back was hilarious.

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.460
All right.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.460
Enough with this email.

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.460
I'll be live soon.

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:13.460
That's from Osprey.

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:19.620
Well, I would say we should call my mama, but it's a quarter to ten right now in Alabama.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:23.980
Well, actually, I think my mom would be awake, but she would be winding down.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.300
Now, let's save it for Mother's Day.

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.300
Ooh, yeah.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.020
Let's call my mom on Mother's Day.

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.740
It'd be, hi, mom.

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:30.740
I'm in jail.

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.740
Wait.

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.860
I'm in Rob's garage.

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.020
Which is kind of like jail.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.180
Only more comfy with better insulation and computers.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:41.780
Even Gold Banjo in chat says I missed that one versus the chat room game.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:42.780
I hope you guys do it again.

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.780
We'll come back.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:45.100
The reception was very, very positive.

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.220
We will do that game again.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.220
Next email.

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.220
With more music, of course.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.620
Yes, with more variety of music next time.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.620
Next email?

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.620
Yes.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.620
Hey, OLR crew.

01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:58.900
I just wanted to say thank you guys for keeping this show, specifically the live show, going.

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:02.420
Sometimes I have horrible weekends, and this show for me is a nice escape from reality

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:06.260
and whatever fail comes my way during the weekend.

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:11.500
I never have anything to do on Sunday nights, so this show helps keep me from getting bored.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.840
I also want to give a shout out to DMN.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.840
Great show.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.840
Keep it up, too.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.300
The screwiness and the chat room cage match definitely brighten up my Wednesday nights.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:23.980
Even though you borderline abusively kick me, SacraMax and some other listeners, said

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.700
kicking only makes the show even better.

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.540
Dude, I'll kick you if you want.

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.540
You're in the chat room, aren't you?

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.540
Yeah.

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:30.540
Give me a kick.

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:31.540
I will in a minute.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.540
I'm going to finish.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.340
I'm at least going to read the email, and then I'll kick you so you can brace for it.

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.340
Okay.

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.980
Because this is GS68, by the way.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:38.420
Unless you want to do the honors.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.420
Sure, I'll kick them.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.420
Okay.

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:45.300
Finally, I would just like to give a shout out to the Orange Lounge chat room for being

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.020
the best friends I've ever met.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:51.740
I mean, yeah, you guys get crazy sometimes, but it's that craziness that keeps me distracted

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.620
from whatever is depressing me.

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.700
And if the depression is too big, it's nice to have an outlet for that.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.520
Hell, even when there's no show, I lurk in the chat room just to see who's inside and

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.980
join in whatever's getting discussed.

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:06.020
I just want to say that you guys, and girls, are a great bunch in makeup, a good 60 to

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:09.140
70 percent of the fun during the live show, and that I love you all.

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.140
Aww, sweet.

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:11.140
Aww.

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.140
That's nice.

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.140
Violin music.

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.140
Violin music.

01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:17.100
You guys are what set the difference between listening to this show live and listening

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.100
to it via podcast.

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.140
Here's to many more episodes of hilarious chat room moments, and then in, it says, takes

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.740
a shot of water, I guess.

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.020
I'm running out of non-alcoholic drink ideas.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:32.580
Anyway, great show, O-L-R-N-D-M-N, and thank you, PoundOrangeLounge, for keeping me sane

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:34.100
through the Sunday and Wednesday nights.

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.100
Love, GS68.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.940
That was a very sweet email.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:42.700
You know, comments like that, and the little groupies we have in Orange Lounge, our chat

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.700
room and everything.

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:47.060
Just, you know, keep us going, and let us know we're not wasting our time here, that

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:51.300
we really are, you know, letting people have a good time on Sunday nights.

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.820
It's just about having fun.

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.820
It's awesome.

01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820
Okay.

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.820
Well, next email?

01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.820
Sure.

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.060
Hi, Sky Dark Sakura, and last but definitely least, Loki.

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:03.300
Sorry I had to say that.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.860
I love you too.

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:10.100
I live in Australia, and I don't know if you've noticed over there, but I've become very irritated

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:15.660
at the fact that the Japanese gaming companies such as Square Enix see fit-to-release games

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:22.460
like Kingdom Hearts, and a few months later think to themselves, hey, I know how we can

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.060
rip off some people and piss off foreigners, and then release something like Kingdom Hearts

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.940
Final Mix.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.540
I don't know if they realize it, but not only are they missing out on an incredibly large

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.620
fan base, but they're leaving a great big gaping hole in plots for us.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:40.360
I understand that they may be busy, but really, think of the children.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.420
That was in bold text, by the way.

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.660
Also, I'd like to point out that I'm trying to spread the word to every online community

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:51.460
I'm in so that we can reach our goal with eye of judgment, or as it's more commonly

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.700
known, that piece of trash would rather burn.

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:58.820
Thank you all for something to keep me laughing on the bus in the morning with numerous strange

01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:05.380
looks, and as I'm listening to the podcast on my PSP, I shall try to get on the chat

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.300
room one morning and join in on the fun.

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.340
You're sincerely one-winged angel.

01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.060
All righty.

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:15.300
I'm glad to hear we're making the wheels on the bus go round and round.

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.300
We have more.

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.300
Okay.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:21.780
But this one's actually a poem.

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:24.140
Oh, yay, Poetic Emails.

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.420
By Strip Majong.

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.380
I love that name.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:28.380
That's great.

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.380
Okay.

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:33.380
This is called The Lay of OLR, or Damn It I Wish I Had Remembered to Upload Some Extra

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.220
Podcasts Last Night.

01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:40.940
I sit and stare at my computer screen and eat my workday lunch of fine cuisine.

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:46.020
I browse through my podcast list, which grows thin, wondering where my OLR has been.

01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.260
Is it Thursday already?

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:52.700
Far too long since last I heard that OLR theme song, or the classic Game of the Week segment.

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.700
No F's either.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.420
At traffic, none vent.

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.820
I direct my browser to the website and am reminded of why I'm in this plight.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:05.020
The OLR crew could not meet Sunday, for that real-life thing had to get in their way.

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.900
I sit back in my chair and give a sigh, longing for this show on which I rely, to help ease

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:15.140
the pain of a boring job, and yet no anger I can feel at Rob, DarkSakura, or Loki, since

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:18.860
these three give us so much entertainment for free.

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:25.460
And so to next week's show I now look toward, but for the moment, damn, I'm freaking bored.

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.460
Aww.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.340
Well, here we are.

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.340
We're back.

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.340
Hi.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.340
Heart, heart, heart.

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.460
And then someone wants us to put a song in rotation.

01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.260
What song's that?

01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:40.860
The Elder Scrolls IV intro song.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860
Guess what?

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860
It's already there.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.860
It's already in rotation.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:47.900
It's just that you're probably not listening quite long enough to actually hear it.

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.140
So it's actually there.

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:55.020
But does that mean they want to hear it on the show, or do they want to hear it in the

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.340
24-hour rotation that's on the station when we're not here?

01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:02.540
I'm thinking in the rotation, because, I mean, just suggesting a song to put in is what it

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.540
looked like.

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.140
And then the mailbox just went down, so that's the last one I'm going to read.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.140
Well, here, I'll give you a little taste.

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.460
There you go, that's all you get.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:18.260
All right, wonderful, yeah, it sounds like the Wi-Fi might be down in studio again.

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:19.260
It just came back.

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.820
That's the perfect time for that to happen.

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:22.820
All right.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.900
And finally, the computer that broadcasts out the signal for Live 365 and all that stuff

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:27.900
is wired.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.700
We actually have a ginormous wire that runs all the way out here into the garage just

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:35.380
for this computer so that we don't have those types of problems on here.

01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:40.140
So anyhow, one more story for you guys, and we're going to open up the Skype line, and

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:43.420
that has to do with Guitar Hero 3.

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:47.740
Activision is going to be offering refunds for the Wii version of Guitar Hero 3, yes,

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.060
all over that whole sound issue.

01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:54.300
Remember about how the sound was a mess, it wasn't actually the surround sound or whatever,

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:58.020
it was all mono sound or what have you?

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:03.140
Activision is offering refunds for that, so if you do not want to actually replace your

01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.500
disk, you can actually replace the disk with money.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.060
You can get a refund.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:13.060
So if that's something that interests you, check Activision's site for more details.

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:19.100
Although, seriously, just stick with the game, the game's fine.

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:22.580
But I understand, some of y'all have those big sound systems and things like that you

01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.660
don't want to cut back on all that.

01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.680
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for your telephone calls.

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:37.000
The number to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.380
The phones are open now, I just turned them on.

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.980
So go ahead and give us a call, and we will talk to you.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:46.980
We're going to take a couple calls tonight, not a whole lot of them, but I'm sure some

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:51.140
of our listeners have some things to say about things like DJ Hero, maybe the XNA, I'm really

01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.020
curious to see what you guys have to say about that.

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:56.380
Meanwhile, while we wait for the buffer and for folks to get the phone number and call

01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.580
in, do we have any last minute stories?

01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:59.580
Yes.

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:05.460
Magic the Gathering is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:10.180
So suck it, I have judgment.

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:15.620
Microsoft of course and Epic announce Gears of War 2 coming November 2008.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:19.740
No word on the details of what's going to be in that, but of course the Unreal 3 engine

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.060
has been enhanced and all fun stuff like that.

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.620
All right, let's go to a call.

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.620
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.620
Who's this?

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:27.620
Hello, this is RossDielUT.

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:31.900
Well, hello RossDielUT, what is on your mind?

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:35.100
Not much, not much, just a few things.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.960
First off, yes, I was going to mention the whole EA deal.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:49.340
I was incredibly relieved to hear that they rejected the EA's offer.

01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:54.120
I think we all know that it's basically they're trying to get rid of the NBA 2K franchise

01:39:54.120 --> 01:40:00.460
because the NBA has so far been resistant towards exclusivity talks and this is pretty

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.740
much all they have left.

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:03.960
I agree.

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.060
What better way to get rid of your competition than buy them out?

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:14.260
Yeah, but it's good to see that Take-Two realizes that sticking around and keeping their company

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:17.180
is going to make them more money in the long run.

01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:23.340
They already had a hit with Bioshock, they're going to have an enormous hit with GTA 4,

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:35.300
and NBA 2K is doing amazingly well, so there's really no reason to jump ship just yet.

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:40.540
I just think EA creates such a monopoly out there in the marketplace.

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:45.660
We're starting to get to this point where you've got EA, Activision, Nintendo, Sega,

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.980
Namco, Konami, and there's less than ten at this point, you know what I mean?

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.460
It seems like back in the day there were a million.

01:40:52.460 --> 01:41:00.100
It hasn't gotten that bad yet, but that is the direction we're going and it is sort of

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:06.380
sad because you see that happen and pretty much innovative game ideas would be impossible

01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:08.380
under that environment.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:16.100
We all saw what EA did to Origin, Bullfrog, and Westwood.

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:22.900
People just have to remember that they also don't have to buy Madden every single year.

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:26.980
The thing is, I don't think it's gamers who buy Madden, it's sports fans.

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:32.060
They probably don't buy anything else, which is why EA doesn't really have to try.

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:33.700
I think you're absolutely right.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:38.420
I think that's the whole reason an Xbox 360 core edition exists is for those people.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:43.300
There are people that bought an Xbox 360 for Madden and that's it, you know what I mean?

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.340
And that's it, and that's not going to be a market for third parties, and I think most

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:53.220
third parties realize that, because that's probably what, two million people?

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:59.660
That's what Madden sells, are you like one million and a half, two million every year?

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:02.460
I don't think the only people that buy Madden are those type of people.

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:05.060
It's probably a certain percentage.

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:08.380
Probably there's a percentage of that million that buy nothing but Madden and maybe the

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:14.180
other occasional sports game like the basketball game or the street or underground editions

01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.780
and racing games here and there, that's it.

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:21.100
But yeah, that's clearly not the majority of the gaming audience and I would really

01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.820
hate to see the entire industry screwed up by that.

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:33.340
Although I do see a silver lining, we all saw what happens when the actual talent leaves

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.860
and they rebrand.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:39.900
If I remember correctly, Molyneux was part of Origin originally, if I remember correctly,

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.700
and then he went on to form Lionhead.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.260
I think you are correct.

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:50.160
So I think we're going to see that eventually, especially with a lot of studios like BioWare.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.060
They don't do a lot of sequels, they might just stick around to complete Mass Effect

01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.500
and then be out, just pack up and rebrand.

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.420
You see that a lot in this industry.

01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:02.580
That's very true, you do see a lot of guys getting up and leaving.

01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:04.300
Especially for EA.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:09.500
Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.620
Just a personal note about the show itself.

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:17.540
I do enjoy the show, but I do have to say this.

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:27.000
I do wonder why we get so much into the mod talk, like the letter segment.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.860
That guy was making a flimsy excuse, we all know he wants to steal Wii games.

01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:39.580
I don't see why you guys have to serve, basically, thieves.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:45.260
That always troubled me and as much as I like the show, that always sort of tugged at me

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.140
a little bit.

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:51.660
I think from our perspective, this show is about the gaming community and all the things

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:56.520
that are going on in the community, the good stuff and the stuff behind closed doors.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.260
So whether that guy was being honest or not, I suppose we'll never know.

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:05.740
But I think it is important sometimes to talk about what goes on in the whole dark side

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:13.100
and gaming and all that stuff to see how the companies respond to that or how they don't.

01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:17.340
For instance, I find this whole thing back and forth with Sony and the people that hacked

01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:21.340
the PSP back and forth, I find that whole thing hilarious, honestly.

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:26.460
In a way, I shouldn't say hilarious, but I find it fascinating how constantly Sony patches

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.580
it and somebody breaks it.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.340
That whole is so interesting to me.

01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.340
But certainly...

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.340
I can certainly see where someone would find that interesting.

01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:40.300
I just find it disgusting because you see the turnaround, PSP software doesn't sell

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.220
as well as it should, at least until recently.

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:47.100
There are good PSP games and they don't do well.

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:52.580
And now you see the same thing is going to start happening with the DS as the R4 gets

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.740
more popular.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.620
Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer.

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:05.380
Well, I think at the same time, though, us not talking about it is not going to make

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.380
it go away.

01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:11.660
Oh, it's not going to make it go away, but the last thing anyone needs to be doing is

01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:15.380
giving tips of all things.

01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.020
At that point, you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.020
All right.

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:22.740
Well, we've heard your opinion and hopefully you've heard ours, so thanks so much for the

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.740
call as always.

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:24.740
All right.

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:25.740
Have a good night, buddy.

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.740
All right.

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:27.740
Bye-bye.

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:28.740
Take care.

01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:29.740
All right.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:36.740
Thank you so much for the call, and we'll see you next time.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:46:02.220
Bye-bye.

01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:10.220
Bye-bye.

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:10.220
Bye-bye.

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:40.220
Bye-bye.

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:09.220
Bye-bye.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:10.220
Bye-bye.

01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:39.220
Bye-bye.

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:10.220
Bye-bye.

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:38.220
Bye-bye.

01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:05.220
All right.

01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:12.220
Well, anyway, we just could not end the show if we did not have an opportunity to respect our elders by paying tribute to a classic game as we do every week here on the program.

01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:16.220
It's time for Dark Sakura to bring in her classic game of the week.

01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:27.220
The classic game of the week is one that I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on.

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:39.220
It's definitely one of the top games in the side-scrolling shooter genre, and that is none other than R-Type.

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:43.220
R-Type is great.

01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:52.220
In fact, I'd have to say that R-Type is probably my favorite shooter, even though I'm not all that great at it.

01:58:52.220 --> 01:59:00.220
This music is like the best ever. The first level music is so much my favorite in the game.

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:03.220
So what sets this shooter apart from other games, Dark Sakura?

01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:07.220
This particular shooter has a very unique weapon system.

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:15.220
You get this item called the Force, which is, since you're watching the clip, you see that ball that's right in front of it.

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:25.220
You can pick up different power-ups for ones that make it grow based on different types of energy power-ups you pick up.

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:34.220
You have a red one that's a counter air laser. That's the one that's on right now, the blue and red sort of spiral-looking laser.

01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:40.220
You also get a rebound laser that shoots these thin beams that bounce off the walls.

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:43.220
Certain weapons are better for certain stages.

01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:50.220
You also get the counter ground laser, which is basically like a flamethrower that goes out on the ceiling and on the ground.

01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:55.220
Which is a very, very, very good thing to have for the third boss.

01:59:55.220 --> 02:00:00.220
Well, actually for the third level, because the entire level is the boss battle.

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:13.220
The other various things that you can get are these little spheres that will float above and below your ship that will shoot missiles for you.

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:19.220
The other cool thing about the Force attachment is that you can move it around.

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:31.220
By the way, the ship one is the third level. You can fire it off and have it sort of hang in mid-air, although it will try to reattach itself.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:38.220
But you can have it attached to the back of your ship and fire the weapon from the back and you can have it attached to the front.

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:46.220
In fact, a lot of the bosses are supposed to be really hard, but they all have a trick to them.

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:55.220
Like the first one, there's one place where nothing will hit you and you just fire off the Force thing and it will just kill the thing for you.

02:00:55.220 --> 02:01:10.220
One of the stages is you fight this heart of this creature and there's a place where you can nestle your ship in and fire off the Force thing by the place where the little heart of it pops up.

02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:19.220
You don't get hit, you kill off all the tentacles and otherwise it's a really intensely long, annoying battle.

02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:29.220
The game is so hard. I mean, I have often completely died in the first level. I am not the best R-Type player.

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:37.220
But I have, however, seen my husband beat this game on one credit and that is hardcore.

02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:43.220
And on top of that, I've seen someone beat it in the arcade on an actual single quarter.

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:51.220
I notice our chat room is in a little bit of a Gradius versus R-Type debate. Care to comment? Is there room for both games or is one better than the other?

02:01:51.220 --> 02:02:07.220
It's all a matter of what you prefer because Gradius is a different style of shooter, I think. Honestly, and this is again just my opinion, I think it takes a more skilled player to play through R-Type.

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:14.220
I really think it takes a lot more skilled and patient of a player to play R-Type.

02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:29.220
And of course, we've had many sequels since then. We've had, if I am correct in order, after this came, we had R-Type 2 and then, God, there was some other game.

02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:40.220
Let's see, Super R-Type came out, R-Type Leo, R-Type 3, R-Type Delta, R-Type Final and there's recently been an R-Type Tactics game which still completely boggles me.

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:47.220
That's coming out over here in April. R-Type Command. There's still a lot of love for R-Type out there.

02:02:47.220 --> 02:03:09.220
But this is put out by Iron which, I'm sorry, this is still my favorite game. I actually have the versions of this, the home versions. My favorite version is the TurboGrafx one because it is probably the closest apart from playing it on PlayStation that you'll get to the arcade version.

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:21.220
It came out on two HuCards and a little bit of trivia is that when on the Japanese Virtual Console, you actually still have to download R-Type in both parts as opposed to one.

02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:33.220
And they came out with an R-Type Complete or something that was a PC Engine duo combination that had the entire thing uncut.

02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:50.220
Also, other games that were rumored to have been spawned by R-Type though were Polestar, although Polestar actually dates back to the very early 80s, but a lot of the gameplay in Polestar is a lot like R-Type.

02:03:50.220 --> 02:04:04.220
Also, a game called Resnon that came out in 91, very similar. A Magic series core, the game called Magic Dragon that was supposed to be almost everything exactly like R-Type with redone sprites.

02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:18.220
We haven't seen that before in Super Mario 2. Also, for the game Turrican 2, you actually can see the force in a hangar and the third level of that game is based on R-Type.

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:30.220
And another game, and this is actually, I almost picked this as my classic game, but it's a little on the obscure side. It's a game called, if I'm pronouncing it right, Zexes, which is just spelled X-E-X-E-X.

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:42.220
And we got it in America as Orius, it's a Konami game. And it's also that same type of shooter game. So, very, very classic. Very good game.

02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:49.220
Alright. I have my love for Gradius, especially Gradius 2, don't get me wrong, but R-Type.

02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:56.220
There you have it. Your classic game of the week is R-Type, which you can check out a version of that on the Virtual Console if you are so inclined.

02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.220
And I believe that's available in all the different regions.

02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:03.220
I do believe so. Just remember, if you are in Japan, you have to pay for two of them.

02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:12.220
Alright. Well, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for tonight's short show, although it wasn't much of a short show. We've been here for over two hours, so it's almost like just doing one long show with no break.

02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:18.220
So, you can't say you got ripped off this week, but I am definitely spent. I am done. I'm ready to go rest.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:23.220
So, we're going to wrap it up and go around and give everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:31.220
I'm going home and hopefully going to be able to play some Lost Odyssey since everything tonight's reruns, except for the Food Network. They have new stuff on there.

02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:38.220
My final thought is medication. Menthol. Cough drops. Hooray. Dark soccer, your final thought?

02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:43.220
Let's have tea will kill me if I don't say it, so reject false icons.

02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:48.220
