00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, February 3rd, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could the Playstation 3 hard drive be getting even bigger?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
New Animal Crossing and Kirby games are rumored for release this holiday

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
And did Spore's release get pushed back yet again?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that podcast on DARE internet

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Say hello to the one and only

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Cuddly DarkSakura

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
She's not like her internet persona in real life

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
She's actually very sweet, right?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
If you add lots of sugar

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Alright, and how are you doing Ms. Sakura?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm frustrated with the mailbag

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm sorry to hear that, what did the mailbag do to you?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
It's being a bitch

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm sorry to hear that

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright, also joining us tonight

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Hello

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Hey, aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Nope

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
You can lick it off

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
That's right, you can lick it off, alright

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Exactly

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And I gotta say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Cause she has no idea who the eff we are

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Hey, you're pretty cool, you should come be on our program

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
But she's a real good sport, she's here tonight

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Give it up for Mo

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Hello interweb, why am I waving?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Huh?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Why am I waving?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Why are you waving?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Cause we do have an internet cam over there on Justin TV

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
So we make sure you get picked up on there

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
But how are you?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm nervous but super

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Why are you nervous?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
There's nothing to be nervous about

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
We don't bite much

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I don't trust her

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
She only doesn't trust dark soccer, right?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You've heard stories

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm nice

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, see, you're gonna fit right in

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
What does she do when she pisses off dark soccer?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
She goes hearts and it makes it better

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
She already knows

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's exactly what I do

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
She knows

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
She knows this gig already

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Alright, and the cowboy hat

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And by the way, Mo

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Uber famous on YouTube

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Uber famous?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay, I don't know about Uber famous

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Closai famous

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Closai famous

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
She's like an e-list celebrity on the internet

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yes

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
So she's here tonight

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
She's actually gonna play for us a cover

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
From the game portal

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Of Jonathan Coulton's Still Alive

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And she's very brave to be doing that live here on the radio

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So we're gonna give her a big OLR hug, right chat room?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Chat at orangeontotototototot.com

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Also joining us tonight

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Someone who's also new to the program

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
But doesn't seem to be quite as intimidated

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You know why?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Cause he's too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Which we have in the house

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
We'll talk about that a little bit

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Say hello to Jake

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Hello interwebs

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
How are you Jake?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Getting thrashed by Snake

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Alright, awesome

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And we're not gonna be able to use this mic to talk to Jake

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Or I might smash over poor Mo's guitar

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
And that wouldn't be good

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Brothers Brawl

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
In the house

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Brothers Brawl

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yes

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So this is something that we, you know, picked up

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
That anybody really can right now if they have the ability to play import games

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And it's actually, I kind of got lucky on eBay

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Cause, you know, it's been going for over $150 on there

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Just for an import copy

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Luckily though, I did find one

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And I had to do a double take on it

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
That was $49.99 and like $8 shipping

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So I was like, I'm jumping on that

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Wow, nice

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
So I bought it

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And sure enough, it was legit

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So, you know, that's awesome

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Very cool

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know why anyone else didn't see this auction

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Seeing it as a buy it now for $49.99

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm like, that's even cheaper than getting it on Playasia

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
So, you know, I'm definitely, this game I think is worth buying twice

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
So I will be playing the Japanese copy until the US one comes out

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Alright, we'll talk about your thoughts a little more on the game

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
When we get into How Was Your Gaming Week

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But for right now, we're gonna move on over into that segment

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
How Was Your Gaming Week

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
But you know us ladies first

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
So we're gonna let DarkSakura kick it off with

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
How Was Your Gaming Week

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
My gaming week was actually very not

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Because it's just, you know, point and click

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
That type of thing

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So, yeah

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I didn't even play any pinball

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
No pinball?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No pinball

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Oh my gosh

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Same reason

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Wow, well sorry to hear about that

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise though

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Very cool, what did you think of what you saw?

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I thought that I really really really really really really like crashes

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And I like the super jumps

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Very cool

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Like the really long ones where you get the different angles

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
And I'm like Dukes of Hazzard go

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
It was cool

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Good times

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Alright

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Well hopefully you'll be back up and running soon

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Your middle finger will be back in commission

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And you can flip people off and all that good stuff

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I wake up in the morning all double horns

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So it's not all bad

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
She rolls out of bed ready to rock

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yep

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And you know if it were more fingers it would be too much metal for one hand

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Awesome

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Alright

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Loki we'll go over to you, how was your gaming week?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Put down the controller

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
My gaming week was fine

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
You are not trying to do this and play at the same time

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You are not

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
You can leave it alone for five seconds

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Hey I'm not playing it

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Alright you know so we were fixing it

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Fine

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I thought you said that wasn't cheating

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It's not cheating it's exploiting the game

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Exactly

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh you said cheat not cheat

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
So my gaming week I've been playing Burnout Paradise

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Which is awesome because I have this vendetta against Dan

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Unfortunately Gunstar Hero

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
Because he keeps beating my times or my show time amounts

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
The Road Rules ones

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah the Road Rules ones

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah he keeps beating my crashing ones

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
So I go through and specifically go and beat his

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He's not actually doing it on purpose

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I know

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
We talked about it

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I know

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Well the whole reason he did the Road Rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs and that was it

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
And he wanted the car

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah well I understand that but I have to beat everybody on my friends list

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
So that's why I've been going through and doing that

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Well if you tell him it's a competition he will compete

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It was fun

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I love the game it's great just crashing everything

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Which kind of gets me to my other topic here

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I had another 360 die

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Three rings

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
No I had to overheat it quite a few times

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Sounds hot

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
This next time though it's not going to be pretty

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about 1000 degrees

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
It will work or it will melt

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
One of the two

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And then let's see what else did I get

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh actually I imported another game

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's a game called

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
God I don't remember what it's called now

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I was going to say while you're thinking about that for your Xbox 360

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
You know Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's like popping randomly in the left speaker

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Put it in a little floaty boat

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Set it on fire

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm not ready to give up on it yet

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Because I've gotten it to work for half an hour at a time

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
It's just so weird because it will work perfectly

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I think oh great it's fixed

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
And then I'll turn it on three hours later and it will be three rings again

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I'll play through a game and it will be completely normal

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It can play it for about an hour or so

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And I'm like okay I'm confident this is working

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And then sure enough it stops working

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
So whatever

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I give up

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Anyways I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Other things I played other than that of course

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Smash Brothers Brawl

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Just started playing a bit of that

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
To be honest I'm not very good at it

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But it's cool

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It's a really cool game

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Like I said it's probably worth buying twice

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
So definitely check it out if you can

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
As soon as you can

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
We've actually unlocked quite a few players

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Because other than playing through space and emissary mode

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
You can actually just play the versus mode

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And one of the cheat things you can do is you can set up a special brawl

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Where the players have set hit points

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And then you drop the computers down the one

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
You put this thing on where the hit points drop gradually

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
So immediately the computer dies

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So that's kind of fun I guess

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
It's like watching paint dry but it unlocks characters so that's good

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's see what else they play

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Res HD

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh my god is that awesome

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Playing that on a surround sound system

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh yeah

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
That is some good stuff there

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Absolutely love that game

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's see

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh now this is the game I imported for the Game Boy Advance

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Dot Stream is the name of it

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It's one of the bit generation titles

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Erase Lines

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And it's actually pretty fun

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Cheap little titles like 20 bucks

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
But I'll have to show you Rob some of it a little bit later

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And that's pretty much it

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Awesome

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Well it sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I try

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Well I want to go to our guest Moe

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And see what Moe's been playing this week

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Now Moe you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
You do actually play video games

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
You work in video games

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You're a gamer girl right

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes I am

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
You sure are so don't doubt it

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So what kind of games have you been playing this week

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
And there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Which is very depressing because it looks awesome so far

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But I'm a really crappy shot

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Awesome

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Very cool

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
So you've been very busy

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Since somebody's borrowing my 360 copies still

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
My bad

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
He's better on PC

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
No actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't know if I mentioned it before

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
Was that I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
The actual 3D model because I want to make one

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
But I haven't gotten around to that yet

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Now Moe are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm a PC player

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Why is that you just prefer that you think it's more of a keyboard mouse type game

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Or are you like Xbox sucks or what

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I have a 360 I love my 360

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
But I cannot do shooters on console at all

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm a terrible shot I cannot play Halo for the life of me

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Gotcha

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Alright

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh I forgot I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Because god damn commander whoever's stuck

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You know holding his arms out with a gun in his hand

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
They won't trigger the last scene

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I really hate that game at the end at least

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
The rest of the game is awesome it's just the end fucking sucks

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Seriously

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Alright

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Well I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And then Jake do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
As soon as I'm done here

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
He's gonna be a pouty face

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Let's see

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
My gaming week was pretty much Res HD all freaking week

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
I agree with Loki Res HD is a beautiful game and it's time for Res to make a little bit of a comeback

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
You know it was a little bit fuzzy on the Playstation 2 and the Dreamcast

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Not that it was bad but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful beautiful HD

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
And the sound system and everything it's just gorgeous

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
For real I just love Res and it's a beautiful game and the graphics are great

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I mean it's only like 10 bucks so it's a great deal I think it's probably the best

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet honestly

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm totally in love with Res HD

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
That's really it otherwise I've been playing Warcraft still because I'm a big nerd

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
SassyPants my level 70 character who's awesome

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
And she now has a sister named SassyLama who is a shaman I just made that so

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And if you don't know what that means you gotta check Urban Dictionary

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So there you go

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Anyway we gotta, Loki you gotta give Jake your mic

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Jake now you're new to the program right?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
But you're a gamer too right?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Well I'm not a gamer

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah you've just been attached to Smash Bros. Brawl all night

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
What kind of games do you play? What have you been playing this week?

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I was in Baltimore all week so I've been playing Rock Band

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And lots of Rock Band

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And more Rock Band up until like midnight on Wednesday

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
What do you love so much about Rock Band?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Character creation, the party aspect

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You get four people in a room just rocking out it doesn't compare to anything else

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Barbie mode is awesome in Rock Band seriously I love Barbie mode

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Hey dress up mode

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes you get to dress up my characters and take them shopping it's awesome

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You play a lot of MMOs though?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Too many

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Like not just Warcraft what other kind of MMOs have you been playing?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I slowly got addicted to EverQuest 2 unfortunately

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Sucker

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So people actually play EverQuest 2?

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Quite a handful there's like 10-15 servers and a couple are actually full now and then

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
What makes EverQuest 2 so dang popular?

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
It's less easy mode it's a little more it's like wow only more difficult as far as I can tell

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Deeper craft system lots more race to choose from

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2 correct?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
And a frog and a rat

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
That's pretty awesome

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And the head of the dragons

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Cool

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
What else what else what other MMOs you been playing?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Well aside from wow Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa is all about because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me which wasn't a whole lot so

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Essentially it's a third person shooter MMO

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
You go around you blast aliens instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and what not

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there or is there something you can compare it to or?

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
There's not much you can compare it to aside from like a tactical shooter because you can actually use cover effectively and

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Alright

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It's hard to describe though as far as that goes

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Gotcha

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Alright

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
So you recommend all these games do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs they should?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Definitely

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Now wait a minute you play three different MMOs but you do have a day job right?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I think so

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
And you do go outdoors once in a while?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm here

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
So you break the stereotype?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yes

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Alright excellent I'm glad to hear you have a healthy balanced lifestyle that's great

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Doubtful

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Alright

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
Also chat orange launch radio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight. We'd love to hear what you guys have to say

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl which is going on right now during our program

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Although I would think you know either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that or you came over here watch this

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway so most people for most people Super Bowl is long passed over

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
Son of Dad says Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target so I guess Tabula Rasa is not selling too well

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
Hitstun praising Res HD Hitstun says Res HD is awesome and have a 360 and don't already have Res you'd be stupid not to pick this up

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on Res HD because they didn't they didn't have or they already had a previous copy of Res on Playstation 2 or Dreamcast

16:04.000 --> 16:12.000
Tigerclaw says Skye I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Res HD not quite but I had to do the trans vibrator mode

16:12.000 --> 16:22.000
I almost picked up three different controllers for that but I didn't have three different controllers at my house so I tried just the controller I was playing with and that was just kind of eh

16:22.000 --> 16:34.000
Eh it's regular well I have the controller I was playing with and then my wireless so I put the wireless on my back cause that's what you know Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do is you should put one towards your lower back and it's actually kind of freaky

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
But it's like a free back massage while you play video games so it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music it's certainly an experience I'll say that

16:42.000 --> 16:53.000
So let's see Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Brothers Brawl in house he says turn it off it's rude to play games that we non importers don't have yet

16:53.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm sorry dude I don't know what to tell you we really want to play dude blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release that's what I say

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
It's alright they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Alright that's right cause they're having problems aren't they

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
They're a little short yeah

17:12.000 --> 17:26.000
Well actually no seriously it is just a little short because they they only fulfill I forget how much of it not much like 20% of the preorders but the rest are coming next week so

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out

17:28.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah it's not that bad I mean and every major like Nintendo title has been short anyways with Mario Galaxy was like that Zelda I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here

17:40.000 --> 17:53.000
Mario Kart and the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels it'll be something stupid and arbitrary that's you know holding the whole thing up I don't know

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
So Nintendo seems to be having production issues just left and right at first you can't crank out enough Wii's and they can't crank out

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
A little random factoid though this is the first dual layer disc that's on the Wii

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
Well I imagine with all the shit they have in this game it's got to be a pretty full disc

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah you have to run an update once you get it so

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Wow

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
Thank you Nintendo now I have two news channels and two weather channels both of which I still don't use so that's awesome

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Weather channel's awesome

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Do you actually use the weather channel Mo?

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
When I feel like seeing what the temperature is in Johannesburg Africa

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Or is it just for spinning the plane?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I like to listen to the music and spin the globe because I'm stupid

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah sometimes that's fun

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Especially if I've been drinking a little bit

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
Sometimes you're curious about how cold it is in Russia at the time or you know how nice and warm it is in Puerto Rico

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Or how cold does it get at the South Pole that kind of stuff fascinates me

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It's fascinating

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole? These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
Alright let's see Portal Combat in our chat room says I want Portal Song now

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Hey how does it feel to want?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You've got to wait

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Patience is a virtue

19:06.000 --> 19:15.000
And also because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and you know is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
You know we could have like hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard she didn't know

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
So she's very brave to come here

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
So once we get past part A and the musical performance we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So once the song is performed there will be cake

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
From the chat room

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Globe Band just says you want song 2 do you know any blur?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know maybe I can do it I can wing it

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
Now you actually do other songs besides just video game stuff right?

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Portal was just a whim one of my friends was like hey you should try doing the Still Alive song

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
And then I looked up the chords and like tapped it out and I was like wow this is really easy

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
And I had a digital camera and I'm like hey I can put my YouTube account to use

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And now it has like 31,000 views

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Isn't it crazy how the internet works?

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Nice well congratulations that's pretty awesome to see you know somebody literally out of their bedroom

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
I mean that's I think that's why we wanted to reach out and like get you in

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
My room is such a mess

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
No because literally where did this show start out of our you know my spare bedroom

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And Loki and I lived together for a little while we were doing the show out of our living room

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
So you know it's just with I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
People can see my like drums from rock band behind me and then like the mess on my floor

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
They can see my posters

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Well next time you need to cl- and somebody here in the Justin TV chat

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Somebody was I don't know being a troll and said something about who decorated this place

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
An 11 year old girl so you know people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
So because I'm so sure an 11 year old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I would have when I was 11

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Oh maybe

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
When I was 11 I think I had gremlins

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Alright let's I think I had Legos

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Alright let's get to the gaming news and then we can I promise we will get to the portal song

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
But we got it we got to tease it a little bit and get to get some news out of the way first

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Also just want to give some quick plugs if you don't know already we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
We have a MySpace MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and a Facebook community is there too

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
If you search for the OL army is our Facebook community too so social networking whores that's us

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So check us out on those different websites

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That's that let's get to the gaming news Loki

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
Alright well as we talked about last week there's rumors going around that the 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 system is being phased out

21:47.000 --> 21:54.000
And of course we know that's true with Best Buy and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
Well now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
SKU that's going to have a 120 to 160 gigabyte hard drive

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
All for the same price point of $499

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
And if you think about it that makes perfect sense seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Right around the corner

22:21.000 --> 22:30.000
And you know it's kind of funny how we laughed before like you know back when Kuteragi was talking about

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
Oh yeah it's going to be like a PC we're going to upgrade it you know all the time you know it's going to be constantly changing

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
And we're like ah that's stupid you're an idiot and sure enough they keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing

22:45.000 --> 22:53.000
So like you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Hey

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
That uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their chips to the hard drive

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
They're future proofing it okay someday there will be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
When home finally comes out it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
That's right

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
You're going to need room for all that SingStar

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
In 2010 when home finally comes out you're going to need that you know 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah who's going to say

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I can't

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Yes

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Yes

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
It's Studio 54 all over again

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
Have you not done your homework Loki the internet is for porn

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And for piracy

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Well you can piracy

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Pirate porn

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Pirate porn

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Hey

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
There is a porn called pirates

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
There is a porn called pirates it was the highest produced like most expensive porn ever made

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
One of our lesbians has it

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Hold on hold on

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I've seen it it's actually pretty well produced

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity but she's a connoisseur of porn

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Apparently as well

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Hope to god my mom isn't watching this

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I know I was like your mom's not watching tonight right

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Hi mom

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Just kidding

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
We're wacky internet people

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Alright we tell jokes

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Anyhow

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Anything else you want to say about the Playstation

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
About the Playstation 3

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Stop making new skews it's confusing

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And all you're going to just convince people is well if I wait longer it'll be better

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You know that's

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
What are they going to get stuck doing

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Seriously

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
And how much you want to bet this new skew is just not going to have backwards compatibility what so ever on it

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Just like the 40

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yep just like the 40

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
They're just going to screw everybody

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh well

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game too

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Probably layer since it doesn't sell

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
That would make sense

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Awesome

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Hooray

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
Let's see and son of dad says in chat.orangelschatter.com

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Playstation 3 one year five skews no fucking games

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Hey there's Uncharted

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Orko says porn is greater than cake

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't know cake is pretty good

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
Of course that brings Isu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
Well actually it was funny while I was half asleep this morning

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Cause I was supposed to be awake for breakfast but I wasn't

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing burnout paradise

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
About the difference between going online on the xbox 360

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
As opposed to going online on the Playstation 3

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
How with xbox 360 it's just part of the experience

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It's there everybody is there

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
But with he was talking about going online with SOCOM

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
And saying how it was like you know filing your taxes

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
So if you're going to be an online player then having a PS3 isn't worth it

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
You know sometimes friend codes don't look so bad

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
When you put all that in comparison

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I mean it's like you know I don't know

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
One thing that the Playstation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Of course you remember that whole controversy

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
With you know there was OMG Sex was unlockable

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Speaking of porn was unlockable within the game

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And you know it was a whole hot coffee mess

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Well if you may remember when we last left off

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
There was a settlement that was going to happen

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Where you could actually replace your game

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
And you could get some sort of you know severance

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
For you know the horrific images that were displayed in your home unknowingly

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Because you didn't have to hack the fucking game to get them or whatever

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But anyhow if you want to know some details

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Take-Two has recently released the details on their website

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Now here's the thing

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
The settlement will offer different levels of compensation

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
Depending on your proof that a violated you know buyer may have to offer

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
So if you have an original copy of the game

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
You can get of course the replacement disc

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
If you have the receipt with it

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
You can get a $35 cash payment

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
As part of the settlement

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And if you have a credit card statement or check

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You get $17.50

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
If you get a disc, no receipt, $10

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
If you have no receipt and no game

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You can earn $5

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Sweet

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
So here you go

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
All you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I'll do it

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
That you purchased the game and you played the offending game

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And you know it hurt you

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It raped your fragile mind

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I don't know

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
You got to just swear that the game you know did things to your mind

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
You were not prepared for

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Some people enjoy that

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I mean I don't know if it's worth it

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
That is lunch at McDonald's for a day

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
$5 will totally get me a teriyaki

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Exactly

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Lunch on Take-Two everybody

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Lunch on Take-Two this week

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Enjoy

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
And hopefully

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That would totally buy me some hot coffee

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
You know

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
You know that $5 that you can get from

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
You know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Because it warped your freaking mind

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
That's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto IV

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
When it comes out

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Exactly

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
It pays for your pre-order

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Exactly

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Exactly

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
To try and stake your claim to this

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Because you know once you get the $5

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
You're going to say

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
You need to pre-order the new game

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Right

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
No I'm just kidding

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Alright

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Let's move on with some more gaming

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Because hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
No it won't be

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Never

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
So in Gran Turismo

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
There's a hot coffee

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
No

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
But speaking of Gran Turismo

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
There's a fun little bit that's out though for $40

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Like I wouldn't pay for that

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
But

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Has an April 17th release date

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And it will have 60 cars

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
And you will get like

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Nissan

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
And Ferraris

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
And Audis

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Like you'd want an Audi

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
And different levels

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I believe there's 5 tracks

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And you can either download it

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Or pay for the disc

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
And with the disc you get a special video

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Awesome

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You know what that means

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
That means that you can buy a half done game

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
For $30 or $40

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
And then guess what

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
You can wait for the full game to come out

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
And then pay another $60

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Because you're a whore

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
But wait wait wait

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
You get a half done game now

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
And then you get a 90% done game later

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And then they'll put out like special edition

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
That's completely finished

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
They'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue the sequel

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Which will be like almost done

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
We're swear we're almost done with the game

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
This is 60% done now

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Loki you put it so eloquently

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
You just have a way with words

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
You know that right

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I know

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
I was going to say

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
This is a lot of crap

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
For a game that's not really done

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
But

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
It's not that great anyways

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Wait wait

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Even if people are going to do it

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
They're going to be like

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh my god I have to have it

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm a consumer whore

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
And get it

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Or just wait for the full game to come out

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
People don't know how to be patient

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah I guess I can't really talk about patience

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
No mister

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Do you have any wheeze now

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
No

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
More news please

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Yes please

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I agree

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
We need to get to the Portal song

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Sooner round later

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Because that means less talking from us

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Sorry

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And I actually meant

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay now this story

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I meant to get something

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
To actually test this out on the show

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But I was too lazy to stop by

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Anyways

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Firmware 3.9 has come out

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Too lazy

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
So I was basically

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Because that's going to stop at GameStop

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And get a headset for my PSP

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So I can talk on Skype

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So we can test it during the show

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
And I figured

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
No that'd be dumb

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And I don't want to waste $20 on a headset

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I'll never use Skype

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I apologize for ever asking about the story

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
It's really hard to find that

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Anyways

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
So

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And it does feature Skype

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
If you have the PSP Slim

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And two days later it was cracked

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
And is now available for everybody else like me

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So hooray

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Way to go Sony

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Keeping up with that security

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Now does the crack still work off some type of exploit

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Or how exactly does that work

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
They basically decrypt the

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
The whole firmware

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And then they just modify it so you can

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Install it on your PSP

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
With homebrew support and other stuff like that

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So one more time just to recap

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
The new PSP firmware came out this week

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And was promptly cracked two days later

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Alright

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
I always feel like every time

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
We have a story about the firmware getting cracked

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
You know Sony comes out and says

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Nobody's ever going to crack this

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
This is the full proof firmware

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We've closed the loophole

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
No one's ever going to crack it

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
And then two days later

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It gets even better

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
And I don't think this made the show roll

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
But they're finding a way now to

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
Inject the 1.5 firmware

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Homebrew capability into the slim PSPs now

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Inject the 1.5 firmware

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
You make it sound so hot

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Well because you can't run

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
There are certain parts of 1.5

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That won't run on a slim PSP

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
But now they're figuring out how to do that

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
It'll never work

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There's never going to be a point where

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
They're super secure

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Alright

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Well if you're looking for more things

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
To use your PSP for

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Pretty soon FLOW

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Is going to be coming out on the PSP

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
You might know this game as the screensaver that you play

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
This originally came out on the PlayStation Network of course

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And it will soon be coming out to the PSP

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
This is according to computer and video games

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
The PSP version probably won't be changed much

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
From the original PlayStation 3 version

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
I'm trying to think

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
How exactly do you mess with FLOW

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Do you give the game a plot?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Or like an objective?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Eat stuff, become bigger, evolve

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
That's right I forgot

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
The instructions that the game gives you

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Eat stuff

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
There you go

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Alrighty

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Well let's see what else is coming out soon

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
From around the world

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000

Because when you see them about to take it you beat them with the clubs

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000

I played the Xbox 360 demo it's awesome

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000

Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore coming out on 360 Wii and PlayStation 2

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Not touching that game

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I thought it was awful

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Nobunaga's Ambition Rise to Power on PlayStation 2

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
The Spider-Man Chronicles on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PC and the DS

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I think that's also coming out on the Wii at the same time too

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS

36:22.000 --> 36:32.000
And one other thing we weren't sure if it was coming out but that Cobalt Blue and Black DS

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Finally confirmed to be coming out on the 10th now

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
Because you didn't know that three weeks ago

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
No you didn't know that three weeks ago

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
And to kind of go along with that Professor Layton and the Curious Village on the DS

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Which is hot shit right now in Japan

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
But I don't know what the draw is but great

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
And what other fun stuff here

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
I'm sorry I had to read

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Merv Griffin's Crosswords on the PC

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Wow that's

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Isn't that like a game show now or something?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I guess

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Right

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Why do they have them hosting anything that's just weird

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Well Merv Griffin is kind of dead so he can't host much right now

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Grrr strong words

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Zombie Cross word

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
Well I don't know they can be like a computer reanimation

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
Wow I don't think Merv Griffin died that long this might be in the To Soon category

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
So we need to be careful

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Okay

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Okay

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
okay sure exactly

37:50.000 --> 37:53.520
Dick Clark should be dead and worse is justice

37:53.520 --> 37:56.400
can't you tell his contract with the devil already ran war out?

37:56.400 --> 38:00.440
you know I think no here's what it is

38:00.440 --> 38:04.360
Dick Clark is seriously the inspiration for that movie Final Destination

38:04.360 --> 38:08.720
he has dodged death so many times you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio the

38:08.720 --> 38:10.360
finest in video game chat

38:10.360 --> 38:14.480
I'm done that's it that's all that's coming out this week

38:22.240 --> 38:25.680
battle stations midway when it comes out on February 7 2008

38:25.680 --> 38:29.280

38:29.280 --> 38:32.680
3 coming out transformers the game finally makes its way to the PlayStation

38:32.680 --> 38:34.140

38:38.200 --> 38:39.720
on the Nintendo Wii

38:39.720 --> 38:43.200
I don't know Major Nelson might have some competition cuz we's getting a game

najiro gyro ball so

38:48.040 --> 38:51.680

39:04.240 --> 39:08.520

39:12.560 --> 39:15.720

39:15.720 --> 39:17.000
simple series games

39:17.000 --> 39:22.200
it's basically a chick wearing lingerie and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword

39:22.200 --> 39:24.160
killing zombies what more do you need

39:24.160 --> 39:27.520

39:53.540 --> 39:54.760
shovel at this point

39:54.760 --> 39:58.200
I think this is still better than being dead in a dish somewhere

39:58.200 --> 40:01.680
that's probably true well hey wait Loki don't go anywhere

anything coming out on the PSP you might care about hey coded soul comes out on

41:33.440 --> 41:34.240
the PSP

41:34.240 --> 41:37.920
this week in Japan and mobile suit Gundam

41:37.920 --> 41:41.760
given know it yeah boo comes out this week and I them

41:41.760 --> 41:46.200
so check that out I remember gonna do it for Japanese

41:46.200 --> 41:50.160
back today when you know thought of a new Gundam game was exciting now it's

41:50.160 --> 41:50.880
just like

41:50.880 --> 41:57.080
and stop alright let's get back into some news

41:57.080 --> 42:00.000
and then we will have ourselves a performance what about news

42:00.000 --> 42:03.400
anyways

42:03.400 --> 42:06.480
I have news related news

42:06.480 --> 42:11.480
it's very special because EA is obviously very special in special by

42:11.480 --> 42:12.440
ending short best

42:12.440 --> 42:16.200
EA is going to be splitting the components

42:16.200 --> 42:20.000
of the orange box dunder done so

42:20.000 --> 42:23.800
there will be a PC and xbox 360 released in October

42:23.800 --> 42:28.120
a ps3 release afterwards that will be just a separate half-life

42:28.120 --> 42:31.680
episode to you and portal and a separate team fortress

42:31.680 --> 42:35.960
and and they've already been there for download for a while but there's going

42:35.960 --> 42:37.880
to be individual box copies on the way

42:37.880 --> 42:41.640
and I hope they're cheap because I mean if you can buy

42:41.640 --> 42:44.760
you know the orange box new for 60 bucks and it's

42:44.760 --> 42:49.840
all this stuff they should make these like no more than 1520 bucks apiece

42:49.840 --> 42:54.920
probably 20 and no one will buy like

42:54.920 --> 42:57.960
episode to everyone else but portal

42:57.960 --> 43:01.520
yeah portal and team fortress to yeah I don't know see

43:01.520 --> 43:05.880
when and we got my copy and see all I cared about was portal at the time that

43:05.880 --> 43:07.960
Dan really really got into

43:07.960 --> 43:11.600
half-life and to episode to you he was all over that

43:11.600 --> 43:16.720
hi

43:16.720 --> 43:20.320
good I'm sorry I had to run out for a minute I'm okay in the

43:20.320 --> 43:25.240
he had a major we that's right ahead I had a major we brew and I had a

43:25.240 --> 43:28.360
cuz I didn't wanna miss our performance I ran out during the last story there

43:28.360 --> 43:32.120
so now that you share that with the entire internet can we move on with

43:32.120 --> 43:32.400
the

43:32.400 --> 43:36.320
another gaming story please we are not over there I know this is gonna come as a

43:36.320 --> 43:39.120
big surprise everybody but Val's talking about

43:39.120 --> 43:42.560
making more portal games way

43:42.560 --> 43:46.360
that's so surprising I'm

43:46.360 --> 43:50.320
yeah apparently portal was kinda successful so they

43:50.320 --> 43:53.880
decided hey let's make some more but they don't want just turn out more

43:53.880 --> 43:55.800
levels and I think actually wanna have a

43:55.800 --> 43:59.360
story to go along with it so they're working on it but

43:59.360 --> 44:04.280
anytime soon just make more downloadable levels that be fun

44:04.280 --> 44:08.020
so let's see a highly successful critically loved game is going to be

44:08.020 --> 44:08.800
getting a sequel

44:08.800 --> 44:11.840
I know and this is news how shot stop presses

44:11.840 --> 44:16.520
shocking on alright I'm anyway speaking a portal obviously our

44:16.520 --> 44:19.640
I've guest here tonight is mo who's with us and mo

44:19.640 --> 44:24.480
is somewhat famous on the internet's for her you tube which is had what 30,000

44:24.480 --> 44:25.260
plus views

44:25.260 --> 44:30.280
31,000 views for portal so what made you decide to do a cover of still alive

44:30.280 --> 44:35.160
of all things oh we finished the portal game in a bunch my friends and heard the

44:35.160 --> 44:36.160
ending sign on my

44:36.160 --> 44:39.760
this is pretty easy and I like you should learn it and

44:39.760 --> 44:44.360
I did are any of your friends listening tonight know that my home so

44:44.360 --> 44:47.560
I if they aren't I'll be really bitter

44:47.560 --> 44:50.960
alright that's alright whether we have the podcast you can you know is

44:50.960 --> 44:53.800
always a share it with your friends on pimping it to them all weekend if they

44:53.800 --> 44:55.060
don't listen I'm gonna be better

44:55.060 --> 44:58.120
alright I'm sure that if you're in chat say hello or something so we cannot pass

44:58.120 --> 44:59.840
on now your well wishes to mo

44:59.840 --> 45:03.560
and I so I'm

45:03.560 --> 45:07.280
so you just you just you heard the song your friends kinda dared you to do it

45:07.280 --> 45:07.960
effectively

45:07.960 --> 45:11.360
yes and I then you're on YouTube and now you're here Jake to the one only take

45:11.360 --> 45:11.800
actually

45:11.800 --> 45:15.640
how did you find her yes did you find me her

45:15.640 --> 45:19.320
just

45:19.320 --> 45:22.360
can we can we get on the mic real quick sorry Jake I can't talk on the mic we

45:22.360 --> 45:22.840
can hear you

45:22.840 --> 45:27.160
think someone links to another portal video and then years came up in the

45:27.160 --> 45:29.160
results and I clicked on it was like hey

45:29.160 --> 45:33.320
that's awesome and then I showed you as I and then you were over here for the

45:33.320 --> 45:38.120
new year's party and I don't somehow I know somehow portal came up just randomly

45:38.120 --> 45:38.880
are watching

45:38.880 --> 45:41.860
you tubes are I don't know and and you said that hey there's a girl who's

45:41.860 --> 45:42.560
local

45:42.560 --> 45:46.600
that's got one and so we watched it we sent her an email and here she is

45:46.600 --> 45:50.840
here she is so are you about ready for this I gotta I'm gonna have to situate a

45:50.840 --> 45:53.120
little differently cuz we're ghetto we don't have a lot of hookups there so I'm

45:53.120 --> 45:54.680
just gonna kinda sit by you here

45:54.680 --> 45:59.120
and now while you do this so and I'm gonna ask you guys to turn your mics off

45:59.120 --> 46:00.840
so we don't get a lot of background noise in here

46:00.840 --> 46:03.920
but this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig

46:03.920 --> 46:07.160
our first musical guest rage but it's gonna be awesome

46:07.160 --> 46:11.960
right it's gonna be only slightly I hope it'll be above average we know that

46:11.960 --> 46:15.560
no it's gonna be great be better than it's gonna be better by listening to us

46:15.560 --> 46:17.000
saying that's for sure alright

46:17.000 --> 46:20.200
so alright so enough chatter let's take

46:20.200 --> 46:25.360
let's have a mo take it away here here she is live on now orange lounge radio

46:25.360 --> 46:30.360
with Jonathan Colton's still alive

46:30.360 --> 46:35.360
this was a triumph

46:35.360 --> 46:41.360
I'm making a no-tear huge success

46:41.360 --> 46:49.360
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction

46:49.360 --> 46:53.360
Aperture Science

46:53.360 --> 46:58.360
we do what we must because we can

46:58.360 --> 47:04.360
for the good in all of us except the ones who are dead

47:04.360 --> 47:09.360
but there's no sense crying over every mistake

47:09.360 --> 47:13.360
you just keep on trying till you run out of cake

47:13.360 --> 47:18.360
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun

47:18.360 --> 47:24.360
for the people who are still alive

47:24.360 --> 47:29.360
I'm not even angry

47:29.360 --> 47:35.360
I'm being so sincere right now

47:35.360 --> 47:43.360
even though you broke my heart and killed me

47:43.360 --> 47:47.360
and tore me to pieces

47:47.360 --> 47:53.360
and threw every piece into a fire

47:53.360 --> 48:00.360
as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you

48:00.360 --> 48:04.360
now these points of data make a beautiful line

48:04.360 --> 48:09.360
and we're out of beta we're releasing on time

48:09.360 --> 48:13.360
so I'm glad I got burned think of all the things we learned

48:13.360 --> 48:17.360
for the people who are still alive

48:17.360 --> 48:26.360
go ahead and leave me

48:26.360 --> 48:33.360
I think I'd prefer to stay inside

48:33.360 --> 48:40.360
maybe you'll find someone else to help you

48:40.360 --> 48:47.360
maybe Black Mesa

48:47.360 --> 48:52.360
that was a joke, haha, fat chance

48:52.360 --> 48:59.360
anyway this cake is great it's so delicious and moist

48:59.360 --> 49:03.360
look at me still talking when there's science to do

49:03.360 --> 49:08.360
when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you

49:08.360 --> 49:12.360
I've experiments to run there is research to be done

49:12.360 --> 49:17.360
on the people who are still alive

49:17.360 --> 49:21.360
and believe me I am still alive

49:21.360 --> 49:26.360
I'm doing science and I'm still alive

49:26.360 --> 49:31.360
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive

49:31.360 --> 49:35.360
while you're dying I'll be still alive

49:35.360 --> 49:39.360
and when you're dead I will be still alive

49:39.360 --> 50:07.360
still alive

50:07.360 --> 50:10.360
and there will be cake and it's not alive

50:10.360 --> 50:13.360
we have some clapping in the chat room

50:13.360 --> 50:15.360
Hitstun says it would win a cage match

50:15.360 --> 50:17.360
our little musical thing we do after the show

50:17.360 --> 50:19.360
or they pick good songs so very nice

50:19.360 --> 50:21.360
so now you're going to have to learn something else and come back

50:21.360 --> 50:23.360
again sometime

50:23.360 --> 50:27.360
yes I happen to watch another one of her YouTubes

50:27.360 --> 50:30.360
which I laughed at because

50:30.360 --> 50:33.360
she did Rick Ashley's Never Gonna Give You Up

50:33.360 --> 50:36.360
everyone's calling it a chick role that's the best part

50:36.360 --> 50:38.360
they're calling it a chick role

50:38.360 --> 50:39.360
it was awesome

50:39.360 --> 50:40.360
awesome

50:40.360 --> 50:45.360
you found it through the chick role?

50:45.360 --> 50:48.360
alright

50:48.360 --> 50:50.360
so lots and lots of clapping there in chat

50:50.360 --> 50:53.360
and thank you very much for being a guinea pig

50:53.360 --> 50:55.360
being our very first musical guest that went pretty well

50:55.360 --> 50:57.360
except for the fact I kind of had to hold that

50:57.360 --> 50:59.360
and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part

50:59.360 --> 51:01.360
I kept smacking the mic and I'm like oh gosh

51:01.360 --> 51:03.360
no but it came out really good so very exciting

51:03.360 --> 51:06.360
alright we'll stop talking about the technical fuck ups now

51:06.360 --> 51:08.360
and get back to the gaming news

51:08.360 --> 51:09.360
yes anyways

51:09.360 --> 51:11.360
oh wait no it's my turn isn't it sorry

51:11.360 --> 51:12.360
yeah Rob

51:12.360 --> 51:15.360
well if you want to be a guitar hero in the comfort of your own home

51:15.360 --> 51:19.360
apparently four more guitar hero games are making their way this year

51:19.360 --> 51:22.360
now that's not real guitar like the kind that Moe plays

51:22.360 --> 51:24.360
but that's you know a fake five button guitar

51:24.360 --> 51:28.360
but it might still get you you know boyfriends, girlfriends

51:28.360 --> 51:30.360
and you know hot dates and all that good stuff

51:30.360 --> 51:32.360
guitar hero Aaron the Ellen show

51:32.360 --> 51:34.360
yeah it could get you on the Ellen show

51:34.360 --> 51:37.360
guitar hero Aerosmith is supposedly going to be coming out in July

51:37.360 --> 51:41.360
and of course guitar hero four in October

51:41.360 --> 51:45.360
guitar hero on tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS

51:45.360 --> 51:46.360
that's going to make its way in June

51:46.360 --> 51:50.360
and supposedly there is a fourth title being planned

51:50.360 --> 51:55.360
it's an action packed guitar hero experience like no other

51:55.360 --> 51:58.360
so apparently it's some other type of guitar hero game

51:58.360 --> 52:04.360
in other words it's basically taking a lovely, well established, loved franchise

52:04.360 --> 52:06.360
and pooping on it with this game

52:06.360 --> 52:10.360
well if there's four games in one year that's already pooping on it I think

52:10.360 --> 52:11.360
I mean seriously

52:11.360 --> 52:17.360
by the way those rumors are coming from surfer girl via gonintendo.com

52:17.360 --> 52:20.360
and surfer girl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff so

52:20.360 --> 52:22.360
not surprised

52:22.360 --> 52:24.360
I'm not surprised about the three of them

52:24.360 --> 52:26.360
and that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July

52:26.360 --> 52:30.360
since that's when Rock the 80s came out this last year

52:30.360 --> 52:32.360
oh, Rock the 80s

52:32.360 --> 52:37.360
and I don't know they need to do something like remember Fret and Ice

52:37.360 --> 52:39.360
they could do something like that action packed guitar game

52:39.360 --> 52:42.360
you know just where you actually do a side scrolling game

52:42.360 --> 52:46.360
but I think this is going to suck whatever it is I'm sure

52:46.360 --> 52:50.360
I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them

52:50.360 --> 52:52.360
it sucked

52:52.360 --> 52:54.360
that's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer

52:54.360 --> 52:57.360
I'm sorry but if you release four games

52:57.360 --> 52:59.360
like okay

52:59.360 --> 53:01.360
DDR for example

53:01.360 --> 53:04.360
when you have three different games coming out in the same year

53:04.360 --> 53:07.360
they just don't get the same amount of focus on each one

53:07.360 --> 53:09.360
it's just

53:09.360 --> 53:13.360
I don't know release one really good game except four really mediocre games

53:13.360 --> 53:15.360
have you ever heard of the saying too much of a good thing

53:15.360 --> 53:17.360
yeah exactly

53:17.360 --> 53:21.360
Gerardimo asks in chat is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now

53:21.360 --> 53:23.360
because the whole Activision Blizzard thing

53:23.360 --> 53:26.360
you know rock out to your torn shaman and all that stuff

53:26.360 --> 53:30.360
do we get hoochie dancing night elves and head banging undead

53:30.360 --> 53:32.360
you might see some of that stuff

53:32.360 --> 53:34.360
but here's the thing

53:34.360 --> 53:38.360
I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version

53:38.360 --> 53:40.360
I'm sure you'll see something like that in there

53:40.360 --> 53:43.360
because they like doing weird crossover things

53:43.360 --> 53:44.360
you never know

53:44.360 --> 53:48.360
look if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3

53:48.360 --> 53:49.360
anything is possible

53:49.360 --> 53:52.360
I'm very disappointed I've not seen anything like that for Rock Band

53:52.360 --> 53:55.360
I want some free songs I understand the three songs a week

53:55.360 --> 53:57.360
or Journey

53:57.360 --> 53:58.360
or Journey

53:58.360 --> 54:01.360
they need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords the Underworld

54:01.360 --> 54:03.360
just isn't enough

54:03.360 --> 54:05.360
there needs to be more gag music in there

54:05.360 --> 54:07.360
we need more lols in our Rock Band

54:07.360 --> 54:10.360
we need Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend on there

54:10.360 --> 54:12.360
I would own on that

54:12.360 --> 54:14.360
like chocolate rain the heavy metal mix or something like that

54:14.360 --> 54:15.360
yes

54:15.360 --> 54:17.360
hey they managed to put freeze pop

54:17.360 --> 54:19.360
drop it at me

54:19.360 --> 54:23.360
well you know what Mo maybe should write them and get Still Alive in there

54:23.360 --> 54:26.360
we need more stuff from the kind of long haired band

54:26.360 --> 54:29.360
see now Still Alive

54:29.360 --> 54:30.360
Spinal Tap

54:30.360 --> 54:31.360
Spinal Tap

54:31.360 --> 54:35.360
I was going to say Still Alive could make it into Rock Band

54:35.360 --> 54:37.360
since EA publishes both games

54:37.360 --> 54:39.360
so maybe

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
interesting EA are you listening

54:41.360 --> 54:44.360
I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song

54:44.360 --> 54:46.360
although I mean there's maps and something

54:46.360 --> 54:47.360
they've got plenty of mellow stuff in there

54:47.360 --> 54:50.360
well part of my iron lung is mellow

54:50.360 --> 54:52.360
we need more Radiohead

54:52.360 --> 54:56.360
and the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain Loki

54:56.360 --> 54:58.360
so here you go a little kick

54:58.360 --> 55:00.360
Chocolate Rain is great

55:00.360 --> 55:01.360
it's amazing

55:01.360 --> 55:03.360
that guy's voice is just intense

55:03.360 --> 55:07.360
intense is a good way to describe it

55:07.360 --> 55:10.360
let's move on with some more news

55:10.360 --> 55:12.360
well

55:12.360 --> 55:14.360
for our Sega fans there is a

55:14.360 --> 55:19.360
PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege

55:19.360 --> 55:24.360
that is an action RPG with different types of gameplay

55:24.360 --> 55:26.360
we have a robotic partner that you can customize

55:26.360 --> 55:28.360
and you have online co-op

55:28.360 --> 55:30.360
up to four people

55:30.360 --> 55:35.360
but they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release too

55:35.360 --> 55:37.360
excuse me

55:37.360 --> 55:42.360
they're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release

55:42.360 --> 55:46.360
they are considering it as an option

55:46.360 --> 55:51.360
and I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that it's actually going to be

55:51.360 --> 55:54.360
they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself

55:54.360 --> 55:57.360
that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible

55:57.360 --> 55:58.360
so

55:58.360 --> 56:01.360
the PC releases in September

56:01.360 --> 56:04.360
so wait it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years hopefully?

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
I hope so

56:05.360 --> 56:07.360
Sega needs to really redeem themselves

56:07.360 --> 56:09.360
or they need to bring out Planet Harrier

56:09.360 --> 56:12.360
we don't have very good hopes for this actually

56:12.360 --> 56:15.360
if I remember correctly Space Siege is actually

56:15.360 --> 56:20.360
a new series in the Dungeon Siege

56:20.360 --> 56:25.360
so basically you know like a dungeon crawler but now it's a space crawler I guess

56:25.360 --> 56:27.360
and

56:27.360 --> 56:29.360
you know

56:29.360 --> 56:31.360
no offense I mean I'm sure Dungeon Siege is awesome

56:31.360 --> 56:33.360
it's just we will ruin that for me

56:33.360 --> 56:34.360
I'm sorry

56:34.360 --> 56:38.360
I think of that and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO

56:38.360 --> 56:41.360
because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King and he'll be in space

56:41.360 --> 56:45.360
and that's you know have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever

56:45.360 --> 56:50.360
you know what I've had this very strange urge to play this week Dark Sakura?

56:50.360 --> 56:51.360
what?

56:51.360 --> 56:52.360
Fastestar universe

56:52.360 --> 56:53.360
no

56:53.360 --> 56:54.360
I don't know why

56:54.360 --> 56:55.360
Ethan Waber's calling to you

56:55.360 --> 56:59.360
yes that's what it is I missed the two handed thing

56:59.360 --> 57:01.360
guy with the swords was awesome

57:01.360 --> 57:03.360
you know my friend Julie

57:03.360 --> 57:04.360
cost me 19

57:04.360 --> 57:05.360
got it

57:05.360 --> 57:08.360
and she's like oh my god every time she's always on PSU

57:08.360 --> 57:10.360
and see we were actually having a discussion on this the other day

57:10.360 --> 57:13.360
and she's saying that they're bringing in the old PSO maps

57:13.360 --> 57:14.360
and everything

57:14.360 --> 57:17.360
and I was like that could almost get me to play

57:17.360 --> 57:18.360
I still have my copy

57:18.360 --> 57:21.360
that could almost get me to play except I still hate how they do forces

57:21.360 --> 57:23.360
that will get me to play I think

57:23.360 --> 57:24.360
that's kind of cool

57:24.360 --> 57:28.360
she says that all of, in fact some of the areas are already available

57:28.360 --> 57:31.360
but they're also bringing back all the old enemies too

57:31.360 --> 57:32.360
wow

57:32.360 --> 57:37.360
so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem was with the universe itself

57:37.360 --> 57:41.360
as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled

57:41.360 --> 57:45.360
I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played

57:45.360 --> 57:47.360
she said they brought back mags

57:47.360 --> 57:49.360
that's hot I love mags

57:49.360 --> 57:51.360
I miss my Master System mag

57:51.360 --> 57:55.360
alright we got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show

57:55.360 --> 58:03.360
so I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice challenge that was on the Xbox 360

58:03.360 --> 58:05.360
I think last year

58:05.360 --> 58:10.360
where you could earn such wonderful games as Contra and

58:10.360 --> 58:11.360
oh guess what?

58:11.360 --> 58:13.360
Fusion Frenzy 2

58:13.360 --> 58:17.360
which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment

58:17.360 --> 58:18.360
punishment

58:18.360 --> 58:19.360
anyways

58:19.360 --> 58:22.360
so you can win some new stuff this time

58:22.360 --> 58:25.360
although it's a little bit different this time around

58:25.360 --> 58:27.360
instead of actually competing just against a set number

58:27.360 --> 58:29.360
you're competing against your friends

58:29.360 --> 58:32.360
and you can win such things as say

58:32.360 --> 58:35.360
a $20 Best Buy gift card

58:35.360 --> 58:37.360
an Xbox 360 HD DVD player

58:37.360 --> 58:41.360
since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of win in there

58:41.360 --> 58:43.360
and some other stuff

58:43.360 --> 58:46.360
maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again who knows

58:46.360 --> 58:47.360
but

58:47.360 --> 58:52.360
yeah so if you're interested in that they've actually got some more information on

58:52.360 --> 58:54.360
360voice.com

58:54.360 --> 58:56.360
slash challenges

58:56.360 --> 58:57.360
you can check it out

58:57.360 --> 58:59.360
a bunch of different things you can win

58:59.360 --> 59:01.360
I don't know

59:03.360 --> 59:04.360
I just have a

59:04.360 --> 59:06.360
I really don't care

59:06.360 --> 59:09.360
I'm kind of done with the whole like EP and achievement points thing

59:09.360 --> 59:10.360
it's kind of done

59:10.360 --> 59:13.360
you know I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so

59:13.360 --> 59:15.360
sadly high it's just never

59:15.360 --> 59:17.360
you're never going to catch up so I don't know

59:17.360 --> 59:20.360
I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing

59:20.360 --> 59:21.360
it's a little old to me

59:21.360 --> 59:24.360
I mean I guess they're still interesting in a way

59:24.360 --> 59:26.360
I guess like virtual trophies or whatever

59:26.360 --> 59:28.360
but I don't know about these contests

59:28.360 --> 59:30.360
unless they start putting some cold hard cash on the line

59:30.360 --> 59:32.360
yeah it doesn't look like they are

59:32.360 --> 59:35.360
I mean you can basically pick one of these different contests they're going on

59:35.360 --> 59:37.360
you pick one you want to enter in

59:37.360 --> 59:41.360
and then you basically compete and see how fast you can

59:41.360 --> 59:43.360
you know grow your gamer score I guess

59:43.360 --> 59:46.360
and they've got you know a bunch of different weird things

59:46.360 --> 59:48.360
like you can win you know 1600 point cards

59:48.360 --> 59:50.360
50 of our best buy cards

59:50.360 --> 59:52.360
Big Mac challenge

59:52.360 --> 59:55.360
I don't know maybe you win some Big Macs or something

59:57.360 --> 59:59.360
clearance copies of Sneak King I don't know

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360
anyhow

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.360
some games may be coming out very soon

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.360
for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.360
because Lord knows you achievement point whores love

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.360
more arcade games to inflate your score

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.360
but these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.360
apparently Microsoft's press FTP site

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.360
was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.360
because they've released these screenshots of

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.360
Conquer Live and Reloaded

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.360
and Jade Empire

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.360
those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.360
it indicates that the games could be coming to

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.360
Xbox Live Marketplace very soon

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.360
so there you have it there

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360
now of course they're going to be added to the Xbox original line up

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.360
so come to think of it

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.360
I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.360
because you can't use the original games for that

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.360
I'm not interested until they put like Jet Set Radio Future on there or something like that

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.360
so if it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live originals

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.360
1200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360
but I hear

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.360
or buy it used for probably even cheaper than that

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.360
I hear especially with Jade Empire

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.360
those games are ones that people love

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.360
so there you have it

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.360
looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360
what's that

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360
to the big game

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360
oh what game

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360
the Puppy Bowl corgi one

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360
oh yes

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360
go team corgi

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.360
good job

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.360
seriously okay all these DS pet raising sims and no Puppy Bowl games

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.360
I mean come on

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.360
they totally need the Puppy Bowl

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.360
which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.360
once again sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360
but apparently

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360
corgis are great and they're smart

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360
alright forget it

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360
with their little mutated feet

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360
I love their little feet

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.360
I've been telling my husband I want a corgi

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.360
and he's like no you have a cat

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360
see proof that inbreeding can be awesome

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360
well they have cats out yet too

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.360
no but they're so horrible

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360
they feel so bad for them

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360
do you love video games

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.360
hey

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.360
listen to Orange Lounge Radio

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.360
we talk about video games non-stop

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.360
you know who should have won Puppy Bowl

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.360
this is the Puppy and Kitty tangent

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360
hey guess what Rob more Xbox Live

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360
what

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.360
ceiling cat is watching you deviate from the video game stories

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360
haha

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360
uh

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360
uh yeah

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360
anyway

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.360
um game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.360
as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360
is Poker Smash

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:25.360
which is um like I guess Tetris with poker things

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Poker Smash

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.360
I don't know it makes me kind of think of columns

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.360
columns

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360
columns

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360
columns gave me an aneurysm

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.360
Poker Smash

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.360
kind of makes me think of I'm not buying it

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.360
haha

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.360
you know you're gonna get it for Nellie

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360
no I'm not

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.360
you know Nellie's gonna get it behind your back

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
for points

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.360
she won't buy that game she's like I don't care

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360
haha

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360
I was teasing

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.360
no if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.360
Nellie's gonna come in and go Xbox Smash

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.360
that's ok he'll rebuild it

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.360
yeah

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360
it actually looks kind of cool

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360
I'll make it work better

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.360
and if it doesn't work better that means I need more

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360
it'll be the bionic 360

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360
haha

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.360
it actually looks kind of cool

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.360
but honestly I just will play Puyo Puyo

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.360
see she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360
she doesn't know how to play poker and that's

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.360
I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.360
but that will stop her from playing that game

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360
ok

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360
alright moving on

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.360
so there's actually been a little issues with

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.360
you know Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.360
you know and you might think at first it's because the name's too long

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360
but you'd be wrong

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.360
it's actually because the game's too big

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:46.360
and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.360
well of course you know those 1080p visuals are you know really big

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:58.360
and so they're having trouble you know fitting it in such a small size constraint there

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360
oh darn

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.360
you know what it doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.360
and slightly better

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360
there may just not be enough room for Cammie's ass

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360
they might just have to cut it out

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360
I'm sorry to say

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360
that would be Chinle's thighs

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.360
or how about I don't know let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360
since most everyone has a hard drive

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.360
and if you don't have a hard drive you don't get to play fucking arcade games

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360
there you go

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360
or how about just get rid of Balrog

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.360
I mean did anyone actually play Balrog?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.360
anybody?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.360
actually?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.360
Tyson played Balrog

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.360
I don't think anyone did

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.360
I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360
so I have to think about who you're talking about

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.360
M. Bison, the boxer

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.360
yeah

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.360
actually he was pretty cool but I like Dudley better in 3

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.360
alright anyhow

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360
guess what time it is folks

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360
you know the party is almost over

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.360
and we're going to get to the classic game of the week

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.360
but we haven't done this in a little while

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.360
there hasn't been a story that has really coaxed us in this way

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.360
to give out another one of these

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.360
let me think of this last week

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.360
we're giving out a stupid award tonight

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
no last week we talked about this guy

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.360
but now the trial is going on

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.360
and so this is why this guy is going to win

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.360
a stupid award tonight

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360
it's Tyrone Spellman is his name

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.360
and apparently he killed a baby

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.360
and what cost him to kill a baby?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360
well video games of course

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.360
if Aaliyah Truman

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.360
the assistant district attorney

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360
is to be believed

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
he said that

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.360
Spellman's entire life and daily routine

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.360
is about playing Ghost Recon

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360
what do you think someone with that kind of obsession

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.360
is going to do when it gets knocked over?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360
what do you think is going to happen?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.360
the skull fractures on that baby or what happened?

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.360
so in other words

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.360
I know that's horrible first off

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.360
I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.360
but what I think is so stupid about this

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.360
is that

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.360
yeah video games cost him to do it

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.360
no I think severe mental instability

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.360
of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.360
like obviously he was not playing

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.360
with a full set of chips in his head

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360
so

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360
that's why we're giving out a stupid award

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.360
not only to the assistant district attorney

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.360
who's trying to jump to this conclusion

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.360
but the guy for killing a baby in the first place

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.360
I mean that's kind of stupid

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360
like don't kill babies

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360
I mean isn't it like

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360
it doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360
like if he had a six pack in his head

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.360
it'd actually be empty except for one flat half drunk bottle

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.360
like do you even really need to be taught that growing up?

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.360
like do your parents really need to teach you like

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360
hey don't kill babies

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360
ever

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360
I don't think so

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.360
I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360
you know what I mean?

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.360
problem is he wasn't playing mad

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.360
shut up

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360
alright

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.360
anyhow before we go to the break

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.360
it's time to respect our elders a little bit

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.360
by paying tribute to the classic game of the week

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:14.360
Dark Sakura what is the classic video game of the week this week

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.360
that all the boys and girls should be playing out there

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360
it's pure and utter awesomeness

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.360
it's Outrun

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.360
I love Outrun

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360
Outrun is a game where you just drive a car

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.360
you make it sound so thrilling

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.360
well you've got a convertible and it's the guy and his blonde lady

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.360
just driving along and passing other drivers

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.360
but you get different forks in the path

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360
different ways that you can take

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.360
and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.360
or a 1971 Corvette

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.360
a 1985 Porsche 911

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.360
or a 1985 BMW

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.360
which I thought was pretty cool

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.360
but the whole I think fun part about it was that

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.360
it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.360
and it had great music in it

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.360
I mean like what you're hearing right now

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360
is the one I picked was Magical Sound Shower

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.360
which is like the best music in the game ever

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.360
I also named one of my horses a derby owner's club after it

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.360
it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.360
and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.360
where at the time 3D was just sort of like

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.360
what? we can do that? because they couldn't yet

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.360
so this I think is actually one of the games that opened up

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.360
a lot of the market for the

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.360
you know like we had our mode 7 games on the Super Nintendo

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360
but I mean this was actually

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360
I had this on Master System

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
wow that's pretty hardcore

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360
yeah it's a pretty good game

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360
were you able to actually play this on Master System?

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360
yeah it's on Master System

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360
interesting

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
it was very weird on Master System

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.360
and I do believe if I'm right there was

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.360
you know we got Afterburner and Space Harrier on the 32X

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.360
but in Japan there was a 32X release of this

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360
that was pretty much arcade

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.360
I mean with this and Afterburner and Space Harrier

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.360
these were the arcade releases on the 32X

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.360
in fact you could even change some of them into arcade mode

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.360
but I think the other big part of this was just that

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360
with the combination of

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360
you know getting your choice of paths

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.360
or getting the music that you got

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.360
because you could actually change your music channel

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.360
and a lot of racing games now have that sort of option

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.360
for the music that you listen to as you play

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.360
and for the Genesis version

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.360
I actually had an extra bit of music in it too

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360
but one that I liked

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.360
we had the arcade that I used to work at in Alabama

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:56.360
is Outrunners which was the two player Outrun

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.360
and it had a few differences to it

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.360
also for anyone else who is a big fan of Sega titles

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360
Outrun has shown up in a bunch of other games

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.360
we've seen it in Shenmue 2

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.360
you can play it on Dreamcast in Shenmue 2

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.360
there's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.360
the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.360
it's actually in Outrun 2 as well

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.360
I don't know if anyone has actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.360
but it was included in Arizona with updated versions of the original tracks

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360
that were in it too

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360
so I thought it was pretty cool

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.360
Outrun is one of those classics

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.360
I think that it should be the first

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:49.360
I'd have to say first racing game I think I've mentioned in the classic games

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360
also it had an appearance in one of my favorite movies

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360
What's that?

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360
Donnie Darko

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.360
Nice

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.360
Some of the chat room folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.360
Black Lab says Lucky and Wild greater than Outrun

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360
I do not like that game

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.360
Orko says Lucky and Wild how I heart think

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360
I have a bias against Lucky and Wild

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360
What's that?

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.360
Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360
and I had to clean that sucker

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Did people do nasty things in Lucky and Wild?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360
It was the drive and gun game

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360
and people would break the gun controller

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.360
or leave their crap all in the thing

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360
and no, it sucked

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.360
In another game I have a bias against the Suzuka 8-hour

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.360
because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.360
when we had inspection

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.360
I do like hard driving though because I took a nap in one once

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.360
Anything else you want to say about Outrun, Jamie?

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360
Outrun is great

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360
Alright, check it out

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.360
Your classic game of the week boys and girls is Outrun

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360
Available on the arcades

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.360
Just about every Sega system ever made as well

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360
So check it out

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.360
And probably the PC as well and hell, some Nintendo systems too

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.360
Outrun 2006 was PC

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.360
There you go

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.360
So check it out

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.360
That's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.360
But we'll be back in just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.360
And tonight boys and girls

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360
It's been a little while, but we're going to have the match game tonight

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.360
That's right, it's been a little while

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360
We're going to play some match games tonight

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360
As long as we have some guests here

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.360
Mo, you're going to stay with us for Part B, right?

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360
Sure

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360
Why not hang out with the strangers from the internet a little more?

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.360
It'll be fun

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360
I'm not dead in a ditch yet

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360
It doesn't get much stranger than this

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.360
But if you lose match game, Mo

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360
I might be

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360
That's it

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.360
And Jake, you're going to play some match games with us too as well, right?

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360
But the stakes in tonight's match game are very high

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.360
You know why?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360
Because, and it's not for us here in studio

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360
But for the listeners that will be playing

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360
We're going to give away something, that's right

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.360
We're giving away a code for ResHD on the Xbox 360

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360
As the prize tonight in the match game

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.360
And that comes to you courtesy of an OLR listener

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.360
Out of the kindness of their heart

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.360
Is donating this prize tonight for the match game

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.360
I'll tell you more about it when we come back for Orange Lounge Radio Part B

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360
In the meantime, we're going to take a little break

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.360
And we'll see you in a little while

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.360
