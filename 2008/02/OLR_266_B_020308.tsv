487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19080	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
32654	33194	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
53562	56684	But the problem was he already bought the game, so he has no use for the code.
56704	58405	So we're going to pay it forward tonight.
59085	62568	One of our OLR listeners is going to pass on the code to our winner tonight of the match game.
62628	64449	So thank you, Actdeft.
64489	65289	Everybody say it with me.
65629	67731	Thank you, Actdeft.
67771	68031	All right.
68431	75335	So we're going to be giving that away a little later in the show, but before we do that, we have got to get back into some gaming news, and Loki's going to kick it off tonight.
75996	76336	All right.
77216	77537	Anyways...
79375	83776	There's two big games that they announced on Nintendo's reports for 2008.
84856	91477	Not a huge surprise, though, that Animal Crossing and the new Kirby game are coming to the Wii in 2008.
92497	95398	Most likely, though, it's only the Japanese Wii in 2008.
95598	99639	Maybe shortly after, in 2009, we'll see Animal Crossing here.
99879	102059	Hopefully, though, I would hope it's this year as well.
103219	106180	But no word on exactly what, you know...
108213	123844	Wii Music, Disaster Day of Crisis, Super Mario Stadium, Baseball, and Everyone's Common Knowledge Television, which I'm assuming is not coming over here.
124725	130449	It also shows Mario Kart Wii, still expected for Spring in North America, and Quarter 2 for Europe.
132725	136728	So, do we know anything more about that Animal Crossing on the Wii?
136808	138729	Like, is it actually going to be an MMO or anything?
139029	139489	No idea.
140350	143432	So, all we just kind of know is it's coming soon.
143992	150596	Yes, and I would imagine keep your expectations low because if you're expecting an MMO from Nintendo, I mean, come on.
151337	153018	They don't embrace online, really.
153258	154479	Good point, good point.
154539	157941	But, you know, I do love my Animal Crossing, so I'm hopeful.
158241	158942	Let's just leave it that way.
158962	159402	I'm hopeful.
160163	167345	All right, well, if Animal Crossing and Kirby don't do it for... Actually, wait, let me backtrack a little bit, because I know, DarkSakura, you're a big Animal Crossing fan.
167665	172366	If Nintendo happens to be listening right now, what do you hope that they implement in the next Animal Crossing game on the Wii?
174926	187289	I would actually like to see... And maybe this is a little bit odd, but I'd like to see a character be able to be the mayor, I think, of the town, instead of having...
187972	188973	You know, everything.
189013	190454	Be the Tom Nook conglomerate.
191215	195138	I would like to see you be able to control development of the town.
195658	197399	You know, new shops, new things.
197500	199921	Sort of expand the whole thing that makes a town work.
200302	201142	So like a promotion?
202764	203424	A way to promote?
203484	206667	Get a job and promote up so you're just not Tom Nook's bitch the whole time?
208008	208288	Kind of?
209089	211871	Well, I guess so.
212311	215634	I want the ability to put Tom Nook out of work.
216705	217786	and put him on the street.
218326	219846	Make him do bitch work for me.
219866	220987	Make him sleep with the fishes.
221207	221527	Yes.
221847	223208	Are you a big fan of Animal Crossing, Moe?
223328	227030	I actually have issues with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon.
227070	227890	They're too boring.
227910	229791	How about Kirby?
229811	230491	Are you a fan of Kirby?
230891	231611	I do like Kirby.
231631	233072	What do you hope they put in the next Kirby game?
234173	236574	Well, if it's going on the Wii, they should do something like Canvas Curse.
237454	238715	Canvas Curse was so awesome.
238775	239695	Canvas Curse was pretty fun.
240327	240747	Parappa the Rapper
262983	265104	and yeah, it's another music-based game on the Wii.
265184	266205	It's not Wii Music.
266245	266745	It's something else.
266805	269987	It's called Major Miners Majestic March.
270627	272408	Sorry, it's Major Miner Majestic March.
272909	277031	It's coming from designer Masuya Matsura and artist Rodney Greenblatt.
277372	280714	And what you're going to be doing in the game, you use the Wii Remote to keep tempo.
281434	282915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
308703	309244	Unjamalami 2 on the Wii
332907	333528	Amen to that.
359891	361072	Were you a band nerd, Mo?
361352	362193	I wasn't a band nerd.
362213	362994	I was a theater geek.
363114	363994	You were a theater geek.
364234	364695	Okay.
364755	366356	I was the AV nerd and the theater geek.
366556	368658	Do you think this game might still appeal to you?
369358	369998	It'd be fun.
370219	370599	It'd be fun.
370639	372240	I could wave my hands around like a tardigan.
372360	373681	Do you think it'll be like most Wii games?
373721	375983	It'll be fun for an hour and then sell it back?
376743	377144	Probably.
377164	378725	Probably.
378985	379545	How about you, Loki?
379565	381427	Are you excited about Major Miners?
382127	382347	No.
384829	386110	I have no interest in this game.
386150	387471	Then let's go to the next story.
387491	387571	Okay.
389458	399221	Well, for our soccer fans, actually, well, I'm sure there's plenty of soccer fans in the UK, as in real football.
400561	401262	I have my own bias.
402522	410665	Electronic Arts, though, is saying that they are not releasing UEFA Euro 2008 on Wii and DS in Europe at all.
412145	417227	So, I mean, they pretty much have the market, I think, because they had FIFA 08 last year.
418609	418809	Euro 2008 Euro 2008
446073	447434	Am I the only one that sees the humor in that?
447514	450235	Well, they're just not bringing down the Wii and DS.
450535	455758	Of the two soccer games that EA puts out, it's the lesser of the two.
456578	458959	I know it doesn't sell very well over here, that's for sure.
459079	460080	Well, fine, Debbie Downer.
461761	462741	Well, I'm sorry.
462861	465142	No one likes obscure soccer games, apparently.
466123	469024	They'll just play FIFA if they want to play FIFA.
469064	470645	I don't know, it's just like...
471505	476606	EA tries to put all these weird ones out there like Arena Football or Rugby and stuff like that.
476626	477847	Hey, don't knock the Rugby game.
478867	483288	Hey, I'm sure in their respective areas they're good, but no one buys them.
484268	486049	Or at least not that many people buy them.
487849	488229	All right.
488709	491390	Well, maybe one of these new games will prove you wrong, but we'll see.
491870	492170	Maybe.
492470	493891	Maybe this game will prove us wrong.
493951	495011	Eternity's Child.
495589	507355	It's a game that was originally designed to come out on the Xbox 360 as part of the XNA program, but now they've been porting that over to the WiiWare service that's still not out yet.
508075	510557	But it is scheduled sometime quarter to 2008.
511517	518241	It will set you back 500 Wii points, so it's nice to see that there will be some more inexpensive games on the WiiWare service.
518861	519801	Actually, it looks pretty cool.
520042	524224	It's all hand-drawn by cartoonist Luke Bernard, and...
524946	526167	Pretty cool looking platform game.
528670	533716	Hopefully we'll hear more about the WiiWare service in a couple weeks during Game Developers Conference.
533776	536038	I'm guessing that's when they're going to drop the bomb on that.
536058	538761	I was going to say, WiiWare should have been out pretty soon.
538821	540503	We thought it was going to come out late last year.
540984	541504	Didn't happen.
541945	544968	So it should be coming out sooner rather than later, right?
545188	545709	I would think so.
546009	546390	I hope so.
547819	551302	JAPAN SOLD HALF MILLION COPIES OF SMASH BROTHERS BRAWL IN ONE DAY
568917	572899	Those numbers coming from a Japanese blog, Amiibo.jp.
572919	578022	Apparently, it's reported that Brawl is the fastest-selling Wii title.
578623	584586	It sold through 80% of its initial stock, and that was 500,000 copies.
584947	587948	And now everybody's wondering, is it going to match that in the U.S.?
588829	589349	I think so.
590010	594092	Well, Mo, I know you work in a game shop, so you take pre-orders for this stuff.
594112	596133	Does it look like it's going to smash records left and right?
596153	596974	Jesus Christ, yes.
597154	597474	Really?
598999	599840	Honestly, I like it.
600400	602141	Japan has a smaller market than the U.S.
602481	604762	does anyways, and that's not even counting Europe, too.
605863	609704	It'll easily sell 500,000 copies in one day.
610165	613706	I wouldn't be surprised if it sells a million copies in the first day.
613966	616608	Well, how many people in America actually own Wiis, though?
618549	619129	That would be about...
620747	621328	It could be done.
621608	622689	That'd be about one in eight.
622969	626852	Still more and more selling, you know, as this date approaches in March, too.
627352	628714	Do you think you could top Halo?
629654	629814	No.
631676	634638	Day one, probably not, but overall, I think so.
634698	635399	Overall, maybe, yeah.
635459	637641	I think it might top Halo 3, but not Halo 2.
637701	639002	I don't know.
639022	640042	Halo 3 was pretty huge.
640062	640603	I don't know.
640963	641303	We'll see.
641744	643285	Well, I mean, in the long run.
643785	644226	In the long run.
644246	645967	Because I believe Halo 2 doesn't matter.
646447	648749	Every game's going to be Grand Theft Auto 4's bitch anyway, so...
651277	652378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
675959	682822	Well, how many copies of, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sold just because of the drama over that, do you think?
683643	683943	A lot.
684884	688445	You know, how many people now do you think are going to be, oh, what's this one going to do?
688505	689706	What's going to be the new thing?
689806	694668	Well, I think that honestly it is going to sort of overplay.
694688	696689	I don't know.
697030	698670	I hope not, but I'm pretty sure it will.
698770	701952	Well, look how amazing Grand Theft Auto 3 was when it came out.
702012	703833	It was just absolutely awesome.
703933	705714	I took a day off of work to play that game, by the way.
706463	710927	I took off a week of school to play Final Fantasy VI
732389	733770	Final Fantasy VI is pretty epic.
733790	736633	You would need like a whole week off of work, though, when that game first came out.
737834	738835	I pretended I had the flu.
740056	743339	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news and things we might call in sick for in the future.
743999	747262	I don't know that I'd be calling in sick for this if I can... There we go.
748203	748984	Stupid Firefox.
751566	756871	Nintendo has registered a patent for a casing for Wii Remote.
758374	764399	And it is quoted as saying, A video game controller for video game and receptor assembly.
764519	769824	A receptor having a shape substantially similar to a component appearing in the video game.
772206	775829	The receptor may be a gun-shaped subunit, is what it also says.
775869	778812	But there's a drawing that was included with it.
779212	784817	And they're actually, in fact, I'm pulling up the drawing right now.
787501	787741	A Teddy Bear?
787861	788141	A Teddy Bear?
813979	818040	Well, I'm pulling up the drawings now just to see everything else that was on there.
818080	820821	Unfortunately, Acrobat is slow.
821741	822182	There we go.
825343	829584	Yeah, DarkSakura in our chat room at chat.originalsradio.com exclaims what some of us are saying.
830285	832547	Are they really considering doing some of those?
833128	834149	I mean, a teddy bear?
834169	835930	Some of those are just what the fuck.
836030	842816	I think it's kind of stupid for them to even try to patent, you know, putting, you know, like a tennis racket or fishing rod controller.
842856	844558	They've already got them out there for the Wii.
844978	857389	They're a little late to the game, just like they were with the whole zapper attachment and stuff for the, you know, the Wii and also the Wii wheel that's going to be coming out with Mario Kart, which is completely retarded, but
858359	860521	Whatever, I guess people want that crap.
862462	863783	Doesn't make a game any better.
864683	870588	They have to go really into detail as far as these patents go, I guess.
870648	874190	I will immediately throw away that wheel when it comes with Mario Kart.
875151	876332	Out the window it will go.
877472	880955	Okay, there's the one on here for the wheel, and the one that looks like the zapper.
881778	884839	Which is sort of cool, but the helmet one, I'm sorry.
885079	887760	We've had virtual reality helmets from Nintendo before.
887800	889660	Are they trying to give us all migraines again?
890200	892501	You know, I still haven't forgiven them for the virtual boy.
893381	899983	The chair is kind of cool, but they have one also that looks like it's trying to remake the Power Glove.
900923	901363	Cool!
901803	902484	Oh, dear God.
902744	903584	It's so bad!
906205	906825	There is...
908773	910173	The racket one makes sense to me.
910193	911634	There's a skateboard one on here, too.
913354	915955	But the bike is like, what are they going to do, bring us Prop Cycle?
916275	923296	Interesting thought from AlphaCanongram in chat says, it's to prevent others from creating crap to ruin the Wii, but it didn't work.
923676	925276	But they've already, that's the thing, though.
925356	929017	If this was to prevent other people from making this crap, they're a little late.
929077	931078	They already have this stuff out there.
932238	934738	You can't patent something after it's already been out.
935539	937559	I guess maybe you can, but, you know.
938410	939432	It doesn't make any sense.
939793	940774	Alright, well let's move on.
941856	945463	I know really they should be threatened by putting a Wiimote in a teddy bear.
946485	947146	Hey, I would do it.
947887	948589	It's dumb.
949205	951808	What is it for, like some teddy bear hugging game?
951948	954550	It's so I can hug him and squeeze him and love him.
955131	956472	It's the baby shaking game.
956532	959195	You see, but they can't use a baby, so they have like a teddy bear.
959415	959796	I see.
959876	961677	You can shake the teddy bear all you want to.
962098	963539	Kill Teddy Ruxpin the game.
963659	964200	That'll be fun.
964400	968364	You know, they are, and I have to, this is coming out sometime soon.
969177	974018	within the next few months, they are bringing the Build-A-Bear workshop to the Wii instead of just the DS.
974038	976439	So you can create virtual bears.
976859	977959	You can do it on the DS already.
978099	980380	Well, I did not pay 80 bucks a piece.
981180	983781	But do you still have to do the little dance with your hands in the air and the spinning?
983821	985761	I didn't do that.
985962	987582	At least I can do it in the privacy of my own home.
989763	991163	So here's another bright idea.
991283	995304	Apparently someone thought it was an awesome idea to bring out Saw, the game.
995819	996540	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1021107	1023309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1042952	1043112	No.
1043632	1044673	Oh my god.
1045453	1047534	That seems like fan service or something to me.
1047554	1054478	No, this is... Brash Entertainment has made an announcement that they're going to make an interactive Saw game.
1054498	1056099	I don't know.
1056119	1057079	Is it going to be like Manhunt?
1058500	1059521	And get banned everywhere?
1059621	1062042	And even worse than Manhunt somehow?
1062402	1063243	We'll be on the Wii.
1063323	1064003	That's what I want to know.
1064023	1065244	No, it's just going to be PlayStation 3 and 360.
1065864	1066624	And here's the other thing, though.
1067005	1070366	I'm thinking, though, they're going to try to build off the controversy of Manhunt 2.
1070586	1071427	Of course...
1073062	1075635	2009 people will forget about Manhunt 2, I think.
1076354	1078535	Alright, this game is so wrong on so many levels.
1078555	1080775	I did a story on Manhunt 2 last week and I've already forgotten about it.
1080935	1090358	Because A, you know, obviously people are totally, you know, they look at video games and movies in complete different ways when, you know, obviously they shouldn't.
1090398	1094299	I mean, the Saw franchise is just as gory as, you know, Manhunt 2 and all that.
1094619	1102181	And this is just going to continue to give video games a bad name and fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courts.
1102501	1104482	That's what we call, rhymes with
1105370	1109674	And that means we have to bring in the FUs of the week.
1141963	1149188	The first of my FUs of the week, because I have had a pretty crazy week, goes towards needles.
1149788	1159274	And I'm not really afraid of needles, because, um, I don't know, I'm just really not afraid of needles anymore, but this is a really big freaking needle.
1159534	1166959	I got a cortisone shot in my hand, and it actually wasn't that bad, because my regular doctor is really cool and lets me watch.
1168179	1169200	The other doctor wouldn't let me watch.
1169460	1170000	He was mean.
1170761	1170821	Um...
1171821	1174402	But then my hand hurt for a couple of days and I couldn't play anything.
1174462	1177683	And then I have to go to an orthopedist next week.
1177903	1182025	And I'm a little bit antsy about surgery because I've only ever had surgery once in my life.
1182745	1183785	And that was Wisdom Teeth.
1184106	1186146	And you know how long I was messed up after that?
1186486	1187047	Four months.
1190108	1193709	So, F you to my stupid tendons.
1194049	1194409	All right.
1194549	1196390	Loki, you have any FUs of the week you'd like to give out?
1196667	1201450	Yeah, my FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making the shoddy system of the Xbox 360.
1201510	1203931	I'm tired of having to fix this stupid three-ring system.
1204011	1214437	It's really pissing me off because what I have to do to fix it, in other words, take a heat gun to it, involves me pulling off the heat sink and then I heat it up and do all that stuff.
1214477	1217239	I have to put a boiler at it so it looks like I'm actually cooking the thing.
1217799	1221521	And then after that works, I have to put everything back together, reapply, you know, the...
1222412	1228814	I've been doing this at work, by the way.
1228834	1232855	So, you know, have all the parts strewn all across, you know, the conference room table.
1233495	1238656	But, uh, this last time, this better fucking work, because I am getting really fed up with it.
1239076	1242057	The other system I fixed works perfectly.
1242137	1250119	This one is being a little bitch and won't fucking work, so... Fuck Microsoft, because there's no reason that I should have two systems dying to me.
1251557	1256459	My FU of the week goes to insomnia because I've had it most of the week and I think it was causing me to get sick.
1256779	1263121	But I'd like to counteractively give a thank you of the week to Airborne because vitamin C is awesome and made me not get totally sick.
1263201	1264561	So that was great.
1265241	1267042	But FU to lack of sleep and getting sick.
1267782	1269663	Mo, I don't know if you're familiar with this segment.
1269683	1272043	Do you have anything you'd like to just say FU to on the air?
1272163	1273764	The fact that I still suck at Halo 3.
1274935	1275535	Amen to that.
1275835	1277956	I will never get first-person shooters.
1278036	1278936	I just never will.
1279276	1279997	Console.
1280237	1280977	I can't do it.
1281377	1282998	Give me a keyboard and a mouse, goddammit.
1284358	1287019	Maybe just some people weren't built to play console shooters.
1287059	1287699	I don't know what it is.
1288299	1292180	I can get the running down, and I can get the shooting down, but if you want me to point, I'm screwed.
1292480	1293801	Just use the caboose method.
1293881	1295161	Let everyone else kill each other off.
1295541	1298942	No, they all know that I'm the weaker player, so everyone picks me off in multiplayer.
1299723	1299943	Bastards.
1300203	1300483	Don't.
1301182	1302703	Jake, I know you're busy with Smash Bros.
1302743	1304624	Brawl, but do you have anything you'd like to give an F you to?
1304704	1305684	Anything that's making you angry?
1306565	1307285	Amazingly, no.
1308386	1310847	Well, F you to you for being so perky.
1315055	1318539	That's the cool thing about this game is you can actually pause it and then rotate around and take snapshots.
1318579	1321242	By the way, for those that weren't listening to the bonus segment, we are playing Smash Bros.
1321302	1323004	Brawl here in studio.
1323144	1328650	Jake's walking us through the game here, and you can watch the action on our Justin.TV feed, which should be archived.
1328931	1330432	I'm sure somebody will make a highlight out of it.
1330492	1333856	It's Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to check it out.
1334671	1335672	But not for much longer.
1335692	1338614	We're going to be pointing the camera back on the studio very soon.
1338894	1342236	Black Lab in chat says we need more studio view on cam and less Super Smash Bros.
1342256	1342416	Ball.
1342476	1342976	All right, soon.
1343376	1343977	Soon, I promise.
1343997	1345017	Maybe after a couple more matches.
1345037	1347079	All right, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
1347259	1350060	Let's get back into the gaming news.
1350341	1356644	And this almost makes me want to bring on the FUs of the week again because I'm so ready for this game.
1356684	1357445	You know, Spore...
1358678	1370573	Well, apparently now, during an EA conference call, the CEO of EA, John Riccatello, told the audience that Spore will not be making fiscal 08.
1371764	1374665	But will it be making calendar year 08 at all?
1375165	1377546	Or will it be actually pushed back to 2009?
1378746	1381967	And still within the 2009 fiscal year, but literally like a year from now.
1382367	1385008	Well, the CEO was not going to give a specific date.
1386528	1390049	It does seem, though, confident that the game will be out before the holidays.
1390149	1392009	But that could be like December 24th.
1392509	1396911	In fact, actually, it could be after Christmas because it could be like Kwanzaa he's talking about as the holidays.
1397291	1398031	You just don't know.
1399371	1400872	It could be Chinese New Year, that's right.
1400892	1401932	It could be January, who knows.
1401992	1403813	It could be July 4th, that's still a holiday.
1404013	1405013	That's right, of 2009.
1406734	1412336	Who knows, but I don't like hearing that Spore keeps getting delayed because I'm so ready for this game to come out.
1412356	1415737	I think he celebrates sleep year as a holiday, so he's referring to next sleep year.
1417378	1417818	I agree.
1419258	1422480	All right, well, let's get back to some other gaming news.
1422740	1425401	Well, I do have some happy in regards to Knights.
1425621	1426521	Thank God, we need it.
1427651	1428451	I love you, Sega.
1429952	1441594	They're having different, I would have to say, celebrations that go on every month as far as different content in the game.
1441654	1444895	In fact, they say that you use the Wii Weather Channel to change the weather.
1445815	1448836	This is another bit of additional hidden content.
1451421	1459463	So you basically raise your own A-Life and the hidden content will let you have different monthly celebrations since it's going by the Wii's time clock.
1460063	1466304	So in January they have of course the New Year with fireworks.
1467084	1470165	In February they have the Chinese New Year.
1470885	1473826	So they have a big dragon hanging out and firecrackers and stuff.
1474686	1480107	In March it's carnivals and the people in the game will have masks on
1480929	1483730	April is Flamenco-inspired roses.
1485590	1490171	May is the Boys Festival, which is a Japanese holiday.
1490571	1495992	So it's May 5th, and there's a big carp streamer hanging in it.
1496052	1497633	June is weddings.
1498753	1502254	July is the Bull Running Festival.
1503354	1508475	August, all the residents in the game are going to be playing instruments.
1509344	1512967	September has full moon paper fans.
1513588	1518652	October is the Halloween theme with witches and pumpkin lanterns and stuff like that.
1519453	1524337	November is autumn leaves falling and fruit.
1526319	1534146	And December is Santa and the Christmas tree and all kinds of Christmassy stuff.
1534246	1534907	Christmas nights.
1535247	1536048	Christmas nights, yeah, I know.
1536767	1537647	I love Christmas nights.
1538208	1540568	I wonder if this is going to actually break my household tradition.
1540588	1543470	Because you've never said that on the show before, that you love Christmas nights.
1543890	1546771	I think every week Jamie finds a reason to bring up Christmas nights.
1547271	1548772	Hey, happy 4th of July, everybody.
1548792	1550432	I'm going to play Christmas nights this December.
1551012	1556254	Ever since I moved to California, every Christmas we break out Saturn and we play Christmas nights.
1557175	1561696	She's having to tell this story to Moe because she's like, oh, Moe maybe hasn't heard this before.
1563037	1563997	You just like telling the story.
1564057	1564437	It's okay.
1564537	1565178	It's fun.
1565418	1565838	It is fun.
1567456	1568176	I like Christmas night.
1568196	1569237	Traditions are good.
1569977	1570637	Traditions are good.
1570697	1574218	I did have to borrow my French-Japanese copy of Christmas night since it's exactly the same.
1574258	1576379	It just gets a nice hard case and not a paper case.
1577980	1578440	Oh, no.
1579680	1580280	I was curious.
1581961	1588403	This sounds like a fun way to at least pop in the game once a month and kind of check it out, see what's going on, right?
1588843	1590764	I think it's a cool thing, but what if they have a...
1591622	1596063	Different things to happen, you know, over different years, you know, something that could be updated in the game.
1596243	1596583	You never know.
1596823	1602265	You know, remember, like, Animal Crossing had all the funny stuff that happened on holidays, and it gave you a reason to, like, turn on the game.
1602565	1603585	Like, even New Year's Eve.
1603945	1605065	I haven't played in six months.
1605086	1605666	Hey, it's New Year's.
1605786	1611687	Or if you don't want to wait a year long, just mess with your time clock in your Wii, and you can see all these within, like, an hour.
1613408	1614048	That's the spirit.
1614088	1616228	Whatever, cheater.
1616268	1616929	I'm not cheating.
1616989	1618169	I'm exploiting time.
1620450	1621991	Never give this man a TARDIS.
1623672	1624493	That would be awesome.
1624933	1627355	Alright, why don't you exploit some more news for us, Loki?
1629117	1648211	Well, the latest copy of the official Xbox magazine has the content for Rock Band outlined for March, which reminds me that I haven't bought the February issue of the official Xbox magazine, which had those three free tracks on there with freeze pop and stuff.
1648584	1653448	Puppy has the CD, one of our frequent guests, Puppy, and maybe I'll make him come to the show next week.
1653528	1654409	So bring your Xbox.
1654709	1655931	Puppy, come to the show next week.
1655951	1656391	Okay, thanks.
1657152	1657432	All right.
1657612	1658813	Bring Xbox Magazine.
1660234	1674587	Well, some of the packs that they have outlined, March 4th, we're getting the Thrash Pack, which is going to have At the Gates, Blinded by Fear, Evil Thrashes, The Haunted with Shadow World,
1675740	1679361	I'm not familiar with any of those, but here at the gates, Blind About Fear is supposed to be pretty good.
1680282	1692066	On March 11th, they've got some individual songs, including Bad Company with Shooting Star, which is a cover, Leonard Skinner with Simple Man, and The Police with Message in a Bottle.
1693466	1700769	March 18th, they have the Nine Inch Nails Pack, including March of the Pigs, The Collector, and The Perfect Drug.
1702309	1704210	And then finally, March 25th,
1705066	1715349	has the metal pack with Iron Maiden's Wraith Child, which is a cover, Black Sabbath Supernaut, which is a cover, and the one I'm really looking forward to, Metallica with Fuel.
1716090	1718770	Because that song I said should have been in Rock Band in the first place.
1720331	1721571	So that's awesome.
1722792	1728774	I'm assuming all of them are going to be $4.40 for the pack and $1.60 for each song individually.
1729994	1730614	Hooray!
1731214	1732835	No idea though what's coming out for February though.
1734099	1739382	All right, well, those of you guys on the Wii have been missing out on all this Rock Band goodness, but maybe not for much longer.
1740222	1749968	Again, going back to the EA conversation, apparently it was confirmed that there is the coming launch of Rock Band for the Wii.
1750028	1755051	The CEO, John Riccatello, referred to a coming launch of the Wii version of Rock Band.
1755491	1761314	And IGN said, I don't know, they just really wanted to seek out a firm confirmation that
1761574	1765157	and got him to admit that yes, the game will be making a Wii debut.
1765417	1767959	But no release date given, nothing else given.
1767999	1780709	But by the way, in a related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but some standalone microphones came out for Rock Band and they say something on them about works on the Nintendo Wii, which is hilarious because there is no Rock Band on the Wii yet and they don't work anyway.
1782034	1785455	So EA had to put out a My Bad right now.
1785535	1789137	So that'll be a retail nightmare when the Wii version does come out.
1789177	1790577	People say, I bought this microphone.
1790637	1792018	It said it's going to work on the Wii.
1793418	1796079	I don't understand why they don't work on the Wii.
1796099	1797700	It's a fucking USB microphone.
1797740	1799700	I mean, those have got to be pretty standardized anyway.
1799720	1802281	Because the USB on Nintendo is retarded.
1802301	1804442	Yeah, like USB .5.
1805162	1807063	It's actually slower than USB 1.
1807603	1808964	That'd be awesome.
1809404	1810324	So there you have it.
1811598	1817583	Alright, now it's time for us to get to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1817724	1821347	It's a chance for you to talk to us a little bit with the mailbag.
1821547	1824129	Every week you send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1824149	1827632	DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads them on the air.
1829344	1833365	So, DarkSakura, why don't you put your hand in the mail back there and pull out a few emails.
1833385	1834525	Did we get a lot of emails this week?
1834645	1835406	Oh, God, we did.
1835726	1836046	Awesome.
1836086	1838186	Well, I guess you can't read them all, but pick some of your favorites.
1838606	1845388	Well, there were a couple that were really long, including one from our friend who made us the offer from Disney World.
1845408	1847949	We must do.
1848869	1849109	Yes.
1850009	1853230	And we're making jokes about the stalker thing.
1853450	1853911	We know better.
1854051	1854331	Trust me.
1854351	1854431	Okay.
1856625	1866493	But, um, this one, um, is, um, I'm just going to use, go by the email name, uh, Lord Katakos, because there's no signature on it.
1867114	1871137	Um, I am new to the podcast, and I was wondering if you guys and girl ever talked about MapleStory.
1871798	1875441	I enjoy this game a lot, um, a lot more than Ragnarok, in my opinion.
1876242	1880485	Um, anyway, my undead mage could destroy any of your World of Warcraft accounts.
1881086	1884729	Well, you guys, uh, like, got the micro and stuff.
1885526	1887508	Keep giving out the spanks to the noobs.
1888929	1890650	By the way, that is my priest pic.
1890690	1891971	I think I'm on my PSP.
1892111	1895213	And he sent a picture titled Ugly Mages.
1895794	1902359	But the mailbag is got PMS.
1903199	1907763	So it doesn't let me actually really get to take a look at the images.
1908163	1908623	So sorry.
1912446	1913046	I can't see it.
1914568	1915028	Ah, here we go.
1916118	1917499	I have never played MapleStory.
1917539	1918259	I've heard about it.
1918279	1918459	It's cute.
1918479	1919639	There's a lot of people that like it.
1919799	1920119	Look at this.
1920159	1920360	It's cute.
1920380	1921100	Have you played it, Mo?
1921340	1922480	I loved MapleStory.
1922820	1924001	Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.
1924281	1927482	It's just... Well, that's a cute little banner.
1927862	1928102	Yeah.
1928442	1929603	Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.
1929623	1929803	It's free.
1929823	1932363	It's like Ragnarok, where it has the little guy avatars and everything.
1932423	1934444	It's just another RPG.
1934504	1935704	It's a chibi good time.
1935724	1936765	Yes, it's a chibi good time.
1936785	1940186	They're supposed to be making one for DS, and I'm waiting for that anxiously.
1940366	1940886	I heard about that.
1940906	1941526	It would never happen, though.
1941546	1942067	It should be fun.
1943027	1943367	All right.
1944062	1948185	Well, okay, so it looks like there are some MapleStory fans here, so you're in good company.
1950367	1953690	This one actually is addressed to Loki from Azurame.
1954971	1961276	I don't quite remember, but in a past episode of OLR, I remember you stating you were able to play games on your Wii.
1961336	1961796	Is this true?
1961816	1962697	Please answer back, thanks.
1962737	1965319	I think it means the imports, which we've obviously proven.
1966180	1967320	Yes, I can play games on my Wii.
1967341	1967661	Okay.
1968812	1971674	If you've been listening to tonight's show, obviously since we have Smash Bros.
1971694	1974096	Brawl in the house and it's an import copy, yes, you can play import.
1974116	1976678	Yeah, because I have a mod chip in mind.
1979200	1980341	This one comes from Osfer.
1981802	1984965	It turns out my parents will finally be getting high-speed internet.
1985385	1989068	And yes, believe it or not, I've had to suffer the pains and torture of dial-up for years.
1989609	1991730	So I resort to web browsing on my iPhone for now.
1992010	1992571	iPhone.
1993717	1997559	But in about a week, I'll be able to finally listen live and even work up the nerve to call in.
1997960	2001262	Talking to you guys would be like talking to celebrities, so yeah, I'd be nervous.
2001842	2006785	But I'm sure talking about gaming would put me at ease.
2007286	2009007	Thanks, and I hope to be a live listener soon.
2009447	2009847	P.S.
2010368	2012509	How come I can't access your chat room on iPhone?
2012569	2013790	I've done it with other sites before.
2013810	2014731	Is it because it's Java?
2015451	2016512	Actually, yeah.
2017552	2019994	The iPhone has problems with Java, but I think that
2020874	2021414	Well, I don't know.
2021474	2027299	I haven't updated my software on my iPhone yet, so maybe that will change.
2027419	2032983	I know I can't watch any YouTube videos if they're embedded, unless I actually just use the YouTube channel.
2033223	2034284	It's because it's the iPhone?
2034604	2035445	No, iPhone's great.
2037046	2042710	You know, and I didn't mean to sound like I was bashing our emailer when they said that talking to us would be like talking to celebrities.
2042830	2046092	I just, you know, it's a compliment.
2046132	2046673	It really is.
2046793	2047533	But, you know, we're just...
2048539	2048819	DarkSakura.com
2063881	2065462	I didn't card Moe.
2065482	2066683	I can pull out my wallet.
2066823	2067144	I'm 22.
2067864	2068164	All right.
2068204	2068445	Good.
2068605	2068885	Good enough.
2069085	2076030	Actually, I want to really quickly, before I get to the next email, I'm so sorry, but there was a very good question asked in chat that I think is a thing to address right now.
2076491	2084977	And someone in chat, they didn't change their nickname, so I just know them as OLARMYRecruit9348 says, someone please tell me how to find Moe on YouTube.
2085197	2086518	And it made me realize I'm so rude.
2086538	2088279	I never let Moe plug her stuff.
2089280	2090881	So please, plug away.
2090941	2092683	How can they find your performance from Moe?
2092703	2093003	I don't know.
2093163	2095106	You can look up the username Amixia.
2095186	2098430	I think you can actually go to youtube.com slash Amixia.
2099331	2106681	It's A-M-I-X-I-A and it's me being a retard with my digital camera and the color tends to change because it's a really bad video camera.
2107522	2109405	It's awesome, but it's me being a retard.
2109865	2110987	It's Amixia on YouTube.
2111564	2111844	It's all right.
2111864	2113226	They're listening to us being retards right now.
2113286	2113546	It's all good.
2113566	2113946	It works.
2114127	2114487	It works.
2114867	2115468	You're in good company.
2115528	2117090	Any other websites you work with?
2117810	2118691	I have a live journal.
2118791	2122455	You can check all my YouTube stuff on there because I'll post those publicly.
2122775	2125939	My username is Furious, spelled exactly like Furious.
2126179	2126479	Wow.
2126499	2127861	I have the most awesome username ever.
2127881	2128702	That's a pretty good username.
2128722	2129042	Congrats.
2129322	2130303	I also have a website.
2130483	2130604	It's...
2131264	2133706	Pride.net, and I never update it.
2133746	2136707	I think the last video on there was never going to give you up, so I should probably fix that.
2136727	2140289	Yeah, it's just like we have a PSP site that I never update.
2140450	2141610	We don't update our websites either.
2141650	2141970	It's fine.
2141990	2142851	Yeah, Pride.net has updates.
2142871	2145292	We were supposed to have a new URL on our website like the first of the year.
2145332	2145873	It didn't happen.
2146753	2147154	It didn't happen.
2147534	2147814	All right.
2148114	2148794	Well, thank you.
2148835	2151036	So now there you go to our listener.
2152096	2154218	Sorry, you can get back to emails now, but that was something very important.
2154258	2155418	It is very important.
2155438	2155619	It is.
2156579	2157960	So next one comes from Ali.
2157980	2158040	Ali.
2158951	2162552	On episode 264, I'm glad you're keeping track of episode numbers because I'm not.
2164613	2167234	Loki goes on an anti-MacBook Air rant.
2167954	2175396	As an Apple fanboy, I must say that the MacBook Air is a triumph of engineering and a beautiful machine, and I don't think it was intended to play video games on.
2176357	2181858	As an Apple stockholder, I can say the MacBook Air blows chunks.
2182639	2183939	Insert love the show drivel here.
2185283	2196467	It's not that I have a problem with it not being able to play games, I really don't care, and I'm sure it can because it's got a core 2D processor in it, but it's just that it doesn't have a CD-ROM drive, or a DVD-ROM drive, or anything like that.
2196507	2207111	You have to basically hijack a drive off another computer, or you have to buy a $99 drive that plugs into the single USB port that's on the damn thing.
2207151	2213594	I mean, it's just not very... Yeah, it's thin, okay, props for that, and I'm sure it has a nice battery life, but it's...
2214344	2217868	Once again, all aesthetics and no functionality.
2218749	2221131	Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game radio.
2221151	2223113	We never talk computers at all, just video games.
2224074	2226156	Computers play games, therefore it works.
2226576	2228598	We talk consoles, consoles play games too.
2228718	2229699	Fine, fine, fine.
2231942	2234704	Anyway, can I keep going now?
2235786	2237207	Okay.
2237227	2238128	This comes from Ryoma.
2239400	2251546	Hello, I was just listening to Part B of Episode 265 today, and as excited as I was to hear you talk about Smash Brawl, I have a little something to add to your discussion about the demos.
2252276	2263641	On the Japan Official Smash Brawl page, there are two more demos that seem to be exclusive to Japan, Mother 2, Earthbound of course, and the original Fire Emblem, which is where Marth comes from.
2264162	2268444	Obviously, I understand that those two games are out on the Japanese Virtual Console.
2268924	2281230	However, I'm pretty irritated with the fact that Nintendo seems to love to torture us Americans, apologies to all overseas listeners, with the idea of having a new Mother game having Earthbound ported to the GBA, DS, VC, what have you.
2281730	2290977	I still love Nintendo to death, and the only next-gen system I have is a Wii, but their seeming lack of interest in what American gamers want is growing frustrating.
2291337	2294059	Just made two cents with much love from Chicago, Ryoma.
2294560	2306669	I can understand why they're not bringing some of those games over, because Earthbound, I'm sure, has quite a bit of dialogue in there, and they have to localize it, where it's not just, I can throw a copy of the ROM onto the Virtual Console Network.
2306749	2309431	Now, I don't understand why they wouldn't put something they'd say localized in
2309994	2314618	The UK and bring it over here because, I don't know, that's just lazy.
2319261	2319581	Next.
2320562	2321022	I guess so.
2321203	2321443	Okay.
2322043	2323004	Hi, The Doctor here.
2323524	2326527	Just to ask what happened to random talk about Battlestar Galactica?
2327747	2328668	Shane moved away.
2329369	2331851	Just wondering because after a while, DarkSakura just stopped.
2332591	2334312	I never talked about Battlestar Galactica.
2334433	2336054	You're getting her confused with Rice Princess.
2336174	2336274	Yeah.
2337825	2340606	and Rob, you still need to send me that MP3 file, please.
2341587	2342427	Oh yeah, I forgot.
2342487	2343127	I'm sorry, I will.
2344128	2345709	Battlestar Galactica comes back in April.
2345749	2348690	I'm sure you will hear random Battlestar Galactica chat come back in April.
2349690	2351511	Because this show never gets derailed, ever.
2352051	2352252	Ever.
2352652	2353572	Rob.
2353912	2354112	Rob.
2354372	2354673	Rob.
2355213	2355513	What?
2356273	2356473	Hi.
2359135	2364397	I've been busy playing Wild Arms and Castlevania Symphony of the Night on my PSP after I paid for them on the PlayStation Network.
2365117	2366678	some Call of Duty 4 actually a lot.
2366778	2367438	Oh, and Rez.
2367598	2368478	Fuck yeah, Rez.
2368698	2369619	Fuck yes, Rez.
2370699	2372099	That is one addicting game.
2372480	2377341	Listening to last week's show while writing this, they retracted their retraction.
2377401	2378101	What the fuck?
2379442	2382463	Sorry, it was literally a WTF, but I like saying what the fuck.
2382703	2383003	Oh, okay.
2383303	2385084	And Rob, I challenge you to some Undertow.
2385744	2388005	Anyways, I was going to go now so you guys can move on.
2388125	2388405	Peace.
2389405	2390946	I'm really bad at Undertow.
2390966	2391906	I don't think you want to play me.
2391946	2394707	Play me at something I'm like halfway decent at, like Puzzle Fighter or something.
2395336	2400479	Well, we have one more email that's really, really, really, really, really freaking long.
2400759	2401079	Okay.
2402520	2404982	Hello, Sky, Loki, DarkSakura, and guest host.
2407103	2407143	Hi.
2408284	2408884	Disclaimer.
2408924	2416889	First, let me apologize for my bad grammar, as I know you tend to be a stickler for proper grammar, and I tend to disregard proper grammar and spelling whenever I write anything.
2416989	2417469	That's okay.
2417509	2418489	I'm used to IMing, Rob.
2420711	2421291	Burn.
2421511	2424593	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, bite me.
2426464	2426725	What?
2426905	2427285	Heart.
2429147	2429827	I brought you cake.
2429907	2430248	Be nice.
2430668	2430988	That's true.
2431029	2432029	You did buy me cake.
2432109	2433150	It was delicious cake.
2433251	2433571	Email.
2433591	2434812	It was delicious and moist.
2434852	2436173	Delicious and moist.
2436694	2436914	Email.
2436934	2437254	Email.
2438716	2439656	Okay, Oscar.
2442219	2444741	Regarding the Fox News report on Mass Effect.
2444821	2445282	Oh, Lord.
2445722	2446323	Oh, God.
2446343	2447343	End of email.
2449443	2449743	Excuse me.
2467782	2476048	Lately with news, it seems that the way to get a top story on the news is simply find something that has a soap opera or scandal written all over it.
2476469	2481052	Scandal sell, and it also had to do with sex, which we know the old saying about that.
2481513	2486697	And of course, children, since the stereotype to a lot of non-gamers is video games are kid stuff.
2491949	2505984	Were I a news show producer or a news show host and saw something that implied there was a lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect, I would run with a trashy story like that because if it is true, that can mean a big ratings hike for the show and a possible raise slash promotion for yourself.
2507870	2519039	Since video games are considered the current evil that is corrupting our youth, much like rock and roll in the 50s and 60s, violent films in the 80s and 90s, and rock and roll, again, just before the focus shifted to video games.
2519059	2520140	You know that was both Jack Thompson.
2520180	2521100	I mean, him, too.
2521541	2521781	Sorry.
2522581	2526344	I still remember journalists trying to pin the Columbine High School Massacre on Marilyn Manson.
2527225	2530287	It makes any scandalous video game story easy prey.
2530668	2532029	With a chance that could be...
2532851	2556409	that could get a casual gamer concerned parents and people who would act like sex in video games I gotta see what games they mention and start playing them as well as your regular audience to tune in when they might not have also since few outside of gaming world would read or hear any follow up on the story on the net regarding the false statements of the report it would be a quick and easy reading so not everyone would have heard the bad journalism backlash disgusting?
2556729	2561273	yes but it also means modern day journalism tactics as well ok discuss so I can take a break
2564296	2565896	Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here.
2566877	2571158	I do understand probably any network would have done it.
2571518	2573119	But I don't know.
2573159	2575800	There's something about the whole sensationalism of it.
2575880	2576380	And I don't know.
2576440	2579141	I feel like Fox News in general has kind of done this stuff before.
2579201	2580462	But I think you're right.
2580542	2586204	CNN probably would do something like this too.
2586384	2588305	I mean it just kind of depends on – but I don't know.
2588345	2588765	I feel like –
2589637	2597983	There's actual news to be reported on out there with an election going on right now and things going on in other countries and things.
2599104	2599464	Whatever.
2600345	2602627	I don't know.
2603327	2607170	Just shouldn't waste our time with that kind of crap.
2607891	2608211	That's all.
2609775	2614617	Well, and didn't they pull the statement like a couple days later when her book on Amazon started getting tanking reviews?
2614997	2616477	She sort of said, I'm sorry.
2616497	2620499	She was like, oh, okay, maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.
2620879	2622439	It was kind of like a half-assed apology, though.
2622459	2626340	She was like, I made a real bad judgment call or something like that.
2626601	2632642	But she didn't really say, I'm sorry, gamers, or I'm sorry to the gaming community and to the mature gamers out there.
2632943	2634083	She didn't really say anything like that.
2634123	2635663	She just said, oh, I done fucked up.
2636064	2637044	Yeah, but...
2638425	2647710	Don't make a statement on Fox News 1, and then once you realize that your review on Amazon is dropping hugely, it took a nosedive.
2647750	2649951	She was like, okay, maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.
2650231	2651251	No shit.
2652852	2654173	Yeah, so there you have it.
2654233	2655453	Anything else you want to read out of that email?
2655473	2656174	There's plenty more.
2656294	2656634	All right.
2657534	2662457	As for the... Well, you know, really this is... Actually, I do have to say this is actually more of what...
2663172	2669235	We've discussed on the show as well, but I really do like this email, and I'm going to post it on the forum, if I remember to.
2672116	2673997	I'm going to move on to the drinking game portion.
2674357	2674597	Okay.
2675918	2685082	In other news, I know the game series is a bit touchy subject for you guys and already has great music, but how would a custom soundtrack of Dragon Force or Death Clock be for a Katamari game?
2685923	2686423	Dude, yes.
2686523	2686763	Yes.
2689144	2690345	I love Metalocalypse.
2690945	2691145	Anyway.
2691165	2691245	Okay.
2692493	2694575	I think it would really change my outlook on the franchise.
2694655	2702881	I love its fun, cheesy quirkiness, and I think Dragon Force soundtrack version of the game would make me love it even more for its mass chaos, death, and destruction, as I do love games with mass carnage.
2703741	2704822	One last thing, sorta.
2705202	2706443	The OLR drinking games.
2706543	2715509	Got a big laugh at the chatroom saying, take a drink whenever Loki leads off the story with anyways, since that first was the first thing that crossed my mind.
2715629	2719232	I am very conscious of that now, and I have been not saying that.
2719676	2722078	No, it's okay, because now it's part of the drinking game and you want people to drink.
2723059	2724179	Well, I don't want them to die.
2725320	2725640	True.
2726341	2729583	They already take a shot every time I say an off-color comment.
2730684	2731245	Every five seconds?
2731265	2733046	People should be rushed to the hospital already.
2733726	2736869	Alright, well, he has some suggestions for us.
2737890	2743574	Whenever the show goes off on a tangent about food... Hey, we've had cake all night, so... Mmm, cake.
2743894	2744695	Delicious cake.
2745095	2745575	Moist.
2746556	2749038	Whenever there is Sony bashing after some Sony news...
2749975	2753237	The word addict is used after someone mentions playing an MMORPG.
2754557	2761801	Anytime a and he uses the blanking expletive is used outside of the FUs of the week segment.
2762921	2764262	Okay, they can't do that on me then.
2765463	2766803	Anytime DarkSakura goes What?
2766823	2766943	Hi.
2766963	2767584	We need the ferret.
2767604	2768724	Whenever Loki bashes the Mac
2777637	2781059	Anytime there's a mention of that former video game channel that shall not be named.
2781780	2784742	Anytime there's a mention of that blood-sucking lawyer that shall not be named.
2784862	2785903	What, GameProTV?
2788644	2789865	With the dreamy J.D.
2789945	2790265	Roth.
2791246	2794548	Anytime Rob says heart to DarkSakura after making fun of her.
2795549	2796590	That was the opposite this time.
2796650	2798251	Yeah.
2798451	2801453	If Raven's Dolphin is the first caller on the Skyplane segment...
2803422	2805443	and any mention of Pyramid Head.
2805563	2809884	Any caller that calls in on a Skype line that's got a bad connection.
2810184	2814005	You know, there is a whole thread going on in the forums and I encourage you to add to this.
2814025	2816446	They are actually making an OLR drinking game in the thread.
2816746	2819207	Here's some more examples of what's going on in the thread here.
2819827	2823308	Let's see, Sky, take a drink every time Sky says, fired.
2823528	2823909	Fired!
2824729	2827510	Mentions the bet or the tingle costume thing.
2828170	2831131	Tells a joke that no one laughs at or is met with resounding silence.
2832412	2841424	DarkSakura gives an F you to bad drivers or her co-workers or to stupid people in general mentions Shermie the cat and says reject false icons as her final thought
2841823	2843344	I haven't said that in a very long time.
2865279	2865940	Exactly.
2866240	2870002	See, how can you not get into a discussion about the Olive Garden when it gets mentioned?
2870022	2871683	The minestrone soup is delicious.
2871703	2872263	There you go.
2872923	2874124	I love the minestrone soup.
2874264	2876285	Too many beans in the minestrone soup, though.
2876305	2877446	No, that's what makes it so great.
2877466	2878606	The potato soup.
2879507	2880227	I love it.
2880287	2881328	Let's go back to Olive Garden.
2881368	2882148	I owe you anyway.
2882208	2885870	Speaking of which, kind of going on a food tangent here real quick.
2885910	2886251	Drink.
2886391	2890733	They started carrying these soups at Rayleigh's now where it's –
2891215	2895157	It's actually the soup from the guy in New York, you know, the soup Nazi.
2895777	2898638	Obviously, they call him the Soup Man, but not Soup Nazi.
2899018	2900779	But I tried one the other day.
2901259	2901739	Not very good.
2902120	2903560	But, you know, it looked cool.
2903620	2906461	The prospect of getting soup from him, you know, was kind of neat.
2906821	2907502	No soup for you.
2907762	2908662	Come back in one year.
2908842	2911023	What the fuck did that have to do with video gaming?
2911864	2913384	Tangent food!
2915245	2915925	Food tangent.
2916705	2917846	Were you paying attention?
2917946	2919187	I finish eating!
2919447	2919567	Email!
2920888	2922189	You cook soup in Cookie Mama.
2922229	2923829	They're Ford's video game related, okay?
2924010	2924430	Yes!
2924530	2924950	Bite me.
2928432	2934555	Anyway, I love the show, keep up the great work, and I've really enjoyed DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week segment.
2934575	2936236	I really do miss the old advice column.
2936316	2937436	I would love to see it come back.
2937996	2939577	My advice is, don't be stupid.
2941698	2942679	That's sound advice.
2942759	2943079	Thank you.
2945815	2949237	If you guys are ever in the Napa area, feel free to drop me an email.
2949258	2955622	I'll be glad to take you and your spouses slash boyfriends to dinner at their restaurants around the valley.
2956943	2957343	Free food.
2958043	2958343	Awesome.
2958484	2959384	I love deals for free food.
2959404	2962826	There's a huge massive PS, but Rob, I'm going to leave it for you to read your part later.
2965068	2965348	All right.
2965388	2966589	We're going to get back to some news now.
2967142	2967803	Shula Shula
2991260	2992041	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3018260	3019701	CryEngine 2, at least the console port of it.
3042686	3046608	at the Game Developers Conference, which is coming up actually in a couple weeks here.
3046768	3052931	So hopefully because of that, we will see maybe Crysis come to, you know, console system.
3053211	3056953	I remember some talks, or rumors at least, of Crysis coming to the PS3.
3058254	3059915	So that'd be pretty cool to see happen.
3060855	3067659	But either way, you know, maybe give something else for game companies to use other than the Unreal 3 engine.
3070340	3070520	Hmm.
3072597	3077883	Oh, and now their engine is fully optimized because if you play it on the PC, the thing eats your PC.
3077963	3080625	I mean, no matter what kind of hardware you have in there.
3081186	3083488	But I guess because it wasn't fully optimized.
3083568	3087973	Thank you, Crytek, for putting out a wonderfully polished game.
3088894	3090175	Not optimized one bit.
3090456	3090876	Awesome.
3092257	3092678	Okay.
3093430	3098832	Well, if Crysis isn't your thing, which I don't know, I haven't really gotten into Crysis, but I don't know, I could probably get into this game.
3099492	3100913	And it's coming to North America soon.
3100973	3104774	It's a game called Arcana Heart, and it's coming to the PlayStation 2.
3105034	3106315	Now, here's the thing about this game.
3106355	3107895	It's an all-girl fighter.
3108776	3109356	That's right.
3109536	3111737	All babes duking it out in the arena.
3111797	3113757	Kind of like the Asuka 100% series or...
3115959	3117260	It's not quite dead or alive.
3117360	3118200	Let's just put it that way.
3118240	3121081	They are fully clothed girls, at least the ones here in this screenshot.
3121141	3122202	Oh, there's a lack of boobies.
3122422	3124603	Yes, there is a severe lack of boobies, which is an important issue.
3124643	3127444	But we do have a little bit of panties in that particular shot.
3128104	3128484	Samus.
3129345	3129605	All right.
3130065	3134587	So anyhow, Atlas has said that the PS2 is still a viable platform.
3134607	3138829	There's no reason to abandon a veteran system just because it isn't the newest thing around.
3139269	3143891	So some of the Japanese titles that haven't made its way over here yet, Atlas Plans, or sorry,
3144668	3147550	Atlas plans to bring over here to the States pretty soon.
3148071	3149372	Arcana Heart has been confirmed.
3149392	3150993	It will be coming out on April 8th.
3151814	3154656	11 different customizable girl fighters.
3155036	3155917	$29.99 is the price.
3156838	3157278	I'll get it.
3157859	3158519	So there you go.
3159020	3160401	That might be fun.
3160681	3162462	We certainly don't have working designs anymore.
3164704	3167426	Okay, well it's about time for us to play a match game.
3168527	3169448	You know what time it is.
3169528	3170569	It's time for the match game.
3170609	3172130	We need some theme music for match game tonight.
3173993	3177215	So Jake, you're going to have to pause Smash Brothers for a little bit because we need you to play a match game tonight.
3177495	3180316	Remember, the way a match game works, well, let me get the contestants, then we'll do a match game.
3180336	3181377	So Mo, why don't you come over here.
3181697	3188400	We didn't have a whole lot of people say me, but we have about that area right there is a few people that said me.
3188481	3193363	So which one of those names do you think is the best, which should play tonight in the match game?
3193963	3194504	Mo's thinking.
3196064	3196925	Cheeseburger.
3197325	3200887	Cheeseburger is going to be our chat room player tonight in the match game.
3202677	3204058	Cheeseburgers are pretty rad.
3204138	3204638	So there you go.
3204858	3207320	Oh, Cheeseburger left chat.
3208760	3209221	Fail.
3209241	3210221	That's epic fail.
3210241	3211162	Bye, Cheeseburger.
3211242	3212062	You lost your opportunity.
3212082	3213823	Okay, so who else do we have?
3222909	3224230	Okay, One Night Stands.
3225330	3227672	Sorry, Cheeseburger, you left at just like the wrong time.
3228312	3231174	So we have One Night Stands as now our player.
3231767	3233668	So I'll get in touch with you in chat shortly.
3234768	3238490	And let's open up the Skype line if you want to play with us.
3238510	3241891	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3241931	3244072	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3250795	3251375	Is something burning?
3252435	3253576	Oh, it might be the thing behind you.
3254256	3255257	I'm just that hot.
3258218	3258458	All right.
3260219	3261859	Let's see, is anybody calling us yet?
3262399	3264160	Maybe nobody wants to play on Skype, I don't know.
3264460	3265300	Oh, here we go, we have a call.
3266420	3267821	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3269541	3270981	Oh, it's SSJ100Matt.
3271041	3275402	Hello, SSJ100Matt, congratulations, you're going to be our other contestant on the match game tonight.
3275963	3281884	And you get to play against One Night Stands in chat, who has yet to confirm with me that he is playing.
3282924	3283584	Hold on a minute.
3285305	3286985	This is live radio, boys and girls.
3289505	3290586	Live radio, folks.
3291186	3292467	Should we cue up the Jeopardy music?
3293668	3296730	Maybe we should just play the theme music again because it's so much fun to listen to.
3296791	3297171	Let's do that.
3297311	3301754	I see him freaking out.
3301874	3303155	I see him freaking out in chat.
3327467	3328228	Oh, I think he got it.
3329249	3329669	There he is.
3331891	3332832	Okay, I think he's got it.
3332872	3333852	He sent me a private message.
3333872	3334253	There you go.
3334693	3335073	Alright.
3335954	3337515	So, SSJ100Matt, you ready to do this?
3339677	3340458	SSJ100Matt, you there?
3340478	3342399	I think everything's broken tonight.
3342660	3344321	Alright, let me remind you all how this works.
3344401	3345582	Okay, Jake, you gotta pause the game.
3346409	3347590	Let me remind everybody how this works.
3347890	3350271	What we're going to do is we're going to have three questions for you tonight.
3350311	3352231	And in the questions, they all have a blank.
3352591	3353892	There's a blank somewhere in the answer.
3353912	3355052	You ever watch the match game in the 70s?
3355232	3356133	The reruns on Game Show Network?
3356213	3356873	Okay, it's just like that.
3357113	3357873	Boy, game stuff.
3358774	3359914	So we're going to ask three questions.
3359954	3361035	There will be a blank in it.
3361275	3366637	So our celebrities will think about their answer and write it down on a little piece of paper.
3368738	3369918	On my invisible keyboard.
3370278	3374620	And then our callers will try to match.
3376326	3378987	and for every celebrity they match, they get a point.
3379627	3380768	That's how it works.
3382028	3384329	Jake, all you have to do is think of something funny that goes in the blank.
3384729	3385129	Or real.
3385409	3385889	It doesn't matter.
3386029	3387169	That's all you have to do.
3387409	3388430	Go for funny.
3391010	3396312	Hopefully one night Stan is understanding what's going on because I just got a message that says, Sweet, I don't know what I'm doing.
3397732	3399013	Which means you're probably going to win.
3399193	3402054	SSJ100, Matt, you're up against some stiff competition tonight.
3402454	3402834	Are you ready?
3404150	3405210	Did Cheeseburger come back?
3405310	3407311	Cheeseburger came back and said, what did I miss?
3407331	3409052	Okay, here we go.
3409572	3411613	Here's what we'll do since we have a code.
3412013	3419256	If it ties 0-0 tonight, if nobody manages to get a point on the board, then we'll give Cheeseburger the code.
3419776	3420096	Yes.
3420356	3423778	All right, so Cheeseburger is hoping that everybody is broke.
3425318	3425619	All right.
3426339	3427619	We'll hope that everyone's a failure.
3428560	3431581	Somebody fill in time while I type out how to play this to One Night Stands.
3433032	3435613	We have Zero Samus on screen.
3435993	3438734	It was funny, though, because... I think we have Kirby getting smashed.
3438974	3442355	She has, like, her suit, but there's, like, a thong built into the suit.
3442675	3443175	That's hot.
3444155	3445196	Okay, he understands now.
3445236	3445556	We're good.
3445736	3446016	All right.
3446296	3449137	See, she has a thong and shiny ass.
3449157	3452578	All right, enough of the porno here.
3453038	3457299	All right, so we have One Night Stands, SSJ100 Matt, and Cheeseburger playing tonight.
3457339	3458700	It's our first three-way match game.
3458740	3460981	Cheeseburger is simply hoping that no one matches anything.
3461961	3462221	All right.
3463118	3464678	Here we go, question number one.
3465639	3470300	DarkSakura was not happy to see Jigglypuff return to Super Smash Bros.
3470340	3470640	Brawl.
3471460	3473620	However, she likes to always look on the bright side.
3474421	3481662	She let all her friends know that she will actually be looking forward to Jigglypuff in the game because she can kill her by blank.
3484903	3489464	DarkSakura is not happy that Jigglypuff is in the game, but no worries, she can kill her by blank.
3492577	3493077	Ding!
3493097	3493278	Ding!
3493298	3493498	Ding!
3493538	3493678	Ding!
3493698	3493918	Ding!
3529423	3530003	Alright, ding.
3532504	3533364	Do you have an answer, Mo?
3533704	3535265	Don't say it yet, but do you know one?
3535465	3536265	I have one.
3536285	3536865	Do you have one, Jake?
3537125	3538446	Okay, he has one.
3538466	3539946	S2100 Matt, do you have an answer just in your mind?
3541747	3542127	Yeah, I got one.
3542327	3544268	Okay, I'm waiting for One Night Stance to send me an answer.
3556612	3557852	So once again, the question...
3559178	3563120	DarkSakura was not happy to see Jigglypuff return to Super Smash Bros.
3563160	3563440	Brawl.
3563780	3566262	However, she likes to always look on the bright side.
3566362	3572985	She let all her friends know that she will actually be looking forward to Jigglypuff in the game because she can kill her by blank.
3576807	3578869	And One Night Stands is still trying to come up with an answer.
3580670	3581590	This is a tough question.
3582070	3583331	It is a hard question.
3583371	3583911	I'll give you that.
3585512	3586913	Ranma, that was me doing the laugh.
3589261	3591283	Why don't you talk a little more about... Oh, okay, there we go.
3591303	3591723	We have an answer.
3592303	3592564	All right.
3593404	3594405	SSJ100 Matt.
3595426	3599129	She can kill her by... What?
3600750	3602732	SSJ100 Matt.
3603853	3604673	Having Kirby eat her.
3605114	3606415	Having Kirby eat her.
3606935	3607256	All right.
3607296	3608336	Having Kirby eat her.
3608837	3612920	And OneNightStan says she can kill her by... Thwomp smash.
3614181	3614962	Thwomp smash.
3615502	3615762	All right.
3616263	3617063	Let's see if there's a match.
3617123	3618705	DarkSakura, she can kill her by...
3620151	3625193	by repeatedly bashing her in the head with Mr. Saturn until she dies a bleeding, horrible, oozy death.
3625733	3630374	That would be a very difficult one to match, but it's a good answer, but unfortunately not a match.
3630734	3631354	Ladies first.
3631434	3632915	Mo, she can kill her by?
3633355	3634435	I was going to say Pyramid Head.
3634795	3635736	Pyramid Head.
3637376	3638336	Rape, sweet rape.
3638576	3639757	All right, from Pyramid Head.
3640477	3641417	Oh, gosh, look at the time.
3641517	3642297	It's Rape O'Clock.
3644358	3645978	Unfortunately not a match.
3646899	3648139	Unfortunately not a match.
3649966	3651067	What time is it?
3651187	3651988	Raping time.
3652088	3653130	All right.
3653230	3653630	Loki.
3654171	3655492	Someone knows the show already.
3657354	3658536	I kept it pretty simple.
3659777	3661859	She can kill her by... Fire.
3662520	3663441	Fire!
3663601	3663942	Not a match.
3663962	3664683	I like fire.
3664703	3665904	I like all these answers so far.
3666064	3666325	All right.
3667426	3667806	Jake.
3668026	3669028	She can kill her by...
3669770	3672193	I also went with fire because fire always makes it better.
3672733	3674195	Oh, fire would have been a great answer.
3674535	3675697	Unfortunately, not a match.
3676237	3682464	And my answer was she could kill her by, in reference to last week, condemned to explosive babies.
3685538	3687639	Unfortunately, also not a match.
3687679	3693921	So Cheeseburger's in the lead right now because it's 0-0, meaning Cheeseburger might win, but there's still two questions to go.
3694381	3696322	Are you ready for the next question, SSJ100 Matt?
3696502	3698282	I can't believe you were singing High School Musical 2.
3698562	3698842	All right.
3699383	3700183	I can't either.
3700963	3702303	I'm sad you recognized that.
3704984	3706285	We'll watch it after the show, okay?
3706645	3706905	All right.
3707885	3708305	Here we go.
3708766	3709726	The next question.
3711093	3720638	Loki was so inspired by Mo's performance of Still Alive in Studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song for the OLR listeners.
3721139	3721659	Right.
3721899	3725041	Next week, he will be performing Blank live on the show.
3732405	3732745	Ding.
3733525	3733806	Ding.
3734266	3735166	Ding ding.
3737188	3737888	Ding dong man.
3739229	3739789	Loki, Jake.
3742805	3749849	Loki was so inspired by Mo's performance of Still Alive in Studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song for the OLR listeners.
3750289	3753391	Next week, he will be performing Blank live on the show.
3755332	3757473	Think you know an answer yet, Jake?
3757493	3758553	Let those gears turn.
3758773	3759714	I'm going to look at chat room.
3764756	3766357	Sorry, the chat has some funny shit.
3769503	3770924	OneNightStance, seriously?
3771265	3772806	Just take an answer from chat.
3779452	3782335	Oh my gosh, I think I like one of these answers better than the one I wrote down.
3782355	3783376	Oh, it's too late.
3785218	3787119	I'm still waiting for OneNightStance to give me an answer.
3787540	3789642	SSJ100Matt, do you have an answer in your mind?
3790202	3790362	Yep.
3790703	3792144	Alright, then we're just waiting on OneNightStance.
3797625	3798926	I've got to stop dancing to the music.
3798986	3799287	All right.
3800047	3801929	We got an answer for One Night Stand.
3801989	3802449	All right, SSJ100Matt.
3802490	3807434	Loki was so inspired by most performances still live in studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song.
3807494	3812899	Next week he will be performing... Chocolate Rain.
3815321	3817383	Chocolate Rain for the listeners.
3817483	3817804	All right.
3818284	3823529	One Night Stand says, Mario's theme or stupid response Spice Girls want to be?
3824398	3826520	So, we'll see if either one of those matches.
3826620	3826941	I don't know.
3826961	3827801	I don't know if we let him out.
3827821	3828782	Guess who thing.
3829063	3829323	All right.
3829363	3831625	Then we're going to go with Mario's theme because that's what he said first.
3832426	3832666	All right.
3833347	3836230	DarkSakura, he's going to perform one live on the show.
3836570	3837211	Animal Dance.
3837631	3838452	Animal Dance.
3840410	3840951	Good answer.
3841071	3841571	Animal Dance?
3841832	3842472	Animal Dance.
3842492	3842813	All right.
3845195	3847417	Moe, he will be performing what live on the show?
3847538	3849580	Dragon Forces through Fire and Flame.
3849720	3852923	Dragon Forces through the Fire and Flames.
3853244	3853824	Not an answer.
3854305	3855206	Loki, what did you pick?
3858009	3858589	I don't know.
3860671	3862533	Okay, we'll just pick what the chat room says.
3863905	3865306	Theme for Tingle.
3865706	3867827	I don't even know what the Tingle theme is.
3870629	3871429	Jake, your answer.
3872149	3875651	The Swinging Jazz Ambassadors of Swing with My Monkey Done Left Me and Took All My Jello.
3879133	3879573	I like that.
3880894	3882515	Acoustic Dragon Force would be pretty funny.
3883435	3886397	Wow, The Monkey Left Me and Took All My Jello?
3886417	3888338	Damn that monkey.
3889261	3893322	All right, and my answer was also Tingle's theme was my answer.
3893462	3896363	So, unfortunately, no match.
3897944	3898604	But that's okay.
3898624	3900085	There is one more question.
3900825	3907787	Cheeseburger's very excited right now because it's 0-0, and if it stays 0-0, then Cheeseburger wins by default just for having a cool nickname.
3907927	3909768	Wins a free copy of Res HD.
3910068	3912689	Didn't have to do shit, but disappear from chat.
3913129	3913969	Yes, SSJ100 Matt.
3914009	3914309	What?
3915590	3915790	What?
3916793	3918534	If I win, I'll give it to Cheeseburger also.
3918954	3919814	Oh, shiz.
3920354	3921975	Do you already have the game, SSJ100Mad?
3921995	3922475	Is that what's up?
3924596	3925657	Yeah, actually I do.
3926017	3926257	Oh, okay.
3926417	3926617	All right.
3926637	3928318	Well, then Cheeseburger, shit, just sit there.
3928358	3928878	Don't do nothing.
3929278	3929538	All right.
3930739	3932479	Just sit there and look pretty, Cheeseburger.
3932519	3933340	Just sit there and look pretty.
3933700	3933960	All right.
3934000	3934360	Here we go.
3934400	3935000	There's one more, though.
3935060	3935580	One Night Stands.
3935600	3936161	The Giants won.
3936201	3937081	I'm in a generous mood.
3937601	3940442	One Night Stands is not out yet.
3940903	3941603	So here it is.
3942163	3944444	Question number three, the last question.
3945649	3949992	Rob was very disappointed to hear that Spore was delayed yet again.
3950993	3956276	He was all ready with the time off work to play the game all day and all night this spring.
3957277	3960739	Oh well, Rob said, I guess I'll just play blank all day.
3968348	3971490	Rob was very disappointed to hear that Spore was delayed yet again.
3971790	3973732	He was all ready with the time off work to play the game.
3973872	3975953	Oh well, I guess I'll just play blank all day.
3977314	3977834	Ding.
3983098	3983378	Ding.
3985780	3986000	Ding.
3987861	3988362	Ding, Jake.
3989102	3991404	Still thinking?
3992504	3993405	Keep those gears turning.
3993465	3994806	SSJ100, Matt, have you thought of an answer?
3994826	3994866	No.
3996514	3997034	Yeah.
3997655	3998515	So is One Night Stands.
3998575	4000096	One Night Stands is getting the hang of this now.
4000216	4001097	He's got it this round.
4001697	4001998	All right.
4002258	4003518	Everybody else good?
4003559	4005680	Jake, you almost... Okay, you got it?
4005960	4006981	That's a ding.
4007001	4007561	All right, here we go.
4009862	4010703	SSJ100 Matt.
4011263	4013485	Oh, well, Rob said, I guess I'll just play...
4016189	4016629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4040925	4041185	Nice.
4043847	4044768	I didn't know that was a game.
4045348	4048410	Moe, I guess I'll just play... Major Wee.
4048930	4050792	Major Wee all day.
4050812	4051512	That was a good one.
4051592	4053133	Good use of a Part A reference.
4053173	4053654	I like that.
4054194	4054454	All right.
4054514	4057716	Loki, oh well, I guess I'll just play... I went in with the realistic answer.
4057776	4058657	World of Warcraft.
4058757	4060678	World of Warcraft all day.
4060859	4063400	Jake, oh well, I guess I'll just play... Oblivion.
4063700	4065081	Oblivion all day.
4065141	4066282	Those are both very good answers.
4066662	4067263	And I said...
4067958	4068458	This is it.
4068999	4071761	If I said Imagine Babies, then One Night Stands wins it.
4071841	4073322	If not, Cheeseburger wins it.
4074983	4077705	Rob was very disappointed to hear the Sporos late yet again.
4077885	4082609	Oh well, I guess I'll just play World of Warcraft all day.
4082669	4085271	And that's World of Warcraft, not Warcraft.
4085631	4088313	So that means Cheeseburger wins!
4088453	4090535	Just for sitting there and looking pretty in a 0-0 show.
4093185	4098169	SSJ100 Matt, you lose, so we hang up on you, but do you have a quick plug?
4100991	4104013	Giants win!
4104093	4117124	Sorry One Night Stands, you did good, at least you got the hang of the match game, I hope you had fun Cheeseburger, private message me your email, you win match game I love how someone wins match game that didn't even play
4118464	4119545	That's how I roll.
4119685	4120826	That's the Orange Lounge Radio.
4120866	4121186	That's right.
4121226	4123047	This is how we roll here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4123067	4123747	This is how we roll.
4124408	4124728	All right.
4125549	4126449	Do we have any more stories?
4127130	4127670	Yes.
4127770	4127950	All right.
4128030	4130752	One more story, and then we're going to open up their Skype line.
4132833	4137556	So not to be outdone by the Wii yet again, PS3 devs.
4139352	4145776	Have put out a little video saying, look at what we can do with the PlayStation Eye.
4146156	4148278	Yeah, we can do that VR shit too.
4148598	4150979	Woo, we're awesome.
4151119	4157383	But yeah, basically kind of impressed by what they've done using the Wiimote.
4157403	4159044	They kind of did this very similar thing.
4159244	4161526	Actually looked like it used the exact same program.
4162166	4166849	And it's running on a PS3 dev kit to give that head tracking effect.
4167586	4170349	So, you know, I'm pretty impressed by the PlayStation.
4170549	4174072	I'm not going to buy it yet, but I'm impressed by what you can do with it.
4174152	4176655	Like, you know, the little tech demos and stuff.
4177936	4183361	But I would like some actual games that use this technology instead of just look at what we can do.
4185063	4186184	Oh, but it'll never come out.
4186284	4187145	But just look at what we can do.
4189427	4189747	All right.
4190848	4191269	What do you think?
4191309	4192610	What will they do, do you think?
4193297	4194257	Well, they better do something.
4194417	4203241	I like that one where it's the combat type game, like the old Atari combat, but you can scan in your picture that you want to use as your tank.
4203921	4204861	You can just draw a picture.
4204881	4207202	You can put an actual tank on there, stuff like that.
4207502	4208023	That's cool.
4208243	4212524	Or like the Lunar Lander game that you make by drawing the pictures and stuff.
4213025	4213965	I mean, that's pretty cool.
4214885	4221908	That's what they should be doing with the eye instead of just, I don't know, games where I have to move a ball around by waving my arm.
4224013	4226094	Trial of the Tupac, Orange Lounge Radio
4254528	4263096	Last Minute Stories, Japan Post is giving away red DS lights, so yet another color you won't see over here in the US.
4263376	4264177	Hooray!
4265558	4279610	The PS3 is getting their own greatest hits, including such wonderful games as Resistance Fall Man, Folk Soul, or Folklore, I think that's what it's called over here, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Gundam Target in Sight, which I think sucked,
4279972	4281053	and RidgeRacer7.
4281593	4284376	All those are going to be available for 3,800 yen, which translates to about 3,599.
4284436	4287378	Oh, boy.
4288259	4292302	I just picked up the phone, and who is there on the phone on the Orange Lingerie Skyline?
4293423	4294584	None other than Legend of Zaku.
4294884	4295505	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
4295525	4297206	Eating a bag of chips by the sound of it.
4298067	4299488	What's on your mind, Legend of Zaku?
4300109	4300429	Nothing.
4302293	4310037	No, nothing but just coming back from just, you know, going to Dave & Buster's or Super Bowl shit and stuff.
4310897	4314398	Yeah, was it wild and crazy when the Giants won?
4315339	4328725	Yeah, I mean, it was kind of quiet when the game started, but then as we further went through, there was a lot of people there, and it was just madness on the way out of Times Square.
4331877	4335039	Did you actually watch the Super Bowl or did you just play DDR all night?
4336660	4341983	No, I actually had my buffalo wings, my beer, and all that other stuff.
4342003	4343384	I actually avoided DDR today.
4345505	4352129	But besides that, I don't know if you want to bring up Supernova 2 since it was probably brought up by other folks anyways.
4354231	4359034	We haven't talked a lot about DDR recently on the program, but what are your thoughts on DDR Supernova 2?
4362153	4363493	Basically, it's like this.
4365234	4366714	I don't know, it's just Betzen.
4366774	4368074	It's Betzen holding us back.
4368515	4372075	They're holding us back for the fact that we can't even unlock songs right now.
4372496	4379397	We're being forced, against our will, to basically have to go as far as importing a game.
4379977	4386899	We're basically just telling the arcade owners that we have good relationships with, better than Betzen's, to just avoid it.
4388031	4391872	It's not worth it without EMUs or a means of unlocking it.
4392592	4398454	So you're pissed they didn't bring the Japanese-only EMU system over to America to try and add a little something to the game?
4398474	4401794	Aren't we kind of lucky to have DDR still going in the arcades in the first place?
4401814	4402695	I mean, think about it.
4402715	4403035	That was...
4417286	4422350	Remember, in no way am I blaming Konami, because they're actually making a good effort in bringing it over here.
4422790	4438721	They tried it with this game, they tried it with Guitar Freak's Drum Mania, which hasn't seen a release date yet, but if Benton is trying to half-ass their way into this, the only thing I can see is Konami...
4441734	4445536	All right.
4445656	4446556	What do you think?
4449197	4450898	Giving us a little Betson hate here on the show.
4450918	4451638	That's fine.
4451678	4455079	But what can Betson do to make things right with DDR?
4455119	4456139	Let's say there's a Supernova 3.
4456399	4457460	What can they do to make things right?
4459220	4460641	I mean, that's pretty much what...
4464158	4471783	What they had to do anyways, since I know this is most likely, the way they were picked out anyways was, you know, a contract.
4472423	4490475	So, you know, since Konami put that bid, you know, bid out, you know, gave bets in the contract to distribute games in America, by not, by basically, you know, asserting Konami's will, you're, you know, that would be on the, you know, that would be grounds for breach of contract right there.
4491204	4495626	and, you know, Konami will sue for, you know, if it got that bad.
4495686	4496827	Konami will sue?
4497067	4499308	If it was putting a damper on their sails.
4499468	4500588	Alright, we gotta wrap up.
4500628	4501829	Any last minute thoughts, Zaku?
4503149	4505691	Um, I don't know.
4506671	4508612	Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass.
4508812	4509572	That's all I have to say.
4509752	4510233	There you have it.
4510293	4512174	Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass.
4512414	4512874	It does.
4514063	4515244	Are you a Call of Duty fangirl?
4515444	4515664	Yeah.
4516084	4516984	Alright, good times.
4517465	4517905	It's gorgeous.
4517925	4520226	Call of Duty 3 sucked, but for good reason.
4520526	4521547	Call of Duty 3 was fun.
4521567	4523167	It was an Infinity Ward.
4523828	4530251	Call of Duty 2 I liked, because there was one level that you can download that had a giant tower in the middle of that, and we absolutely loved playing multiplayer on that.
4530451	4534953	It's whoever can stand, you know, king of the tower, I guess, instead of king of the hill, but...
4537819	4543867	Call of Duty 3 was okay, but Call of Duty 4 was a lot better.
4544068	4547152	Yeah, well, because Call of Duty 3 was a completely different team.
4548974	4552539	Alright, I have some big news before we go to this next call.
4552619	4553380	Cheeseburger...
4554617	4560440	has deferred the prize, saying that unfortunately he only has a Wii, so the prize does him no good.
4560880	4566363	So the prize will go back into the prize pool, and we'll give it away next week here on the program in another lame game.
4566843	4570305	So tune in next week for your chance to win Rez HD.
4570845	4574007	Cheeseburger says instead, my birthday is on the 14th.
4574307	4576408	Say happy birthday on the show instead, okay?
4576768	4579270	So happy birthday, Cheeseburger.
4579610	4580150	All right, there you go.
4581536	4583277	Have a good birthday on Valentine's Day.
4583497	4584458	That is so awesome.
4585319	4585899	And cute.
4586299	4587060	It's cute.
4587360	4588040	So cute.
4588060	4588961	So precious.
4588981	4590242	Let's go to the sky flight.
4590262	4591183	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4591203	4591523	Who's this?
4594585	4595486	I thought we had someone on sky flight.
4595506	4595746	It's Ranma.
4595766	4596186	What's up, everyone?
4596206	4597207	Well, hello, Ranma.
4597247	4597767	What's on your mind?
4598648	4599688	Hey.
4600909	4601309	Not much.
4601370	4603511	Before I start, Jamie.
4604372	4605793	Jamie stepped out for just a minute.
4605993	4607093	She stepped out for just a minute.
4607314	4608554	For a giant wee.
4609175	4610776	Yes, I think she's taking a major wee.
4613746	4616387	So do you have, can we relay something to her?
4616427	4617608	What would you say if she was here?
4621230	4624631	Well, me or you, because I just wanted to say to her, I can have the Guinness, that's all.
4625391	4626452	Is there a major lag tonight?
4626472	4626912	I think there is.
4626952	4628213	Maybe the cam's slowing things down.
4628233	4628633	I don't know.
4628853	4629974	It might be on my end.
4630014	4631054	If there is, I'm sorry.
4631414	4631794	It's all right.
4631834	4632375	We forgive you.
4632435	4633835	So I can have the Guinness.
4633895	4635116	We'll relay the message to her.
4635156	4637537	Is there anything else you want to say about the program?
4639666	4640786	Join the show so far.
4640927	4644089	I missed part eight because out in a row of friends getting tattooed.
4644229	4647612	Well, you missed Mo's lovely rendition of Still Alive.
4647672	4648172	How dare you?
4649433	4651635	I will catch the replay on Justin TV.
4652535	4653556	Jamie is back.
4653716	4654617	What do you want to say to Jamie?
4656178	4656498	Jamie.
4656758	4656978	What?
4658560	4659500	I can has a Guinness?
4660121	4660921	Yes, you can has.
4663143	4664244	I can has Guinness.
4665685	4666846	I can has Smithwick's.
4666866	4667987	Smithwick's is what I called.
4668047	4668307	Is that?
4668789	4672670	I'm kind of tired of the DDR bashing by the diehards.
4672750	4675050	Can we just let it be, okay?
4675450	4678531	We already realize that Konami doesn't care.
4679091	4680331	They're doing what they can.
4681171	4684172	Just leave it be, because I'm just a happy-go-lucky player.
4684312	4686612	I'm just happy that we even have the game in the arcades.
4686752	4687793	Can we just leave it at that?
4687873	4690113	Can't we just all agree that DDR is gay?
4690713	4691913	Can't we all just get along?
4692954	4694494	And I can say that, because I am, so...
4696405	4698045	Is it gayer than you or gay as you?
4698266	4699986	No, I'm just kidding.
4700026	4700986	DDR is not gay.
4701046	4706108	DDR is just... DDR totally does not like to sleep with other DDRs of the same gender.
4709909	4710669	I'd beg to differ.
4713150	4713810	No, I'm kidding.
4715090	4718151	I've said the DDR argument so many times I'm like blue in the face.
4718471	4720432	I want to look at pretty Smash Bros.
4720452	4721012	Brawl more.
4721052	4721772	That's all I want.
4721832	4722312	Is that okay?
4724233	4725113	But, um, Rob.
4725673	4725853	What?
4727020	4731763	A few episodes back, you said something about any things you would do to make DDR better.
4731803	4733044	You kind of glanced over it.
4733104	4735005	What would you do to make it better?
4735145	4736446	I really have to hear what you would do.
4736967	4741990	I would scrap all the code that they've ever used to make DDR and build the game from the ground up.
4742030	4745452	It's going to force them to think of some new ideas on how to make the game original again.
4745472	4749195	And I would bring over some of the people that helped on the Xbox version if they're still with the company.
4750196	4753878	Additionally, I would think about how to make the game more competitive than cooperative in nature.
4753958	4756860	Because, yes, there was the dance battle mode or whatever in Supernova.
4757160	4760682	But I think a mode like that should be the focus of the game next time and not an afterthought.
4762123	4762663	That's my thoughts.
4763824	4765805	Literally redesign the fundamentals of the game.
4767826	4774770	I mean, the game can still be single player and have those modes and it can have some cooperative features in it, but make it more of a tournament game.
4774930	4778312	Relaunch the game as Dance Dance Tournament or something, I don't know.
4779153	4781634	Alright, Ranma, we gotta let you go try and get some more calls, okay?
4782875	4783315	One more thing.
4783435	4786017	Nintendo World is now taking Classic only for Wii consoles.
4786644	4787004	What's that?
4788166	4791289	Nintendo World is only accepting plastic for Wii console sales.
4791369	4791969	Why is that?
4793130	4793611	I don't know.
4793651	4795653	That's the sign in the window when you walk in.
4795913	4796253	Wow.
4796574	4797134	No checks?
4797274	4797795	No cash?
4798936	4799136	Nope.
4799356	4801038	Same as Apple is doing with the iPhones.
4801298	4801919	Plastic only.
4802339	4802700	Interesting.
4802860	4803080	All right.
4803100	4803861	Well, thanks for the heads up.
4804762	4805462	Our man in New York City.
4805482	4806163	Catch you guys next week.
4806570	4808651	Our man in New York City, DJ Ranma S, right there.
4809191	4810411	So is Zaku in New York City.
4810451	4812652	And SSJ100, this is a New York show tonight.
4812712	4814072	Our contestant was New York City, too.
4814092	4817893	Well, Plastic, come to think of that, that actually leaves a data trail.
4818833	4819213	That's true.
4819233	4821134	The cash money is almost untraceable.
4821454	4822574	Let's do one more call tonight.
4822634	4823534	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4823554	4823894	Who's this?
4824895	4826475	Hi, this is One Night Stands.
4826795	4828296	Hello, One Night Stands.
4828316	4829076	What's on your mind?
4829096	4830896	Oh, not much.
4830936	4833577	You know, after playing that game, I kind of just wanted to call in.
4834698	4837140	Are you apologizing for your horrendous performance in the game?
4837180	4837921	No, I'm totally kidding.
4837961	4839002	I think you did good.
4839122	4840042	I'm totally kidding.
4840082	4840523	You know what?
4840623	4846827	Games are so much easier when you're just watching and playing them, or playing along, but when you're actually a contestant, it's so much weirder.
4847088	4848949	The radio is high-stress stuff.
4849209	4849670	It is.
4851191	4851811	Just ask Mo.
4852372	4853372	What did she say before the show?
4853392	4854813	She was going to throw up chunks of her pancreas.
4854833	4856835	I was going to throw up shards of my pelvis.
4858156	4858456	Hello?
4858696	4859297	Yeah, so I'm sorry.
4859317	4859557	We're here.
4859997	4860958	Why do you think I picked his name?
4861018	4861999	It was One Night Stands.
4862481	4862961	Oh, okay.
4863641	4863942	Hello?
4864322	4864682	Hello?
4865762	4866702	What else did you want to say?
4866902	4869103	Hi, what else did you want to say, One Night Stands?
4870364	4871764	Oh, you know what?
4871844	4878546	Well, a couple weeks ago, I actually wrote in an email for the first time, and it was actually right on the air, I guess.
4879407	4882728	And I was just, you know, just felt like saying hi.
4883088	4888390	Also, I just wanted to know about the whole ASEN thing, if you really were coming out here.
4888410	4889430	Yeah.
4891161	4892661	Oh, I can't even think of anything right now.
4892862	4893622	I'm sorry, what was that?
4894302	4895662	You were asking about what coming out here?
4897703	4897983	Huh?
4899103	4899984	What was that you just said?
4900204	4901104	You dropped out for a minute.
4901364	4901764	Hello?
4902224	4902605	Hello?
4905245	4905846	What the hell?
4905866	4906206	Oh, man.
4906246	4906586	Hello?
4907046	4907426	Hello?
4910247	4910607	Hello?
4911747	4912208	Goodbye.
4914488	4915969	Thanks for calling One Night Stands.
4916029	4916749	Nothing personal.
4917731	4918791	Skype hates us tonight.
4918811	4919432	What is up with that?
4919472	4920572	I'm punishing the Skype line.
4920592	4921212	We're closing that.
4921232	4924533	In the future, we might just have to shut off Justin TV or something when we do Skype line.
4925634	4926874	Sorry, One Night Stands.
4926934	4927714	It's nothing personal.
4927734	4928275	It's not you.
4928335	4929175	It's just the connection.
4929215	4930515	I don't know what the hell's going on.
4933636	4935317	That's going to do it for our Skype line tonight.
4935737	4937598	But we encourage you to send more emails to us.
4937658	4941399	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or leave us voicemails.
4941419	4947041	You can always call the Skype line when we're not live at 1-877-GAME-OLR and leave us lovely voicemails.
4948106	4949006	That's always a good time.
4950147	4951467	Any more last-minute stories, Loki?
4953588	4956369	Yeah, actually, a couple things real quick.
4956469	4963111	Monster Hunter, apparently Capcom is releasing this grip for the PSP.
4963171	4970094	It looks stupid, but it's the Monster Hunter grip accessory, and it's lame-looking.
4970674	4971615	That looks absolutely retarded.
4971915	4972835	Yeah, it is retarded.
4973735	4976717	DarkSakura, do you have anything last for us?
4976738	4978839	I like fire.
5002042	5002142	Fire!
5020596	5022057	You can Photoshop... I'm sorry.
5022458	5026601	One is a caption and me dancing with Pikachu is the one to caption.
5027141	5032586	And Photoshop is me and DarkSakura attacking Loki is the Photoshop challenge.
5032646	5034087	So good luck with that.
5034127	5036049	And then there's some animated picture of me swimming.
5036129	5037089	I don't know what the hell that is.
5037610	5038470	That's beautiful.
5038531	5039291	That's what it is.
5039832	5040993	That's all in our forums.
5042017	5044158	over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5044198	5045778	It's the Caption Photoshop Contest.
5045818	5046498	You can't miss it.
5047279	5050179	If we can't give away that res code any other way, we might have to do it there.
5050559	5058462	I hope, though, our listeners want to win some free shit because all I'm going to say is that coming soon, we're going to be giving away a lot of stuff.
5059062	5060002	A lot of stuff.
5060802	5062003	More details in the coming weeks.
5062703	5062963	All right.
5063873	5066735	Let's go around at this point and get everybody's final thought.
5068116	5073139	Jake, I know you didn't say much tonight, but you were entertaining the Justin TV crowd with much playing of Smash Bros.
5073159	5073419	Brawl.
5073720	5076141	First off, what do you think of Smash Bros.
5076181	5076421	Brawl?
5078022	5079423	Two words, fucking awesome.
5079844	5080184	Excellent.
5081144	5082625	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5083926	5085227	I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
5085587	5086268	All right, fair enough.
5086988	5088689	Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5089290	5091071	Need to find cage match song.
5091091	5091271	No.
5092439	5094280	Mo, thanks so much for being here tonight.
5094440	5095841	I'm glad I'm not dead in a ditch.
5095881	5096521	Nerve-wracking?
5096581	5098422	Well, there is always the part after the show.
5098743	5099183	I'm just kidding.
5100083	5103505	But we hope you enjoyed the cake, and thanks so much for taking a chance and coming on our program.
5103525	5104146	We hope you had fun.
5104226	5105206	Thank you for inviting me.
5105306	5105786	No problem.
5105806	5106627	Come back sometime.
5107908	5109548	You don't even have to bring a new song.
5109568	5110969	Thank God for that.
5112370	5114111	Just come over just because you want to.
5114831	5115852	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
5116532	5120354	My Texan wife just made me lose the game, so anyone out there playing the game, you just lost.
5120534	5121595	And hi to my Texan wife.
5122242	5122563	All right.
5122964	5124188	Aw, a special shout-out there.
5124268	5124529	All right.
5126154	5127517	DarkSakura, any final thoughts?
5130025	5130326	Cake.
5130990	5131571	www.DarkSakura.com
5154246	5156107	to get our name out there.
5156147	5156987	We appreciate it.
5158248	5159488	That's going to do it for another week.
5159608	5162669	Next week on the program, it looks like we'll be giving away Res HD.
5162849	5164430	We still have Actdeft's code to give away.
5164950	5168132	And who knows what other insanity awaits us next week.
5169072	5170512	You'll just have to tune in to find out.
5170553	5176495	So until then, I'm Rob, she's Jamie, he's Loki, and we're out till next week.
