0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	25000	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 3rd of 2008.
25000	31000	The Super Bowl and the Puppy Bowl have just finished up and so we're getting more and more live listeners coming on.
31000	35000	Which is a good thing because tonight we're going to play a little round of the Match Game.
35000	40000	That's right, it's your chance to match the stars here in the OLR studio for fabulous prizes.
40000	45000	And when I say fabulous prizes I mean a copy of Res HD is what we're giving away tonight.
45000	53000	That's right, one of our listeners, ActDeft, one of our friends from Mexico, actually listens to the program and he won a code.
53000	56000	But the problem was he already bought the game so he has no use for the code.
56000	58000	So we're going to pay it forward tonight.
58000	62000	One of our OLR listeners is going to pass on the code to our winner tonight of the Match Game.
62000	65000	So thank you ActDeft, everybody say it with me.
65000	67000	Thank you ActDeft.
67000	70000	Alright, so we're going to be giving that away a little later in the show.
70000	75000	But before we do that, we have got to get back into some gaming news and Loki's going to kick it off tonight.
75000	84000	Alright, anyways, there's two big games that they announced on Nintendo's reports for 2008.
84000	92000	Not a huge surprise though, that Animal Crossing and the new Kirby gamer will be coming to the Wii in 2008.
92000	95000	Most likely though, it's only the Japanese Wii in 2008.
95000	99000	Maybe shortly after in 2009 we'll see Animal Crossing here.
99000	102000	Hopefully though, I would hope it's this year as well.
102000	108000	But no word on exactly what the new Animal Crossing game is going to be like.
108000	110000	But at least there's a listing for it.
110000	112000	Some other games that were also listed on there.
112000	121000	Wii Music, Disaster Day of Crisis, Super Mario Stadium, Baseball, and everyone's common knowledge television.
121000	124000	Which I'm assuming is not coming over here.
124000	132000	And it also shows Mario Kart Wii still expected for Spring in North America and Quarter 2 for Europe.
132000	137000	So do we know anything more about that Animal Crossing on the Wii?
137000	139000	Is it actually going to be an MMO or anything?
139000	140000	No idea.
140000	144000	So all we just kind of know is it's coming soon.
144000	147000	Yes, and I would imagine keep your expectations low.
147000	153000	Because if you're expecting an MMO from Nintendo, I mean come on, they'll embrace online really.
153000	154000	Good point, good point.
154000	158000	But you know, I do love my Animal Crossing, so I'm hopeful.
158000	160000	Let's just leave it that way, I'm hopeful.
160000	163000	Alright, well if Animal Crossing and Kirby don't do it for...
163000	167000	Actually, let me backtrack a little bit because I know Dark Soccer, you're a big Animal Crossing fan.
167000	174000	If Nintendo happens to be listening right now, what do you hope that they implement in the next Animal Crossing game on the Wii?
174000	179000	I would actually like to see...
179000	186000	And maybe this is a little bit odd, but I'd like to see a character be able to be the mayor, I think, of the town.
186000	191000	Instead of having, you know, everything be the Tom Nook conglomerate,
191000	195000	I would like to see you be able to control development of the town.
195000	200000	You know, new shops, new things, you know, sort of expand the whole thing that makes a town work.
200000	202000	So like a promotion.
202000	207000	A way to promote, get a job and promote up so you're just not Tom Nook's bitch the whole time.
207000	208000	Kind of?
208000	212000	Well, I guess so, you know...
212000	218000	I want the ability to put Tom Nook out of work and put him on the street.
218000	220000	Make him do bitch work for me.
220000	221000	Make him sleep with the fishes.
221000	222000	Yes.
222000	223000	Are you a big fan of Animal Crossing, Mo?
223000	228000	I actually have issues with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon. They're too boring.
228000	230000	How about Kirby? Are you a fan of Kirby?
230000	231000	I do like Kirby.
231000	233000	What do you hope they put in the next Kirby game?
233000	237000	Well, if it's going on the Wii, they should do something like Canvas Curse.
237000	239000	Because Canvas Curse was so awesome.
239000	240000	Canvas Curse was pretty fun.
240000	242000	That would be a good thing to have on the Wii.
242000	245000	You know, it's funny because the Wii is like a bunch of DS games, kind of.
245000	248000	You have, what, Trauma Center, Cookin' Mama.
248000	250000	Some of those games should have stayed on the DS, like Cookin' Mama.
250000	251000	Cookin' Mama was pretty bad on the Wii.
251000	253000	It was pretty bad on the Wii.
253000	258000	All right, anyhow, if none of those games are for you, perhaps this will be a game that you will like.
258000	262000	Because it's coming from the creators of Parappa the Rappa.
262000	265000	And yeah, it's another music-based game on the Wii.
265000	267000	It's not Wii music, it's something else.
267000	270000	It's called Major Minor's Majestic March.
270000	272000	That's right, it's Major Minor Majestic March.
272000	277000	It's coming from designer Masuyama Tsura and artist Rodney Greenblatt.
277000	281000	And what you're going to be doing in the game, you use the Wii Remote to keep tempo.
281000	283000	It's a marching band game.
283000	285000	So what you do, you get new band members.
285000	286000	That's high school.
286000	287000	You get valuable items.
287000	289000	You go to eight different locations.
289000	297000	You get up to 15 instruments, and it will have 25 popular marching band songs in it.
297000	299000	So that's going to be pretty awesome.
299000	303000	I know I was a band geek in high school, so this kind of tickles the nerve for me.
303000	305000	What about you, Dark Soccer? Are you excited about this?
305000	308000	I was never the band major, the drum major.
308000	310000	I see, but it would still be fun.
310000	312000	It's from the guys who did Parappa.
312000	314000	I would say that since it's the...
314000	317000	I honestly don't think that they could do anything wrong.
317000	323000	Well, I don't know. We did get the baby level of Unjamma Lamy.
323000	325000	I love the baby level in Unjamma Lamy.
325000	327000	I miss the hell level.
327000	328000	You didn't get hell.
328000	330000	Son of Dad in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrady.com, says,
330000	333000	I wanted Unjamma Lamy 2 on the Wii.
333000	334000	Amen to that.
334000	335000	Amen to that. I agree.
335000	337000	Dude, imagine Unjamma Lamy using the...
337000	340000	Well, you remember the arcade version?
340000	345000	Very, very... I know I played it once, and the machine was made for little girls,
345000	348000	so I had to get on my knees to play the game.
348000	351000	Get your minds out of the gutter, kids.
351000	356000	But they should have something that works with the Guitar Hero set up
356000	358000	and do an Unjamma Lamy.
358000	359000	Maybe.
359000	361000	How about... Were you a band nerd, Mo?
361000	363000	I wasn't a band nerd. I was a theater geek.
363000	365000	You were a theater geek? Oh, okay.
365000	367000	I was the AV nerd and the theater geek.
367000	369000	Do you think this game might still appeal to you?
369000	370000	It'd be fun.
370000	371000	It'd be fun.
371000	373000	I could wave my hands around like a tard again.
373000	376000	Most Wii games, it'll be fun for an hour and then sell it back.
376000	377000	Probably.
377000	378000	Probably.
379000	382000	How about you, Loki? Are you excited about Major Minors?
382000	383000	No.
384000	386000	I have no interest in this game.
386000	388000	Then let's go to the next story.
389000	393000	Well, for our soccer fans...
393000	397000	Actually, well, I'm sure there's plenty of soccer fans in the UK.
397000	400000	As in real football.
400000	402000	I have my own bias.
402000	406000	Electronic Arts, though, is saying that they are not releasing
406000	410000	UEFA Euro 2008 on Wii NDS in Europe.
410000	411000	At all.
412000	416000	So, I mean, they pretty much have the market, I think,
416000	418000	because they had FIFA 08 last year,
418000	420000	but they're not bringing out the other one.
424000	426000	I'm like, okay, why?
427000	430000	If they've already brought out one game, why do you need the other?
430000	432000	There's a big difference between them, so...
432000	435000	But I guess it'd be people who'd be disappointed that it's not coming out over there.
435000	436000	Really sad.
436000	440000	Especially since it's, you know, Euro 2008.
440000	443000	I know, I was gonna say, I find it ironic that a game called Euro 2008
443000	446000	is not coming out in Europe.
446000	448000	I mean, am I the only one that sees the humor in that?
448000	450000	Well, they're just not bringing down the Wii NDS.
450000	452000	It's not...
452000	456000	Of the two soccer games that EA puts out, it's the lesser of the two.
456000	459000	I know it doesn't sell very well over here, that's for sure.
459000	461000	Well, fine, Debbie Downer.
462000	466000	Well, I'm sorry, no one likes obscure soccer games, apparently.
466000	470000	They'll just play FIFA if they, you know, want to play FIFA, and then...
470000	472000	I don't know, it's just like...
472000	477000	EA tries to put all these weird ones out there, like arena football, or rugby, and stuff like that.
477000	479000	Hey, don't knock the rugby game.
479000	482000	Hey, I'm sure in their respective areas, they're good, but...
482000	484000	No one buys them.
484000	487000	Or at least not that many people buy them.
487000	489000	All right.
489000	492000	Well, maybe one of these new games will prove you wrong, but we'll see.
492000	494000	Maybe. Maybe this game will prove us wrong.
494000	495000	Eternity's Child.
495000	500000	It's a game that was originally designed to come out on the Xbox 360,
500000	502000	as part of the XNA program,
502000	508000	but now they've been ported over to the WiiWare service that's still not out yet.
508000	511000	But it is scheduled sometime Q2 2008.
511000	514000	It will set you back 500 Wii points,
514000	518000	so it's nice to see that there will be some more inexpensive games on the WiiWare service.
518000	520000	Actually, it looks pretty cool.
520000	523000	It's all hand-drawn by cartoonist Luke Bernard,
523000	526000	and a pretty cool-looking platform game.
528000	533000	Hopefully, we'll hear more about the WiiWare service in a couple weeks during Game Developers Conference.
533000	536000	I'm guessing that's when they're going to drop the bomb on that.
536000	538000	I was going to say, WiiWare should have been out pretty...
538000	540000	We thought it was going to come out late last year.
540000	541000	Didn't happen.
541000	545000	So, it should be coming out sooner rather than later, right?
545000	546000	I would think so.
546000	547000	I hope so.
547000	552000	Well, perhaps they're just too busy putting out all these other games
552000	556000	that they apparently keep missing production for and all this stuff,
556000	558000	but the demand's just out there,
558000	560000	and if you don't believe me, listen to this.
560000	568000	Japan apparently sold a half-million copies of Smash Bros. Brawl in one day.
568000	573000	Those numbers coming from a Japanese blog, amiibo.jp,
573000	578000	apparently has reported that Brawl is the fastest-selling Wii title.
578000	584000	It sold through 80% of its initial stock, and that was 500,000 copies.
584000	588000	And now everybody's wondering, is it going to match that in the U.S.?
588000	589000	I think so.
589000	594000	Mo, I know you work in game shops, so you take pre-orders for this stuff.
594000	596000	Does it look like it's going to smash records left and right?
596000	597000	Jesus Christ, yes.
597000	600000	Honesty, I like it.
600000	603000	Japan has a smaller market than the U.S. does anyways,
603000	605000	and that's not even counting Europe, too.
605000	609000	They'll easily sell 500,000 copies in one day.
609000	614000	I wouldn't be surprised if it sells a million copies in the first day.
614000	617000	Well, how many people in America actually own Wiis, though?
617000	621000	It could be done.
621000	623000	That would be about one in eight.
623000	627000	It's still more and more selling as this date approaches in March, too.
627000	629000	Do you think you could top Halo?
629000	631000	No.
631000	635000	Day one, probably not, but overall I think so.
635000	636000	Overall, maybe, yeah.
636000	639000	I think it might top Halo 3, but not Halo 2.
639000	641000	I don't know. Halo 3 was pretty huge.
641000	642000	We'll see.
642000	644000	Well, I mean, in the long run.
644000	645000	In the long run.
645000	646000	It doesn't matter.
646000	649000	Every game's going to be Grand Theft Auto Force, bitch, anyway.
649000	652000	Doesn't matter.
652000	653000	Whatever.
653000	655000	They can have their Smash Bros. Brawl.
655000	658000	It's all about Grand Theft Auto IV around the PlayStation 3 and 3.
658000	659000	Good point.
659000	665000	What do you think, Dark Saga, is every game going to be Grand Theft Auto's bitch?
665000	671000	Honestly, yeah, because you know the whole drama that came up over the whole hot coffee thing,
671000	676000	I think that was, you know, they said there's no such thing as bad press.
676000	684000	Well, how many copies of, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sold just because of the drama over that, do you think?
684000	685000	A lot.
685000	689000	You know, how many people now do you think are going to be, oh, what's this one going to do?
689000	690000	What's going to be the new thing?
690000	696000	Well, I think that honestly it is going to sort of overplay.
696000	697000	I don't know.
697000	699000	I hope not, but I'm pretty sure it will.
699000	702000	Well, look how amazing Grand Theft Auto 3 was when it came out.
702000	704000	It was just absolutely awesome.
704000	709000	I took a day off of work to play that game, by the way, as I will with 4.
709000	719000	But it was just completely blew everyone away just because it was so, I don't know, unlike anything that they've seen before.
719000	722000	Of course, you know, moving from 2 to 3, that was a huge step.
722000	726000	It's like, you know, Final Fantasy VI to VII, so I don't know.
726000	727000	They'll be big.
727000	732000	I took off a week of school to play Final Fantasy VI.
732000	734000	Final Fantasy VI is pretty epic.
734000	737000	You would need like a whole week off of work, though, when that game first came out.
737000	740000	I pretended I had the flu.
740000	744000	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news and things we might call in sick for in the future.
744000	747000	I don't know that I'd be calling in sick for this if I can.
747000	748000	There we go.
748000	751000	Stupid Firefox.
751000	758000	Nintendo has registered a patent for a casing for Wii Remote.
758000	764000	And it is quoted as saying, a video game controller for video game and receptor assembly.
764000	772000	A receptor having a shape substantially similar to a component appearing in the video game.
772000	776000	The receptor may be a gun-shaped subunit, is what it also says.
776000	779000	But there's a drawing that was included with it.
779000	787000	And they're actually, in fact, I'm pulling up the drawing right now.
787000	789000	God, I hate this thing.
789000	796000	Well, some of the drawings that they had were like the original Zapper prototype that we had seen, you know, E3.
796000	799000	And then a lot of them were just ridiculous.
799000	803000	Well, they were included in that, a tennis racket, a baseball bat, and a fishing rod.
803000	812000	But there's also a bicycle, a helmet, and a chair, and a teddy bear, and a headset.
812000	814000	A teddy bear?
814000	818000	Well, I'm pulling up the drawings now just to see everything else that was on there.
818000	821000	Unfortunately, Acrobat is slow.
821000	825000	There we go.
825000	830000	Yeah, DarkTits2U in our chatroom at chat.org.com exclaims what some of us are saying.
830000	833000	Are they really considering doing some of those?
833000	834000	I mean, a teddy bear?
834000	836000	Some of those are just, what the fuck?
836000	843000	I think it's kind of stupid for them to even try to patent, you know, putting, you know, like a tennis racket or fishing rod controller.
843000	845000	They've already got them out there for the Wii.
845000	851000	They're a little late to the game, just like they were with the whole Zapper attachment and stuff for the, you know, the Wii,
851000	859000	and also the Wii Wheel that's going to be coming out with Mario Kart, which is completely retarded, but whatever.
859000	862000	I guess people want that crap.
862000	865000	It doesn't make a game any better.
865000	871000	They have to go really into detail as far as these patents go, I guess.
871000	875000	Immediately throw away that wheel when it comes with Mario Kart.
875000	877000	Out the window it will go.
877000	884000	Okay, there's the one on here for the wheel, and the one that looks like the Zapper, which is sort of cool, but the helmet one?
884000	888000	I'm sorry, we've had virtual reality helmets for Nintendo before.
888000	890000	They're trying to give us all migraines again.
890000	893000	You know, I still haven't forgiven them for the Virtual Boy.
893000	900000	The chair is kind of cool, but they have one also that looks like it's trying to remake the Power Glove.
900000	901000	Cool!
901000	902000	Oh dear God.
902000	904000	It's so bad.
904000	910000	There is, the racket one makes sense to me.
910000	912000	There's a skateboard one on here too.
912000	916000	But the bike is like, what are they going to do, bring us Prop Cycle?
916000	923000	Interesting thought from Alpha Canogram in chat says it's to prevent others from creating crap to ruin the Wii, but it didn't work.
923000	925000	But they've already, that's the thing though.
925000	929000	If this was to prevent other people from making this crap, they're a little late.
929000	932000	They already have this stuff out there.
932000	935000	You can't patent something after it's already been out.
935000	939000	I guess maybe you can, but you know, it doesn't make any sense.
939000	941000	Alright, well let's move on.
941000	946000	I know really they should be threatened by putting a Wiimote in a teddy bear.
946000	947000	Hey, I would do it.
947000	949000	It's dumb.
949000	952000	What, is it for like some teddy bear hugging game?
952000	955000	It's so I can hug them and squeeze them and love them?
955000	959000	It's the baby shaking game, you see, but they can't use a baby, so they have like a teddy bear.
959000	960000	I see.
960000	962000	You can shake the teddy bear all you want to.
962000	964000	Kill teddy rock spin the game.
964000	970000	You know, they are, and I have to, this is coming out sometime soon, within the next few months.
970000	974000	They are bringing the Build-a-Bear workshop to the Wii instead of just the DS.
974000	977000	So you can create virtual bears.
977000	979000	You can do it on the DS already.
979000	981000	Why didn't I pay 80 bucks a piece?
981000	985000	But do you still have to do the little dance with your hands in the air and the spinning and the...
985000	986000	I didn't do that.
986000	989000	At least I can do it in the privacy of my own home.
989000	991000	So here's another bright idea.
991000	995000	Apparently someone thought it was an awesome idea to bring out Saw the game.
995000	999000	At least they're going to be bringing it out to consoles in 2009.
999000	1005000	Let's hope the series is still around in 2009 because the way it's going, I don't know.
1005000	1007000	They'll be up to like Saw 12 by that point.
1007000	1013000	If they still do, I don't know if the Rider Strike impacted them, but if they maintain one a year, they should be up to Saw 6.
1013000	1015000	Because there should be Saw 5 this year.
1015000	1017000	Oh my gosh.
1017000	1018000	That's true.
1018000	1020000	People write Saw.
1020000	1023000	I thought it was just monkeys at a typewriter.
1023000	1025000	Monkeys at a typewriter.
1025000	1030000	Someone just dropped a lot of acid and then wrote it all down and filled it up.
1030000	1034000	This game is going to have some really unique features about it.
1034000	1039000	First off, it's going to be using the Unreal 3 engine because no other game on the face of the earth ever uses the Unreal 3 engine.
1039000	1043000	Okay, I've got to ask right off the bat, is this like a rumor?
1043000	1044000	No.
1044000	1047000	That seems like fan service or something to me.
1047000	1049000	No, this is...
1049000	1056000	Brash Entertainment has made an announcement that they're going to make an interactive Saw game.
1056000	1060000	Is it going to be like Manhunt and get banned everywhere?
1060000	1062000	And even worse than Manhunt somehow?
1062000	1064000	Where's he on the Wii? That's what I want to know.
1064000	1066000	No, it's just going to be PlayStation 3 and 360.
1066000	1067000	And here's the other thing though.
1067000	1071000	I'm thinking they're going to try to build off the controversy of Manhunt 2.
1071000	1076000	Of course, 2009 people will forget about Manhunt 2, I think.
1076000	1078000	Alright, this game is so wrong on so many levels.
1078000	1081000	I did a story on Manhunt 2 last week and I've already forgotten about it.
1081000	1085000	Because A, obviously people are totally...
1085000	1090000	They look at video games and movies in complete different ways when obviously they shouldn't.
1090000	1094000	I mean, the Saw franchise is just as gory as Manhunt 2 and all that.
1094000	1102000	And this is just going to continue to give video games a bad name and fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courts.
1102000	1104000	That's what we call...
1104000	1105000	Rhymes with...
1105000	1106000	...Ompson.
1107000	1109000	That's what we call him as Lord Voldemort.
1109000	1110000	He who shall not be named.
1110000	1114000	This will just fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courtroom.
1114000	1118000	This will just be more things for the politicians to get rah rah rah rambly about.
1118000	1124000	So we are giving a preemptive F.U. to the creators of this game because this is just a bad idea.
1124000	1127000	To make a bad video game out of a bad franchise.
1127000	1130000	And that means we have to bring in the F.U.'s of the week.
1142000	1147000	The first of my F.U.'s of the week, because I have had a pretty crazy week.
1147000	1149000	Goes towards needles.
1149000	1155000	And I'm not really afraid of needles because I don't know.
1155000	1157000	I'm just really not afraid of needles anymore.
1157000	1159000	But this is a really big freaking needle.
1159000	1161000	I got a cortisone shot in my hand.
1161000	1167000	And it actually wasn't that bad because my regular doctor is really cool and lets me watch.
1167000	1169000	The other doctor wouldn't let me watch.
1169000	1170000	He was mean.
1171000	1174000	But then my hand hurt for a couple of days and I couldn't play anything.
1174000	1177000	And then I have to go to an orthopedist next week.
1177000	1182000	And I'm a little bit antsy about surgery because I've only ever had surgery once in my life.
1182000	1184000	And that was wisdom teeth.
1184000	1186000	And you know how long I was messed up after that?
1186000	1187000	Four months.
1190000	1194000	So, F.U. to my stupid tendons.
1194000	1196000	Alright, Loki, do you have any F.U.'s of the week you'd like to give out?
1196000	1201000	Yeah, my F.U. of the week is Microsoft making the shoddy system of the Xbox 360.
1201000	1204000	I'm tired of having to fix this stupid three ring system.
1204000	1209000	It's really pissing me off because what I have to do to fix it, in other words take a heat gun to it,
1209000	1214000	involves me pulling off the heat sink and then I heat it up and do all that stuff.
1214000	1217000	I have to put foil around it so it looks like I'm actually cooking the thing.
1217000	1223000	And then after that works I have to put everything back together, reapply the thermal grease and that kind of stuff.
1223000	1225000	Only to have it not work after that.
1225000	1227000	Then I have to take it all apart again and do it.
1227000	1229000	I've been doing this at work, by the way.
1229000	1233000	So, have all the parts strewn all across the conference room table.
1233000	1239000	But this last time this better fucking work because I am getting really fed up with it.
1239000	1242000	The other system I fixed works perfectly.
1242000	1245000	This one is being a little bitch and won't fucking work.
1245000	1250000	So, fuck Microsoft because there's no reason that I should have two systems die anyway.
1251000	1256000	My F.U. of the week goes to Insomnia because I've had it most of the week and I think it was causing me to get sick.
1256000	1263000	But I'd like to counteractively give a thank you of the week to Airborne because vitamin C is awesome and made me not get totally sick.
1263000	1265000	So, that was great.
1265000	1267000	But F.U. to lack of sleep and getting sick.
1267000	1269000	Mo, I don't know if you're familiar with this segment.
1269000	1272000	Do you have anything you'd like to just say F.U. to on the air?
1272000	1274000	The fact that I still suck at Halo 3.
1274000	1279000	Amen to that. I will never get first person shooters. I just never will.
1279000	1283000	Console, I can't do it. Give me a keyboard and a mouse, god damn it.
1283000	1288000	Maybe just some people weren't built to play console shooters. I don't know what it is.
1288000	1292000	I can get the running down and I can get the shooting down, but if you want me to point, I'm screwed.
1292000	1295000	Just use the caboose method. Let everyone else kill each other off.
1295000	1299000	No, they all know that I'm the weaker player, so everyone picks me off in multiplayer.
1299000	1300000	Ah.
1300000	1301000	Don't.
1301000	1306000	Jake, I know you're busy with Smash Brothers Brawl, but do you have anything you'd like to give an F.U. to? Anything that's making you angry?
1306000	1308000	Amazingly, no.
1308000	1311000	Well, aren't you F.U. to you for being so perky?
1311000	1318000	That's a cool thing about this game is you can actually pause it and then rotate around and take snapshots.
1318000	1322000	By the way, for those who weren't listening to the bonus segment, we are playing Smash Brothers Brawl here in studio.
1322000	1328000	Jake's walking us through the game here and you can watch the action on our Justin.TV feed, which should be archived.
1328000	1334000	I'm sure somebody will make a highlight out of it. It's Justin.TV slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to check it out.
1334000	1338000	But not for much longer. We're going to be pointing the camera back on the studio very soon.
1338000	1342000	Black Lab in chat says we need more studio view on cam and less Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
1342000	1345000	All right, soon. Soon, I promise. Maybe after a couple more matches.
1345000	1347000	All right, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week.
1347000	1350000	Let's get back into the gaming news.
1350000	1356000	And this almost makes me want to bring on the F.U.s of the week again, because I'm so ready for this game.
1356000	1358000	You know Spore?
1358000	1371000	Well apparently now, during an EA conference call, the CEO of EA, John Riccitello, told the audience that Spore will not be making fiscal 08.
1371000	1378000	But will it be making calendar year 08 at all? Or will it be actually pushed back to 2009?
1378000	1382000	And still within the 2009 fiscal year, but literally like a year from now.
1382000	1390000	While the CEO was not going to give a specific date, it does seem confident that the game will be out before the holidays.
1390000	1392000	But that could be like December 24th.
1392000	1397000	In fact, actually it could be after Christmas because it could be like Kwanzaa he's talking about as the holidays.
1397000	1399000	You just don't know.
1399000	1402000	It could be Chinese New Year. That's right. It could be January. Who knows?
1402000	1404000	It could be July 4th. That's still a holiday.
1404000	1406000	That's right. Of 2009.
1406000	1412000	Who knows? But I don't like hearing that Spore keeps getting delayed because I'm so ready for this game to come out.
1412000	1416000	I think he celebrates sleep year as a holiday, so he's referring to next sleep year.
1416000	1418000	I agree.
1418000	1422000	Alright, well let's get back to some other gaming news.
1422000	1425000	Why do you have some happy in regards to nights?
1425000	1427000	Thank God, we need it.
1427000	1429000	I love you Sega.
1429000	1441000	They're having different, I would have to say, celebrations that go on every month as far as different content in the game.
1441000	1445000	In fact, they say that you use the Wii Weather Channel to change the weather.
1445000	1449000	This is another bit of additional hidden content.
1449000	1459000	So you basically raise your own A life and the hidden content will let you have different monthly celebrations since it's going by the Wii's time clock.
1459000	1466000	So in January, they have of course the New Year with fireworks.
1466000	1470000	In February, they have the Chinese New Year.
1470000	1474000	So they have a big dragon hanging out and firecrackers and stuff.
1474000	1480000	In March, it's carnivals and the people in the game will have masks on.
1480000	1484000	In April is flamenco inspired roses.
1484000	1490000	May is the boys festival, which is a Japanese holiday.
1490000	1492000	So that's May 5th.
1492000	1496000	And there's a big carp streamer hanging in it.
1496000	1498000	June is weddings.
1498000	1503000	July is the bull running festival.
1503000	1509000	In August, all the residents in the game are going to be playing instruments.
1509000	1513000	September has full moon paper fans.
1513000	1519000	October is the Halloween theme with witches and pumpkin lanterns and stuff like that.
1519000	1526000	November is autumn leaves falling and fruit.
1526000	1534000	And December is Santa and the Christmas tree and all kinds of Christmasy stuff.
1534000	1535000	Christmas nights.
1535000	1536000	Christmas nights, yeah I know.
1536000	1538000	I love Christmas nights.
1538000	1540000	I wonder if this is going to actually break my household tradition.
1540000	1543000	Because you've never said that on the show before that you love Christmas nights.
1543000	1547000	I think every week Jamie finds a reason to bring up Christmas nights.
1547000	1548000	Hey, happy 4th of July everybody.
1548000	1550000	I'm going to play Christmas nights this December.
1550000	1556000	Ever since I moved to California, every Christmas we break out the Saturn and we play Christmas nights.
1556000	1562000	She's having to tell the story to Moe because she's like, oh, Moe maybe hasn't heard this before.
1562000	1564000	You just like telling the story. It's okay.
1564000	1565000	It's fun.
1565000	1566000	It is fun.
1566000	1568000	I like Christmas nights.
1568000	1569000	Traditions are good.
1569000	1570000	Traditions are good.
1570000	1573000	I did have to borrow my French Japanese copy of Christmas nights.
1573000	1574000	It's exactly the same.
1574000	1576000	It just gets a nice hard case and not a paper case.
1576000	1578000	Oh no.
1578000	1580000	I was curious.
1580000	1586000	This sounds like a fun way to at least pop in the game once a month and kind of check it out.
1586000	1587000	See what's going on.
1587000	1588000	Right?
1588000	1593000	I still think it's a cool thing but what if they have different things to happen over different years.
1593000	1595000	You know something that could be updated in the game.
1595000	1596000	You never know.
1596000	1601000	You know remember like Animal Crossing had all the funny stuff that happened on holidays and it gave you a reason to turn on the game.
1601000	1603000	Like even New Year's Eve.
1603000	1604000	I haven't played in six months.
1604000	1605000	Say it's New Year's.
1605000	1613000	Or if you don't want to wait a year long just mess with your time clock and then you can see all these within like an hour.
1613000	1614000	That's the spirit.
1614000	1616000	Whatever cheater.
1616000	1617000	I'm not cheating.
1617000	1619000	I'm exploiting time.
1619000	1620000	It's exploitation.
1620000	1623000	Never give this man a TARDIS.
1623000	1625000	That would be awesome.
1625000	1626000	All right.
1626000	1629000	Why don't you exploit some more news for us, Loki.
1629000	1638000	Well the latest copy of the official Xbox Magazine has the content for Rock Band outlined for March.
1638000	1648000	Which reminds me that I haven't bought the February issue of the official Xbox Magazine which had those three free tracks from on there with Freeze Pop and stuff.
1648000	1650000	Puppy has the CD.
1650000	1651000	One of our frequent guests, Puppy.
1651000	1653000	And maybe I'll make him come to the show next week.
1653000	1654000	So bring your Xbox.
1654000	1656000	Puppy come to the show next week.
1656000	1657000	K thanks.
1657000	1658000	All right.
1658000	1660000	Let's go to the Xbox Magazine.
1660000	1662000	Well some of the packs that they have outlined.
1662000	1675000	March 4th we're getting the Thrash pack which is going to have At The Gates, Blinded By Fear, Evil, Thrashes, The Haunted, Shadow World.
1675000	1677000	I'm not familiar with any of those.
1677000	1680000	But here At The Gates, Blinded By Fear is supposed to be pretty good.
1680000	1688000	On March 11th they've got some individual songs including Bad Company with Shooting Star which is a cover.
1688000	1693000	Leonard Skynyrd with Simple Man and The Police with Message In A Bottle.
1693000	1702000	March 18th they have the Nine Inch Nails pack including March of the Pigs, The Collector and The Perfect Drug.
1702000	1710000	And then finally March 25th has the Metal pack with Iron Maiden's Wraith Child which is a cover.
1710000	1712000	Black Sabbath's Supernaut which is a cover.
1712000	1716000	And the one I'm really looking forward to, Metallica with Fuel.
1716000	1720000	Because that song I said should have been in Rock Band in the first place.
1720000	1722000	So that's awesome.
1722000	1729000	I'm assuming all of them are going to be 440 for the pack and 160 for each song individually.
1729000	1731000	Hooray!
1731000	1734000	No idea though what's coming out for February though.
1734000	1738000	Alright, well those of you guys on the Wii have been missing out on all this Rock Band goodness.
1738000	1740000	But maybe not for much longer.
1740000	1748000	Again, going back to the EA conversation, apparently it was confirmed that there is the coming launch of Rock Band for the Wii.
1748000	1755000	He just referred to, the CEO John Riccatello referred to a coming launch of the Wii version of Rock Band.
1755000	1765000	And IGN said, they just really wanted to seek out a firm confirmation and got him to admit that yes, the game will be making a Wii debut.
1765000	1768000	But no release date given, nothing else given.
1768000	1773000	But by the way, in a related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but some standalone microphones came out for Rock Band.
1773000	1779000	And they say something on them about works on the Nintendo Wii, which is hilarious because there is no Rock Band on the Wii yet.
1779000	1781000	And they don't work anyway.
1781000	1785000	So, EA had to put out a My Bad right now.
1785000	1789000	So, that will be a retail nightmare when the Wii version does come out and people say,
1789000	1792000	I bought this microphone, it said it was going to work on the Wii.
1792000	1797000	I don't understand why they don't work on the Wii, it's a fucking USB microphone.
1797000	1799000	I mean, those have got to be pretty standardized anyway.
1799000	1802000	Because the USB on Nintendo is retarded.
1802000	1805000	Yeah, like USB.5.
1805000	1807000	It's actually slower than USB 1.
1807000	1809000	That would be awesome.
1809000	1811000	So, there you have it.
1811000	1817000	Alright, now it's time for us to get to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1817000	1821000	It's a chance for you to talk to us a little bit with the mailbag.
1821000	1824000	Every week you send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1824000	1828000	DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads them on the air.
1828000	1833000	So, DarkSakura, I want you to put your hand in the mailbag there and pull out a few emails.
1833000	1834000	Did we get a lot of emails this week?
1834000	1835000	Oh God, we did.
1835000	1836000	Awesome.
1836000	1838000	Well, I guess you can't read them all, but pick some of your favorites.
1838000	1847000	Well, there were a couple that were really long, including one from our friend who made us the offer from Disney World.
1847000	1849000	Disney must do.
1849000	1850000	Yes.
1850000	1853000	And we're making jokes about the stalker thing.
1853000	1854000	We know better.
1854000	1856000	Trust me.
1856000	1867000	But this one I'm just going to use to go by the email name Lord Katakos because there's no signature on it.
1867000	1872000	I am new to the podcast and I was wondering if you guys and girl ever talked about MapleStory.
1872000	1877000	I enjoy this game a lot, a lot more than Ragnarok in my opinion.
1877000	1881000	Anyway, my undead mage could destroy any of your World of Warcraft accounts.
1881000	1885000	Well, you guys got the micro and stuff.
1885000	1889000	Keep giving out the spanks to the noobs.
1889000	1891000	By the way, that is my priest pick.
1891000	1892000	I think I'm on my PSP.
1892000	1903000	And he sent a picture titled Ugly Mages, but the mailbag is got PMS.
1903000	1908000	So it doesn't let me actually really get to take a look at the images.
1908000	1912000	So sorry.
1912000	1914000	I can't see it.
1914000	1915000	Here we go.
1915000	1917000	I have never played MapleStory.
1917000	1918000	I've heard about it.
1918000	1920000	There's a lot of people that like it.
1920000	1921000	Have you played it, Mo?
1921000	1922000	I loved MapleStory.
1922000	1926000	Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.
1926000	1927000	Well, that's a cute little banner.
1927000	1928000	Yeah.
1928000	1929000	Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.
1929000	1932000	It's like Ragnarok where it has the little Gaia avatars and everything.
1932000	1934000	It's just another RPG.
1934000	1935000	It's a chibi good time.
1935000	1936000	Yes, it's a chibi good time.
1936000	1940000	They're supposed to be making one for DS and I'm waiting for that anxiously.
1940000	1941000	I heard about that.
1941000	1942000	It never happened though.
1942000	1943000	It should be fun.
1943000	1944000	All right.
1944000	1946000	Well, okay, so it looks like there are some MapleStory fans here.
1946000	1950000	So you're in good company.
1950000	1955000	This one actually is addressed to Loki from Azurune.
1955000	1961000	I don't quite remember, but in a past episode of OLR, I remember you stating you were able to play games on your Wii.
1961000	1962000	Is this true?
1962000	1963000	Please answer back.
1963000	1964000	Thanks.
1964000	1966000	I think it means the imports, which we've obviously proven.
1966000	1969000	Yes, I can play games on my Wii.
1969000	1974000	If you've been listening to tonight's show, obviously since we have Smash Brothers Brawl in the house and it's an import copy, yes, he can play import.
1974000	1979000	Yeah, because I have a mod chip in mind.
1979000	1981000	This one comes from Oscar.
1981000	1985000	It turns out my parents will finally be getting high speed Internet.
1985000	1989000	And yes, believe it or not, I've had to suffer the pain and torture of dial up for years.
1989000	1992000	So I resort to web browsing on my iPhone for now.
1992000	1993000	iPhone.
1993000	1998000	But in about a week, I'll be able to finally listen live and even work up the nerve to call in.
1998000	2000000	Talking to you guys would be like talking to celebrities.
2000000	2004000	So, yeah, I'd be nervous, but I'm sure we talked about gaming.
2004000	2007000	I'm sure talking about gaming would put me at ease.
2007000	2009000	Thanks, and I hope to be a live listener soon.
2009000	2012000	P.S., how come I can't access your chat room on iPhone?
2012000	2014000	I've done it with other sites before.
2014000	2015000	Is it because it's Java?
2015000	2021000	Actually, yeah, the iPhone has problems with Java, but I think that, well, I don't know.
2021000	2027000	I haven't updated my software on my iPhone yet, so maybe that will change.
2027000	2033000	I know I can't watch any YouTube videos if they're embedded unless I actually just use the YouTube channel.
2033000	2034000	It's because it's the iPhone?
2034000	2036000	No, iPhone's great.
2036000	2043000	I didn't mean to sound like I was bashing our emailer when they said that talking to us would be like talking to celebrities.
2043000	2050000	It's a compliment, it really is, but we're just nerds that are way too old to be doing this,
2050000	2052000	just kind of kicking back, having fun on a Sunday night.
2052000	2054000	It's really nothing special to us.
2054000	2056000	We invite strangers over to have a beer with us.
2056000	2059000	It's a good time.
2059000	2060000	Next email.
2060000	2063000	Maybe we'll invite you to have a beer with us sometime if you're 21.
2063000	2065000	I didn't card Mo, but I'm just assuming.
2065000	2066000	I can pull out my wallet.
2066000	2067000	I'm 22.
2067000	2068000	All right, good.
2068000	2069000	Good enough.
2069000	2071000	Actually, I want to really quickly, before I get to the next email, I'm so sorry,
2071000	2076000	but there was a very good question asked in chat that I think is a thing to address right now.
2076000	2082000	Someone in chat, they didn't change their nickname, so I just know them as olarmyrecruit9348 says,
2082000	2085000	Someone please tell me how to find Mo on YouTube.
2085000	2088000	It made me realize I'm so rude, I never let Mo plug her stuff.
2088000	2090000	Please, plug away.
2090000	2092000	How can they find your performance from-
2092000	2095000	You can look up the username Amixia.
2095000	2099000	I think you can actually go to YouTube.com slash Amixia.
2099000	2103000	It's A-M-I-X-I-A, and it's me being a retard with my digital camera,
2103000	2107000	and the color tends to change because it's a really bad video camera.
2107000	2109000	It's awesome, but it's me being a retard.
2109000	2111000	It's Amixia on YouTube.
2111000	2112000	It's all right.
2112000	2113000	They're listening to us being retards right now.
2113000	2114000	It's all good.
2114000	2115000	It works.
2115000	2116000	It works.
2116000	2117000	You're in good company.
2117000	2118000	Any other websites you work with?
2118000	2119000	I have a live journal.
2119000	2123000	You can check all my YouTube stuff on there because I'll post those publicly.
2123000	2126000	My username is Furious, spelled exactly like Furious.
2126000	2127000	Wow.
2127000	2128000	I have the most awesome username ever.
2128000	2129000	That's a pretty good username.
2129000	2130000	Congrats.
2130000	2131000	I also have a website.
2131000	2134000	It's prided.net, and I never updated.
2134000	2136000	I think the last video on there was never going to give you up,
2136000	2137000	so I should probably fix that.
2137000	2140000	Yeah, it's just like we have a PSP site that I never update.
2140000	2142000	We don't update our websites either.
2142000	2143000	It's fine.
2143000	2144000	Yeah, prided.net has updates.
2144000	2146000	We're supposed to have a new URL on our website like the first of the year.
2146000	2147000	It didn't happen.
2147000	2148000	It didn't happen.
2148000	2149000	Well, thank you.
2149000	2151000	So now there you go to our listener.
2151000	2154000	Sorry, you can get back to emails now, but that was something very important.
2154000	2155000	Indeed, Rita.
2155000	2156000	It is very important.
2156000	2157000	It is.
2157000	2159000	So next one comes from Ali.
2159000	2164000	On episode 264, I'm glad you're keeping track of episode numbers because I'm not.
2164000	2168000	Loki goes on an anti MacBook Air rant.
2168000	2172240	As an Apple fanboy, I must say that the MacBook Air is a triumph of engineering and a beautiful
2172240	2176120	machine, and I don't think it was intended to play video games on.
2176120	2182680	As an Apple stockholder, I can say the MacBook Air blows chunks.
2182680	2185400	Insert love the show drivel here.
2185400	2187760	It's not that I have a problem with it not being able to play games.
2187760	2191520	I really don't care, and I'm sure it can because it's got a Core Studio processor in it, but
2191520	2196560	it's just that it doesn't have a CD-ROM drive or a DVD-ROM drive or anything like that.
2196560	2203520	You have to basically hijack a drive off another computer, or you have to buy a $99 drive that
2203520	2207480	plugs into the single USB port that's on the damn thing.
2207480	2210960	It's just not very... Yay, it's thin, okay?
2210960	2216000	Props for that, and I'm sure it has a nice battery life, but it's, once again, all aesthetics
2216000	2218760	and no functionality.
2218760	2221180	Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game radio.
2221180	2224360	We never talk computers at all, just video games.
2224360	2226240	Computers play games, therefore it works.
2226240	2227840	Okay, we talk consoles.
2227840	2229840	Consoles play games, too.
2229840	2232000	Fine, fine, fine.
2232000	2235920	Anyway... Can I keep going now?
2235920	2237240	Okay.
2237240	2238560	This comes from Ryoma.
2238560	2246520	Hello, I was just listening to part B of EpiDeDe, episode 265 today, and as excited as I was
2246520	2250680	to hear you talk about Smash Brawl, I have a little something to add to your discussion
2250680	2252260	about the demos.
2252260	2257560	On the Japan official Smash Brawl page, there are two more demos that seem to be exclusive
2257560	2262720	to Japan, Mother 2, Earthbound, of course, and the original Fire Emblem, which is where
2262720	2263960	Marth comes from.
2263960	2268680	Obviously, I understand that those two games are out on the Japanese Virtual Console.
2268680	2273280	However, I'm pretty irritated with the fact that Nintendo seems to love to torture us
2273280	2278320	Americans, apologies to all overseas listeners, with the idea of having a new Mother game,
2278320	2281680	having Earthbound ported to the GBA DSVC, what have you.
2281680	2287680	I still love Nintendo to death, and the only next-gen system I have is a Wii, but their
2287680	2291520	seeming lack of interest in what American gamers want is growing frustrating.
2291520	2293800	Just my two cents, with much love from Chicago Ryoma.
2293800	2298680	Well, I can understand why they're not bringing some of those games over, because Earthbound,
2298680	2302740	I'm sure, has quite a bit of dialogue in there, and they have to localize it, where it's not
2302740	2306640	just, I can throw a copy of the ROM onto the Virtual Console network.
2306640	2310200	Now, I don't understand why they wouldn't put something that, say, localizes in the
2310200	2317200	UK, and bring it over here, because, I don't know, that's just lazy.
2317200	2320440	Next?
2320440	2321440	I guess so.
2321440	2322440	Okay.
2322440	2323680	Hi, the doctor here.
2323680	2326880	Just to ask, what happened to random talk about Battlestar Galactica?
2326880	2329520	Uh, Shane moved away.
2329520	2332480	Just wondering, because after a while, Dark Sakura just stopped.
2332480	2334480	I never talked about Battlestar Galactica.
2334480	2336560	You're getting confused with Rice Princess.
2336560	2337560	Yeah.
2337560	2340840	And, Rob, you still need to send me that MP3 file, please.
2340840	2342440	Oh, yeah, I forgot.
2342440	2344320	I'm sorry, I will.
2344320	2345760	Battlestar Galactica comes back in April.
2345760	2349880	I'm sure you will hear random Battlestar Galactica chat come back in April.
2349880	2352040	Because this show never gets derailed, ever.
2352040	2353040	Ever.
2353040	2354040	Rob.
2354040	2355040	Rob.
2355040	2356040	Rob.
2356040	2357040	Rob.
2357040	2358040	What?
2358040	2359040	Hi.
2359040	2362960	I've been busy playing Wild Arms in Castlevania Symphony of the Night on my PSP after I paid
2362960	2365200	for them on the PlayStation Network.
2365200	2366800	Some Call of Duty 4 are actually a lot.
2366800	2367800	Oh, and Rez.
2367800	2368880	Fuck yeah, Rez.
2368880	2370880	Fuck yes, Rez.
2370880	2372760	That is one addicting game.
2372760	2377520	Listening to last week's show while writing this, they retracted their retraction.
2377520	2378520	What the fuck?
2378520	2382840	Sorry, it was literally a WTF, but I like saying what the fuck.
2382840	2383840	Oh, okay.
2383840	2385480	And, Rob, I challenge you to some Undertow.
2385480	2388840	Anyways, I was going to go now, so you guys can move on.
2388840	2389840	Peace.
2389840	2390960	I'm really bad at Undertow.
2390960	2392080	I don't think you want to play me.
2392080	2395160	Play me at something I'm like halfway decent at, like Puzzle Fighter or something.
2395160	2400200	Well, we have one more e-mail that's really, really, really, really, really, freaking
2400200	2401200	long.
2401200	2402200	Okay.
2402200	2406280	Hello, Skyloki, DarkSakura, and guest host.
2406280	2407600	Hi.
2407600	2409120	Disclaimer.
2409120	2412800	First let me apologize for my bad grammar, as I know you tend to be a stickler for proper
2412800	2417160	grammar, and I tend to disregard proper grammar and spelling whenever I write anything.
2417160	2418160	That's okay.
2418160	2420160	I'm used to IMing, Rob.
2420160	2421160	Burn.
2421160	2422160	Jamie.
2422160	2423160	Jamie.
2423160	2424160	Jamie.
2424160	2425160	Jamie.
2425160	2426160	Bite me.
2426160	2427160	Rob.
2427160	2428160	What?
2428160	2429160	Heart.
2429160	2430160	I brought you cake.
2430160	2431160	Be nice.
2431160	2432160	That's true.
2432160	2433160	You did buy me cake.
2433160	2434160	It was delicious cake.
2434160	2435160	E-mail.
2435160	2436160	It was delicious and moist.
2436160	2437160	E-mail.
2437160	2438160	E-mail.
2438160	2439160	E-mail.
2439160	2440160	E-mail.
2440160	2442600	Okay, Oscar.
2442600	2446160	Regarding the Fox News report on Mass Effect, oh, Lord.
2446160	2447160	Oh, God.
2447160	2449320	And of e-mail.
2449320	2453040	I feel it sadly shows the current state of our country's journalism.
2453040	2457680	While Fox News is notorious for having a conservative agenda to their broadcast, the sad truth of
2457680	2461280	the matter was that it was probably nothing more than a ploy for a ratings boost, and
2461280	2464960	I'm sure if CNN had the chance, they would have done the same.
2464960	2467800	Excuse me.
2467800	2473240	Lately with news, it seems that the way to get a top story on the news is simply find
2473240	2476800	something that has a soap opera or scandal written all over it.
2476800	2481560	Scandals sell, and it also had to do with sex, which we know the old saying about that.
2481560	2490500	And of course, children, since the stereotype to a lot of non-gamers is video games are
2490500	2492040	kid stuff.
2492040	2496040	Were I a news show producer or a news show host and saw something that implied there
2496040	2500800	was a lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect, I would run with a trashy story like that because
2500800	2505460	if it is true, that can mean big ratings hike for the show and possible raise slash promotion
2505460	2508000	for yourself.
2508000	2511140	Since video games are considered the current evil that is corrupting our youth much like
2511140	2516000	rock and roll in the 50s and 60s, violent films in the 80s and 90s, and rock and roll
2516000	2520120	again just before the focus shifted to video games, you know that was both Jack Thompson,
2520120	2522480	I mean him too, sorry.
2522480	2526080	I still remember journalists trying to pin the Columbine High School massacre on Marilyn
2526080	2527240	Manson.
2527240	2530720	It makes any scandalous video game story easy prey.
2530720	2536820	With a chance that could get a casual gamer, concerned parents, and people who would act
2536820	2541320	like sex in video games, I got to see what games they mention and start playing them,
2541320	2546000	as well as your regular audience to tune in when they might not have.
2546000	2549840	Also since few outside of gaming world would read or hear any follow up on the story on
2549840	2553440	the net regarding the false statements of the report, it would be a quick and easy reading
2553440	2556000	so not everyone would have heard the bad journalism backlash.
2556000	2557000	Disgusting?
2557000	2559600	Yes, but it also means modern day journalism tactics as well.
2559600	2562800	Okay, discuss so I can take a break.
2562800	2570400	Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here, I do understand, you know, probably any network
2570400	2575520	would have done it, but I don't know, there's something about the whole sensationalism of
2575520	2579320	it and I don't know, I feel like Fox News in general has kind of done this stuff before,
2579320	2586920	but I think you're right, CNN probably would do something like this too, I mean it just
2586920	2591720	kind of depends on, but I don't know, I feel like there's actual news to be reported on
2591720	2596820	out there, what with an election going on right now, and you know, things going on in
2596820	2605920	other countries and things and whatever, I just, it's, I don't know, just shouldn't waste
2605920	2608040	our time with that kind of crap.
2608040	2609040	That's all.
2609040	2613040	Well, and didn't they pull the statement like a couple days later when her book on Amazon
2613040	2615060	started getting tanking reviews?
2615060	2619200	She sort of said, I'm sorry- She was like, oh, okay, maybe Mass Effect
2619200	2620200	wasn't that bad.
2620200	2625640	It was kind of like a half-assed apology, though, she was like, I made a real bad judgment
2625640	2629480	call or something like that, but she didn't really say, I'm sorry, gamers, or I'm sorry
2629480	2633680	to the gaming community and to the mature gamers out there, she didn't really say anything
2633680	2636160	like that, she just said, oh, I've done fucked up.
2636160	2642640	Yeah, but don't make a statement on Fox News 1 and then like, once you realize that your
2642640	2648480	review on Amazon is like dropping hugely, it like took a nose dive, she was like, okay,
2648480	2650280	maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.
2650280	2651280	No shit.
2651280	2654440	Yeah, so there you have it.
2654440	2655440	Anything else you want to read out of that email?
2655440	2656440	Oh, there's plenty more.
2656440	2657440	All right.
2657440	2661800	As for the, well, you know, really this is, I actually, I do have to say this is actually
2661800	2666060	more of what we've discussed on the show as well, but I really do like this email and
2666060	2672080	I'm going to post it on the forum if I remember to.
2672080	2674440	I'm going to move on to the drinking game portion.
2674440	2675440	Okay.
2675440	2676440	Uh-oh.
2676440	2679760	So this is, I know the game series is a bit touchy subject for you guys and already has
2679760	2685000	great music, but how would a custom soundtrack of Dragon Force or Death Clock be for a Katamari
2685000	2686000	game?
2686000	2687000	Dude, yes.
2687000	2688000	Yes.
2688000	2691000	I love Metalocalypse.
2691000	2694600	Anyway, I think it would really change my outlook on the franchise.
2694600	2698320	I love its fun, cheesy quirkiness and I think Dragon Force soundtrack version of the game
2698320	2701960	would make me love it even more for its mass chaos, death and destruction as I do love
2701960	2703760	games with mass carnage.
2703760	2708760	One last thing, sorta, the OLR drinking games got a big laugh at the chat room saying take
2708760	2713800	a drink whenever Loki leads off the story with anyways since that first was the first
2713800	2715520	thing that crossed my mind.
2715520	2719400	I am very conscious of that now and I have been not saying that.
2719400	2723160	No, it's okay because now it's part of the drinking game and you want people to drink.
2723160	2725160	Well I don't want them to die.
2725160	2726160	True.
2726160	2731440	They already take a shot every time I say an off-color comment, so you know, people
2731440	2733840	should be rushed to the hospital already, so.
2733840	2738120	Alright, well he has some suggestions for us.
2738120	2743360	Whenever the show goes off on a tangent about food, hey we've had cake all night, so.
2743360	2744360	Mmm cake.
2744360	2745360	Delicious cake.
2745360	2746800	Moist.
2746800	2751600	Whenever there is Sony bashing after some Sony news, the word addict is used after someone
2751600	2754620	mentions playing an MMORPG.
2754620	2761680	Anytime an EE uses the blanking expletive is used outside of the FUs of the week segment,
2761680	2765520	okay, they can't do that on me then.
2765520	2781980	Anytime Dark yet the
2781980	2758980	forward video game channel that shall not be named.
2758980	2763820	expletive is used outside of the FUs of the week segment okay they can't do that
2763820	2768060	on me then um anytime dark soccer goes rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah
2768060	2775540	rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah what hi we need the ferret and whenever Loki
2775540	2780340	bashes the Mac anytime there's a mention of that former video game channel that
2780340	2783580	shall not be named anytime there's a mention of that blood-sucking lawyer
2783580	2791580	there shall not be named what game pro TV any time dreamy JD Roth at any time
2791580	2798820	Rob says heart to dark Sakura after making fun of her yeah and if Raven
2798820	2804180	Stoffan is the first caller on the skyline segment and any mention of
2804180	2808100	pyramid head it definitely any caller that calls in the skyline that's got a
2808100	2812400	bad like you know connection you know there is a whole thread going on in the
2812400	2815300	forums and I encourage you to add to this they are actually making an OLR
2815300	2818660	drinking game in the thread here's some more examples of what's going on in
2818660	2825060	thread here let's see sky take a drink every time sky says fired fired mentions
2825060	2829980	the bet or the tingle costume thing tells a joke that no one laughs at or is
2829980	2834660	met with resounding silence dark Sakura gives an F you to bad drivers or her
2834660	2838660	co-workers or two stupid people in general mentions sure me the cat and
2838660	2842780	says reject false icons it's her final thought I haven't said that in a very
2842780	2848380	long time Loki brings up his dislike of the karaoke performances a refusal to do
2848380	2852500	that anymore bashes Apple pretty much the same thing our emailer said the
2852500	2856180	drinking game even extends to some of our weeknight shows such as the
2856180	2859800	insanest hour and Travis Donovan live but there's some other miscellaneous
2859800	2864940	things take a shot every time the Olive Garden gets mentioned there you go
2864940	2869180	exactly see how can you not get into a discussion about the Olive Garden when
2869180	2872100	it gets mentioned he's like the minister these soup is delicious you go
2872100	2876620	I love the mystery drink too many mean the mystery soup though no that's what
2876620	2881740	makes it so great I hate a soup I love let's go back to Olive Garden I owe you
2881740	2886140	anyway speaking of which kind of going off food tangent here real well drink
2886140	2891840	they started carrying these soups at Raley's now where it's it's actually the
2891840	2896100	soup from the guy in New York that you know the soup Nazi get mail obviously
2896100	2901380	they call him the soup man but not soup Nazi but I tried one the other day not
2901380	2905420	very good but um you know it looked cool the prospect of getting soup from him
2905420	2909580	you know it's kind of no soup for you excuse me one year what the fuck did
2909580	2921000	that have to do with video gaming she mentioned food tangent here's what you

2978480	2983940	would like you to type me in chat only once if you type it more than once you

2997740	3002540	totally in exactly so and tonight on the line a res HD code from our listener at
3002540	3005360	death who is kind enough to give it away here on the show so if you want to play
3005360	3008660	in tonight's match game say me and Moe will pick a person very soon to play
3008660	3012020	match game if you lose there that's okay you can always hammer the skype line
3012020	3017860	which will be open very soon but first a couple more news stories for us yes a
3017860	3024100	game I talked about earlier crisis they were having some well not so wonderful
3024100	3029500	sales before but now they have finally hit 1 million copies sold that's good
3029500	3032420	for them because it was a pretty good game except for that last level which
3032420	3039140	really sucked of course to go along with that news they're gonna be showing off
3039140	3043520	the cry engine to at least the console port of it at the game developers
3043520	3047700	conference was just coming up actually in a couple weeks here so hopefully
3047700	3053100	because of that we will see maybe crisis come to you know console system I
3053100	3058500	remember some talks rumors at least of crisis coming through the ps3 so that'd
3058500	3064500	be pretty cool to see happen but either way you know maybe give something else
3064500	3073820	for game companies use others in the end real free engine hmm oh another engines
3073820	3078220	fully optimized because if you play it on the PC if thing eats your PC I mean
3078220	3082380	no matter what kind of hardware you have in there but uh I guess because it
3082380	3087000	wasn't fully optimized thank you cry tech for putting out a wonderfully
3087000	3094580	polished game not optimized one bit awesome okay well if crisis isn't your
3094580	3097260	thing which I don't know I haven't really gotten into crisis but I don't
3097260	3100860	know I could probably get into this game and it's coming to North America soon
3100860	3105360	it's a game called arcana heart and it's coming to the PlayStation 2 now here's
3105360	3109980	the thing about this game it's an all-girl fighter that's right all babes
3109980	3118300	duking it out it's not quite dead or alive let's just put it that way they
3118300	3122660	are fully clothed girls at least the ones here in this screenshot yes there
3122660	3125420	is a severe lack of boobies or so important is but we do have a little bit
3125420	3132860	of panties in that particular shots all right so anyhow I'm Atlas is said that
3132860	3136220	the ps2 is still a viable platform there's no reason to abandon a veteran
3136220	3140500	system just because it isn't the newest thing around so some of the Japanese
3140500	3143900	titles that haven't made its way over here yet atlas plant plans are sorry

3342820	3346380	let me remind you all how this works okay Jake you gotta pause the game okay
3346380	3348860	let me remind everybody how this works what we're gonna do is we're gonna have
3348860	3352140	three questions for you tonight and in the questions they all have a blank
3352140	3354760	there's a blank somewhere in the answer you ever watch the match game in the
3354760	3358860	70s the reruns on games network it's just like that boy game stuff okay so
3358860	3362020	we're gonna ask three questions there will be a blank in it so our celebrities
3362020	3366860	will think about their answer and write it down on a little piece of paper and
3366860	3374740	five mad libs on my invisible keyboard and then our callers will try to match
3374740	3379980	okay and if for every celebrity they match they get a point that's how it
3379980	3383500	works so what you just have to Jake all I have to do think of something funny
3383500	3387900	that goes in the blank or real doesn't matter okay so I have to do go for funny
3387900	3393500	all right I have to hopefully one night stands got my is understanding what's
3393500	3396020	going on because I just got a message that says sweet I don't know what I'm
3396020	3400420	doing which means you're probably gonna win SSJ 100 Matt you're up some up
3400420	3405100	against stiff competition tonight are you ready did cheeseburger come back

3415020	3418940	nobody manages to get a point on the board then we'll get cheeseburger the
3418940	3423100	code yes all right so cheeseburger is hoping that everybody that's fine with

3431100	3437140	night stands we have a zero Sam it's on screen it was funny though because I

3609340	3616380	night stands says she can kill her by flop smash flop smash all right let's
3616380	3621380	see if there's a match dark Sakura she can kill her by by repeatedly bashing
3621380	3625100	her in the head with mr. Saturn until she dies a bleeding horrible oozy death
3625100	3629740	well be a very difficult one to match but is a good answer but unfortunately

3669940	3672300	went with fire because fire always makes it better
3672300	3676900	Oh fire would have been a great answer unfortunately not a match and my answer
3676900	3681820	was she could kill her by in reference to last week condemned to explosive
3681820	3689220	babies unfortunately also not a match so cheeseburgers in the lead right now

4121940	4125980	here at orange launch radio this is how we roll all right do we have any more
4125980	4130100	stories yeah all right one more story and then we're gonna open up dare
4130100	4136700	skype line so not to be outdone by the Wii yet again
4136700	4143700	ps3 devs have put out a little video saying look at what we could do with the
4143700	4151540	I or the PlayStation I yeah we can do that VR shit too we're awesome but yeah
4151540	4156460	basically um in you know kind of impressed by what they've done using the
4156460	4160300	wiimote you know they kind of this very similar thing actually look like it uses
4160300	4165580	the exact same program and it's running on a ps3 dev kit to give that you know
4165580	4171220	head tracking so you know I'm pretty impressed by the PlayStation I'm not
4171220	4175340	gonna buy it yet but I'm impressed by what you can do with it like you know
4175340	4180580	the little tech demos and stuff but I would like some actual games that use
4180580	4185940	this technology instead of just look at what we can do oh but it'll never come
4185940	4191780	out but just look what we can do all right what do you think what will they
4191780	4195700	do do you think well they better do something like I like that one where is
4195700	4200500	the combat type game you know like the old Atari combat but you you know you
4200500	4204500	can scan in your picture that you want to use as your tank you can just draw a
4204500	4207620	picture you can put an actual tank on there you know stuff like that that's
4207620	4211580	cool or like you know the lunar lander game where they make by drawing the
4211580	4215780	pictures and stuff I mean that's pretty cool that's what they should be doing
4215780	4221140	with the I instead of just I don't know games right to move a ball around by
4221140	4227620	waving my arm that's kind of dumb trials of Topac also a stupid name too for the
4227620	4234460	game she's been trials of Tupac that's that would have sold a lot better
4237460	4241980	alright on that note we're gonna open up our Skype line for you guys to give us a
4241980	4246980	call it's one eight seven seven game olr username on Skype orange lounge radio

4289580	4295100	who is there on the phone on the orange lounge radio Skype line hello
4295100	4301380	eating a bag of chips by the sound of it what's on your mind Legend of Zaku no
4301380	4306820	no nothing but nothing was just coming back from just you know you want to do
4306820	4313380	but just your Super Bowl shit and stuff um yeah was it was well I was wild crazy
4313380	4318380	when the Giants won yeah I mean it was it was dead it was kind of quiet when
4318380	4323620	the game started but then as we further went you know went through there was a
4323620	4327180	lot of people there and it was it was just man it's on the way you know I had
4327180	4334100	a time square did you get now did you actually watch the Super Bowl or did you
4334100	4338780	just play DDR all night no I bought actually you know I had my
4338780	4344620	Buffalo wings might be here and all that other stuff I actually avoided DDR today
4344620	4349140	hmm but besides that I mean I don't know if you want to bring up supernova too
4349140	4354740	since it was probably brought up by other folks anyways oh we haven't talked
4354740	4358500	a lot about DDR recently on the program but what are your thoughts on DDR
4358500	4367300	supernova 2 basically it's like this um I don't know it's just bits and bits and
4367300	4371460	holding us back they're holding us back the fact that we can't even unlock songs
4371460	4376540	right now we're being out and we're being forced against our will to
4376540	4382120	basically have to go as far as importing a game or basically just telling the
4382120	4385720	arcade owners that means and we have good relationships with better than bits
4385720	4390220	and to just avoid it it's not worth it without even news or a means of
4390220	4394420	unlocking their form just so you're pissed they didn't bring the Japanese
4394420	4398420	only EMU system over to America to try and add a little some of the game
4398420	4402700	tension but bits and being the half-assed American you know folks that
4402700	4406500	they are just basically say fuck it we're not gonna do it aren't we kind of
4406500	4412300	lucky to have we are still going in the arcades in the first place I mean huh I
4412300	4419500	mean think about it that was I remember and the way I might blame the Konami
4419500	4423100	because they're actually making a good effort in bringing it over here they try
4423100	4427060	it you know they tried it with this you know with this game they tried it with
4427060	4431660	guitar fish from Romania which is which hasn't seen at least a year but you know
4431660	4437820	it fits in this is trying to half-assed away into this the only thing I can see
4437820	4443680	is you know and I mean literally needs to shake it all right so she can the
4443680	4447700	biggest in this country what do you what do you think now I'm not playing this
4447700	4452200	game so giving us a little bet tonight here on the show that's fine but what
4452200	4456100	what can Betson do to make things right with DDR let's say there's a supernova
4456100	4461740	three what can they do to make things right well just do what Konami says I mean
4461740	4467740	that's that's pretty much what they had to do anyways since I know most likely
4467740	4473180	the way the way they were picked out anyways was you know a contract so you
4473180	4476820	know since Konami put the bid you know bid out you know the effects in the
4476820	4484540	contract to distribute games in America by not by basically you know a surfing
4484540	4489100	Konami's will you know that would that would be on the you know that'd be ground
4489100	4495060	for breach of contract all right you know Konami will sue if it got that bad
4495060	4500020	if it was Konami will sue it was putting a damper on their sales all right we
4500020	4507420	got to wrap up any last-minute thoughts that go um I don't know Call of Duty 4
4507420	4512860	kicks Halo 3's ass there you have a Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass it does

4594780	4603620	we had well hello Rama what's on your mind um hey before I start I'm Jamie

4607700	4615380	giant we yes I think she's taking a major we so do you have can we can we
4615380	4622260	relay something to her what would you say if she was here oh me or me or you
4622260	4625780	because I just want to say I can has a Guinness that's all is is there a major
4625780	4628860	like tonight I think there is maybe the cam slowing things down I don't know it
4628860	4632900	might be on my end if there is I'm sorry no it's alright we forgive you so I can
4632900	4635900	has a Guinness we will relay the message to her is there anything else you want
4635900	4642420	to say about the program join the show so far and this party because out on the
4642420	4646820	road friends getting tattooed well you missed you missed most lovely rendition
4646820	4651860	of still alive how dare you I will I'll catch the replay on Justin TV all right
4651860	4659420	so Jamie is back what you want to say to Jamie Jamie what I can has a Guinness
4659420	4668060	yes you can have I can ask you this I can have Smith which is why I called is
4668060	4673500	that I'm kind of tired of the DDR bashing by by the diehards can we just
4673500	4679740	let it be okay we already realized that Konami doesn't care they're doing what
4679740	4684580	they can just leave it at because I'm just a happy-go-lucky player I'm just
4684580	4687700	happy that we even have the game in the arcades can we just leave it at that
4687700	4693100	can't we just all agree that DDR is gay can't we all just get along right and I
4693100	4698780	can say that because I am so is it gayer than you or gay as you know I'm just I'm
4698780	4704140	just kidding obvious I'm DDR is not gay DDR is just it's DDR totally does not
4704140	4713900	like to sleep with other DDR is the same gender I beg to differ no I'm kidding I
4713900	4718260	don't yeah I've said the DDR argument so many times I'm like blue in the face I
4718260	4721860	just I want to look at pretty Smash Brothers brawl more that's all I want is
4721860	4729580	that okay but um Rob what a few episodes back you said some about any I think you
4729580	4734620	would do to make DDR better you kind of glance over what would you do to make it
4734620	4738940	better I really have to hear what you would do I would scrap all the code they
4738940	4742540	have ever used to make DDR and build the game from the ground up it's gonna force
4742540	4745600	them to think of some new ideas on how to make the game original again and I
4745600	4748380	would bring over some of the people that helped on the Xbox version if they're
4748380	4751820	still with the company additionally I would think about how to make the game
4751820	4755340	more competitive than cooperative in nature because yes there was the dance
4755340	4758420	battle mode or whatever in supernova but I think a mode like that should be the
4758420	4763220	focus of the game next time and not an afterthought that's my thoughts
4763220	4770180	literally redesign I mean the game can still be single-player and have that's
4770180	4774020	modes and they can have some cooperative features in it but make it more of a
4774020	4777140	tournament game relaunch the game is dance dance tournament or something I
4777140	4781260	don't know so all right Rama we gotta let you go try and get some more calls
4781260	4785540	okay okay and one more thing yes I'm aware was not taking classic own for we
4785540	4790900	consoles what's that Nintendo world is only accepting plastic for we console
4790900	4795620	sales why is that I don't know that's the sign in the window when you walk in
4795620	4801660	Wow no checks no cash nope safe it's Apple is doing with the iPhones plastic
