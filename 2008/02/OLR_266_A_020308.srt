Could the Playstation 3 hard drive be getting even bigger?

New Animal Crossing and Kirby games are rumored for release this holiday

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000

Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that podcast on DARE internet

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Say hello to the one and only

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Cuddly DarkSakura

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She's not like her internet persona in real life

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She's actually very sweet, right?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you add lots of sugar

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, and how are you doing Ms. Sakura?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm frustrated with the mailbag

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry to hear that, what did the mailbag do to you?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's being a bitch

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry to hear that

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright, also joining us tonight

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nope

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can lick it off

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's right, you can lick it off, alright

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Exactly

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I gotta say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Cause she has no idea who the eff we are

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey, you're pretty cool, you should come be on our program

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But she's a real good sport, she's here tonight

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Give it up for Mo

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello interweb, why am I waving?

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Huh?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why am I waving?

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you waving?

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Cause we do have an internet cam over there on Justin TV

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So we make sure you get picked up on there

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But how are you?

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm nervous but super

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you nervous?

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's nothing to be nervous about

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We don't bite much

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't trust her

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She only doesn't trust dark soccer, right?

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You've heard stories

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm nice

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, see, you're gonna fit right in

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What does she do when she pisses off dark soccer?

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She goes hearts and it makes it better

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She already knows

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's exactly what I do

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She knows

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She knows this gig already

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, and the cowboy hat

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And by the way, Mo

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Uber famous on YouTube

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uber famous?

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, I don't know about Uber famous

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Closai famous

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Closai famous

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She's like an e-list celebrity on the internet

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So she's here tonight

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She's actually gonna play for us a cover

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
From the game portal

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Of Jonathan Coulton's Still Alive

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And she's very brave to be doing that live here on the radio

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we're gonna give her a big OLR hug, right chat room?

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Chat at orangeontotototototot.com

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Also joining us tonight

81
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Someone who's also new to the program

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But doesn't seem to be quite as intimidated

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You know why?

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Cause he's too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl

85
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Which we have in the house

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We'll talk about that a little bit

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Say hello to Jake

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello interwebs

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How are you Jake?

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Getting thrashed by Snake

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Alright, awesome

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And we're not gonna be able to use this mic to talk to Jake

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or I might smash over poor Mo's guitar

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And that wouldn't be good

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Brothers Brawl

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the house

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Brothers Brawl

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So this is something that we, you know, picked up

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That anybody really can right now if they have the ability to play import games

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And it's actually, I kind of got lucky on eBay

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Cause, you know, it's been going for over $150 on there

103
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Just for an import copy

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Luckily though, I did find one

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I had to do a double take on it

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That was $49.99 and like $8 shipping

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I was like, I'm jumping on that

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow, nice

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I bought it

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And sure enough, it was legit

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, you know, that's awesome

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Very cool

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know why anyone else didn't see this auction

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Seeing it as a buy it now for $49.99

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm like, that's even cheaper than getting it on Playasia

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, you know, I'm definitely, this game I think is worth buying twice

117
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I will be playing the Japanese copy until the US one comes out

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, we'll talk about your thoughts a little more on the game

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
When we get into How Was Your Gaming Week

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But for right now, we're gonna move on over into that segment

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How Was Your Gaming Week

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But you know us ladies first

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So we're gonna let DarkSakura kick it off with

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How Was Your Gaming Week

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
My gaming week was actually very not

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok

127
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Because it's just, you know, point and click

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That type of thing

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, yeah

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I didn't even play any pinball

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No pinball?

132
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No pinball

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh my gosh

134
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Same reason

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wow, well sorry to hear about that

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise though

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Very cool, what did you think of what you saw?

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I thought that I really really really really really really like crashes

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I like the super jumps

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Very cool

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like the really long ones where you get the different angles

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I'm like Dukes of Hazzard go

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was cool

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Good times

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Alright

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well hopefully you'll be back up and running soon

148
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Your middle finger will be back in commission

149
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you can flip people off and all that good stuff

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I wake up in the morning all double horns

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So it's not all bad

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She rolls out of bed ready to rock

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yep

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you know if it were more fingers it would be too much metal for one hand

156
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Awesome

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Alright

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Loki we'll go over to you, how was your gaming week?

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Put down the controller

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
My gaming week was fine

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are not trying to do this and play at the same time

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are not

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You can leave it alone for five seconds

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey I'm not playing it

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat

166
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright you know so we were fixing it

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fine

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I thought you said that wasn't cheating

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not cheating it's exploiting the game

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Exactly

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh you said cheat not cheat

172
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So my gaming week I've been playing Burnout Paradise

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Which is awesome because I have this vendetta against Dan

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Unfortunately Gunstar Hero

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Because he keeps beating my times or my show time amounts

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The Road Rules ones

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah the Road Rules ones

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah he keeps beating my crashing ones

180
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So I go through and specifically go and beat his

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's not actually doing it on purpose

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know

183
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We talked about it

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I know

185
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well the whole reason he did the Road Rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs and that was it

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And he wanted the car

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah well I understand that but I have to beat everybody on my friends list

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So that's why I've been going through and doing that

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well if you tell him it's a competition he will compete

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was fun

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I love the game it's great just crashing everything

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Which kind of gets me to my other topic here

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I had another 360 die

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Three rings

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times

196
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?

197
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No I had to overheat it quite a few times

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sounds hot

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This next time though it's not going to be pretty

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about 1000 degrees

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It will work or it will melt

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One of the two

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then let's see what else did I get

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh actually I imported another game

205
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a game called

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
God I don't remember what it's called now

207
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was going to say while you're thinking about that for your Xbox 360

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard

209
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's like popping randomly in the left speaker

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral

214
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Put it in a little floaty boat

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Set it on fire

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm not ready to give up on it yet

219
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because I've gotten it to work for half an hour at a time

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just so weird because it will work perfectly

221
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I think oh great it's fixed

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then I'll turn it on three hours later and it will be three rings again

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll play through a game and it will be completely normal

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It can play it for about an hour or so

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I'm like okay I'm confident this is working

226
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And then sure enough it stops working

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So whatever

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I give up

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Anyways I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Other things I played other than that of course

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Smash Brothers Brawl

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just started playing a bit of that

233
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To be honest I'm not very good at it

234
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But it's cool

235
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a really cool game

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Like I said it's probably worth buying twice

237
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So definitely check it out if you can

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
As soon as you can

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We've actually unlocked quite a few players

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because other than playing through space and emissary mode

241
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can actually just play the versus mode

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And one of the cheat things you can do is you can set up a special brawl

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Where the players have set hit points

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then you drop the computers down the one

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You put this thing on where the hit points drop gradually

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So immediately the computer dies

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So that's kind of fun I guess

248
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like watching paint dry but it unlocks characters so that's good

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's see what else they play

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Res HD

251
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh my god is that awesome

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Playing that on a surround sound system

253
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh yeah

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That is some good stuff there

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Absolutely love that game

256
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's see

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh now this is the game I imported for the Game Boy Advance

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Dot Stream is the name of it

259
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's one of the bit generation titles

260
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Erase Lines

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it's actually pretty fun

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Cheap little titles like 20 bucks

263
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But I'll have to show you Rob some of it a little bit later

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And that's pretty much it

265
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Awesome

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well it sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I try

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well I want to go to our guest Moe

269
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And see what Moe's been playing this week

270
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now Moe you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs

271
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You do actually play video games

272
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You work in video games

273
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're a gamer girl right

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes I am

275
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You sure are so don't doubt it

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So what kind of games have you been playing this week

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful

278
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Which is very depressing because it looks awesome so far

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But I'm a really crappy shot

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Awesome

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Very cool

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So you've been very busy

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Since somebody's borrowing my 360 copies still

288
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My bad

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He's better on PC

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't know if I mentioned it before

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Was that I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The actual 3D model because I want to make one

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle

295
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But I haven't gotten around to that yet

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Now Moe are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360

297
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm a PC player

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why is that you just prefer that you think it's more of a keyboard mouse type game

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or are you like Xbox sucks or what

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have a 360 I love my 360

301
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But I cannot do shooters on console at all

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm a terrible shot I cannot play Halo for the life of me

303
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Gotcha

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Alright

306
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh I forgot I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because god damn commander whoever's stuck

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know holding his arms out with a gun in his hand

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They won't trigger the last scene

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I really hate that game at the end at least

312
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The rest of the game is awesome it's just the end fucking sucks

313
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Seriously

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Alright

315
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week

316
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And then Jake do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
As soon as I'm done here

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He's gonna be a pouty face

319
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's see

320
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My gaming week was pretty much Res HD all freaking week

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I agree with Loki Res HD is a beautiful game and it's time for Res to make a little bit of a comeback

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You know it was a little bit fuzzy on the Playstation 2 and the Dreamcast

323
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Not that it was bad but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful beautiful HD

324
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And the sound system and everything it's just gorgeous

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever

326
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
For real I just love Res and it's a beautiful game and the graphics are great

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I mean it's only like 10 bucks so it's a great deal I think it's probably the best

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet honestly

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm totally in love with Res HD

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's really it otherwise I've been playing Warcraft still because I'm a big nerd

331
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SassyPants my level 70 character who's awesome

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And she now has a sister named SassyLama who is a shaman I just made that so

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And if you don't know what that means you gotta check Urban Dictionary

334
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So there you go

335
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Anyway we gotta, Loki you gotta give Jake your mic

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Jake now you're new to the program right?

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But you're a gamer too right?

338
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well I'm not a gamer

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah you've just been attached to Smash Bros. Brawl all night

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What kind of games do you play? What have you been playing this week?

341
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was in Baltimore all week so I've been playing Rock Band

342
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And lots of Rock Band

343
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And more Rock Band up until like midnight on Wednesday

344
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you love so much about Rock Band?

345
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Character creation, the party aspect

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You get four people in a room just rocking out it doesn't compare to anything else

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Barbie mode is awesome in Rock Band seriously I love Barbie mode

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey dress up mode

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes you get to dress up my characters and take them shopping it's awesome

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You play a lot of MMOs though?

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Too many

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like not just Warcraft what other kind of MMOs have you been playing?

353
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I slowly got addicted to EverQuest 2 unfortunately

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sucker

355
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So people actually play EverQuest 2?

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Quite a handful there's like 10-15 servers and a couple are actually full now and then

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What makes EverQuest 2 so dang popular?

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's less easy mode it's a little more it's like wow only more difficult as far as I can tell

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Deeper craft system lots more race to choose from

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2 correct?

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And a frog and a rat

362
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's pretty awesome

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And the head of the dragons

364
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Cool

365
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What else what else what other MMOs you been playing?

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well aside from wow Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa is all about because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me which wasn't a whole lot so

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Essentially it's a third person shooter MMO

369
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You go around you blast aliens instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and what not

370
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there or is there something you can compare it to or?

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's not much you can compare it to aside from like a tactical shooter because you can actually use cover effectively and

372
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's hard to describe though as far as that goes

374
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Gotcha

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Alright

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So you recommend all these games do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs they should?

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Definitely

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now wait a minute you play three different MMOs but you do have a day job right?

379
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think so

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And you do go outdoors once in a while?

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm here

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So you break the stereotype?

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes

384
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Alright excellent I'm glad to hear you have a healthy balanced lifestyle that's great

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Doubtful

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Alright

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Also chat orange launch radio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight. We'd love to hear what you guys have to say

388
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl which is going on right now during our program

389
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Although I would think you know either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that or you came over here watch this

390
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway so most people for most people Super Bowl is long passed over

391
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Son of Dad says Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target so I guess Tabula Rasa is not selling too well

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hitstun praising Res HD Hitstun says Res HD is awesome and have a 360 and don't already have Res you'd be stupid not to pick this up

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on Res HD because they didn't they didn't have or they already had a previous copy of Res on Playstation 2 or Dreamcast

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Tigerclaw says Skye I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Res HD not quite but I had to do the trans vibrator mode

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I almost picked up three different controllers for that but I didn't have three different controllers at my house so I tried just the controller I was playing with and that was just kind of eh

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Eh it's regular well I have the controller I was playing with and then my wireless so I put the wireless on my back cause that's what you know Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do is you should put one towards your lower back and it's actually kind of freaky

398
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But it's like a free back massage while you play video games so it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music it's certainly an experience I'll say that

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So let's see Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Brothers Brawl in house he says turn it off it's rude to play games that we non importers don't have yet

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry dude I don't know what to tell you we really want to play dude blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release that's what I say

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's alright they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Alright that's right cause they're having problems aren't they

403
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They're a little short yeah

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well actually no seriously it is just a little short because they they only fulfill I forget how much of it not much like 20% of the preorders but the rest are coming next week so

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah it's not that bad I mean and every major like Nintendo title has been short anyways with Mario Galaxy was like that Zelda I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here

407
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mario Kart and the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels it'll be something stupid and arbitrary that's you know holding the whole thing up I don't know

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So Nintendo seems to be having production issues just left and right at first you can't crank out enough Wii's and they can't crank out

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
A little random factoid though this is the first dual layer disc that's on the Wii

410
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well I imagine with all the shit they have in this game it's got to be a pretty full disc

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah you have to run an update once you get it so

412
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wow

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank you Nintendo now I have two news channels and two weather channels both of which I still don't use so that's awesome

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Weather channel's awesome

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you actually use the weather channel Mo?

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
When I feel like seeing what the temperature is in Johannesburg Africa

417
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Or is it just for spinning the plane?

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I like to listen to the music and spin the globe because I'm stupid

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah sometimes that's fun

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Especially if I've been drinking a little bit

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sometimes you're curious about how cold it is in Russia at the time or you know how nice and warm it is in Puerto Rico

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Or how cold does it get at the South Pole that kind of stuff fascinates me

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's fascinating

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole? These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world

425
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Alright let's see Portal Combat in our chat room says I want Portal Song now

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient

427
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hey how does it feel to want?

428
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You've got to wait

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Patience is a virtue

430
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And also because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and you know is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program

431
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know we could have like hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard she didn't know

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So she's very brave to come here

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So once we get past part A and the musical performance we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment

434
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So once the song is performed there will be cake

435
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
From the chat room

436
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Globe Band just says you want song 2 do you know any blur?

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know maybe I can do it I can wing it

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now you actually do other songs besides just video game stuff right?

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Portal was just a whim one of my friends was like hey you should try doing the Still Alive song

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then I looked up the chords and like tapped it out and I was like wow this is really easy

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I had a digital camera and I'm like hey I can put my YouTube account to use

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And now it has like 31,000 views

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Isn't it crazy how the internet works?

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Nice well congratulations that's pretty awesome to see you know somebody literally out of their bedroom

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean that's I think that's why we wanted to reach out and like get you in

447
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
My room is such a mess

448
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No because literally where did this show start out of our you know my spare bedroom

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And Loki and I lived together for a little while we were doing the show out of our living room

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So you know it's just with I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
People can see my like drums from rock band behind me and then like the mess on my floor

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They can see my posters

453
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well next time you need to cl- and somebody here in the Justin TV chat

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Somebody was I don't know being a troll and said something about who decorated this place

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
An 11 year old girl so you know people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on

456
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So because I'm so sure an 11 year old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket

457
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I would have when I was 11

458
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh maybe

459
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
When I was 11 I think I had gremlins

460
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Alright let's I think I had Legos

461
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Alright let's get to the gaming news and then we can I promise we will get to the portal song

462
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But we got it we got to tease it a little bit and get to get some news out of the way first

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Also just want to give some quick plugs if you don't know already we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We have a MySpace MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and a Facebook community is there too

465
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you search for the OL army is our Facebook community too so social networking whores that's us

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So check us out on those different websites

467
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's that let's get to the gaming news Loki

468
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Alright well as we talked about last week there's rumors going around that the 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 system is being phased out

469
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And of course we know that's true with Best Buy and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Well now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
SKU that's going to have a 120 to 160 gigabyte hard drive

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
All for the same price point of $499

474
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And if you think about it that makes perfect sense seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways

475
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Right around the corner

476
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And you know it's kind of funny how we laughed before like you know back when Kuteragi was talking about

477
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh yeah it's going to be like a PC we're going to upgrade it you know all the time you know it's going to be constantly changing

478
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And we're like ah that's stupid you're an idiot and sure enough they keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing

479
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So like you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3

480
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their chips to the hard drive

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They're future proofing it okay someday there will be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
When home finally comes out it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run

484
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's right

485
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're going to need room for all that SingStar

486
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In 2010 when home finally comes out you're going to need that you know 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then

487
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah who's going to say

488
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes

489
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I can't

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes

493
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes

494
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's Studio 54 all over again

495
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Have you not done your homework Loki the internet is for porn

496
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And for piracy

497
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well you can piracy

498
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Pirate porn

499
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Pirate porn

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hey

501
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There is a porn called pirates

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There is a porn called pirates it was the highest produced like most expensive porn ever made

503
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
One of our lesbians has it

504
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Hold on hold on

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've seen it it's actually pretty well produced

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity but she's a connoisseur of porn

507
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Apparently as well

508
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Hope to god my mom isn't watching this

509
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I know I was like your mom's not watching tonight right

510
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Hi mom

511
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just kidding

512
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We're wacky internet people

513
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Alright we tell jokes

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Anyhow

515
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Anything else you want to say about the Playstation

516
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
About the Playstation 3

517
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Stop making new skews it's confusing

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And all you're going to just convince people is well if I wait longer it'll be better

519
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You know that's

520
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What are they going to get stuck doing

521
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Seriously

522
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And how much you want to bet this new skew is just not going to have backwards compatibility what so ever on it

523
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Just like the 40

524
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yep just like the 40

525
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They're just going to screw everybody

526
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh well

527
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game too

528
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Probably layer since it doesn't sell

529
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That would make sense

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Awesome

531
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Hooray

532
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's see and son of dad says in chat.orangelschatter.com

533
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Playstation 3 one year five skews no fucking games

534
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey there's Uncharted

535
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Orko says porn is greater than cake

536
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't know cake is pretty good

537
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Of course that brings Isu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well actually it was funny while I was half asleep this morning

539
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Cause I was supposed to be awake for breakfast but I wasn't

540
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing burnout paradise

541
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
About the difference between going online on the xbox 360

542
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
As opposed to going online on the Playstation 3

543
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
How with xbox 360 it's just part of the experience

544
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's there everybody is there

545
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But with he was talking about going online with SOCOM

546
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And saying how it was like you know filing your taxes

547
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it

548
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So if you're going to be an online player then having a PS3 isn't worth it

549
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You know sometimes friend codes don't look so bad

550
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
When you put all that in comparison

551
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I mean it's like you know I don't know

552
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
One thing that the Playstation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for

553
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

554
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Of course you remember that whole controversy

555
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
With you know there was OMG Sex was unlockable

556
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Speaking of porn was unlockable within the game

557
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And you know it was a whole hot coffee mess

558
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Well if you may remember when we last left off

559
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There was a settlement that was going to happen

560
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Where you could actually replace your game

561
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And you could get some sort of you know severance

562
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
For you know the horrific images that were displayed in your home unknowingly

563
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Because you didn't have to hack the fucking game to get them or whatever

564
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But anyhow if you want to know some details

565
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Take-Two has recently released the details on their website

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Now here's the thing

567
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The settlement will offer different levels of compensation

568
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Depending on your proof that a violated you know buyer may have to offer

569
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So if you have an original copy of the game

570
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You can get of course the replacement disc

571
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If you have the receipt with it

572
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You can get a $35 cash payment

573
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
As part of the settlement

574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And if you have a credit card statement or check

575
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You get $17.50

576
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
If you get a disc, no receipt, $10

577
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
If you have no receipt and no game

578
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You can earn $5

579
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Sweet

580
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So here you go

581
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury

583
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'll do it

584
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That you purchased the game and you played the offending game

585
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And you know it hurt you

586
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It raped your fragile mind

587
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't know

588
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You got to just swear that the game you know did things to your mind

589
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You were not prepared for

590
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Some people enjoy that

591
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean I don't know if it's worth it

593
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That is lunch at McDonald's for a day

594
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
$5 will totally get me a teriyaki

595
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Exactly

596
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Lunch on Take-Two everybody

597
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Lunch on Take-Two this week

598
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Enjoy

599
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And hopefully

600
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That would totally buy me some hot coffee

601
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You know

602
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You know that $5 that you can get from

603
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

604
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because it warped your freaking mind

605
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto IV

606
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
When it comes out

607
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Exactly

608
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It pays for your pre-order

609
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Exactly

610
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Exactly

611
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store

612
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
To try and stake your claim to this

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Because you know once you get the $5

614
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You're going to say

615
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You need to pre-order the new game

616
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Right

617
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
No I'm just kidding

618
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Alright

619
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let's move on with some more gaming

620
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal

621
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
No it won't be

622
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Never

623
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So in Gran Turismo

624
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
There's a hot coffee

625
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No

626
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But speaking of Gran Turismo

627
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
There's a fun little bit that's out though for $40

628
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Like I wouldn't pay for that

629
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But

630
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue

631
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Has an April 17th release date

632
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And it will have 60 cars

633
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And you will get like

634
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Nissan

635
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And Ferraris

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And Audis

637
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Like you'd want an Audi

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And different levels

639
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I believe there's 5 tracks

640
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And you can either download it

641
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Or pay for the disc

642
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And with the disc you get a special video

643
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Awesome

644
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You know what that means

645
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That means that you can buy a half done game

646
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
For $30 or $40

647
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then guess what

648
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You can wait for the full game to come out

649
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And then pay another $60

650
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because you're a whore

651
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But wait wait wait

652
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You get a half done game now

653
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And then you get a 90% done game later

654
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And then they'll put out like special edition

655
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's completely finished

656
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
They'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue the sequel

657
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Which will be like almost done

658
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We're swear we're almost done with the game

659
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This is 60% done now

660
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Loki you put it so eloquently

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You just have a way with words

662
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You know that right

663
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I know

664
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I was going to say

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
This is a lot of crap

666
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
For a game that's not really done

667
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's not that great anyways

669
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Wait wait

670
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Even if people are going to do it

671
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They're going to be like

672
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh my god I have to have it

673
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm a consumer whore

674
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And get it

675
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Or just wait for the full game to come out

676
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
People don't know how to be patient

677
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah I guess I can't really talk about patience

678
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No mister

679
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Do you have any wheeze now

680
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
More news please

682
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes please

683
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I agree

684
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We need to get to the Portal song

685
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Sooner round later

686
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because that means less talking from us

687
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Sorry

688
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I actually meant

689
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay now this story

690
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I meant to get something

691
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To actually test this out on the show

692
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But I was too lazy to stop by

693
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Anyways

694
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Firmware 3.9 has come out

695
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl

696
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Too lazy

697
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So I was basically

698
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Because that's going to stop at GameStop

699
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And get a headset for my PSP

700
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So I can talk on Skype

701
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So we can test it during the show

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I figured

703
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No that'd be dumb

704
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And I don't want to waste $20 on a headset

705
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'll never use Skype

706
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I apologize for ever asking about the story

707
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's really hard to find that

708
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Anyways

709
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So

710
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP

711
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And it does feature Skype

712
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
If you have the PSP Slim

713
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And two days later it was cracked

714
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And is now available for everybody else like me

715
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So hooray

716
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Way to go Sony

717
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Keeping up with that security

718
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Now does the crack still work off some type of exploit

719
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Or how exactly does that work

720
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They basically decrypt the

721
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The whole firmware

722
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And then they just modify it so you can

723
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Install it on your PSP

724
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
With homebrew support and other stuff like that

725
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So one more time just to recap

726
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The new PSP firmware came out this week

727
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And was promptly cracked two days later

728
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Alright

729
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I always feel like every time

730
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We have a story about the firmware getting cracked

731
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You know Sony comes out and says

732
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Nobody's ever going to crack this

733
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This is the full proof firmware

734
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We've closed the loophole

735
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
No one's ever going to crack it

736
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And then two days later

737
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It gets even better

738
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I don't think this made the show roll

739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But they're finding a way now to

740
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Inject the 1.5 firmware

741
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Homebrew capability into the slim PSPs now

742
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Inject the 1.5 firmware

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You make it sound so hot

744
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Well because you can't run

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
There are certain parts of 1.5

746
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That won't run on a slim PSP

747
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But now they're figuring out how to do that

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It'll never work

749
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There's never going to be a point where

750
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
They're super secure

751
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Alright

752
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Well if you're looking for more things

753
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
To use your PSP for

754
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Pretty soon FLOW

755
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Is going to be coming out on the PSP

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You might know this game as the screensaver that you play

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This originally came out on the PlayStation Network of course

758
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And it will soon be coming out to the PSP

759
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This is according to computer and video games

760
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The PSP version probably won't be changed much

761
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
From the original PlayStation 3 version

762
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm trying to think

763
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
How exactly do you mess with FLOW

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Do you give the game a plot?

765
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Or like an objective?

766
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Eat stuff, become bigger, evolve

767
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's right I forgot

768
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The instructions that the game gives you

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Eat stuff

770
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
There you go

771
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Alrighty

772
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Well let's see what else is coming out soon

773
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
From around the world

774
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We're going to take a minute to travel the globe

775
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000

Yeah Rob

818
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Because when you see them about to take it you beat them with the clubs

819
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I see

820
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's it

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000

Turok that's on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC

827
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Assassin's Creed Altera's Chronicles on the DS

Cold Asept Saga on Xbox 360

830
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm actually excited about this game I'm one of those cultist Cold Asept fans for some reason

831
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I played the Xbox 360 demo it's awesome

832
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Wow that sounded like exciting

833
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah my phone was even excited it just went off

834
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Twisted Metal Head On Extra Twisted Edition for PlayStation 2

Space Force Captains on PC

836
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Downstream Panic on the PSP which is kind of like a rip off of LocoRoco when you look at it

837
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore coming out on 360 Wii and PlayStation 2

838
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Not touching that game

839
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I thought it was awful

840
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Nobunaga's Ambition Rise to Power on PlayStation 2

841
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The Spider-Man Chronicles on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PC and the DS

842
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I think that's also coming out on the Wii at the same time too

843
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000

844

Medieval 2 Total War the Gold Pack

847
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And one other thing we weren't sure if it was coming out but that Cobalt Blue and Black DS

848
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Finally confirmed to be coming out on the 10th now

849
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Because you didn't know that three weeks ago

850
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No you didn't know that three weeks ago

851
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And to kind of go along with that Professor Layton and the Curious Village on the DS

852
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Which is hot shit right now in Japan

853
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But I don't know what the draw is but great

854
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And then Puppy Palace on DS

855
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Because there's just not enough puppy raising sims my god

856
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And what other fun stuff here

857
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm sorry I had to read

858
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Merv Griffin's Crosswords on the PC

859
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wow that's

860
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Isn't that like a game show now or something?

861
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I guess

862
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Right

863
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why do they have them hosting anything that's just weird

864
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Well Merv Griffin is kind of dead so he can't host much right now

865
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Grrr strong words

866
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Zombie Cross word

867
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well I don't know they can be like a computer reanimation

868
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden

869
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Wow I don't think Merv Griffin died that long this might be in the To Soon category

870
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So we need to be careful

871
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing

872
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay

873
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Okay

874
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
okay sure exactly

875
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
Dick Clark should be dead and worse is justice

876
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,400
can't you tell his contract with the devil already ran war out?

877
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,440
you know I think no here's what it is

878
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,360
Dick Clark is seriously the inspiration for that movie Final Destination

simple series games

901
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,200

shovel at this point

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,200

anyways

949
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,480
I have news related news

950
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,480
it's very special because EA is obviously very special in special by

951
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,440
ending short best

952
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,200
EA is going to be splitting the components

953
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,000
of the orange box dunder done so

954
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,800
there will be a PC and xbox 360 released in October

955
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,120
a ps3 release afterwards that will be just a separate half-life

956
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,680
episode to you and portal and a separate team fortress

957
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,960
and and they've already been there for download for a while but there's going

958
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,880
to be individual box copies on the way

959
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,640
and I hope they're cheap because I mean if you can buy

960
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,760
you know the orange box new for 60 bucks and it's

961
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,840
all this stuff they should make these like no more than 1520 bucks apiece

962
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,920
probably 20 and no one will buy like

963
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,960
episode to everyone else but portal

964
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,520
yeah portal and team fortress to yeah I don't know see

965
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,880
when and we got my copy and see all I cared about was portal at the time that

966
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,960
Dan really really got into

967
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,600
half-life and to episode to you he was all over that

968
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,720
hi

969
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,320

he had a major we that's right ahead I had a major we brew and I had a

971
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,360
cuz I didn't wanna miss our performance I ran out during the last story there

972
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,120
so now that you share that with the entire internet can we move on with

973
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,400

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,320
another gaming story please we are not over there I know this is gonna come as a

975
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,120

00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,560
making more portal games way

977
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,360
that's so surprising I'm

978
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,320
yeah apparently portal was kinda successful so they

979
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,880
decided hey let's make some more but they don't want just turn out more

980
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,800
levels and I think actually wanna have a

981
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,360
story to go along with it so they're working on it but

982
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,280
anytime soon just make more downloadable levels that be fun

983
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,020
so let's see a highly successful critically loved game is going to be

984
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,800

1018
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,840
here she is so are you about ready for this I gotta I'm gonna have to situate a

1019
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,120
little differently cuz we're ghetto we don't have a lot of hookups there so I'm

1020
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,680
just gonna kinda sit by you here

1021
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,120
and now while you do this so and I'm gonna ask you guys to turn your mics off

1022
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,840
so we don't get a lot of background noise in here

1023
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,920
but this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig

1024
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,160
our first musical guest rage but it's gonna be awesome

1025
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,960
right it's gonna be only slightly I hope it'll be above average we know that

1026
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,560
no it's gonna be great be better than it's gonna be better by listening to us

1027
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,000
saying that's for sure alright

1028
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,200
so alright so enough chatter let's take

1029
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,360
let's have a mo take it away here here she is live on now orange lounge radio

1030
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,360
with Jonathan Colton's still alive

1031
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,360
this was a triumph

1032
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,360
I'm making a no-tear huge success

1033
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:49,360
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction

1034
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,360
Aperture Science

1035
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,360
we do what we must because we can

1036
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:04,360
for the good in all of us except the ones who are dead

1037
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,360
but there's no sense crying over every mistake

1038
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,360
you just keep on trying till you run out of cake

1039
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,360
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun

1040
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:24,360
for the people who are still alive

1041
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,360
I'm not even angry

1042
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,360
I'm being so sincere right now

1043
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:43,360
even though you broke my heart and killed me

1044
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,360
and tore me to pieces

1045
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,360
and threw every piece into a fire

1046
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:00,360
as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you

1047
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,360
now these points of data make a beautiful line

1048
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,360
and we're out of beta we're releasing on time

1049
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,360
so I'm glad I got burned think of all the things we learned

1050
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,360
for the people who are still alive

1051
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:26,360
go ahead and leave me

1052
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:33,360
I think I'd prefer to stay inside

1053
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,360
maybe you'll find someone else to help you

1054
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:47,360
maybe Black Mesa

1055
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,360
that was a joke, haha, fat chance

1056
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:59,360
anyway this cake is great it's so delicious and moist

1057
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,360
look at me still talking when there's science to do

1058
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,360
when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you

1059
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,360
I've experiments to run there is research to be done

1060
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,360
on the people who are still alive

1061
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,360
and believe me I am still alive

1062
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,360
I'm doing science and I'm still alive

1063
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,360
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive

1064
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,360
while you're dying I'll be still alive

1065
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,360
and when you're dead I will be still alive

1066
00:49:39,360 --> 00:50:07,360
still alive

1067
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,360
and there will be cake and it's not alive

1068
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,360
we have some clapping in the chat room

1069
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,360
Hitstun says it would win a cage match

1070
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,360
our little musical thing we do after the show

1071
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,360
or they pick good songs so very nice

1072
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,360
so now you're going to have to learn something else and come back

1073
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,360
again sometime

1074
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,360
yes I happen to watch another one of her YouTubes

1075
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,360
which I laughed at because

1076
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,360
she did Rick Ashley's Never Gonna Give You Up

1077
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,360
everyone's calling it a chick role that's the best part

1078
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,360
they're calling it a chick role

1079
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
it was awesome

1080
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
awesome

1081
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,360
you found it through the chick role?

1082
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,360
alright

1083
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
so lots and lots of clapping there in chat

1084
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,360
and thank you very much for being a guinea pig

1085
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,360
being our very first musical guest that went pretty well

1086
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
except for the fact I kind of had to hold that

1087
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,360
and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part

1088
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,360
I kept smacking the mic and I'm like oh gosh

1089
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,360
no but it came out really good so very exciting

1090
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,360
alright we'll stop talking about the technical fuck ups now

1091
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,360
and get back to the gaming news

1092
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360
yes anyways

1093
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360
oh wait no it's my turn isn't it sorry

1094
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
yeah Rob

1095
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,360
well if you want to be a guitar hero in the comfort of your own home

1096
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,360
apparently four more guitar hero games are making their way this year

1097
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,360
now that's not real guitar like the kind that Moe plays

1098
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,360
but that's you know a fake five button guitar

1099
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,360
but it might still get you you know boyfriends, girlfriends

1100
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,360
and you know hot dates and all that good stuff

1101
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
guitar hero Aaron the Ellen show

1102
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,360
yeah it could get you on the Ellen show

1103
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,360
guitar hero Aerosmith is supposedly going to be coming out in July

1104
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,360
and of course guitar hero four in October

1105
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,360
guitar hero on tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS

1106
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,360
that's going to make its way in June

1107
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,360
and supposedly there is a fourth title being planned

1108
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,360
it's an action packed guitar hero experience like no other

1109
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,360
so apparently it's some other type of guitar hero game

1110
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,360
in other words it's basically taking a lovely, well established, loved franchise

1111
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,360
and pooping on it with this game

1112
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,360
well if there's four games in one year that's already pooping on it I think

1113
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,360
I mean seriously

1114
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:17,360
by the way those rumors are coming from surfer girl via gonintendo.com

1115
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,360
and surfer girl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff so

1116
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,360
not surprised

1117
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,360
I'm not surprised about the three of them

1118
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
and that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July

1119
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,360
since that's when Rock the 80s came out this last year

1120
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
oh, Rock the 80s

1121
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,360
and I don't know they need to do something like remember Fret and Ice

1122
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,360
they could do something like that action packed guitar game

1123
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,360
you know just where you actually do a side scrolling game

1124
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,360
but I think this is going to suck whatever it is I'm sure

1125
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,360
I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them

1126
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,360
it sucked

1127
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,360
that's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer

1128
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,360
I'm sorry but if you release four games

1129
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,360
like okay

1130
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,360
DDR for example

1131
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,360
when you have three different games coming out in the same year

1132
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,360
they just don't get the same amount of focus on each one

1133
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
it's just

1134
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,360
I don't know release one really good game except four really mediocre games

1135
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,360
have you ever heard of the saying too much of a good thing

1136
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,360
yeah exactly

1137
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,360
Gerardimo asks in chat is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now

1138
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,360
because the whole Activision Blizzard thing

1139
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,360
you know rock out to your torn shaman and all that stuff

1140
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,360
do we get hoochie dancing night elves and head banging undead

1141
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
you might see some of that stuff

1142
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,360
but here's the thing

1143
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,360
I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version

1144
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,360
I'm sure you'll see something like that in there

1145
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,360
because they like doing weird crossover things

1146
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
you never know

1147
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,360
look if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3

1148
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,360
anything is possible

1149
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,360
I'm very disappointed I've not seen anything like that for Rock Band

1150
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
I want some free songs I understand the three songs a week

1151
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,360
or Journey

1152
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,360
or Journey

1153
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,360
they need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords the Underworld

1154
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,360
just isn't enough

1155
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,360
there needs to be more gag music in there

1156
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,360
we need more lols in our Rock Band

1157
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,360
we need Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend on there

1158
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,360
I would own on that

1159
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,360
like chocolate rain the heavy metal mix or something like that

1160
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360
yes

1161
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,360
hey they managed to put freeze pop

1162
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,360
drop it at me

1163
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,360
well you know what Mo maybe should write them and get Still Alive in there

1164
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,360
we need more stuff from the kind of long haired band

1165
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,360
see now Still Alive

1166
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Spinal Tap

1167
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Spinal Tap

1168
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,360
I was going to say Still Alive could make it into Rock Band

1169
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
since EA publishes both games

1170
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
so maybe

1171
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
interesting EA are you listening

1172
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,360
I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song

1173
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,360
although I mean there's maps and something

1174
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
they've got plenty of mellow stuff in there

1175
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,360
well part of my iron lung is mellow

1176
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
we need more Radiohead

1177
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,360
and the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain Loki

1178
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
so here you go a little kick

1179
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,360
Chocolate Rain is great

1180
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
it's amazing

1181
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,360
that guy's voice is just intense

1182
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,360
intense is a good way to describe it

1183
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,360
let's move on with some more news

1184
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
well

1185
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,360
for our Sega fans there is a

1186
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,360
PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege

1187
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,360
that is an action RPG with different types of gameplay

1188
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
we have a robotic partner that you can customize

1189
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,360
and you have online co-op

1190
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,360
up to four people

1191
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,360
but they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release too

1192
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,360
excuse me

1193
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,360
they're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release

1194
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,360
they are considering it as an option

1195
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,360
and I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that it's actually going to be

1196
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,360
they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself

1197
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,360
that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible

1198
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,360
so

1199
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,360
the PC releases in September

1200
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,360
so wait it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years hopefully?

1201
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
I hope so

1202
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Sega needs to really redeem themselves

1203
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,360
or they need to bring out Planet Harrier

1204
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,360
we don't have very good hopes for this actually

1205
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,360
if I remember correctly Space Siege is actually

1206
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,360
a new series in the Dungeon Siege

1207
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,360
so basically you know like a dungeon crawler but now it's a space crawler I guess

1208
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,360
and

1209
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,360
you know

1210
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,360
no offense I mean I'm sure Dungeon Siege is awesome

1211
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,360
it's just we will ruin that for me

1212
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
I'm sorry

1213
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,360
I think of that and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO

1214
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,360
because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King and he'll be in space

1215
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,360
and that's you know have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever

1216
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,360
you know what I've had this very strange urge to play this week Dark Sakura?

1217
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
what?

1218
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
Fastestar universe

1219
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,360
no

1220
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
I don't know why

1221
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,360
Ethan Waber's calling to you

1222
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,360
yes that's what it is I missed the two handed thing

1223
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,360
guy with the swords was awesome

1224
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,360
you know my friend Julie

1225
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,360
cost me 19

1226
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
got it

1227
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,360
and she's like oh my god every time she's always on PSU

1228
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
and see we were actually having a discussion on this the other day

1229
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,360
and she's saying that they're bringing in the old PSO maps

1230
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
and everything

1231
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,360
and I was like that could almost get me to play

1232
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,360
I still have my copy

1233
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,360
that could almost get me to play except I still hate how they do forces

1234
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,360
that will get me to play I think

1235
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
that's kind of cool

1236
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,360
she says that all of, in fact some of the areas are already available

1237
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,360
but they're also bringing back all the old enemies too

1238
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,360
wow

1239
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,360
so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem was with the universe itself

1240
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,360
as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled

1241
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,360
I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played

1242
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,360
she said they brought back mags

1243
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,360
that's hot I love mags

1244
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,360
I miss my Master System mag

1245
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,360
alright we got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show

1246
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:03,360
so I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice challenge that was on the Xbox 360

1247
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,360
I think last year

1248
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,360
where you could earn such wonderful games as Contra and

1249
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
oh guess what?

1250
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,360
Fusion Frenzy 2

1251
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,360
which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment

1252
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
punishment

1253
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
anyways

1254
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,360
so you can win some new stuff this time

1255
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,360
although it's a little bit different this time around

1256
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,360
instead of actually competing just against a set number

1257
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,360
you're competing against your friends

1258
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,360
and you can win such things as say

1259
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,360
a $20 Best Buy gift card

1260
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
an Xbox 360 HD DVD player

1261
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,360
since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of win in there

1262
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,360
and some other stuff

1263
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,360
maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again who knows

1264
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
but

1265
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,360
yeah so if you're interested in that they've actually got some more information on

1266
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,360
360voice.com

1267
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
slash challenges

1268
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,360
you can check it out

1269
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,360
a bunch of different things you can win

1270
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,360
I don't know

1271
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,360
I just have a

1272
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
I really don't care

1273
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,360
I'm kind of done with the whole like EP and achievement points thing

1274
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
it's kind of done

1275
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,360
you know I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so

1276
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,360
sadly high it's just never

1277
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360
you're never going to catch up so I don't know

1278
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,360
I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing

1279
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360
it's a little old to me

1280
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,360
I mean I guess they're still interesting in a way

1281
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,360
I guess like virtual trophies or whatever

1282
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
but I don't know about these contests

1283
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,360
unless they start putting some cold hard cash on the line

1284
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360
yeah it doesn't look like they are

1285
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,360
I mean you can basically pick one of these different contests they're going on

1286
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,360
you pick one you want to enter in

1287
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,360
and then you basically compete and see how fast you can

1288
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,360
you know grow your gamer score I guess

1289
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,360
and they've got you know a bunch of different weird things

1290
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,360
like you can win you know 1600 point cards

1291
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
50 of our best buy cards

1292
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,360
Big Mac challenge

1293
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,360
I don't know maybe you win some Big Macs or something

1294
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
clearance copies of Sneak King I don't know

1295
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,360
anyhow

1296
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,360
some games may be coming out very soon

1297
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,360
for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more

1298
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,360
because Lord knows you achievement point whores love

1299
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,360
more arcade games to inflate your score

1300
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,360
but these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all

1301
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,360
apparently Microsoft's press FTP site

1302
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,360
was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there

1303
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,360
because they've released these screenshots of

1304
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Conquer Live and Reloaded

1305
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,360
and Jade Empire

1306
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,360
those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site

1307
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,360
it indicates that the games could be coming to

1308
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,360
Xbox Live Marketplace very soon

1309
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,360
so there you have it there

1310
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:41,360
now of course they're going to be added to the Xbox original line up

1311
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,360
so come to think of it

1312
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,360
I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points

1313
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,360
because you can't use the original games for that

1314
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,360
I'm not interested until they put like Jet Set Radio Future on there or something like that

1315
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,360
so if it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live originals

1316
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,360
1200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games

1317
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,360
but I hear

1318
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,360
or buy it used for probably even cheaper than that

1319
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,360
I hear especially with Jade Empire

1320
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,360
those games are ones that people love

1321
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,360
so there you have it

1322
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,360
looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for

1323
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,360
what's that

1324
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,360
to the big game

1325
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,360
oh what game

1326
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
the Puppy Bowl corgi one

1327
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,360
oh yes

1328
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
go team corgi

1329
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,360
good job

1330
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,360
seriously okay all these DS pet raising sims and no Puppy Bowl games

1331
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
I mean come on

1332
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,360
they totally need the Puppy Bowl

1333
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,360
which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season

1334
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,360
once again sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house

1335
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,360
but apparently

1336
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,360
corgis are great and they're smart

1337
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,360
alright forget it

1338
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
with their little mutated feet

1339
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,360
I love their little feet

1340
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,360
I've been telling my husband I want a corgi

1341
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
and he's like no you have a cat

1342
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,360
see proof that inbreeding can be awesome

1343
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,360
well they have cats out yet too

1344
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,360
no but they're so horrible

1345
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
they feel so bad for them

1346
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,360
do you love video games

1347
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,360
hey

1348
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,360
listen to Orange Lounge Radio

1349
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,360
we talk about video games non-stop

1350
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
you know who should have won Puppy Bowl

1351
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,360
this is the Puppy and Kitty tangent

1352
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,360
hey guess what Rob more Xbox Live

1353
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,360
what

1354
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,360
ceiling cat is watching you deviate from the video game stories

1355
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,360
haha

1356
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
uh

1357
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,360
uh yeah

1358
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,360
anyway

1359
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:15,360
um game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations

1360
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,360
as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases

1361
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,360
is Poker Smash

1362
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,360
which is um like I guess Tetris with poker things

1363
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,360
Poker Smash

1364
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,360
I don't know it makes me kind of think of columns

1365
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,360
columns

1366
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,360
columns

1367
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,360
columns gave me an aneurysm

1368
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,360
Poker Smash

1369
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,360
kind of makes me think of I'm not buying it

1370
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,360
haha

1371
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,360
you know you're gonna get it for Nellie

1372
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,360
no I'm not

1373
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,360
you know Nellie's gonna get it behind your back

1374
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
for points

1375
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,360
she won't buy that game she's like I don't care

1376
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,360
haha

1377
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,360
I was teasing

1378
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,360
no if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360

1379
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,360
Nellie's gonna come in and go Xbox Smash

1380
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,360
that's ok he'll rebuild it

1381
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,360
yeah

1382
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,360
it actually looks kind of cool

1383
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,360
I'll make it work better

1384
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
and if it doesn't work better that means I need more

1385
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
it'll be the bionic 360

1386
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
haha

1387
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,360
it actually looks kind of cool

1388
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,360
but honestly I just will play Puyo Puyo

1389
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,360
see she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in

1390
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
she doesn't know how to play poker and that's

1391
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,360
I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever

1392
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,360
but that will stop her from playing that game

1393
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,360
ok

1394
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,360
alright moving on

1395
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,360
so there's actually been a little issues with

1396
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,360
you know Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

1397
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,360
you know and you might think at first it's because the name's too long

1398
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
but you'd be wrong

1399
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,360
it's actually because the game's too big

1400
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:46,360
and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade

1401
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,360
well of course you know those 1080p visuals are you know really big

1402
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:58,360
and so they're having trouble you know fitting it in such a small size constraint there

1403
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,360
oh darn

1404
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,360
you know what it doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo

1405
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,360
and slightly better

1406
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,360
there may just not be enough room for Cammie's ass

1407
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
they might just have to cut it out

1408
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,360
I'm sorry to say

1409
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,360
that would be Chinle's thighs

1410
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,360
or how about I don't know let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway

1411
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,360
since most everyone has a hard drive

1412
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,360
and if you don't have a hard drive you don't get to play fucking arcade games

1413
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,360
there you go

1414
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
or how about just get rid of Balrog

1415
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,360
I mean did anyone actually play Balrog?

1416
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,360
anybody?

1417
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,360
actually?

1418
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,360
Tyson played Balrog

1419
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,360
I don't think anyone did

1420
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,360
I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it

1421
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,360
so I have to think about who you're talking about

1422
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
M. Bison, the boxer

1423
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,360
yeah

1424
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,360
actually he was pretty cool but I like Dudley better in 3

1425
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,360
alright anyhow

1426
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,360
guess what time it is folks

1427
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:51,360
you know the party is almost over

1428
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,360
and we're going to get to the classic game of the week

1429
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,360
but we haven't done this in a little while

1430
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,360
there hasn't been a story that has really coaxed us in this way

1431
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,360
to give out another one of these

1432
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,360
let me think of this last week

1433
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,360
we're giving out a stupid award tonight

1434
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,360
no last week we talked about this guy

1435
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,360
but now the trial is going on

1436
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,360
and so this is why this guy is going to win

1437
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,360
a stupid award tonight

1438
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,360
it's Tyrone Spellman is his name

1439
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,360
and apparently he killed a baby

1440
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,360
and what cost him to kill a baby?

1441
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,360
well video games of course

1442
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,360
if Aaliyah Truman

1443
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,360
the assistant district attorney

1444
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,360
is to be believed

1445
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
he said that

1446
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,360
Spellman's entire life and daily routine

1447
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,360
is about playing Ghost Recon

1448
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,360
what do you think someone with that kind of obsession

1449
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,360
is going to do when it gets knocked over?

1450
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
what do you think is going to happen?

1451
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,360
the skull fractures on that baby or what happened?

1452
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,360
so in other words

1453
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,360
I know that's horrible first off

1454
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,360
I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation

1455
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,360
but what I think is so stupid about this

1456
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,360
is that

1457
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,360
yeah video games cost him to do it

1458
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,360
no I think severe mental instability

1459
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,360
of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it

1460
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,360
like obviously he was not playing

1461
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,360
with a full set of chips in his head

1462
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
so

1463
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,360
that's why we're giving out a stupid award

1464
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,360
not only to the assistant district attorney

1465
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,360
who's trying to jump to this conclusion

1466
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,360
but the guy for killing a baby in the first place

1467
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,360
I mean that's kind of stupid

1468
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,360
like don't kill babies

1469
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,360
I mean isn't it like

1470
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,360
it doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up

1471
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,360
like if he had a six pack in his head

1472
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,360
it'd actually be empty except for one flat half drunk bottle

1473
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,360
like do you even really need to be taught that growing up?

1474
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,360
like do your parents really need to teach you like

1475
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,360
hey don't kill babies

1476
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360
ever

1477
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
I don't think so

1478
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,360
I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in

1479
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
you know what I mean?

1480
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,360
problem is he wasn't playing mad

1481
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,360
shut up

1482
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,360
alright

1483
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,360
anyhow before we go to the break

1484
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,360
it's time to respect our elders a little bit

1485
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,360
by paying tribute to the classic game of the week

1486
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:14,360
Dark Sakura what is the classic video game of the week this week

1487
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,360
that all the boys and girls should be playing out there

1488
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,360
it's pure and utter awesomeness

1489
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,360
it's Outrun

1490
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,360
I love Outrun

1491
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,360
Outrun is a game where you just drive a car

1492
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,360
you make it sound so thrilling

1493
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,360
well you've got a convertible and it's the guy and his blonde lady

1494
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,360
just driving along and passing other drivers

1495
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,360
but you get different forks in the path

1496
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
different ways that you can take

1497
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,360
and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen

1498
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,360
or a 1971 Corvette

1499
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
a 1985 Porsche 911

1500
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,360
or a 1985 BMW

1501
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,360
which I thought was pretty cool

1502
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,360
but the whole I think fun part about it was that

1503
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,360
it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car

1504
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:05,360
and it had great music in it

1505
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,360
I mean like what you're hearing right now

1506
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,360
is the one I picked was Magical Sound Shower

1507
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,360
which is like the best music in the game ever

1508
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,360
I also named one of my horses a derby owner's club after it

1509
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:21,360
it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier

1510
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,360
and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D

1511
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,360
where at the time 3D was just sort of like

1512
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:33,360
what? we can do that? because they couldn't yet

1513
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,360
so this I think is actually one of the games that opened up

1514
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,360
a lot of the market for the

1515
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,360
you know like we had our mode 7 games on the Super Nintendo

1516
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,360
but I mean this was actually

1517
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,360
I had this on Master System

1518
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
wow that's pretty hardcore

1519
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,360
yeah it's a pretty good game

1520
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,360
were you able to actually play this on Master System?

1521
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,360
yeah it's on Master System

1522
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,360
interesting

1523
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,360
it was very weird on Master System

1524
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,360
and I do believe if I'm right there was

1525
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,360
you know we got Afterburner and Space Harrier on the 32X

1526
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,360
but in Japan there was a 32X release of this

1527
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,360
that was pretty much arcade

1528
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:11,360
I mean with this and Afterburner and Space Harrier

1529
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,360
these were the arcade releases on the 32X

1530
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,360
in fact you could even change some of them into arcade mode

1531
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,360
but I think the other big part of this was just that

1532
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,360
with the combination of

1533
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,360
you know getting your choice of paths

1534
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,360
or getting the music that you got

1535
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,360
because you could actually change your music channel

1536
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,360
and a lot of racing games now have that sort of option

1537
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,360
for the music that you listen to as you play

1538
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,360
and for the Genesis version

1539
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,360
I actually had an extra bit of music in it too

1540
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,360
but one that I liked

1541
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,360
we had the arcade that I used to work at in Alabama

1542
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:56,360
is Outrunners which was the two player Outrun

1543
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,360
and it had a few differences to it

1544
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,360
also for anyone else who is a big fan of Sega titles

1545
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
Outrun has shown up in a bunch of other games

1546
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,360
we've seen it in Shenmue 2

1547
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,360
you can play it on Dreamcast in Shenmue 2

1548
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,360
there's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance

1549
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,360
the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation

1550
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:24,360
it's actually in Outrun 2 as well

1551
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:30,360
I don't know if anyone has actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out

1552
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,360
but it was included in Arizona with updated versions of the original tracks

1553
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,360
that were in it too

1554
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
so I thought it was pretty cool

1555
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Outrun is one of those classics

1556
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,360
I think that it should be the first

1557
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,360
I'd have to say first racing game I think I've mentioned in the classic games

1558
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,360
also it had an appearance in one of my favorite movies

1559
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
What's that?

1560
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,360
Donnie Darko

1561
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,360
Nice

1562
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,360
Some of the chat room folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision

1563
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,360
Black Lab says Lucky and Wild greater than Outrun

1564
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,360
I do not like that game

1565
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,360
Orko says Lucky and Wild how I heart think

1566
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
I have a bias against Lucky and Wild

1567
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
What's that?

1568
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,360
Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those

1569
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,360
and I had to clean that sucker

1570
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:19,360
Did people do nasty things in Lucky and Wild?

1571
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,360
It was the drive and gun game

1572
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,360
and people would break the gun controller

1573
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,360
or leave their crap all in the thing

1574
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,360
and no, it sucked

1575
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,360
In another game I have a bias against the Suzuka 8-hour

1576
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,360
because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom

1577
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,360
when we had inspection

1578
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,360
I do like hard driving though because I took a nap in one once

1579
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,360
Anything else you want to say about Outrun, Jamie?

1580
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
Outrun is great

1581
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,360
Alright, check it out

1582
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Your classic game of the week boys and girls is Outrun

1583
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,360
Available on the arcades

1584
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,360
Just about every Sega system ever made as well

1585
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,360
So check it out

1586
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,360
And probably the PC as well and hell, some Nintendo systems too

1587
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,360
Outrun 2006 was PC

1588
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,360
There you go

1589
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,360
So check it out

1590
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,360
That's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A

1591
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,360
But we'll be back in just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B

1592
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,360
And tonight boys and girls

1593
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,360
It's been a little while, but we're going to have the match game tonight

1594
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,360
That's right, it's been a little while

1595
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,360
We're going to play some match games tonight

1596
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,360
As long as we have some guests here

1597
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,360
Mo, you're going to stay with us for Part B, right?

1598
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,360
Sure

1599
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,360
Why not hang out with the strangers from the internet a little more?

1600
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,360
It'll be fun

1601
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,360
I'm not dead in a ditch yet

1602
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,360
It doesn't get much stranger than this

1603
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,360
But if you lose match game, Mo

1604
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,360
I might be

1605
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,360
That's it

1606
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,360
And Jake, you're going to play some match games with us too as well, right?

1607
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,360
But the stakes in tonight's match game are very high

1608
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,360
You know why?

1609
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
Because, and it's not for us here in studio

1610
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,360
But for the listeners that will be playing

1611
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,360
We're going to give away something, that's right

1612
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,360
We're giving away a code for ResHD on the Xbox 360

1613
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
As the prize tonight in the match game

1614
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
And that comes to you courtesy of an OLR listener

1615
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,360
Out of the kindness of their heart

1616
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,360
Is donating this prize tonight for the match game

1617
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,360
I'll tell you more about it when we come back for Orange Lounge Radio Part B

1618
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,360
In the meantime, we're going to take a little break

1619
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,360
And we'll see you in a little while

1620
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,360
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

1621
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,360
