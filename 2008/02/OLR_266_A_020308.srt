1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 3rd, 2008, could the PlayStation 3 hard drive be getting even bigger?

2
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,970
[SPEAKER_00]: New Animal Crossing and Kirby games are rumored for release this holiday.

3
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:26,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And did Spore's release get pushed back yet again?

4
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:36,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast on DARE Internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Cuddly DarkSakura.

8
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:50,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

9
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not like her internet persona in real life.

10
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,013
[SPEAKER_04]: She's actually very sweet, right?

11
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add lots of sugar.

12
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,034
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

13
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are you doing, Miss Sakura?

14
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm frustrated with the mailbag.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

16
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:02,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

17
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What did the mailbag do to you?

18
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:04,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being a bitch.

19
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:05,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to hear that.

20
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

21
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

23
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:13,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion.

24
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:16,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's not for... Aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?

25
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:17,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

26
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You can lick it off.

27
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:20,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you can lick it off.

28
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:21,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

29
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:22,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't do that.

30
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:25,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show.

31
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got to say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world because she has no idea who the F we are.

32
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying, Hey, you're pretty cool.

33
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,373
[SPEAKER_04]: You should come be on our program.

34
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's a real good sport.

35
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:39,674
[SPEAKER_04]: She's here tonight.

36
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it up for Mo.

37
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:42,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Interweb.

38
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:43,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I waving?

39
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I waving?

40
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:45,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you waving?

41
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we do have an internet cam over there on JustinTV.

42
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:52,189
[SPEAKER_04]: We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you so we make sure you get picked up on there.

43
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:52,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But how are you?

44
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm nervous, but super.

45
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

46
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you nervous?

47
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:57,991
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing to be nervous about.

48
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't bite.

49
00:01:59,171 --> 00:01:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Much.

50
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:00,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust her.

51
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,272
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even trust our Sakura?

52
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,593
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard stories?

53
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,303
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Interwebs.

55
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,569
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Jake?

56
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:31,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting thrashed by Snake.

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,180
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, awesome.

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not going to be able to use this mic to talk to Jake, or I might smash over poor Moe's guitar, and that wouldn't be good.

59
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:06,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Bros.

60
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl in Z-House.

61
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Bros.

62
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:10,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl.

63
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

64
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:14,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something that we picked up.

65
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:16,356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

66
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:45,518
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:23,621
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was actually very not because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok because it's just, you know, point and click, that type of thing.

68
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:26,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

69
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even play any pinball.

70
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:31,445
[SPEAKER_04]: No pinball?

71
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:32,185
[SPEAKER_01]: No pinball.

72
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:32,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.

73
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:33,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Same reason.

74
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:34,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

75
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sorry to hear about that.

76
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff.

77
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:40,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise, though.

78
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:41,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

79
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,710
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think of what you saw?

80
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:47,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that I really, really, really, really, really, really like crashes.

81
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the super jumps.

82
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:52,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

83
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the really long ones where you get the different angles.

84
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Dukes of Hazzard, yo.

85
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool.

86
00:04:59,355 --> 00:04:59,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

87
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:00,836
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

88
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully you'll be back up and running soon.

89
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:07,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Your middle finger will be back in commission and you can flip people off and all that good stuff.

90
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,241
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night, I wake up in the morning all devil horns.

91
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not all bad.

92
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,412
[SPEAKER_04]: She rolls out of bed ready to rock.

93
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

94
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:21,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if it were more fingers, it'd be too much metal for one hand.

95
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:22,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

96
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

97
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:25,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we'll go over to you.

98
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:26,599
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

99
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Put down the controller.

100
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,460
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was fine.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not trying to do this and play at the same time.

102
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:31,442
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not.

103
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:33,823
[SPEAKER_04]: You can leave it alone for five seconds.

104
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:34,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm not playing it.

105
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat.

106
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were fixing it.

107
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:39,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

108
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:40,744
[SPEAKER_01]: The Red Bulls ones?

109
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:12,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he keeps beating my crashing ones, so I go through and specifically go and beat his.

110
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,091
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not actually doing it on purpose.

111
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

112
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,111
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it.

113
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

114
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:20,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the whole reason he did the road rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs, and that was it, and he wanted the car.

115
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:26,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I understand that, but I have to beat everybody on my friends list, so that's why I've been going through and doing that.

116
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you tell him it's a competition, he will compete.

117
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

118
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:31,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the game.

119
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great, just crashing everything, which kind of gives me...

120
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,440
[SPEAKER_06]: To my other topic here, I had another 360 die.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Three rings.

122
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times.

123
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?

124
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,763
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I had to overheat it quite a few times.

125
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:48,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds hot.

126
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,744
[SPEAKER_06]: This next time, though, it's not going to be pretty.

127
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:55,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about a thousand degrees.

128
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,606
[SPEAKER_06]: It will work or it will melt.

129
00:06:59,226 --> 00:06:59,807
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the two.

130
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:00,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

131
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see, what else did I get?

132
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, I imported another game.

133
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,762
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game called... God, I don't remember what it's called now.

134
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:17,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, while you're thinking about that, for your Xbox 360, you know, Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard.

135
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:19,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week.

136
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like popping randomly in the left speaker.

137
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:24,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed.

138
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker.

139
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral.

140
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360.

141
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:39,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home, put it in a little floaty boat, set it on fire.

142
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not ready to give up on it yet.

143
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:43,278
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was.

145
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Other things I've played other than that, of course, Smash Bros.

146
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:14,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl.

147
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Just started playing a bit of that.

148
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,459
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I'm not very good at it.

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's cool.

150
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really cool game.

151
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:26,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it's probably worth buying twice.

152
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:31,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely check it out if you can as soon as you can.

153
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,112
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually unlocked quite a few players.

154
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

155
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:04,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

156
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,001
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did they play?

157
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:06,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Rez HD.

158
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:08,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, is that awesome.

159
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing that on a surround sound system?

160
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

161
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some good stuff there.

162
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely love that game.

163
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:20,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

164
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:20,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

165
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is the game that I imported for the Game Boy Advance.

166
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,465
[SPEAKER_06]: DotStream is the name of it.

167
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:26,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the bit generation titles.

168
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:27,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You race lines.

169
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:29,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually pretty fun.

170
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheap little titles like 20 bucks.

171
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to show you, Rob, some of it a little bit later.

172
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty much it.

173
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:40,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

174
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week.

175
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:43,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I try.

176
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:47,021
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I want to go to our guest, Mo, and see what Mo's been playing this week.

177
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Mo, you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs.

178
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:52,466
[SPEAKER_04]: You do actually play video games.

179
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,127
[SPEAKER_04]: You work in video games.

180
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a gamer girl, right?

181
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

182
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure are, so don't doubt it.

183
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of games have you been playing this week?

184
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:05,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful and there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things.

185
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV.

186
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:16,480
[SPEAKER_03]: which was very depressing because it looks awesome so far but I'm a really crappy shot.

187
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game.

188
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

189
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:23,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

190
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've been very busy.

191
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:31,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC since somebody's borrowing my 360 copy still.

192
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:31,644
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

193
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:33,464
[SPEAKER_03]: He's better on PC.

194
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:41,786
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC I don't know if I mentioned it before was that

195
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:49,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game, the actual 3D model, because I want to make one.

196
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle.

197
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't gotten around to that yet.

198
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Mo, are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360?

199
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:02,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a PC player.

200
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

201
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You just prefer that?

202
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You think it's more of a keyboard and mouse type game, or are you like, Xbox sucks, or what?

203
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:09,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a 360.

204
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:15,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my 360, but I cannot do shooters on console at all.

205
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:17,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a terrible shot.

206
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot play Halo for the life of me.

207
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:20,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

208
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people.

209
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:24,254
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

210
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:24,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

211
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:40,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot, I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it because goddamn commander or whoever stuck, you know, holding his arms out with a gun in his hand and won't trigger the last scene.

212
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hate that game, at the end at least.

213
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,615
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of the game is awesome, it's just the end fucking sucks.

214
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:50,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

215
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:50,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

216
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:56,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week and then Jake, do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week as soon as I'm done here?

217
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,404
[SPEAKER_04]: He's giving me a pouty face.

218
00:11:59,044 --> 00:11:59,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

219
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:03,328
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was pretty much Rez HD all freaking week.

220
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:04,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Loki.

221
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:08,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Rez HD is a beautiful game, and it's time for Rez to make a little bit of a comeback.

222
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,914
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit fuzzy on the PlayStation 2 and the Dreamcast.

223
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:19,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it was bad, but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful, beautiful HD and the sound system and everything.

224
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gorgeous, and it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever.

225
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,002
[SPEAKER_04]: For real, I just love Rez, and it's a beautiful game, and the graphics are great.

226
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:32,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's only like 10 bucks, so it's a great deal.

227
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:36,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's probably the best Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet, honestly.

228
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally in love with Rez HD.

229
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,708
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

230
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:42,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I've been playing Warcraft still, because I'm a big nerd.

231
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:51,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sassy Pants, my level 70 character, who's awesome, and she now has a sister named Sassy Llama, who is a shaman.

232
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made that, so...

233
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know what that means, check Urban Dictionary.

234
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:56,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

235
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Loki, you've got to give Jake your mic.

236
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake, now you're new to the program, right?

237
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're a gamer too, right?

238
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,453
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not a gamer.

239
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've just been attached to Smash Brothers for all night.

240
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:11,674
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of games do you play?

241
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:12,515
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been playing this week?

242
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Baltimore all week, so I've been playing Rock Band.

243
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of Rock Band.

244
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:22,390
[SPEAKER_05]: and more Rock Band up until midnight on Wednesday.

245
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you love so much about Rock Band?

246
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Character creation, the party aspect.

247
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,592
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less easy mode.

249
00:13:57,414 --> 00:14:00,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little more... It's like WoW, only more difficult, as far as I can tell.

250
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Deeper craft system, lots more race to choose from.

251
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2, correct?

252
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And a frog, and a rat.

253
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,200
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome.

254
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And they added the dragons.

255
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:10,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

256
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

257
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,603
[SPEAKER_04]: What other MMOs have you been playing?

258
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,152
[SPEAKER_05]: No, aside from WoW, Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta.

259
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

260
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa's all about, because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me, which wasn't a whole lot, so... Essentially, it's a third-person shooter MMO.

261
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:33,638
[SPEAKER_05]: You go around, you blast aliens, instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and whatnot.

262
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:43,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there, or is there something you can compare it to, or... There's not much you can compare it to, aside from, like, a tactical shooter, because you can actually use cover effectively, and... Mm-hmm.

263
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,915
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to describe, though, as far as that goes.

264
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:47,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

265
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:48,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

266
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So you recommend all these games?

267
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:53,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs, they should?

268
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

269
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, wait a minute.

270
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:58,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You play three different MMOs, but you do have a day job, right?

271
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

272
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do go outdoors once in a while?

273
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:02,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

274
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So you break the stereotype?

275
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:03,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

276
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:04,464
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

277
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:04,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

278
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear you have a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

279
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:07,405
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

280
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:07,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Doubtful.

281
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

282
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:14,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight.

283
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:17,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear what you guys have to say.

284
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl, which is going on right now during our program.

285
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:28,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would think either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that, or you came over here and watched this.

286
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:34,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway, so for most people, the Super Bowl is long past over.

287
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:39,248
[SPEAKER_04]: SonOfDad says, Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target.

288
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess Tabula Rasa's not selling too well.

289
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation.

290
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:53,773
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun, praising RezHD, HitStun says, RezHD is awesome, and have a 360 and don't already have Rez, you'd be stupid not to pick this up.

291
00:15:54,113 --> 00:16:05,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on RezHD because they didn't have, or they already had a previous copy of Rez on PlayStation 2 or Dreamcast or whatever.

292
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:09,655
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, Sky, I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Rez HD.

293
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite, but I had to do the Transvibrator mode.

294
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost looked up three different controllers for that, but I didn't have three different controllers at my house, so I tried just the controller I was playing with, and I was just kind of, eh.

295
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's regular.

296
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have the controller I was playing with, and then my wireless, so I put the wireless on my back, because that's what, you know, Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do, is you should put one towards your lower back, and it's actually kind of freaky.

297
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,336
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like a free back massage while you play video games.

298
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music.

299
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly an experience.

300
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:41,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that.

301
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

302
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Bros.

303
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:49,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl in house.

304
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, turn it off.

305
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rude to play games that we non-importers don't have yet.

306
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, dude.

307
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you.

308
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We really want to play, dude.

309
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release.

310
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,229
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I say.

311
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,439
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways.

312
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

313
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,860
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, because they're having problems, aren't they?

314
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,180
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a little short.

315
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,120
[SPEAKER_06]: A little?

316
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, no, seriously, it is just a little short, because they only fulfill, I forget how much of it, not much, let me put like 20% of the pre-orders, but the rest are coming next week, so... So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out?

317
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:29,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not that bad.

318
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:30,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

319
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Every major Nintendo title has been short anyways.

320
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Galaxy was like that.

321
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:37,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Zelda.

322
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here.

323
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart.

324
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels.

325
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:52,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be something stupid and arbitrary that's holding the whole thing up.

326
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

327
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,450
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

328
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:20,755
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: or how cold does it get at the South Pole?

330
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:44,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of stuff fascinates me.

331
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fascinating.

332
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole?

333
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to check on these things.

334
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:51,133
[SPEAKER_04]: These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world.

335
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:52,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

336
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:53,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

337
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal Combat in our chat room says, I want Portal song now.

338
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient.

339
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how does it feel to want?

340
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,124
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to wait.

341
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Patience is a virtue.

342
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:05,805
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

343
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:16,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and, you know, is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program, you know, we could have, like...

344
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard.

345
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:19,421
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't know.

346
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was afraid of.

347
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:23,122
[SPEAKER_04]: She's very brave to come here.

348
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:28,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we get past part A and the musical performance, we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment.

349
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So once the song is performed, there will be cake.

350
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:36,347
[SPEAKER_01]: From the chat room, from the chat room, Glowbanja says, me want song two.

351
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know any blur?

352
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

353
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:40,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I can do it.

354
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:41,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I can wing it.

355
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:42,650
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually do.

356
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you actually do other songs besides just...

357
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments.

358
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:49,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

359
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:12,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

360
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:15,626
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome to see somebody literally out of their bedroom.

361
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why we wanted to reach out.

362
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:20,350
[SPEAKER_03]: My room is such a mess.

363
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,313
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because literally, where did this show start?

364
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:26,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of my spare bedroom, and Loki and I lived together for a little while.

365
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing the show out of our living room.

366
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:33,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing.

367
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,706
[SPEAKER_03]: People can see my drums from Rock Band behind me, and then the mess on my floor.

368
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:40,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They can see my posters.

369
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:51,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, next time you need to... Somebody here in the Justin TV chat, somebody was, I don't know, being a troll and said something about who decorated this place, an 11-year-old girl.

370
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on.

371
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:01,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm so sure an 11-year-old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket.

372
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have when I was 11.

373
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:04,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe.

374
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,067
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was 11, I think I had gremlins.

375
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:07,707
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

376
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had Legos.

377
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:14,845
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the gaming news, and then we can, I promise, we will get to the Portal song.

378
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,107
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got to tease it a little bit and get some news out of the way first.

379
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:19,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, just want to give some quick plugs.

380
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,851
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know already, we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge.

381
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a MySpace, myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

382
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:29,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And a Facebook community is there, too, if you search for the OL Army.

383
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It is our Facebook community, too.

384
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So social networking whores, that's us.

385
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So check us out on those different websites.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,520
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

387
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the gaming news, Loki.

388
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:47,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, as we talked about last week, there's rumors going around that the 80GB PlayStation 3 system is being phased out.

389
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:53,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course we know that's true with Best Buy, and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB.

390
00:21:54,324 --> 00:22:03,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor, and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system, SKU, that's going to have a 120 to 160GB hard drive.

391
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:11,956
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller, all for the same price point of $4.99.

392
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about it, that makes perfect sense, seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways, right around the corner.

393
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:33,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's kind of funny how we laughed before, like, you know, back when Kutaragi was talking about, oh yeah, we're going to, it's going to be like a PC, we're going to upgrade it, you know,

394
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:37,909
[SPEAKER_06]: All the time, you know, it's going to be constantly changing.

395
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, ah, that's stupid, you're an idiot.

396
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough...

397
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,613
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing.

398
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:58,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3 that uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their ships with the hard drive.

399
00:22:58,104 --> 00:22:58,985
[SPEAKER_06]: They're future-proofing it, okay?

400
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:04,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Someday there'll be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something.

401
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,052
[SPEAKER_03]: When home finally comes out, it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run.

402
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

403
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need room for all that SingStar.

404
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:16,398
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2010, when Home finally comes out, you're going to need that 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then.

405
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:17,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who's going to say it?

406
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:20,160
[SPEAKER_04]: For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes.

407
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:22,701
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

408
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:24,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

409
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:24,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

410
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

411
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Studio 54 all over again.

412
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you not done your homework, Loki?

413
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:33,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet is for porn.

414
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:36,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And for piracy.

415
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:38,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can piracy your...

416
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirate porn.

417
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:39,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirate porn.

418
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:40,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.

419
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:41,445
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a porn called Pirates.

420
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:42,106
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a one called Pirates.

421
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:43,086
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a porn called Pirates.

422
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the highest produced, like, most expensive porn ever made.

423
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:47,210
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our lesbians has it.

424
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

425
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:48,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it.

426
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty well produced.

427
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:54,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity, but she's a connoisseur of porn.

428
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:56,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently as well.

429
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:59,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to God my mom isn't watching this.

430
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was like, your mom's not watching tonight, right?

431
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:02,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, mom.

432
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

433
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:05,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We're wacky internet people.

434
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:07,005
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we tell jokes.

435
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

436
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:09,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to say about the PlayStation?

437
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:11,099
[SPEAKER_06]: About the PlayStation 3?

438
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop making new SKUs!

439
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's confusing!

440
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:18,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And all you're going to do is convince people, well, if I wait longer, it'll be better.

441
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:21,505
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're going to get stuck doing.

442
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

443
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:26,968
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet this new SKU is just not going to have backwards compatibility whatsoever on it?

444
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:27,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the 40?

445
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:29,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, just like the 40.

446
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,930
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to screw everybody.

447
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game, too.

448
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably Lair, since it doesn't sell.

449
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make sense.

450
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

451
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:50,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, and SonOfDad says in chat.orange.com PlayStation 3, one year, five SKUs, no fucking games.

452
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:52,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's Uncharted.

453
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Orko says porn is greater than cake.

454
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, cake is pretty good.

455
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course that brings Aisu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie.

456
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:09,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was funny while I was half asleep this morning because I was supposed to be waiting for breakfast, but I wasn't.

457
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing Burnout Paradise about the difference between going online on the Xbox 360 as opposed to going online on the PlayStation 3.

458
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:23,437
[SPEAKER_01]: How with Xbox 360, it's just part of the experience.

459
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:24,718
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.

460
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's there.

461
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:32,462
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about going online with SOCOM and saying how it was like filing your taxes.

462
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,408
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it.

463
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be an online player, then having a PS3 isn't worth it.

464
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:44,820
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes friend codes don't look so bad when you put all that in comparison.

465
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, you know, I don't know.

466
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:54,038
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that the PlayStation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

467
00:25:54,078 --> 00:26:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you remember that whole controversy with, you know, there was OMG sex was unlockable.

468
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:04,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of porn, was unlockable within the game and, you know, it was a whole hot coffee mess.

469
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugly sex.

470
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:13,932
[SPEAKER_04]: If you may remember when we last left off, there was a settlement that was going to happen where you could actually replace your game and you could get some sort of, you know, severance.

471
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:15,120
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

472
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:40,146
[SPEAKER_04]: The settlement will offer different levels of compensation depending on your proof that a violated buyer may have to offer.

473
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have an original copy of the game, you can get, of course, the replacement disc.

474
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,995
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the receipt with it, you can get a $35 cash payment as part of the settlement.

475
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have a credit card statement or check, you get $17.50.

476
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,377
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a disc, no receipt, $10.00.

477
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have no receipt and no game, you can earn $5.

478
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet!

479
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you go.

480
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:21,375
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two, all you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury that you purchased the game and you played the offending game and it raped your fragile mind.

481
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

482
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:26,199
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to just swear that the game did things to your mind you were not prepared for.

483
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people enjoy that.

484
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5.

485
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if it's worth it.

486
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:36,890
[SPEAKER_04]: That is lunch at McDonald's for a day.

487
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,334
[SPEAKER_01]: $5 will totally get me teriyaki.

488
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:42,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

489
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:44,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Lunch on take two, everybody.

490
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:45,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Lunch on take two this week.

491
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

492
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,104
[SPEAKER_01]: That would totally buy me some hot coffee.

493
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:50,464
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.

494
00:27:51,690 --> 00:28:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that $5 that you can get from, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it, you know, warped your freaking mind, that's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 when it comes out.

495
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

496
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Pays for your pre-order.

497
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:06,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

498
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:16,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store to try and stake your claim to this because, you know, once you get the $5, you're going to say, you need to pre-order the new game, right?

499
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

500
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

501
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:25,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal.

502
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it won't be.

503
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:31,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Gran Turismo, there's a hot coffee... No, I'm just kidding.

504
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:37,440
[SPEAKER_01]: But speaking of Gran Turismo, there's a fun little bit that's out, though, for $40.

505
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I wouldn't pay for that.

506
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,702
[SPEAKER_01]: But Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has an April 17th release date.

507
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:53,143
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will have 60 cars and you will get like Nissan and Ferraris and Audis like you'd want an Audi and different levels.

508
00:28:53,263 --> 00:29:00,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's five tracks and you can either download it or pay for the disc and with the disc you get a special video.

509
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:01,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

510
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:02,829
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what that means?

511
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:07,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that you can buy a half done game for 30 bucks or 40 bucks and then guess what?

512
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,832
[SPEAKER_06]: You can wait for the full game to come out, and then pay another $60, because you're a whore.

513
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:13,353
[SPEAKER_01]: But wait, wait, wait.

514
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,775
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a half-done game now, and then you get a 90% done game later.

515
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:20,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll put out, like, special edition that's completely finished.

516
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:24,738
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the sequel, which will be, like, almost done.

517
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We swear, we're almost done with the game.

518
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 60% done now.

519
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you put it so eloquently.

520
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have a way with words.

521
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:32,022
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that, right?

522
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:32,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

523
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, this is a lot of crap for a game that's not really done.

524
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:35,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

525
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:37,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that great anyways.

526
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,066
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to do it.

527
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be like, oh my god, I have to have it.

528
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:43,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a consumer whore.

529
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just wait for the full game to come out.

530
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people don't know how to be patient.

531
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess I can't really talk about patience.

532
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any weeds now?

533
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:56,215
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

534
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:00,978
[SPEAKER_04]: More news, please.

535
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, we need to get to the Portal song sooner rather than later because that means less talking from us.

536
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:07,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

537
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:14,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually meant, okay, now this story, I meant to get something to actually test this out on the show, but I was too lazy to stop by anyways.

538
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:16,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Firmware 3.9 has come out.

539
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:18,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Bros.

540
00:30:18,822 --> 00:30:19,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl?

541
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:19,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Too lazy.

542
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:34,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was basically, because I was going to stop at GameStop and get a headset for my PSP so I can talk on Skype so we can test it during the show, but I figured, no, that'd be dumb, and I don't want to waste $20 on a headset when I will never, I'll never use Skype.

543
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize for ever asking about the story.

544
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:36,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anywhere to find the headsets?

545
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:39,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to find that.

546
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:56,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so, firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP, and it does feature Skype if you have the PSP Slim, and two days later it was cracked, and is now available for everybody else like me.

547
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:58,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hooray!

548
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:01,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to go, Sony.

549
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeping up with that security thing.

550
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, does the crack still work off some type of exploit, or how exactly does that work?

551
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:21,698
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically decrypt the whole firmware, and then they just modify it so you can install it on your PSP with homebrew support and other stuff like that.

552
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:22,238
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

553
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So one more time, just to recap, the new PSP firmware came out this week.

554
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It was promptly cracked two days later.

555
00:31:29,362 --> 00:31:30,483
All right.

556
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I always feel like every time we have a story about the firmware getting cracked, Sony comes out and says, nobody's ever going to crack this, this is the foolproof firmware, we've closed the loophole, no one's ever going to crack it, and then two days later... It gets even better, and I don't think this made the show roll, but they're finding a way now to inject the 1.5 firmware...

557
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

558
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:22,775
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

559
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're looking for more things to use your PSP for, pretty soon Flow is going to be coming out on the PSP.

560
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know this game as the screensaver that you play.

561
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:39,066
[SPEAKER_04]: This originally came out on the PlayStation Network, of course, and it will soon be coming out to the PSP.

562
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:41,748
[SPEAKER_04]: This is according to Computer and Video Games.

563
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:47,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP version probably won't be changed much from the original PlayStation 3 version.

564
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:52,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think, you know, how exactly do you mess with flow?

565
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:56,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you give the game a plot or like an objective?

566
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat stuff.

567
00:32:57,636 --> 00:32:58,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Become bigger.

568
00:32:58,737 --> 00:32:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Evolve.

569
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:00,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

570
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot the instructions that the game gives you.

571
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:03,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat stuff.

572
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:04,940
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

573
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:09,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's see what else is coming out soon from around the world.

574
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a minute to travel the globe and check out some release dates.

575
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:15,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with Jamie.

576
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:17,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me.

577
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:22,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we have a few, actually quite a number of releases coming out in the UK.

578
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:28,097
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 6th is Poker Smash on Xbox 360, which we will be discussing later.

579
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,735
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 8th is where a bunch of stuff is coming out.

580
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:57,200
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Agatha Christie and Then There Were None, An Arctic Tale, Art of Fighting Anthology, Cars Matter National, Conflict Denied Ops, Devil May Cry 4 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Final Fantasy 1 Anniversary Edition, Final Fantasy 2 Anniversary Edition, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Imagination Invades, Iridium Runners, Life Science Hospital Affairs, Mario and Sonic at the

581
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:22,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Medal of Honor, Heroes 2, NFL Tour, Nitro Bike, PDC World Darts Championship 2008, oh fun, Pick Pick on DS, Professor Kageyama's Math Training, Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords, Showtime Championship Boxing, Speedball 2 Tournament, SpongeBob Atlanta SquarePants, okay, SquarePanta, sorry,

582
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't, I'm sorry.

583
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I was like, whatever.

584
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,121
[SPEAKER_01]: The Club, which is on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

585
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:35,642
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Turok.

586
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that so people don't steal your 360, or what?

587
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:40,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rob.

588
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:43,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you see them about to take it, you beat them with the club.

589
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:45,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

590
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:47,806
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

591
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:48,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

592
00:34:49,427 --> 00:34:52,028
[SPEAKER_06]: The US, there's quite a bit coming out as well.

593
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,386
[SPEAKER_06]: The highlights for this week, of course, Devil May Cry 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

594
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:03,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Turok, that's on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

595
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:07,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, if you're smart, you know that it's already out now, so you can pick it up anyways.

596
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:11,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed, Altair's Chronicles on the DS.

597
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Sins of a Solar Empire on the PC.

598
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:18,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldicep Saga on Xbox 360.

599
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:19,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually excited about this game.

600
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:22,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of those cultist Caldicep fans for some reason.

601
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the Xbox 360 demo.

602
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:24,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

603
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:27,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that sounds like exciting.

604
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:29,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my phone was even excited.

605
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It just went off.

606
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:34,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Twisted Metal Head-On Extra Twisted Edition for PlayStation 2.

607
00:35:35,614 --> 00:35:37,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Space Force Captains on PC.

608
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:43,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Downstream Panic on the PSP, which is kind of like a ripoff of LocoRoco when you look at it.

609
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:51,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore coming out on 360, Wii, and PlayStation 2.

610
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Not touching that game.

611
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:55,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was awful.

612
00:35:57,425 --> 00:36:00,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobunaga's Ambition Rise to Power on PlayStation 2.

613
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:06,435
[SPEAKER_06]: The Spider Chronicles on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PC, and the DS.

614
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's also coming out in the Wii at the same time, too.

615
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:12,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS.

616
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:15,779
[SPEAKER_06]: My Horse and Me on the Wii and the DS.

617
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

618
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And, let's see, Medieval 2 Total War, the Gold Pack.

619
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:34,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And one other thing, the, well, we weren't sure if it was coming out, but, you know, that Cobalt Blue and Black DS finally confirmed to be coming out on the 10th now.

620
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you didn't know that three weeks ago.

621
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:39,504
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you didn't know that three weeks ago.

622
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:52,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And to kind of go along with that, Professor Layton and the Curious Village on the DS, which is hot shit right now in Japan, but I don't know what the draw is, but great.

623
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:58,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Puppy Palace on DS, because there's just not enough puppy-raising sims, my god.

624
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And what other fun stuff here?

625
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:08,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I had to read Merv Griffin's crosswords on the PC.

626
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:10,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

627
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:12,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that like a game show now or something?

628
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

629
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do they have him hosting anything?

630
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:16,498
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just weird.

631
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:23,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Merv Griffin's kind of dead, so he can't host much right now unless it's... Crosswords.

632
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie crosswords, yes.

633
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:26,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

634
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:30,742
[SPEAKER_01]: He could be like a computer reanimation, because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden.

635
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Merv Griffin died that long ago, so this might be in the too soon category, so we need to be careful.

636
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:42,108
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing.

637
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:42,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

638
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

639
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:47,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

640
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:49,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

641
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:53,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Dick Clark should be dead and worse is justice.

642
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:56,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't you tell his contract with the devil already ran wore out?

643
00:37:58,753 --> 00:37:59,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened very quickly.

644
00:37:59,754 --> 00:38:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what it is.

645
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Dick Clark is seriously the inspiration for that movie Final Destination.

646
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:06,538
[SPEAKER_06]: He has dodged death so many times.

647
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:10,300
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game chat.

648
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:12,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

649
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:13,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

650
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,443
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that's coming out this week.

651
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,085
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move over then to the...

652
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:20,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 Japanese release dates.

653
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friends in Japan will be playing Battle Stations Midway when it comes out on February 7, 2008.

654
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:27,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not, because they may not buy it.

655
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:27,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

656
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:33,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the PlayStation 3 coming out, Transformers The Game finally makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

657
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all sorry.

658
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki gives that its highest recommendation, by the way.

659
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:46,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, I don't know, Major Nelson might have some competition because the Wii's getting a game called Major Wii, Najiro Gyro Ball.

660
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So... Major we.

661
00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:53,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Major we.

662
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get your major we on.

663
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:57,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we.

664
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:57,916
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are we?

665
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually after I watch a movie.

666
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:00,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

667
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,241
[SPEAKER_06]: and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword killing zombies.

668
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: What more do you need?

669
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:25,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sold.

670
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like it could be the greatest game ever made.

671
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,564
[SPEAKER_04]: How have we not heard more about this?

672
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:30,705
[SPEAKER_06]: This was supposed to be on the 360.

673
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: This was like the other game that they made other than Earth Defense Force 2017.

674
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you get your waggle on with that?

675
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:36,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

676
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:37,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be getting this game.

677
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:38,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

678
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to get that and a major Wii?

679
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And a major Wii.

680
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:41,790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

681
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get a major Wii for everybody.

682
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,508
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that say?

683
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I were you, I would have almost been hoping for the shovel at this point.

684
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is still better than being dead in a dish somewhere.

685
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably true.

686
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:01,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, wait, Loki, don't go anywhere.

687
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:05,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan this week.

688
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know you've imported Smash Brothers, so you might be getting this too.

689
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the fifth entry in a long-running series on the PlayStation 2.

690
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:15,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, Loki's favorite.

691
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:20,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Princess Maker 5 makes its way to Japan this week.

692
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:23,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my favorite.

693
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:25,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Princess Maker 2 on PC.

694
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's a pornographic game, in which case I may like it.

695
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki will make a princess out of you yet.

696
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:31,185
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

697
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:31,545
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

698
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:34,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get Princess Maker 2 again, and I'm going to make Orange Lounge Radio the RPG.

699
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:35,829
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

700
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be very fun.

701
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,973
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you guys that are fans of Pachinko, hey.

702
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

703
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:44,937
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some fun Pachinko now.

704
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:46,858
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Parodius Pachinko, and it's awesome.

705
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanyo Pachinko Paradise 13 is getting a price reduction.

706
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:50,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only $20.

707
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank God.

708
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I was waiting for that.

709
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,528
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Nintendo DS.

710
00:40:58,235 --> 00:41:02,819
[SPEAKER_04]: L, the prologue to Death Note comes out on the DS this week.

711
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what?

712
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out, Pato Tokyuru Indosukagu Drill comes out as well on the DS, and I have no idea what that is.

713
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:15,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Mr. Driller's bastard cousin.

714
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what that is.

715
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:20,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like a quiz, that kind of drill.

716
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:22,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another brain training game.

717
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:23,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

718
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not the bastard cousin of Dig Dug and Mr. Driller, their love child.

719
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see real quickly if there's anything coming out on the PSP you might care about.

720
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:35,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Coded Soul comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.

721
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:41,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mobile Suit Gundam Giren no Yabu comes out this week from Bandai.

722
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

723
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:49,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember back in the day when the thought of a new Gundam game was exciting.

724
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:52,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just like, I have to stop.

725
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get back into some news, and then we will have ourselves a performance.

726
00:41:58,971 --> 00:41:59,791
[SPEAKER_01]: What about news?

727
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways... Well, I have some news.

728
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:06,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I have related news.

729
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:12,354
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very special, because EA is obviously very special, and special by any short bus.

730
00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:17,216
[SPEAKER_01]: EA is going to be splitting the components of the Orange Box.

731
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:18,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Dun-dun-dun.

732
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be a PC and Xbox 360 release in October, and a PS3 release afterwards, but it'll be just a separate Half-Life, Episode 2 portal, and a separate Team Fortress.

733
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:37,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've already been there for download for a while, but there's going to be individual box copies on the way.

734
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:47,297
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope they're cheap, because, I mean, if you can buy, you know, the Orange Box New for $60, and it's all this stuff, they should make these, like...

735
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:49,602
[SPEAKER_01]: No more than 15, 20 bucks a piece.

736
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:50,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll probably be 20.

737
00:42:51,383 --> 00:42:57,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And... No one will buy, like, Episode 2 or... Everyone will just buy Portal.

738
00:42:58,004 --> 00:42:59,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Portal and Team Fortress 2.

739
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:00,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

740
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:09,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, see, when we got my copy, see, all I cared about was Portal at the time, but Dan really, really got into Half-Life 2, Episode 2.

741
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:11,507
[SPEAKER_01]: He was all over that.

742
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:16,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

743
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I had to run out for a minute.

744
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay.

745
00:43:20,465 --> 00:43:21,385
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a major wee.

746
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

747
00:43:22,086 --> 00:43:24,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a major wee brewing.

748
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I didn't want to miss our performance, so I ran out during the last story there.

749
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:33,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you've shared that with the entire internet, can we move on with another gaming story, please?

750
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:34,776
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not afraid to go there.

751
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:41,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is going to come as a big surprise to everybody, but Val's talking about making more Portal games.

752
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

753
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:44,845
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so surprising.

754
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:46,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Shock and Awe!

755
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

756
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:44,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

757
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:47,348
[SPEAKER_03]: If they aren't, I'll be really bitter.

758
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,048
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

759
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:48,949
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

760
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the podcast.

761
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,252
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always share it with your friends.

762
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been pimping it to them all weekend.

763
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:54,934
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't listen, I'm going to be bitter.

764
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

765
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:59,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm sure that if you're in chat, say hello or something so we can pass on your well wishes to Mo.

766
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so you just, you just, you heard the song, your friends kind of dared you to do it effectively.

767
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:08,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

768
00:45:08,423 --> 00:45:10,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, then you're on YouTube and now you're here.

769
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake, the one and only Jake, actually, how did you find her?

770
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how did you find me?

771
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

772
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was looking, I think someone went.

773
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:20,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we, can we get him on the mic real quick?

774
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:22,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jake, you gotta talk on the mic or we can't hear you.

775
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:25,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

776
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:47,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Here she is.

777
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:49,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you about ready for this?

778
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,990
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to situate a little differently because we're ghetto and we don't have a lot of hookups there.

779
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to kind of sit by you here while you do this.

780
00:45:57,573 --> 00:46:00,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask you guys to turn your mics off so we don't get a lot of background noise in here.

781
00:46:01,316 --> 00:46:05,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig, our first musical guest.

782
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be awesome, right?

783
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:09,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be slightly...

784
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a triumph

785
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a no-tier huge success It's hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture science

786
00:46:54,321 --> 00:47:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: We do what we must because we can For the good in all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you run out of cake And the science gets done And you make a neat gun For the people who are still alive

787
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:51,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even angry I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire

788
00:47:54,433 --> 00:48:17,322
[SPEAKER_02]: As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you Now these points of data make a beautiful line And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned For the people who are still alive

789
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:51,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd prefer to stay inside Maybe I'll find someone else to help you Maybe Black Mesa That was a joke, haha, fat chance

790
00:48:55,250 --> 00:49:21,138
[SPEAKER_02]: This cake is great, it's so delicious and moist Look at me still talking when there's science to do When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you I've experiments to run, there is research to be done On the people who are still alive And believe me I am still alive

791
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing science and I'm still alive I feel fantastic and I'm still alive While you're dying I'll be still alive And when you're dead I will be still alive Still alive, still alive Give it up everybody for Vo!

792
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:49,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Also known as Amixi on YouTube with her cover.

793
00:49:50,222 --> 00:49:52,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking in the chat room and everyone's totally into it.

794
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:53,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

795
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:56,566
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had virtual lighters.

796
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:57,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

797
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it say about mistakes?

798
00:50:00,108 --> 00:50:01,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a chance on mistakes, whatever that is.

799
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:03,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

800
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It was beautiful.

801
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep on trying until you run out of cake.

802
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

803
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:09,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be cake, and it's not alive.

804
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:10,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So very nice.

805
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:18,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have some clapping in the chat room, and HitStun says it would win a cage match, our little musical thing we do after the show where they pick good songs.

806
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:19,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So very nice.

807
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:23,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you're going to have to learn something else and come back again sometime.

808
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:32,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I happened to watch another one of her YouTubes, actually, which I laughed at because she said Rick Ashley is never going to give you up.

809
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:34,265
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

810
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:54,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots and lots of clapping there in chat, and thank you very much for being a guinea pig and being our very first musical guest.

811
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That went pretty well, except for the fact I kind of had to hold that, and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part.

812
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept smacking the mic, and I'm like, shit.

813
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:03,436
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it came out really good, so very exciting.

814
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:03,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

815
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,139
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Ellen Show.

816
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero Aerosmith Guitar Hero 4

817
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:41,505
[SPEAKER_04]: in October.

818
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero On Tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS.

819
00:51:45,346 --> 00:51:46,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to make its way in June.

820
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:50,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And supposedly, there is a fourth title being planned.

821
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:55,448
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an action-packed Guitar Hero experience like no other.

822
00:51:55,848 --> 00:51:58,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently it's some other type of Guitar Hero game.

823
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:06,731
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, it's basically taking a lovely, well-established, loved franchise and pooping on it with this game.

824
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:10,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if there's four games in one year, that's already pooping on it, I think.

825
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

826
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:17,460
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, those rumors are coming from SurferGirl via GoNintendo.com.

827
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And SurferGirl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff.

828
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:23,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Not surprised.

829
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:24,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised about the three of them.

830
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:27,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July.

831
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Since that's when Rock the 80s came out last year.

832
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:32,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock the 80s.

833
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:32,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

834
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, they need to do something like, remember Fret and Ice?

835
00:52:37,712 --> 00:52:42,374
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do something like that, action-packed guitar game, you know, where you actually do a side-scrolling game.

836
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:46,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think this is going to suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

837
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:50,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them.

838
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked.

839
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:54,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer.

840
00:52:54,922 --> 00:53:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but if you release four games, like, okay, DDR, for example...

841
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:02,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

842
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, at least one really good game set, four really mediocre games.

843
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of the saying, too much of a good thing?

844
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

845
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo asks in chat, is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now?

846
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the whole Activision Blizzard thing, you know, rock out to your, you know, torn shaman and all that stuff.

847
00:53:26,695 --> 00:53:30,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we get hoochie dancing night elves and headbanging in bed?

848
00:53:30,818 --> 00:53:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You might see some of that stuff, but here's the thing...

849
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version.

850
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:42,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you'll see something like that in there because they like doing weird crossover things.

851
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

852
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:49,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3, anything is possible.

853
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very disappointed that I've not seen anything like that for rock bands.

854
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:53,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some free songs, okay?

855
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the three songs a week that have to pay for.

856
00:53:55,878 --> 00:53:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Journey.

857
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:58,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Journey.

858
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,982
[SPEAKER_03]: They need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords of the Underworld just isn't enough.

859
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,941
[SPEAKER_03]: There needs to be more gag music in there.

860
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:07,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more lols in our rock band.

861
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:09,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Avril Lavigne's girlfriend on there.

862
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I would own on that.

863
00:54:11,823 --> 00:54:14,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Chocolate Rain, the heavy metal mix or something like that.

864
00:54:14,644 --> 00:54:14,724
Yes!

865
00:54:15,224 --> 00:54:16,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they managed to put Freeze Pop in there.

866
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:18,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate Rain!

867
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:20,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

868
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Moe maybe should write them and get still alive in there.

869
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:25,767
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more stuff from the kinda long-haired band.

870
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,346
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now, Still Alive... Spinal Tap?

871
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:31,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Spinal Tap.

872
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:38,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, Still Alive could make it into Rock Band since EA publishes both games, so maybe.

873
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

874
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: EA, you listening?

875
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:44,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song.

876
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:45,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I mean, there's maps and stuff.

877
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:47,586
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got plenty of mellow stuff in there.

878
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:50,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, part of my iron lung is mellow.

879
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,631
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we need more Radiohead.

880
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:56,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain, Loki.

881
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:57,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you go, a little kick.

882
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick!

883
00:54:58,556 --> 00:54:59,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolate Rain is great.

884
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:00,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.

885
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:03,440
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's voice is just intense.

886
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:09,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Intense is a good way to describe it.

887
00:55:09,255 --> 00:55:10,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more news.

888
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:19,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for our Sega fans, there is a PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege.

889
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:24,467
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an action RPG with different types of gameplay.

890
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:30,112
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a robotic partner that you can customize, and you have online co-op, up to four people.

891
00:55:31,013 --> 00:55:35,036
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release, too.

892
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:42,305
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release.

893
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,106
[SPEAKER_01]: They are considering it as an option.

894
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:56,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself, that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible.

895
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: The PC releases in September.

896
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait, it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years, hopefully?

897
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:05,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.

898
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:07,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega needs to really redeem themselves.

899
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:08,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they need to bring out Planet Harrier.

900
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:12,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have very good hopes for this, actually.

901
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:21,422
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember correctly, Space Siege is actually a new series in the Dungeon Siege games.

902
00:56:21,562 --> 00:56:25,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, you know, like a dungeon crawler, but now it's a space crawler, I guess.

903
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know...

904
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:32,883
[SPEAKER_06]: No offense, I'm sure Dungeon Seed is awesome, it's just, we bull-ruined that for me.

905
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:33,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

906
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:38,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of that, and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO.

907
00:56:38,647 --> 00:56:41,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King, and it'll be in space.

908
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:45,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever.

909
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:46,511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
00:57:09,924 --> 00:57:10,565
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

911
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:41,205
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem wasn't with the universe itself as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled.

912
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played it.

913
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:47,350
[SPEAKER_01]: She said they brought back Mags.

914
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hot.

915
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Mags.

916
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:51,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss my Master System Mag.

917
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:52,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And my Opa Opa.

918
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:54,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show.

919
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:56,157
Ah.

920
00:57:56,787 --> 00:58:08,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice Challenge that was on the Xbox 360, I think last year, where you could, you know, earn, you know,

921
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:12,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Such wonderful games as Contra and, oh, guess what?

922
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Fusion Frenzy 2, which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment.

923
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Punishment.

924
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:25,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so you can win some new stuff this time, although it's a little bit different this time around.

925
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:31,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of actually competing just against a set number, you're competing against your friends, and you can win such things as, say...

926
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: $20 Best Buy gift card, an Xbox 360 HD DVD player since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of went in there.

927
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:45,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And some other stuff, you know, maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again.

928
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:45,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

929
00:58:46,495 --> 00:58:56,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, so if you're interested in that, they've actually got some more information on 360voice.com slash challenges.

930
00:58:56,643 --> 00:58:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check it out.

931
00:58:58,024 --> 00:58:59,365
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of different things you can win.

932
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:00,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

933
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a... I really don't care.

934
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of done with the whole EP and achievement points thing.

935
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:10,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of done.

936
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:17,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so sadly high, it's just never... you're never going to catch up.

937
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

938
00:59:17,547 --> 00:59:20,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing.

939
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little old to me.

940
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess there's still...

941
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:24,384
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

942
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:52,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Mac Challenge.

943
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:53,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

944
00:59:54,113 --> 00:59:55,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you win some Big Macs or something.

945
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearance copies of Sneak King.

946
00:59:59,617 --> 00:59:59,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

947
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:11,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, some games may be coming out very soon for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more, because Lord knows you Achievement Point whores love more arcade games to inflate your score.

948
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:14,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all.

949
01:00:14,723 --> 01:00:25,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Microsoft's PressFTP site was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there, because they've released these screenshots of Conker Live and Reloaded and Jade Empire.

950
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site.

951
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:34,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It indicates that the games could be coming to Xbox Live Marketplace very soon.

952
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it there.

953
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, they're going to be added to the Xbox original lineup.

954
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:46,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So come to think of it, I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points because you can't use the original games.

955
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:50,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not interested until they put a Jet Set Radio feature on there or something like that.

956
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:58,753
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live Originals, 1,200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games.

957
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:01,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Or go buy it used for probably even cheaper than that.

958
01:01:02,495 --> 01:01:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear especially with Jade Empire, those games are ones that people love.

959
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:09,382
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it.

960
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:12,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for.

961
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:13,085
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

962
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:14,305
[SPEAKER_01]: To the big game.

963
01:01:14,746 --> 01:01:15,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what game?

964
01:01:15,867 --> 01:01:17,047
[SPEAKER_01]: The Puppy Bowl, Corgi one.

965
01:01:17,468 --> 01:01:17,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

966
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:18,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

967
01:01:18,648 --> 01:01:19,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Go team Corgi.

968
01:01:19,629 --> 01:01:20,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

969
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:24,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all these DS, pet raising sims, and no Puppy Bowl games.

970
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:26,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

971
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:27,654
[SPEAKER_01]: They totally need the Puppy Bowl.

972
01:01:27,794 --> 01:01:32,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season once again.

973
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house.

974
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Corgis are great and they're smart.

975
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,560
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, forget it.

976
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,661
[SPEAKER_01]: With their little mutated feet.

977
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:39,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their little feet.

978
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:44,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been telling my husband I want a corgi, and he's like, no, you have a cat.

979
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_01]: See, proof that inbreeding can be awesome.

980
01:01:46,884 --> 01:01:48,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have cats out yet, too.

981
01:01:48,244 --> 01:01:48,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Midget cats.

982
01:01:48,645 --> 01:01:49,605
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but they're so horrible.

983
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:50,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels so bad for them.

984
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you love video games?

985
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:52,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

986
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

987
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:55,967
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about video games nonstop.

988
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:57,488
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who should have won Puppy Bowl?

989
01:01:57,508 --> 01:01:59,389
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the puppy and kitty tangent.

990
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:01,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what, Rob?

991
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:02,190
[SPEAKER_01]: More Xbox Live.

992
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:02,650
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

993
01:02:03,337 --> 01:02:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: CeilingCat is watching you deviate from the video game stories.

994
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations, as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases, is Poker Smash, which is like, I guess, Tetris with poker things?

995
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:26,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Poker Smash!

996
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it makes me kind of think of Columns.

997
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:31,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Columns.

998
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:33,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Columns gave me an aneurysm.

999
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:34,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Columns smash!

1000
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:37,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of makes me think of, I'm not buying it.

1001
01:02:40,728 --> 01:02:42,169
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you're going to get it for Nelly.

1002
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,290
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1003
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,251
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Nelly's going to get it behind your back.

1004
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:46,552
[SPEAKER_06]: For points.

1005
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:47,653
[SPEAKER_06]: She won't buy that game.

1006
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:48,694
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I don't care.

1007
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:51,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't either.

1008
01:02:51,516 --> 01:02:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360, Nelly's going to come in and go, Xbox smash!

1009
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, he'll rebuild it.

1010
01:03:01,003 --> 01:03:01,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1011
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make it work better.

1012
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:07,275
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't work better, that means I need more heat.

1013
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:13,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually looks kind of cool, but honestly, I just will play Puyo Puyo.

1014
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,339
[SPEAKER_06]: See, she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in it.

1015
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,460
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't know how to play poker.

1016
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:22,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever, but that will stop her from playing that game.

1017
01:03:23,563 --> 01:03:23,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1018
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:25,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1019
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:33,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's actually been a little issues with, you know, Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

1020
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:38,377
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and you might think at first it's because the name's too long, but you'd be wrong.

1021
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually because the game's too big, and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade.

1022
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:56,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, you know, those 1080p visuals are, you know, really big, and so they're having trouble, you know, fitting it in such a small size, uh,

1023
01:03:57,332 --> 01:03:57,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Constraint there.

1024
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:00,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, darn.

1025
01:04:00,857 --> 01:04:01,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1026
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:04,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

1027
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: There may just not be enough room for Cammy's ass.

1028
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:09,791
[SPEAKER_04]: They might just have to cut it out.

1029
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:10,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say.

1030
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:12,075
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Chin-Li's thighs.

1031
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:20,690
[SPEAKER_06]: or how about, I don't know, let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway since most everyone has a hard drive and if you don't have a hard drive, you don't get to play fucking arcade games.

1032
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:21,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1033
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how about just get rid of Balrog?

1034
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:25,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, did anyone actually play Balrog?

1035
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:26,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

1036
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:27,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually?

1037
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Tyson played Balrog.

1038
01:04:30,853 --> 01:04:31,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone did.

1039
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:36,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it so I have to think about who you're talking about.

1040
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: M. Bison, the boxer.

1041
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:38,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1042
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:42,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, he was pretty cool, but I liked Dudley better in 3.

1043
01:04:42,698 --> 01:04:45,379
[SPEAKER_01]: We're giving out a stupid award tonight.

1044
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,919
[SPEAKER_04]: No, last week we talked about this guy, but now the trial's going on.

1045
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:18,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is why this guy is going to win a stupid award tonight.

1046
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:25,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Tyrone Spellman is his name, and apparently he killed a baby.

1047
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1048
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:28,495
[SPEAKER_04]: What caused him to kill a baby?

1049
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, video games, of course.

1050
01:05:30,537 --> 01:05:38,263
[SPEAKER_04]: If the, uh, Aaliyah Truman, or Tourman, the assistant district attorney, is to be believed.

1051
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:44,047
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that Spellman's entire life and daily routine is about playing Ghost Recon.

1052
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:48,591
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think someone with that kind of obsession is going to do when it gets knocked over?

1053
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:50,072
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is going to happen?

1054
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:52,994
[SPEAKER_04]: The skull fractures on that baby, or what happened?

1055
01:05:54,463 --> 01:05:57,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, I know that's horrible, first off.

1056
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation.

1057
01:05:59,845 --> 01:06:04,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is so stupid about this is that, yeah, video games caused him to do it.

1058
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:11,669
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think severe mental instability of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it.

1059
01:06:11,749 --> 01:06:16,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, obviously he was not playing with a full set of chips in his head.

1060
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:19,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's why we're giving out a stupid award.

1061
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:23,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only to the assistant district attorney who's trying to jump to this conclusion...

1062
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:27,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But the guy for killing a baby in the first place, I mean, that's kind of stupid.

1063
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:28,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, don't kill babies.

1064
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:31,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, isn't it, like... It doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up.

1065
01:06:31,377 --> 01:06:36,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if he had a six-pack in his head, it'd actually be empty except for one flat half-drunk bottle.

1066
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you even really need to be taught that growing up?

1067
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:43,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do your parents really need to teach you, like, hey, don't kill babies.

1068
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

1069
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:45,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1070
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:48,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in.

1071
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:48,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1072
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:53,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So... The problem is he wasn't playing Madden.

1073
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:57,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pure and utter awesomeness.

1074
01:06:57,822 --> 01:06:58,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Outrun!

1075
01:06:58,342 --> 01:06:59,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Outrun.

1076
01:07:25,111 --> 01:07:26,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Outrun is a game where you just drive a car.

1077
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: You make it sound so thrilling.

1078
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:44,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got a convertible, and it's the guy and his blonde lady just driving along and passing other drivers, but you get different forks in the path, different ways that you can take, and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen or a 1971 Corvette, a 1985 Porsche 911, or a 1985 BMW, which I thought was pretty cool.

1079
01:07:55,282 --> 01:08:02,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole, I think, fun part about it was that it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car.

1080
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:05,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had great music in it.

1081
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:07,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like we're hearing right now.

1082
01:08:08,146 --> 01:08:12,227
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I picked was Magical Sound Shower, which is like the best music in the game ever.

1083
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:16,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I also named one of my horses in Derby Owner's Club after it.

1084
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:24,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is, it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D

1085
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

1086
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:49,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pretty good game.

1087
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you able to actually play this on Master System?

1088
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:52,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's on Master System.

1089
01:08:53,313 --> 01:08:53,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1090
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:29,153
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the other big part of this was just that with the combination of getting your choice of paths or getting the music that you got.

1091
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:31,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you could actually change your music channel.

1092
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:36,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of racing games now have that sort of option for the music that you listen to as you play.

1093
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:43,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the Genesis version, it actually had an extra...

1094
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:46,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Outrun, Shenmue 2

1095
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:12,446
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play it on the Dreamcast and Shenmue too.

1096
01:10:13,527 --> 01:10:19,251
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance in the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation.

1097
01:10:21,572 --> 01:10:23,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually in Outrun 2 as well.

1098
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:36,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone's actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out, but it was included in Arizona's with updated versions of the original tracks that were in it too.

1099
01:10:37,022 --> 01:10:37,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was pretty cool.

1100
01:10:39,176 --> 01:10:39,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnie Darko

1101
01:10:56,979 --> 01:10:59,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the chatroom folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision.

1102
01:11:00,241 --> 01:11:03,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab says, Lucky and Wild, greater than Outrun.

1103
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:04,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like that game.

1104
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Orko says, ah, Lucky and Wild, how I heart they.

1105
01:11:06,884 --> 01:11:08,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bias against Lucky and Wild.

1106
01:11:09,226 --> 01:11:09,766
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1107
01:11:09,826 --> 01:11:13,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those, and I had to clean that sucker.

1108
01:11:15,068 --> 01:11:15,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Did people like...

1109
01:11:17,681 --> 01:11:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Do nasty things in the Lucky Wild Machine.

1110
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:21,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was the drive and gun game.

1111
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:27,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would, like, break the gun controller or leave their crap all in the thing.

1112
01:11:28,172 --> 01:11:29,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And, no, it sucked.

1113
01:11:29,974 --> 01:11:33,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And another game I have a bias against is Suzuka 8-Hour.

1114
01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:37,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom when we got inspection.

1115
01:11:38,602 --> 01:11:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1116
01:11:39,163 --> 01:11:41,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like hard driving, though, because I took a nap in one once.

1117
01:11:41,937 --> 01:11:44,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you want to say about OutRun, Jamie?

1118
01:11:44,838 --> 01:11:45,578
[SPEAKER_01]: OutRun is great.

1119
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:46,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, check it out.

1120
01:11:46,878 --> 01:11:49,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, is OutRun.

1121
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:54,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Available on the arcades, just about every Sega system ever made as well.

1122
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out.

1123
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably the PC as well, and hell, some Nintendo systems too.

1124
01:11:59,621 --> 01:12:00,842
[SPEAKER_01]: OutRun 2006 was PC.

1125
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:01,602
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1126
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:02,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out.

1127
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:10,604
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we'll be back in just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B. And tonight, boys and girls...

1128
01:12:11,357 --> 01:12:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little while, but we're going to have the match game tonight.

1129
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it's been a little while.

1130
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play some match game tonight as long as we have some guests here.

1131
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Mo, you're going to stay with us for Part B, right?

1132
01:12:18,644 --> 01:12:19,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1133
01:12:19,225 --> 01:12:21,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not hang out with the strangers from the internet a little more?

1134
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:22,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

1135
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:23,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dead in a ditch yet.

1136
01:12:23,169 --> 01:12:25,191
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get much stranger than this.

1137
01:12:25,211 --> 01:12:27,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you lose match game, Mo, that's it.

1138
01:12:27,813 --> 01:12:28,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be.

1139
01:12:28,294 --> 01:12:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1140
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jake, you're going to play some match game with us too as well, right?

1141
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:35,828
[SPEAKER_04]: But the stakes in tonight's match game are very high.

1142
01:12:35,848 --> 01:12:36,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

1143
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, and it's not for us here in studio, but for the listeners that will be playing, we're going to give away something.

1144
01:12:42,171 --> 01:12:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1145
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:48,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We're giving away a code for Rez HD on the Xbox 360 as the prize tonight in the match game.

1146
01:12:48,454 --> 01:12:55,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes to you courtesy of an OLR listener out of the kindness of their heart is donating this prize tonight for the match game.

1147
01:12:55,397 --> 01:13:02,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you more about it when we come back for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. In the meantime, we're going to take a little break and we'll see you in a little while.

1148
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1149
01:13:08,307 --> 01:13:12,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
