00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:33,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

4
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:56,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem was he already bought the game, so he has no use for the code.

5
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to pay it forward tonight.

6
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:02,568
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our OLR listeners is going to pass on the code to our winner tonight of the match game.

7
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Actdeft.

8
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody say it with me.

9
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Actdeft.

10
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,031
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

11
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to be giving that away a little later in the show, but before we do that, we have got to get back into some gaming news, and Loki's going to kick it off tonight.

12
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:16,336
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

13
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:17,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

14
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,776
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two big games that they announced on Nintendo's reports for 2008.

15
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:31,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a huge surprise, though, that Animal Crossing and the new Kirby game are coming to the Wii in 2008.

16
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Most likely, though, it's only the Japanese Wii in 2008.

17
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:39,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe shortly after, in 2009, we'll see Animal Crossing here.

18
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, though, I would hope it's this year as well.

19
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,180
[SPEAKER_07]: But no word on exactly what, you know...

20
00:01:48,213 --> 00:02:03,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Music, Disaster Day of Crisis, Super Mario Stadium, Baseball, and Everyone's Common Knowledge Television, which I'm assuming is not coming over here.

21
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:10,449
[SPEAKER_07]: It also shows Mario Kart Wii, still expected for Spring in North America, and Quarter 2 for Europe.

22
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:16,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So, do we know anything more about that Animal Crossing on the Wii?

23
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, is it actually going to be an MMO or anything?

24
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:19,489
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea.

25
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all we just kind of know is it's coming soon.

26
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:30,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I would imagine keep your expectations low because if you're expecting an MMO from Nintendo, I mean, come on.

27
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:33,018
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't embrace online, really.

28
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:34,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point, good point.

29
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I do love my Animal Crossing, so I'm hopeful.

30
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:38,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just leave it that way.

31
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:39,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hopeful.

32
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, if Animal Crossing and Kirby don't do it for... Actually, wait, let me backtrack a little bit, because I know, DarkSakura, you're a big Animal Crossing fan.

33
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:52,366
[SPEAKER_08]: If Nintendo happens to be listening right now, what do you hope that they implement in the next Animal Crossing game on the Wii?

34
00:02:54,926 --> 00:03:07,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I would actually like to see... And maybe this is a little bit odd, but I'd like to see a character be able to be the mayor, I think, of the town, instead of having...

35
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:08,973
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, everything.

36
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Be the Tom Nook conglomerate.

37
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:15,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to see you be able to control development of the town.

38
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:17,399
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, new shops, new things.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of expand the whole thing that makes a town work.

40
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So like a promotion?

41
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:23,424
[SPEAKER_08]: A way to promote?

42
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:26,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a job and promote up so you're just not Tom Nook's bitch the whole time?

43
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:28,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of?

44
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess so.

45
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the ability to put Tom Nook out of work.

46
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:37,786
[SPEAKER_07]: and put him on the street.

47
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him do bitch work for me.

48
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him sleep with the fishes.

49
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:41,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

50
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a big fan of Animal Crossing, Moe?

51
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:47,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have issues with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon.

52
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,890
[SPEAKER_12]: They're too boring.

53
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,791
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Kirby?

54
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a fan of Kirby?

55
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:51,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I do like Kirby.

56
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,072
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you hope they put in the next Kirby game?

57
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if it's going on the Wii, they should do something like Canvas Curse.

58
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Canvas Curse was so awesome.

59
00:03:58,775 --> 00:03:59,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Canvas Curse was pretty fun.

60
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Parappa the Rapper

61
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,104
[SPEAKER_08]: and yeah, it's another music-based game on the Wii.

62
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,205
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Wii Music.

63
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:26,745
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something else.

64
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:29,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Major Miners Majestic March.

65
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it's Major Miner Majestic March.

66
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:37,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming from designer Masuya Matsura and artist Rodney Greenblatt.

67
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:40,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you're going to be doing in the game, you use the Wii Remote to keep tempo.

68
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

69
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:09,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Unjamalami 2 on the Wii

70
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:33,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen to that.

71
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you a band nerd, Mo?

72
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:02,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't a band nerd.

73
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:02,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I was a theater geek.

74
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:03,994
[SPEAKER_08]: You were a theater geek.

75
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:04,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

76
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I was the AV nerd and the theater geek.

77
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think this game might still appeal to you?

78
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:09,998
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be fun.

79
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:10,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be fun.

80
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I could wave my hands around like a tardigan.

81
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it'll be like most Wii games?

82
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun for an hour and then sell it back?

83
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

84
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:18,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

85
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:19,545
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you, Loki?

86
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you excited about Major Miners?

87
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:22,347
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

88
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no interest in this game.

89
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Then let's go to the next story.

90
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:27,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

91
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:39,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for our soccer fans, actually, well, I'm sure there's plenty of soccer fans in the UK, as in real football.

92
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:41,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my own bias.

93
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:50,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Electronic Arts, though, is saying that they are not releasing UEFA Euro 2008 on Wii and DS in Europe at all.

94
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:57,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, they pretty much have the market, I think, because they had FIFA 08 last year.

95
00:06:58,609 --> 00:06:58,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Euro 2008 Euro 2008

96
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I the only one that sees the humor in that?

97
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're just not bringing down the Wii and DS.

98
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the two soccer games that EA puts out, it's the lesser of the two.

99
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:38,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it doesn't sell very well over here, that's for sure.

100
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fine, Debbie Downer.

101
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: No one likes obscure soccer games, apparently.

103
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:49,024
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll just play FIFA if they want to play FIFA.

104
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's just like...

105
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:56,606
[SPEAKER_07]: EA tries to put all these weird ones out there like Arena Football or Rugby and stuff like that.

106
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't knock the Rugby game.

107
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:03,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm sure in their respective areas they're good, but no one buys them.

108
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least not that many people buy them.

109
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:08,229
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

110
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe one of these new games will prove you wrong, but we'll see.

111
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

112
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this game will prove us wrong.

113
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Eternity's Child.

114
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:27,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game that was originally designed to come out on the Xbox 360 as part of the XNA program, but now they've been porting that over to the WiiWare service that's still not out yet.

115
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is scheduled sometime quarter to 2008.

116
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:38,241
[SPEAKER_07]: It will set you back 500 Wii points, so it's nice to see that there will be some more inexpensive games on the WiiWare service.

117
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:39,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it looks pretty cool.

118
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,224
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all hand-drawn by cartoonist Luke Bernard, and...

119
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool looking platform game.

120
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we'll hear more about the WiiWare service in a couple weeks during Game Developers Conference.

121
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:56,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guessing that's when they're going to drop the bomb on that.

122
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, WiiWare should have been out pretty soon.

123
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,503
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought it was going to come out late last year.

124
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:01,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't happen.

125
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So it should be coming out sooner rather than later, right?

126
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:05,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think so.

127
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:06,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

128
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:11,302
[SPEAKER_08]: JAPAN SOLD HALF MILLION COPIES OF SMASH BROTHERS BRAWL IN ONE DAY

129
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:32,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Those numbers coming from a Japanese blog, Amiibo.jp.

130
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:38,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, it's reported that Brawl is the fastest-selling Wii title.

131
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:44,586
[SPEAKER_08]: It sold through 80% of its initial stock, and that was 500,000 copies.

132
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And now everybody's wondering, is it going to match that in the U.S.?

133
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:49,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

134
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Mo, I know you work in a game shop, so you take pre-orders for this stuff.

135
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it look like it's going to smash records left and right?

136
00:09:56,153 --> 00:09:56,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus Christ, yes.

137
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:57,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

138
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I like it.

139
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Japan has a smaller market than the U.S.

140
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,762
[SPEAKER_07]: does anyways, and that's not even counting Europe, too.

141
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:09,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll easily sell 500,000 copies in one day.

142
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:13,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised if it sells a million copies in the first day.

143
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:16,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, how many people in America actually own Wiis, though?

144
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be about...

145
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:21,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be done.

146
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:22,689
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be about one in eight.

147
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:26,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Still more and more selling, you know, as this date approaches in March, too.

148
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you could top Halo?

149
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:29,814
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

150
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:34,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Day one, probably not, but overall, I think so.

151
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:35,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Overall, maybe, yeah.

152
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might top Halo 3, but not Halo 2.

153
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

154
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:40,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo 3 was pretty huge.

155
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:40,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

156
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:41,303
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

157
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, in the long run.

158
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:44,226
[SPEAKER_08]: In the long run.

159
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I believe Halo 2 doesn't matter.

160
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Every game's going to be Grand Theft Auto 4's bitch anyway, so...

161
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

162
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how many copies of, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sold just because of the drama over that, do you think?

163
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:23,943
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.

164
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,445
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, how many people now do you think are going to be, oh, what's this one going to do?

165
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,706
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to be the new thing?

166
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:34,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that honestly it is going to sort of overplay.

167
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

168
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope not, but I'm pretty sure it will.

169
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, look how amazing Grand Theft Auto 3 was when it came out.

170
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:43,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just absolutely awesome.

171
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I took a day off of work to play that game, by the way.

172
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:50,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I took off a week of school to play Final Fantasy VI

173
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VI is pretty epic.

174
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You would need like a whole week off of work, though, when that game first came out.

175
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:18,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I pretended I had the flu.

176
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:23,339
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some more gaming news and things we might call in sick for in the future.

177
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:27,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that I'd be calling in sick for this if I can... There we go.

178
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:28,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid Firefox.

179
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:36,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo has registered a patent for a casing for Wii Remote.

180
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:44,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is quoted as saying, A video game controller for video game and receptor assembly.

181
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,824
[SPEAKER_10]: A receptor having a shape substantially similar to a component appearing in the video game.

182
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,829
[SPEAKER_10]: The receptor may be a gun-shaped subunit, is what it also says.

183
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,812
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's a drawing that was included with it.

184
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:04,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're actually, in fact, I'm pulling up the drawing right now.

185
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:07,741
[SPEAKER_10]: A Teddy Bear?

186
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,141
[SPEAKER_10]: A Teddy Bear?

187
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm pulling up the drawings now just to see everything else that was on there.

188
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, Acrobat is slow.

189
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:42,182
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

190
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, DarkSakura in our chat room at chat.originalsradio.com exclaims what some of us are saying.

191
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they really considering doing some of those?

192
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a teddy bear?

193
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those are just what the fuck.

194
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's kind of stupid for them to even try to patent, you know, putting, you know, like a tennis racket or fishing rod controller.

195
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already got them out there for the Wii.

196
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a little late to the game, just like they were with the whole zapper attachment and stuff for the, you know, the Wii and also the Wii wheel that's going to be coming out with Mario Kart, which is completely retarded, but

197
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, I guess people want that crap.

198
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't make a game any better.

199
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:30,588
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to go really into detail as far as these patents go, I guess.

200
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:34,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I will immediately throw away that wheel when it comes with Mario Kart.

201
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Out the window it will go.

202
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:40,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there's the one on here for the wheel, and the one that looks like the zapper.

203
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:44,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is sort of cool, but the helmet one, I'm sorry.

204
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,760
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had virtual reality helmets from Nintendo before.

205
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they trying to give us all migraines again?

206
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,501
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I still haven't forgiven them for the virtual boy.

207
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:59,983
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair is kind of cool, but they have one also that looks like it's trying to remake the Power Glove.

208
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:01,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool!

209
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:02,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, dear God.

210
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:03,584
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so bad!

211
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:06,825
[SPEAKER_10]: There is...

212
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,173
[SPEAKER_10]: The racket one makes sense to me.

213
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,634
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a skateboard one on here, too.

214
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: But the bike is like, what are they going to do, bring us Prop Cycle?

215
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:23,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting thought from AlphaCanongram in chat says, it's to prevent others from creating crap to ruin the Wii, but it didn't work.

216
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,276
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've already, that's the thing, though.

217
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:29,017
[SPEAKER_07]: If this was to prevent other people from making this crap, they're a little late.

218
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,078
[SPEAKER_07]: They already have this stuff out there.

219
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,738
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't patent something after it's already been out.

220
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess maybe you can, but, you know.

221
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.

222
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:40,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on.

223
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:45,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I know really they should be threatened by putting a Wiimote in a teddy bear.

224
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I would do it.

225
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:48,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dumb.

226
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:51,808
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it for, like some teddy bear hugging game?

227
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:54,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so I can hug him and squeeze him and love him.

228
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the baby shaking game.

229
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:59,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You see, but they can't use a baby, so they have like a teddy bear.

230
00:15:59,415 --> 00:15:59,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

231
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You can shake the teddy bear all you want to.

232
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:03,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill Teddy Ruxpin the game.

233
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:04,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

234
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,364
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they are, and I have to, this is coming out sometime soon.

235
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:14,018
[SPEAKER_07]: within the next few months, they are bringing the Build-A-Bear workshop to the Wii instead of just the DS.

236
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can create virtual bears.

237
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:17,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it on the DS already.

238
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I did not pay 80 bucks a piece.

239
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,781
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you still have to do the little dance with your hands in the air and the spinning?

240
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't do that.

241
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,582
[SPEAKER_08]: At least I can do it in the privacy of my own home.

242
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:31,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's another bright idea.

243
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently someone thought it was an awesome idea to bring out Saw, the game.

244
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,540
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

245
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,309
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:23,112
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

247
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:24,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

248
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:27,534
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems like fan service or something to me.

249
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is... Brash Entertainment has made an announcement that they're going to make an interactive Saw game.

250
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

251
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it going to be like Manhunt?

252
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And get banned everywhere?

253
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:42,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And even worse than Manhunt somehow?

254
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:43,243
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be on the Wii.

255
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

256
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,244
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just going to be PlayStation 3 and 360.

257
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:46,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the other thing, though.

258
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking, though, they're going to try to build off the controversy of Manhunt 2.

259
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course...

260
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,635
[SPEAKER_07]: 2009 people will forget about Manhunt 2, I think.

261
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, this game is so wrong on so many levels.

262
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a story on Manhunt 2 last week and I've already forgotten about it.

263
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:10,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Because A, you know, obviously people are totally, you know, they look at video games and movies in complete different ways when, you know, obviously they shouldn't.

264
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:14,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the Saw franchise is just as gory as, you know, Manhunt 2 and all that.

265
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just going to continue to give video games a bad name and fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courts.

266
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we call, rhymes with

267
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means we have to bring in the FUs of the week.

268
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:09,188
[SPEAKER_10]: The first of my FUs of the week, because I have had a pretty crazy week, goes towards needles.

269
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:19,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not really afraid of needles, because, um, I don't know, I'm just really not afraid of needles anymore, but this is a really big freaking needle.

270
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:26,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a cortisone shot in my hand, and it actually wasn't that bad, because my regular doctor is really cool and lets me watch.

271
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,200
[SPEAKER_10]: The other doctor wouldn't let me watch.

272
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,000
[SPEAKER_10]: He was mean.

273
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:30,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

274
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:34,402
[SPEAKER_10]: But then my hand hurt for a couple of days and I couldn't play anything.

275
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:37,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have to go to an orthopedist next week.

276
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:42,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm a little bit antsy about surgery because I've only ever had surgery once in my life.

277
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:43,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was Wisdom Teeth.

278
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:46,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know how long I was messed up after that?

279
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Four months.

280
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So, F you to my stupid tendons.

281
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:54,409
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

282
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you have any FUs of the week you'd like to give out?

283
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:01,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my FU of the week goes to Microsoft for making the shoddy system of the Xbox 360.

284
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired of having to fix this stupid three-ring system.

285
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:14,437
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really pissing me off because what I have to do to fix it, in other words, take a heat gun to it, involves me pulling off the heat sink and then I heat it up and do all that stuff.

286
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:17,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to put a boiler at it so it looks like I'm actually cooking the thing.

287
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that works, I have to put everything back together, reapply, you know, the...

288
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:28,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing this at work, by the way.

289
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:32,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, have all the parts strewn all across, you know, the conference room table.

290
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:38,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, this last time, this better fucking work, because I am getting really fed up with it.

291
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:42,057
[SPEAKER_07]: The other system I fixed works perfectly.

292
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:50,119
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is being a little bitch and won't fucking work, so... Fuck Microsoft, because there's no reason that I should have two systems dying to me.

293
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:56,459
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week goes to insomnia because I've had it most of the week and I think it was causing me to get sick.

294
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:03,121
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd like to counteractively give a thank you of the week to Airborne because vitamin C is awesome and made me not get totally sick.

295
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was great.

296
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,042
[SPEAKER_08]: But FU to lack of sleep and getting sick.

297
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:09,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Mo, I don't know if you're familiar with this segment.

298
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:12,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have anything you'd like to just say FU to on the air?

299
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:13,764
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that I still suck at Halo 3.

300
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:15,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen to that.

301
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:17,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I will never get first-person shooters.

302
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:18,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I just never will.

303
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:19,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Console.

304
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:20,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't do it.

305
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me a keyboard and a mouse, goddammit.

306
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:27,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just some people weren't built to play console shooters.

307
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:27,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

308
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:32,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I can get the running down, and I can get the shooting down, but if you want me to point, I'm screwed.

309
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Just use the caboose method.

310
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Let everyone else kill each other off.

311
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,942
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they all know that I'm the weaker player, so everyone picks me off in multiplayer.

312
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:39,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Bastards.

313
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:40,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't.

314
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:42,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, I know you're busy with Smash Bros.

315
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl, but do you have anything you'd like to give an F you to?

316
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that's making you angry?

317
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:47,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazingly, no.

318
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, F you to you for being so perky.

319
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:58,539
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the cool thing about this game is you can actually pause it and then rotate around and take snapshots.

320
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,242
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, for those that weren't listening to the bonus segment, we are playing Smash Bros.

321
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:03,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl here in studio.

322
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:08,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake's walking us through the game here, and you can watch the action on our Justin.TV feed, which should be archived.

323
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:10,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure somebody will make a highlight out of it.

324
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:13,856
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to check it out.

325
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:15,672
[SPEAKER_08]: But not for much longer.

326
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:18,614
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be pointing the camera back on the studio very soon.

327
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:22,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Lab in chat says we need more studio view on cam and less Super Smash Bros.

328
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:22,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Ball.

329
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:22,976
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, soon.

330
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:23,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, I promise.

331
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:25,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe after a couple more matches.

332
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:27,079
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

333
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:30,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into the gaming news.

334
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:36,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And this almost makes me want to bring on the FUs of the week again because I'm so ready for this game.

335
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:37,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Spore...

336
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:50,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently now, during an EA conference call, the CEO of EA, John Riccatello, told the audience that Spore will not be making fiscal 08.

337
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:54,665
[SPEAKER_08]: But will it be making calendar year 08 at all?

338
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Or will it be actually pushed back to 2009?

339
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:01,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And still within the 2009 fiscal year, but literally like a year from now.

340
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:05,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the CEO was not going to give a specific date.

341
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:10,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It does seem, though, confident that the game will be out before the holidays.

342
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,009
[SPEAKER_08]: But that could be like December 24th.

343
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,911
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, actually, it could be after Christmas because it could be like Kwanzaa he's talking about as the holidays.

344
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,031
[SPEAKER_08]: You just don't know.

345
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,872
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be Chinese New Year, that's right.

346
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:21,932
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be January, who knows.

347
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,813
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be July 4th, that's still a holiday.

348
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,013
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, of 2009.

349
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:32,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows, but I don't like hearing that Spore keeps getting delayed because I'm so ready for this game to come out.

350
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:35,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he celebrates sleep year as a holiday, so he's referring to next sleep year.

351
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:37,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

352
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:42,480
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, let's get back to some other gaming news.

353
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I do have some happy in regards to Knights.

354
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:46,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God, we need it.

355
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:48,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you, Sega.

356
00:23:49,952 --> 00:24:01,594
[SPEAKER_10]: They're having different, I would have to say, celebrations that go on every month as far as different content in the game.

357
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:04,895
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they say that you use the Wii Weather Channel to change the weather.

358
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:08,836
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another bit of additional hidden content.

359
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:19,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So you basically raise your own A-Life and the hidden content will let you have different monthly celebrations since it's going by the Wii's time clock.

360
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:26,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So in January they have of course the New Year with fireworks.

361
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:30,165
[SPEAKER_10]: In February they have the Chinese New Year.

362
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have a big dragon hanging out and firecrackers and stuff.

363
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:40,107
[SPEAKER_10]: In March it's carnivals and the people in the game will have masks on

364
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,730
[SPEAKER_10]: April is Flamenco-inspired roses.

365
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,171
[SPEAKER_10]: May is the Boys Festival, which is a Japanese holiday.

366
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:55,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's May 5th, and there's a big carp streamer hanging in it.

367
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:57,633
[SPEAKER_10]: June is weddings.

368
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:02,254
[SPEAKER_10]: July is the Bull Running Festival.

369
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:08,475
[SPEAKER_10]: August, all the residents in the game are going to be playing instruments.

370
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:12,967
[SPEAKER_10]: September has full moon paper fans.

371
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:18,652
[SPEAKER_10]: October is the Halloween theme with witches and pumpkin lanterns and stuff like that.

372
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:24,337
[SPEAKER_10]: November is autumn leaves falling and fruit.

373
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:34,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And December is Santa and the Christmas tree and all kinds of Christmassy stuff.

374
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:34,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas nights.

375
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:36,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas nights, yeah, I know.

376
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:37,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Christmas nights.

377
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if this is going to actually break my household tradition.

378
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:43,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you've never said that on the show before, that you love Christmas nights.

379
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I think every week Jamie finds a reason to bring up Christmas nights.

380
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, happy 4th of July, everybody.

381
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to play Christmas nights this December.

382
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:56,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever since I moved to California, every Christmas we break out Saturn and we play Christmas nights.

383
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:01,696
[SPEAKER_08]: She's having to tell this story to Moe because she's like, oh, Moe maybe hasn't heard this before.

384
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:03,997
[SPEAKER_12]: You just like telling the story.

385
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:04,437
[SPEAKER_12]: It's okay.

386
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

387
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:05,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It is fun.

388
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:08,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Christmas night.

389
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Traditions are good.

390
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:10,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Traditions are good.

391
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:14,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have to borrow my French-Japanese copy of Christmas night since it's exactly the same.

392
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:16,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It just gets a nice hard case and not a paper case.

393
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

394
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I was curious.

395
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:28,403
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounds like a fun way to at least pop in the game once a month and kind of check it out, see what's going on, right?

396
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a cool thing, but what if they have a...

397
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:36,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Different things to happen, you know, over different years, you know, something that could be updated in the game.

398
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:36,583
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

399
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:42,265
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, remember, like, Animal Crossing had all the funny stuff that happened on holidays, and it gave you a reason to, like, turn on the game.

400
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:43,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, even New Year's Eve.

401
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:45,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played in six months.

402
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:45,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's New Year's.

403
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you don't want to wait a year long, just mess with your time clock in your Wii, and you can see all these within, like, an hour.

404
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the spirit.

405
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:56,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, cheater.

406
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:56,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not cheating.

407
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:58,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm exploiting time.

408
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Never give this man a TARDIS.

409
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,493
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be awesome.

410
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, why don't you exploit some more news for us, Loki?

411
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:28,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the latest copy of the official Xbox magazine has the content for Rock Band outlined for March, which reminds me that I haven't bought the February issue of the official Xbox magazine, which had those three free tracks on there with freeze pop and stuff.

412
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:33,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy has the CD, one of our frequent guests, Puppy, and maybe I'll make him come to the show next week.

413
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So bring your Xbox.

414
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy, come to the show next week.

415
00:27:35,951 --> 00:27:36,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thanks.

416
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:37,432
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

417
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring Xbox Magazine.

418
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:54,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some of the packs that they have outlined, March 4th, we're getting the Thrash Pack, which is going to have At the Gates, Blinded by Fear, Evil Thrashes, The Haunted with Shadow World,

419
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not familiar with any of those, but here at the gates, Blind About Fear is supposed to be pretty good.

420
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:12,066
[SPEAKER_07]: On March 11th, they've got some individual songs, including Bad Company with Shooting Star, which is a cover, Leonard Skinner with Simple Man, and The Police with Message in a Bottle.

421
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:20,769
[SPEAKER_07]: March 18th, they have the Nine Inch Nails Pack, including March of the Pigs, The Collector, and The Perfect Drug.

422
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, March 25th,

423
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:35,349
[SPEAKER_07]: has the metal pack with Iron Maiden's Wraith Child, which is a cover, Black Sabbath Supernaut, which is a cover, and the one I'm really looking forward to, Metallica with Fuel.

424
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that song I said should have been in Rock Band in the first place.

425
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:41,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's awesome.

426
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:48,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming all of them are going to be $4.40 for the pack and $1.60 for each song individually.

427
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray!

428
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:52,835
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea though what's coming out for February though.

429
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:59,382
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, those of you guys on the Wii have been missing out on all this Rock Band goodness, but maybe not for much longer.

430
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:09,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, going back to the EA conversation, apparently it was confirmed that there is the coming launch of Rock Band for the Wii.

431
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:15,051
[SPEAKER_08]: The CEO, John Riccatello, referred to a coming launch of the Wii version of Rock Band.

432
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And IGN said, I don't know, they just really wanted to seek out a firm confirmation that

433
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:25,157
[SPEAKER_08]: and got him to admit that yes, the game will be making a Wii debut.

434
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,959
[SPEAKER_08]: But no release date given, nothing else given.

435
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:40,709
[SPEAKER_08]: But by the way, in a related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but some standalone microphones came out for Rock Band and they say something on them about works on the Nintendo Wii, which is hilarious because there is no Rock Band on the Wii yet and they don't work anyway.

436
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:45,455
[SPEAKER_08]: So EA had to put out a My Bad right now.

437
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be a retail nightmare when the Wii version does come out.

438
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:50,577
[SPEAKER_08]: People say, I bought this microphone.

439
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:52,018
[SPEAKER_08]: It said it's going to work on the Wii.

440
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:56,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand why they don't work on the Wii.

441
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking USB microphone.

442
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those have got to be pretty standardized anyway.

443
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the USB on Nintendo is retarded.

444
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like USB .5.

445
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually slower than USB 1.

446
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:08,964
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be awesome.

447
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:10,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

448
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:17,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now it's time for us to get to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

449
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:21,347
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a chance for you to talk to us a little bit with the mailbag.

450
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:24,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

451
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:27,632
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads them on the air.

452
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:33,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, why don't you put your hand in the mail back there and pull out a few emails.

453
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we get a lot of emails this week?

454
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:35,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, we did.

455
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:36,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

456
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess you can't read them all, but pick some of your favorites.

457
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:45,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there were a couple that were really long, including one from our friend who made us the offer from Disney World.

458
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We must do.

459
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:49,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

460
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:53,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're making jokes about the stalker thing.

461
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:53,911
[SPEAKER_10]: We know better.

462
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:54,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me.

463
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:54,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

464
00:30:56,625 --> 00:31:06,493
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, this one, um, is, um, I'm just going to use, go by the email name, uh, Lord Katakos, because there's no signature on it.

465
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:11,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I am new to the podcast, and I was wondering if you guys and girl ever talked about MapleStory.

466
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:15,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I enjoy this game a lot, um, a lot more than Ragnarok, in my opinion.

467
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:20,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, anyway, my undead mage could destroy any of your World of Warcraft accounts.

468
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:24,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you guys, uh, like, got the micro and stuff.

469
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep giving out the spanks to the noobs.

470
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,650
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, that is my priest pic.

471
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm on my PSP.

472
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,213
[SPEAKER_10]: And he sent a picture titled Ugly Mages.

473
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:42,359
[SPEAKER_10]: But the mailbag is got PMS.

474
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:47,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't let me actually really get to take a look at the images.

475
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:48,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So sorry.

476
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't see it.

477
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, here we go.

478
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never played MapleStory.

479
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:58,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard about it.

480
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:58,459
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

481
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,639
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people that like it.

482
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at this.

483
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:00,360
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

484
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played it, Mo?

485
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved MapleStory.

486
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.

487
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... Well, that's a cute little banner.

488
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:08,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

489
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:09,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.

490
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:09,803
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.

491
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,363
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like Ragnarok, where it has the little guy avatars and everything.

492
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,444
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just another RPG.

493
00:32:14,504 --> 00:32:15,704
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a chibi good time.

494
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:16,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it's a chibi good time.

495
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:20,186
[SPEAKER_12]: They're supposed to be making one for DS, and I'm waiting for that anxiously.

496
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:20,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard about that.

497
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It would never happen, though.

498
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:22,067
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be fun.

499
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:23,367
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

500
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:28,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, so it looks like there are some MapleStory fans here, so you're in good company.

501
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:33,690
[SPEAKER_10]: This one actually is addressed to Loki from Azurame.

502
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:41,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't quite remember, but in a past episode of OLR, I remember you stating you were able to play games on your Wii.

503
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:41,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this true?

504
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:42,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Please answer back, thanks.

505
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:45,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it means the imports, which we've obviously proven.

506
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can play games on my Wii.

507
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:47,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

508
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:51,674
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been listening to tonight's show, obviously since we have Smash Bros.

509
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:54,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl in the house and it's an import copy, yes, you can play import.

510
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:56,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I have a mod chip in mind.

511
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,341
[SPEAKER_10]: This one comes from Osfer.

512
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:04,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It turns out my parents will finally be getting high-speed internet.

513
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:09,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, believe it or not, I've had to suffer the pains and torture of dial-up for years.

514
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So I resort to web browsing on my iPhone for now.

515
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,571
[SPEAKER_10]: iPhone.

516
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:17,559
[SPEAKER_10]: But in about a week, I'll be able to finally listen live and even work up the nerve to call in.

517
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking to you guys would be like talking to celebrities, so yeah, I'd be nervous.

518
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:26,785
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm sure talking about gaming would put me at ease.

519
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:29,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, and I hope to be a live listener soon.

520
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:29,847
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

521
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,509
[SPEAKER_10]: How come I can't access your chat room on iPhone?

522
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:33,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it with other sites before.

523
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it because it's Java?

524
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:36,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, yeah.

525
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,994
[SPEAKER_10]: The iPhone has problems with Java, but I think that

526
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:41,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

527
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:47,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't updated my software on my iPhone yet, so maybe that will change.

528
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:52,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I can't watch any YouTube videos if they're embedded, unless I actually just use the YouTube channel.

529
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,284
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because it's the iPhone?

530
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:55,445
[SPEAKER_10]: No, iPhone's great.

531
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:02,710
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I didn't mean to sound like I was bashing our emailer when they said that talking to us would be like talking to celebrities.

532
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, you know, it's a compliment.

533
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:06,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

534
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, we're just...

535
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:08,819
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

536
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't card Moe.

537
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I can pull out my wallet.

538
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:27,144
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 22.

539
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,164
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

540
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:28,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

541
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:28,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Good enough.

542
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:36,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I want to really quickly, before I get to the next email, I'm so sorry, but there was a very good question asked in chat that I think is a thing to address right now.

543
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:44,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And someone in chat, they didn't change their nickname, so I just know them as OLARMYRecruit9348 says, someone please tell me how to find Moe on YouTube.

544
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And it made me realize I'm so rude.

545
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:48,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I never let Moe plug her stuff.

546
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, plug away.

547
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,683
[SPEAKER_08]: How can they find your performance from Moe?

548
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:53,003
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

549
00:34:53,163 --> 00:34:55,106
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look up the username Amixia.

550
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:58,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you can actually go to youtube.com slash Amixia.

551
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:06,681
[SPEAKER_12]: It's A-M-I-X-I-A and it's me being a retard with my digital camera and the color tends to change because it's a really bad video camera.

552
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,405
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awesome, but it's me being a retard.

553
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:10,987
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Amixia on YouTube.

554
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:11,844
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all right.

555
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:13,226
[SPEAKER_08]: They're listening to us being retards right now.

556
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:13,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all good.

557
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:13,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It works.

558
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:14,487
[SPEAKER_08]: It works.

559
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:15,468
[SPEAKER_08]: You're in good company.

560
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other websites you work with?

561
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a live journal.

562
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:22,455
[SPEAKER_12]: You can check all my YouTube stuff on there because I'll post those publicly.

563
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,939
[SPEAKER_12]: My username is Furious, spelled exactly like Furious.

564
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:26,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

565
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the most awesome username ever.

566
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:28,702
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty good username.

567
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:29,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats.

568
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:30,303
[SPEAKER_12]: I also have a website.

569
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:30,604
[SPEAKER_12]: It's...

570
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Pride.net, and I never update it.

571
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:36,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the last video on there was never going to give you up, so I should probably fix that.

572
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:40,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just like we have a PSP site that I never update.

573
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,610
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't update our websites either.

574
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

575
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Pride.net has updates.

576
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,292
[SPEAKER_08]: We were supposed to have a new URL on our website like the first of the year.

577
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:45,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't happen.

578
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:47,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't happen.

579
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:47,814
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

580
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:48,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.

581
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:51,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So now there you go to our listener.

582
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, you can get back to emails now, but that was something very important.

583
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very important.

584
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:55,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

585
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So next one comes from Ali.

586
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Ali.

587
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,552
[SPEAKER_10]: On episode 264, I'm glad you're keeping track of episode numbers because I'm not.

588
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:07,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki goes on an anti-MacBook Air rant.

589
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:15,396
[SPEAKER_10]: As an Apple fanboy, I must say that the MacBook Air is a triumph of engineering and a beautiful machine, and I don't think it was intended to play video games on.

590
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:21,858
[SPEAKER_10]: As an Apple stockholder, I can say the MacBook Air blows chunks.

591
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Insert love the show drivel here.

592
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:36,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that I have a problem with it not being able to play games, I really don't care, and I'm sure it can because it's got a core 2D processor in it, but it's just that it doesn't have a CD-ROM drive, or a DVD-ROM drive, or anything like that.

593
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:47,111
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to basically hijack a drive off another computer, or you have to buy a $99 drive that plugs into the single USB port that's on the damn thing.

594
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:53,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just not very... Yeah, it's thin, okay, props for that, and I'm sure it has a nice battery life, but it's...

595
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:57,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, all aesthetics and no functionality.

596
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game radio.

597
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:03,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We never talk computers at all, just video games.

598
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:06,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Computers play games, therefore it works.

599
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,598
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk consoles, consoles play games too.

600
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:09,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, fine, fine.

601
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:14,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, can I keep going now?

602
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:17,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

603
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:18,128
[SPEAKER_10]: This comes from Ryoma.

604
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:31,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, I was just listening to Part B of Episode 265 today, and as excited as I was to hear you talk about Smash Brawl, I have a little something to add to your discussion about the demos.

605
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:43,641
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Japan Official Smash Brawl page, there are two more demos that seem to be exclusive to Japan, Mother 2, Earthbound of course, and the original Fire Emblem, which is where Marth comes from.

606
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:48,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I understand that those two games are out on the Japanese Virtual Console.

607
00:37:48,924 --> 00:38:01,230
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I'm pretty irritated with the fact that Nintendo seems to love to torture us Americans, apologies to all overseas listeners, with the idea of having a new Mother game having Earthbound ported to the GBA, DS, VC, what have you.

608
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:10,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I still love Nintendo to death, and the only next-gen system I have is a Wii, but their seeming lack of interest in what American gamers want is growing frustrating.

609
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:14,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Just made two cents with much love from Chicago, Ryoma.

610
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:26,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand why they're not bringing some of those games over, because Earthbound, I'm sure, has quite a bit of dialogue in there, and they have to localize it, where it's not just, I can throw a copy of the ROM onto the Virtual Console Network.

611
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't understand why they wouldn't put something they'd say localized in

612
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:34,618
[SPEAKER_07]: The UK and bring it over here because, I don't know, that's just lazy.

613
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:39,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Next.

614
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:41,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

615
00:38:41,203 --> 00:38:41,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

616
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, The Doctor here.

617
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to ask what happened to random talk about Battlestar Galactica?

618
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:48,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane moved away.

619
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wondering because after a while, DarkSakura just stopped.

620
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:54,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I never talked about Battlestar Galactica.

621
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,054
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting her confused with Rice Princess.

622
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:56,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

623
00:38:57,825 --> 00:39:00,606
[SPEAKER_10]: and Rob, you still need to send me that MP3 file, please.

624
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:02,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I forgot.

625
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I will.

626
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:05,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Battlestar Galactica comes back in April.

627
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you will hear random Battlestar Galactica chat come back in April.

628
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this show never gets derailed, ever.

629
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:12,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

630
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:13,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

631
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:14,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

632
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:14,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

633
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:15,513
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

634
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:16,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

635
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:24,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been busy playing Wild Arms and Castlevania Symphony of the Night on my PSP after I paid for them on the PlayStation Network.

636
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,678
[SPEAKER_10]: some Call of Duty 4 actually a lot.

637
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and Rez.

638
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yeah, Rez.

639
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:29,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes, Rez.

640
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,099
[SPEAKER_10]: That is one addicting game.

641
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Listening to last week's show while writing this, they retracted their retraction.

642
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,101
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck?

643
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:42,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, it was literally a WTF, but I like saying what the fuck.

644
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:43,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

645
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rob, I challenge you to some Undertow.

646
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:48,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, I was going to go now so you guys can move on.

647
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:48,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.

648
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:50,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really bad at Undertow.

649
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:51,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you want to play me.

650
00:39:51,946 --> 00:39:54,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Play me at something I'm like halfway decent at, like Puzzle Fighter or something.

651
00:39:55,336 --> 00:40:00,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have one more email that's really, really, really, really, really freaking long.

652
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:01,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

653
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Sky, Loki, DarkSakura, and guest host.

654
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:07,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

655
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:08,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Disclaimer.

656
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:16,889
[SPEAKER_10]: First, let me apologize for my bad grammar, as I know you tend to be a stickler for proper grammar, and I tend to disregard proper grammar and spelling whenever I write anything.

657
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:17,469
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

658
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:18,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm used to IMing, Rob.

659
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Burn.

660
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:24,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, bite me.

661
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:26,725
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

662
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:27,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Heart.

663
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:29,827
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought you cake.

664
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:30,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Be nice.

665
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:30,988
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

666
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,029
[SPEAKER_08]: You did buy me cake.

667
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:33,150
[SPEAKER_11]: It was delicious cake.

668
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:33,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Email.

669
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:34,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It was delicious and moist.

670
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Delicious and moist.

671
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:36,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Email.

672
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Email.

673
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:39,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Oscar.

674
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Regarding the Fox News report on Mass Effect.

675
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:45,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Lord.

676
00:40:45,722 --> 00:40:46,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

677
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,343
[SPEAKER_12]: End of email.

678
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:49,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

679
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:16,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Lately with news, it seems that the way to get a top story on the news is simply find something that has a soap opera or scandal written all over it.

680
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:21,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Scandal sell, and it also had to do with sex, which we know the old saying about that.

681
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:26,697
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, children, since the stereotype to a lot of non-gamers is video games are kid stuff.

682
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:45,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Were I a news show producer or a news show host and saw something that implied there was a lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect, I would run with a trashy story like that because if it is true, that can mean a big ratings hike for the show and a possible raise slash promotion for yourself.

683
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:59,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Since video games are considered the current evil that is corrupting our youth, much like rock and roll in the 50s and 60s, violent films in the 80s and 90s, and rock and roll, again, just before the focus shifted to video games.

684
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,140
[SPEAKER_10]: You know that was both Jack Thompson.

685
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, him, too.

686
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:01,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

687
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:06,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I still remember journalists trying to pin the Columbine High School Massacre on Marilyn Manson.

688
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes any scandalous video game story easy prey.

689
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:12,029
[SPEAKER_10]: With a chance that could be...

690
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:36,409
[SPEAKER_10]: that could get a casual gamer concerned parents and people who would act like sex in video games I gotta see what games they mention and start playing them as well as your regular audience to tune in when they might not have also since few outside of gaming world would read or hear any follow up on the story on the net regarding the false statements of the report it would be a quick and easy reading so not everyone would have heard the bad journalism backlash disgusting?

691
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:41,273
[SPEAKER_10]: yes but it also means modern day journalism tactics as well ok discuss so I can take a break

692
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here.

693
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I do understand probably any network would have done it.

694
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:53,119
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

695
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,800
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something about the whole sensationalism of it.

696
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.

697
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like Fox News in general has kind of done this stuff before.

698
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think you're right.

699
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:06,204
[SPEAKER_08]: CNN probably would do something like this too.

700
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean it just kind of depends on – but I don't know.

701
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:08,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like –

702
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:17,983
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actual news to be reported on out there with an election going on right now and things going on in other countries and things.

703
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

704
00:43:20,345 --> 00:43:22,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

705
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Just shouldn't waste our time with that kind of crap.

706
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:28,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

707
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:34,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and didn't they pull the statement like a couple days later when her book on Amazon started getting tanking reviews?

708
00:43:34,997 --> 00:43:36,477
[SPEAKER_08]: She sort of said, I'm sorry.

709
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:40,499
[SPEAKER_12]: She was like, oh, okay, maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.

710
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like a half-assed apology, though.

711
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:46,340
[SPEAKER_08]: She was like, I made a real bad judgment call or something like that.

712
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:52,642
[SPEAKER_08]: But she didn't really say, I'm sorry, gamers, or I'm sorry to the gaming community and to the mature gamers out there.

713
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,083
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't really say anything like that.

714
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:55,663
[SPEAKER_08]: She just said, oh, I done fucked up.

715
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:57,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but...

716
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:07,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't make a statement on Fox News 1, and then once you realize that your review on Amazon is dropping hugely, it took a nosedive.

717
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,951
[SPEAKER_12]: She was like, okay, maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.

718
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,251
[SPEAKER_12]: No shit.

719
00:44:12,852 --> 00:44:14,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there you have it.

720
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:15,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to read out of that email?

721
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:16,174
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty more.

722
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:16,634
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

723
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:22,457
[SPEAKER_10]: As for the... Well, you know, really this is... Actually, I do have to say this is actually more of what...

724
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:29,235
[SPEAKER_10]: We've discussed on the show as well, but I really do like this email, and I'm going to post it on the forum, if I remember to.

725
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:33,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to move on to the drinking game portion.

726
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:34,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

727
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:45,082
[SPEAKER_10]: In other news, I know the game series is a bit touchy subject for you guys and already has great music, but how would a custom soundtrack of Dragon Force or Death Clock be for a Katamari game?

728
00:44:45,923 --> 00:44:46,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, yes.

729
00:44:46,523 --> 00:44:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

730
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Metalocalypse.

731
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

732
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:51,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

733
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:54,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would really change my outlook on the franchise.

734
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:02,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I love its fun, cheesy quirkiness, and I think Dragon Force soundtrack version of the game would make me love it even more for its mass chaos, death, and destruction, as I do love games with mass carnage.

735
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:04,822
[SPEAKER_10]: One last thing, sorta.

736
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,443
[SPEAKER_10]: The OLR drinking games.

737
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:15,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Got a big laugh at the chatroom saying, take a drink whenever Loki leads off the story with anyways, since that first was the first thing that crossed my mind.

738
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very conscious of that now, and I have been not saying that.

739
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,078
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's okay, because now it's part of the drinking game and you want people to drink.

740
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:24,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't want them to die.

741
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,640
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

742
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:29,583
[SPEAKER_07]: They already take a shot every time I say an off-color comment.

743
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:31,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Every five seconds?

744
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,046
[SPEAKER_07]: People should be rushed to the hospital already.

745
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:36,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, he has some suggestions for us.

746
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever the show goes off on a tangent about food... Hey, we've had cake all night, so... Mmm, cake.

747
00:45:43,894 --> 00:45:44,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Delicious cake.

748
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:45,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Moist.

749
00:45:46,556 --> 00:45:49,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever there is Sony bashing after some Sony news...

750
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:53,237
[SPEAKER_10]: The word addict is used after someone mentions playing an MMORPG.

751
00:45:54,557 --> 00:46:01,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime a and he uses the blanking expletive is used outside of the FUs of the week segment.

752
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they can't do that on me then.

753
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime DarkSakura goes What?

754
00:46:06,823 --> 00:46:06,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

755
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:07,584
[SPEAKER_10]: We need the ferret.

756
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:08,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever Loki bashes the Mac

757
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:21,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime there's a mention of that former video game channel that shall not be named.

758
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime there's a mention of that blood-sucking lawyer that shall not be named.

759
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:25,903
[SPEAKER_07]: What, GameProTV?

760
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:29,865
[SPEAKER_07]: With the dreamy J.D.

761
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:30,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Roth.

762
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime Rob says heart to DarkSakura after making fun of her.

763
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:36,590
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the opposite this time.

764
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

765
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:41,453
[SPEAKER_10]: If Raven's Dolphin is the first caller on the Skyplane segment...

766
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:45,443
[SPEAKER_11]: and any mention of Pyramid Head.

767
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:49,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Any caller that calls in on a Skype line that's got a bad connection.

768
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:54,005
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there is a whole thread going on in the forums and I encourage you to add to this.

769
00:46:54,025 --> 00:46:56,446
[SPEAKER_08]: They are actually making an OLR drinking game in the thread.

770
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some more examples of what's going on in the thread here.

771
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:03,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Sky, take a drink every time Sky says, fired.

772
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:03,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Fired!

773
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:07,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Mentions the bet or the tingle costume thing.

774
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Tells a joke that no one laughs at or is met with resounding silence.

775
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:21,424
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura gives an F you to bad drivers or her co-workers or to stupid people in general mentions Shermie the cat and says reject false icons as her final thought

776
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:23,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't said that in a very long time.

777
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:45,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

778
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,002
[SPEAKER_08]: See, how can you not get into a discussion about the Olive Garden when it gets mentioned?

779
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:51,683
[SPEAKER_12]: The minestrone soup is delicious.

780
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:52,263
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

781
00:47:52,923 --> 00:47:54,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the minestrone soup.

782
00:47:54,264 --> 00:47:56,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many beans in the minestrone soup, though.

783
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:57,446
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's what makes it so great.

784
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:58,606
[SPEAKER_10]: The potato soup.

785
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:00,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

786
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:01,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go back to Olive Garden.

787
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:02,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I owe you anyway.

788
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:05,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, kind of going on a food tangent here real quick.

789
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:06,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink.

790
00:48:06,391 --> 00:48:10,733
[SPEAKER_07]: They started carrying these soups at Rayleigh's now where it's –

791
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:15,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually the soup from the guy in New York, you know, the soup Nazi.

792
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:18,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, they call him the Soup Man, but not Soup Nazi.

793
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:20,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But I tried one the other day.

794
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:21,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very good.

795
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,560
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it looked cool.

796
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,461
[SPEAKER_07]: The prospect of getting soup from him, you know, was kind of neat.

797
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,502
[SPEAKER_12]: No soup for you.

798
00:48:27,762 --> 00:48:28,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Come back in one year.

799
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:31,023
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck did that have to do with video gaming?

800
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:33,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Tangent food!

801
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:35,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Food tangent.

802
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you paying attention?

803
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:39,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I finish eating!

804
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:39,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Email!

805
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:42,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You cook soup in Cookie Mama.

806
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:43,829
[SPEAKER_07]: They're Ford's video game related, okay?

807
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:44,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

808
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:44,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite me.

809
00:48:48,432 --> 00:48:54,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I love the show, keep up the great work, and I've really enjoyed DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week segment.

810
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:56,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do miss the old advice column.

811
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see it come back.

812
00:48:57,996 --> 00:48:59,577
[SPEAKER_10]: My advice is, don't be stupid.

813
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:02,679
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sound advice.

814
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:03,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

815
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:09,237
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys are ever in the Napa area, feel free to drop me an email.

816
00:49:09,258 --> 00:49:15,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be glad to take you and your spouses slash boyfriends to dinner at their restaurants around the valley.

817
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:17,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Free food.

818
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:18,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

819
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:19,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I love deals for free food.

820
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:22,826
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a huge massive PS, but Rob, I'm going to leave it for you to read your part later.

821
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

822
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:26,589
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get back to some news now.

823
00:49:27,142 --> 00:49:27,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Shula Shula

824
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

825
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,701
[SPEAKER_07]: CryEngine 2, at least the console port of it.

826
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:46,608
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Game Developers Conference, which is coming up actually in a couple weeks here.

827
00:50:46,768 --> 00:50:52,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully because of that, we will see maybe Crysis come to, you know, console system.

828
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember some talks, or rumors at least, of Crysis coming to the PS3.

829
00:50:58,254 --> 00:50:59,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'd be pretty cool to see happen.

830
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But either way, you know, maybe give something else for game companies to use other than the Unreal 3 engine.

831
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

832
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:17,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and now their engine is fully optimized because if you play it on the PC, the thing eats your PC.

833
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:20,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no matter what kind of hardware you have in there.

834
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:23,488
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess because it wasn't fully optimized.

835
00:51:23,568 --> 00:51:27,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Crytek, for putting out a wonderfully polished game.

836
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:30,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Not optimized one bit.

837
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:30,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

838
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:32,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

839
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if Crysis isn't your thing, which I don't know, I haven't really gotten into Crysis, but I don't know, I could probably get into this game.

840
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:40,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's coming to North America soon.

841
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:44,774
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game called Arcana Heart, and it's coming to the PlayStation 2.

842
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:46,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's the thing about this game.

843
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:47,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an all-girl fighter.

844
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:49,356
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

845
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:51,737
[SPEAKER_08]: All babes duking it out in the arena.

846
00:51:51,797 --> 00:51:53,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like the Asuka 100% series or...

847
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:57,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not quite dead or alive.

848
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just put it that way.

849
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,081
[SPEAKER_08]: They are fully clothed girls, at least the ones here in this screenshot.

850
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:02,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's a lack of boobies.

851
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:04,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is a severe lack of boobies, which is an important issue.

852
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:07,444
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have a little bit of panties in that particular shot.

853
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:08,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Samus.

854
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:09,605
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

855
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:14,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyhow, Atlas has said that the PS2 is still a viable platform.

856
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:18,829
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason to abandon a veteran system just because it isn't the newest thing around.

857
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:23,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the Japanese titles that haven't made its way over here yet, Atlas Plans, or sorry,

858
00:52:24,668 --> 00:52:27,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Atlas plans to bring over here to the States pretty soon.

859
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcana Heart has been confirmed.

860
00:52:29,392 --> 00:52:30,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be coming out on April 8th.

861
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:34,656
[SPEAKER_08]: 11 different customizable girl fighters.

862
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:35,917
[SPEAKER_08]: $29.99 is the price.

863
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:37,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get it.

864
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:38,519
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

865
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be fun.

866
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:42,462
[SPEAKER_10]: We certainly don't have working designs anymore.

867
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well it's about time for us to play a match game.

868
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:49,448
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what time it is.

869
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for the match game.

870
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:52,130
[SPEAKER_08]: We need some theme music for match game tonight.

871
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:57,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jake, you're going to have to pause Smash Brothers for a little bit because we need you to play a match game tonight.

872
00:52:57,495 --> 00:53:00,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, the way a match game works, well, let me get the contestants, then we'll do a match game.

873
00:53:00,336 --> 00:53:01,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mo, why don't you come over here.

874
00:53:01,697 --> 00:53:08,400
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have a whole lot of people say me, but we have about that area right there is a few people that said me.

875
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:13,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So which one of those names do you think is the best, which should play tonight in the match game?

876
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:14,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Mo's thinking.

877
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:16,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheeseburger.

878
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:20,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburger is going to be our chat room player tonight in the match game.

879
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:24,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburgers are pretty rad.

880
00:53:24,138 --> 00:53:24,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

881
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Cheeseburger left chat.

882
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Fail.

883
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:30,221
[SPEAKER_09]: That's epic fail.

884
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Cheeseburger.

885
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,062
[SPEAKER_08]: You lost your opportunity.

886
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:33,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so who else do we have?

887
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, One Night Stands.

888
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Cheeseburger, you left at just like the wrong time.

889
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:51,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have One Night Stands as now our player.

890
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll get in touch with you in chat shortly.

891
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:58,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's open up the Skype line if you want to play with us.

892
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:01,891
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

893
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:04,072
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

894
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:11,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Is something burning?

895
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:13,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it might be the thing behind you.

896
00:54:14,256 --> 00:54:15,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just that hot.

897
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:18,458
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

898
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, is anybody calling us yet?

899
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe nobody wants to play on Skype, I don't know.

900
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here we go, we have a call.

901
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

902
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's SSJ100Matt.

903
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:35,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, SSJ100Matt, congratulations, you're going to be our other contestant on the match game tonight.

904
00:54:35,963 --> 00:54:41,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get to play against One Night Stands in chat, who has yet to confirm with me that he is playing.

905
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:43,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on a minute.

906
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:46,985
[SPEAKER_08]: This is live radio, boys and girls.

907
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:50,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Live radio, folks.

908
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:52,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we cue up the Jeopardy music?

909
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:56,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we should just play the theme music again because it's so much fun to listen to.

910
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.

911
00:54:57,311 --> 00:55:01,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I see him freaking out.

912
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:03,155
I see him freaking out in chat.

913
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:28,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think he got it.

914
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:29,669
[SPEAKER_08]: There he is.

915
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:32,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think he's got it.

916
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:33,852
[SPEAKER_08]: He sent me a private message.

917
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,253
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

918
00:55:34,693 --> 00:55:35,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

919
00:55:35,954 --> 00:55:37,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So, SSJ100Matt, you ready to do this?

920
00:55:39,677 --> 00:55:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt, you there?

921
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:42,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everything's broken tonight.

922
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let me remind you all how this works.

923
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:45,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Jake, you gotta pause the game.

924
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me remind everybody how this works.

925
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,271
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're going to do is we're going to have three questions for you tonight.

926
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:52,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the questions, they all have a blank.

927
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,892
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a blank somewhere in the answer.

928
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:55,052
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever watch the match game in the 70s?

929
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:56,133
[SPEAKER_08]: The reruns on Game Show Network?

930
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:56,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it's just like that.

931
00:55:57,113 --> 00:55:57,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, game stuff.

932
00:55:58,774 --> 00:55:59,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to ask three questions.

933
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:01,035
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a blank in it.

934
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:06,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So our celebrities will think about their answer and write it down on a little piece of paper.

935
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:09,918
[SPEAKER_08]: On my invisible keyboard.

936
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:14,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And then our callers will try to match.

937
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:18,987
[SPEAKER_08]: and for every celebrity they match, they get a point.

938
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:20,768
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it works.

939
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:24,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, all you have to do is think of something funny that goes in the blank.

940
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:25,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Or real.

941
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:25,889
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

942
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you have to do.

943
00:56:27,409 --> 00:56:28,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Go for funny.

944
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:36,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully one night Stan is understanding what's going on because I just got a message that says, Sweet, I don't know what I'm doing.

945
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:39,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Which means you're probably going to win.

946
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:42,054
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100, Matt, you're up against some stiff competition tonight.

947
00:56:42,454 --> 00:56:42,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

948
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Cheeseburger come back?

949
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheeseburger came back and said, what did I miss?

950
00:56:47,331 --> 00:56:49,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

951
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what we'll do since we have a code.

952
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:59,256
[SPEAKER_08]: If it ties 0-0 tonight, if nobody manages to get a point on the board, then we'll give Cheeseburger the code.

953
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:00,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

954
00:57:00,356 --> 00:57:03,778
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Cheeseburger is hoping that everybody is broke.

955
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:05,619
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

956
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,619
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll hope that everyone's a failure.

957
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody fill in time while I type out how to play this to One Night Stands.

958
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:15,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Zero Samus on screen.

959
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:18,734
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny, though, because... I think we have Kirby getting smashed.

960
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:22,355
[SPEAKER_07]: She has, like, her suit, but there's, like, a thong built into the suit.

961
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:23,175
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hot.

962
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:25,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, he understands now.

963
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:25,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good.

964
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:26,016
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

965
00:57:26,296 --> 00:57:29,137
[SPEAKER_08]: See, she has a thong and shiny ass.

966
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:32,578
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, enough of the porno here.

967
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:37,299
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we have One Night Stands, SSJ100 Matt, and Cheeseburger playing tonight.

968
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:38,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our first three-way match game.

969
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburger is simply hoping that no one matches anything.

970
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:42,221
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

971
00:57:43,118 --> 00:57:44,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, question number one.

972
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:50,300
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura was not happy to see Jigglypuff return to Super Smash Bros.

973
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl.

974
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,620
[SPEAKER_08]: However, she likes to always look on the bright side.

975
00:57:54,421 --> 00:58:01,662
[SPEAKER_08]: She let all her friends know that she will actually be looking forward to Jigglypuff in the game because she can kill her by blank.

976
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:09,464
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is not happy that Jigglypuff is in the game, but no worries, she can kill her by blank.

977
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:13,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding!

978
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:13,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding!

979
00:58:13,298 --> 00:58:13,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Ding!

980
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:13,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Ding!

981
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:13,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Ding!

982
00:58:49,423 --> 00:58:50,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, ding.

983
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:53,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an answer, Mo?

984
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't say it yet, but do you know one?

985
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:56,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

986
00:58:56,285 --> 00:58:56,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have one, Jake?

987
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, he has one.

988
00:58:58,466 --> 00:58:59,946
[SPEAKER_08]: S2100 Matt, do you have an answer just in your mind?

989
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:02,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got one.

990
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:04,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm waiting for One Night Stance to send me an answer.

991
00:59:16,612 --> 00:59:17,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, the question...

992
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:23,120
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura was not happy to see Jigglypuff return to Super Smash Bros.

993
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl.

994
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,262
[SPEAKER_08]: However, she likes to always look on the bright side.

995
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:32,985
[SPEAKER_08]: She let all her friends know that she will actually be looking forward to Jigglypuff in the game because she can kill her by blank.

996
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And One Night Stands is still trying to come up with an answer.

997
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:41,590
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a tough question.

998
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,331
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a hard question.

999
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:43,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

1000
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:46,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, that was me doing the laugh.

1001
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:51,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you talk a little more about... Oh, okay, there we go.

1002
00:59:51,303 --> 00:59:51,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an answer.

1003
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:52,564
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1004
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:54,405
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt.

1005
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:59,129
[SPEAKER_08]: She can kill her by... What?

1006
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,732
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt.

1007
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:04,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Having Kirby eat her.

1008
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:06,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Having Kirby eat her.

1009
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:07,256
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1010
01:00:07,296 --> 01:00:08,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Having Kirby eat her.

1011
01:00:08,837 --> 01:00:12,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And OneNightStan says she can kill her by... Thwomp smash.

1012
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:14,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Thwomp smash.

1013
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:15,762
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1014
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:17,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if there's a match.

1015
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,705
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, she can kill her by...

1016
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:25,193
[SPEAKER_10]: by repeatedly bashing her in the head with Mr. Saturn until she dies a bleeding, horrible, oozy death.

1017
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:30,374
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a very difficult one to match, but it's a good answer, but unfortunately not a match.

1018
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:31,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies first.

1019
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Mo, she can kill her by?

1020
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:34,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say Pyramid Head.

1021
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:35,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Pyramid Head.

1022
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:38,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Rape, sweet rape.

1023
01:00:38,576 --> 01:00:39,757
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, from Pyramid Head.

1024
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:41,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, gosh, look at the time.

1025
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:42,297
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Rape O'Clock.

1026
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately not a match.

1027
01:00:46,899 --> 01:00:48,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately not a match.

1028
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:51,067
[SPEAKER_08]: What time is it?

1029
01:00:51,187 --> 01:00:51,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Raping time.

1030
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:53,130
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1031
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1032
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:55,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone knows the show already.

1033
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I kept it pretty simple.

1034
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:01,859
[SPEAKER_08]: She can kill her by... Fire.

1035
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire!

1036
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:03,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match.

1037
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:04,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fire.

1038
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I like all these answers so far.

1039
01:01:06,064 --> 01:01:06,325
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1040
01:01:07,426 --> 01:01:07,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake.

1041
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:09,028
[SPEAKER_08]: She can kill her by...

1042
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I also went with fire because fire always makes it better.

1043
01:01:12,733 --> 01:01:14,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fire would have been a great answer.

1044
01:01:14,535 --> 01:01:15,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, not a match.

1045
01:01:16,237 --> 01:01:22,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And my answer was she could kill her by, in reference to last week, condemned to explosive babies.

1046
01:01:25,538 --> 01:01:27,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, also not a match.

1047
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So Cheeseburger's in the lead right now because it's 0-0, meaning Cheeseburger might win, but there's still two questions to go.

1048
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready for the next question, SSJ100 Matt?

1049
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:38,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe you were singing High School Musical 2.

1050
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1051
01:01:39,383 --> 01:01:40,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't either.

1052
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sad you recognized that.

1053
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:46,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll watch it after the show, okay?

1054
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:46,905
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1055
01:01:47,885 --> 01:01:48,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1056
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:49,726
[SPEAKER_08]: The next question.

1057
01:01:51,093 --> 01:02:00,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki was so inspired by Mo's performance of Still Alive in Studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song for the OLR listeners.

1058
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:01,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1059
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:05,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, he will be performing Blank live on the show.

1060
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:12,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1061
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:13,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Ding.

1062
01:02:14,266 --> 01:02:15,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Ding ding.

1063
01:02:17,188 --> 01:02:17,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Ding dong man.

1064
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:19,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, Jake.

1065
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:29,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki was so inspired by Mo's performance of Still Alive in Studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song for the OLR listeners.

1066
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:33,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week, he will be performing Blank live on the show.

1067
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Think you know an answer yet, Jake?

1068
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:38,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Let those gears turn.

1069
01:02:38,773 --> 01:02:39,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to look at chat room.

1070
01:02:44,756 --> 01:02:46,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the chat has some funny shit.

1071
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:50,924
[SPEAKER_08]: OneNightStance, seriously?

1072
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:52,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Just take an answer from chat.

1073
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:02,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh, I think I like one of these answers better than the one I wrote down.

1074
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's too late.

1075
01:03:05,218 --> 01:03:07,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still waiting for OneNightStance to give me an answer.

1076
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,642
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt, do you have an answer in your mind?

1077
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:10,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1078
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, then we're just waiting on OneNightStance.

1079
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:18,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to stop dancing to the music.

1080
01:03:18,986 --> 01:03:19,287
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1081
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,929
[SPEAKER_08]: We got an answer for One Night Stand.

1082
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:22,449
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, SSJ100Matt.

1083
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki was so inspired by most performances still live in studio that he decided to pick up a guitar and learn how to play a song.

1084
01:03:27,494 --> 01:03:32,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week he will be performing... Chocolate Rain.

1085
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:37,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Chocolate Rain for the listeners.

1086
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:37,804
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1087
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:43,529
[SPEAKER_08]: One Night Stand says, Mario's theme or stupid response Spice Girls want to be?

1088
01:03:44,398 --> 01:03:46,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we'll see if either one of those matches.

1089
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:46,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1090
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:47,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we let him out.

1091
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:48,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess who thing.

1092
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:49,323
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1093
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:51,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to go with Mario's theme because that's what he said first.

1094
01:03:52,426 --> 01:03:52,666
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1095
01:03:53,347 --> 01:03:56,230
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, he's going to perform one live on the show.

1096
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Dance.

1097
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Dance.

1098
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Good answer.

1099
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:01,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Dance?

1100
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:02,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Dance.

1101
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:02,813
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1102
01:04:05,195 --> 01:04:07,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Moe, he will be performing what live on the show?

1103
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:09,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragon Forces through Fire and Flame.

1104
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Forces through the Fire and Flames.

1105
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:13,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Not an answer.

1106
01:04:14,305 --> 01:04:15,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what did you pick?

1107
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:18,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1108
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:22,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll just pick what the chat room says.

1109
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:25,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Theme for Tingle.

1110
01:04:25,706 --> 01:04:27,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what the Tingle theme is.

1111
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:31,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, your answer.

1112
01:04:32,149 --> 01:04:35,651
[SPEAKER_05]: The Swinging Jazz Ambassadors of Swing with My Monkey Done Left Me and Took All My Jello.

1113
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:39,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1114
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Acoustic Dragon Force would be pretty funny.

1115
01:04:43,435 --> 01:04:46,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, The Monkey Left Me and Took All My Jello?

1116
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:48,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn that monkey.

1117
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:53,322
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and my answer was also Tingle's theme was my answer.

1118
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:56,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So, unfortunately, no match.

1119
01:04:57,944 --> 01:04:58,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay.

1120
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:00,085
[SPEAKER_08]: There is one more question.

1121
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:07,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburger's very excited right now because it's 0-0, and if it stays 0-0, then Cheeseburger wins by default just for having a cool nickname.

1122
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:09,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Wins a free copy of Res HD.

1123
01:05:10,068 --> 01:05:12,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't have to do shit, but disappear from chat.

1124
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:13,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, SSJ100 Matt.

1125
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:14,309
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1126
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:15,790
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1127
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:18,534
[SPEAKER_08]: If I win, I'll give it to Cheeseburger also.

1128
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:19,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shiz.

1129
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:21,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you already have the game, SSJ100Mad?

1130
01:05:21,995 --> 01:05:22,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what's up?

1131
01:05:24,596 --> 01:05:25,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually I do.

1132
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:26,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1133
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:26,617
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1134
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:28,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then Cheeseburger, shit, just sit there.

1135
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:28,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't do nothing.

1136
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:29,538
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1137
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:32,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sit there and look pretty, Cheeseburger.

1138
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:33,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sit there and look pretty.

1139
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:33,960
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1140
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1141
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,000
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one more, though.

1142
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:35,580
[SPEAKER_08]: One Night Stands.

1143
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The Giants won.

1144
01:05:36,201 --> 01:05:37,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in a generous mood.

1145
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,442
[SPEAKER_08]: One Night Stands is not out yet.

1146
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:41,603
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is.

1147
01:05:42,163 --> 01:05:44,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number three, the last question.

1148
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:49,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very disappointed to hear that Spore was delayed yet again.

1149
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:56,276
[SPEAKER_08]: He was all ready with the time off work to play the game all day and all night this spring.

1150
01:05:57,277 --> 01:06:00,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, Rob said, I guess I'll just play blank all day.

1151
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:11,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very disappointed to hear that Spore was delayed yet again.

1152
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,732
[SPEAKER_08]: He was all ready with the time off work to play the game.

1153
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:15,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, I guess I'll just play blank all day.

1154
01:06:17,314 --> 01:06:17,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1155
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:23,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1156
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1157
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:28,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding, Jake.

1158
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:31,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Still thinking?

1159
01:06:32,504 --> 01:06:33,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep those gears turning.

1160
01:06:33,465 --> 01:06:34,806
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100, Matt, have you thought of an answer?

1161
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:34,866
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1162
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:37,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1163
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:38,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So is One Night Stands.

1164
01:06:38,575 --> 01:06:40,096
[SPEAKER_08]: One Night Stands is getting the hang of this now.

1165
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:41,097
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got it this round.

1166
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:41,998
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1167
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:43,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody else good?

1168
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, you almost... Okay, you got it?

1169
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,981
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a ding.

1170
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:47,561
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here we go.

1171
01:06:49,862 --> 01:06:50,703
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt.

1172
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, Rob said, I guess I'll just play...

1173
01:06:56,189 --> 01:06:56,629
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1174
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1175
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:24,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that was a game.

1176
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:28,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Moe, I guess I'll just play... Major Wee.

1177
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Major Wee all day.

1178
01:07:30,812 --> 01:07:31,512
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good one.

1179
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:33,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Good use of a Part A reference.

1180
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:33,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1181
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:34,454
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1182
01:07:34,514 --> 01:07:37,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, oh well, I guess I'll just play... I went in with the realistic answer.

1183
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:38,657
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft.

1184
01:07:38,757 --> 01:07:40,678
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft all day.

1185
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:43,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, oh well, I guess I'll just play... Oblivion.

1186
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion all day.

1187
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:46,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both very good answers.

1188
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said...

1189
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:48,458
[SPEAKER_08]: This is it.

1190
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:51,761
[SPEAKER_08]: If I said Imagine Babies, then One Night Stands wins it.

1191
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:53,322
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, Cheeseburger wins it.

1192
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:57,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very disappointed to hear the Sporos late yet again.

1193
01:07:57,885 --> 01:08:02,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, I guess I'll just play World of Warcraft all day.

1194
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:05,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's World of Warcraft, not Warcraft.

1195
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:08,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means Cheeseburger wins!

1196
01:08:08,453 --> 01:08:10,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for sitting there and looking pretty in a 0-0 show.

1197
01:08:13,185 --> 01:08:18,169
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt, you lose, so we hang up on you, but do you have a quick plug?

1198
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:24,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Giants win!

1199
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:37,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry One Night Stands, you did good, at least you got the hang of the match game, I hope you had fun Cheeseburger, private message me your email, you win match game I love how someone wins match game that didn't even play

1200
01:08:38,464 --> 01:08:39,545
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I roll.

1201
01:08:39,685 --> 01:08:40,826
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Orange Lounge Radio.

1202
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1203
01:08:41,226 --> 01:08:43,047
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we roll here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1204
01:08:43,067 --> 01:08:43,747
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we roll.

1205
01:08:44,408 --> 01:08:44,728
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1206
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:46,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any more stories?

1207
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:47,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1208
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:47,950
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1209
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:50,752
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story, and then we're going to open up their Skype line.

1210
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:57,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So not to be outdone by the Wii yet again, PS3 devs.

1211
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:05,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Have put out a little video saying, look at what we can do with the PlayStation Eye.

1212
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:08,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can do that VR shit too.

1213
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:10,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo, we're awesome.

1214
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:17,383
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, basically kind of impressed by what they've done using the Wiimote.

1215
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,044
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of did this very similar thing.

1216
01:09:19,244 --> 01:09:21,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually looked like it used the exact same program.

1217
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:26,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's running on a PS3 dev kit to give that head tracking effect.

1218
01:09:27,586 --> 01:09:30,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'm pretty impressed by the PlayStation.

1219
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:34,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to buy it yet, but I'm impressed by what you can do with it.

1220
01:09:34,152 --> 01:09:36,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, the little tech demos and stuff.

1221
01:09:37,936 --> 01:09:43,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would like some actual games that use this technology instead of just look at what we can do.

1222
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:46,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but it'll never come out.

1223
01:09:46,284 --> 01:09:47,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But just look at what we can do.

1224
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:49,747
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1225
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:51,269
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

1226
01:09:51,309 --> 01:09:52,610
[SPEAKER_08]: What will they do, do you think?

1227
01:09:53,297 --> 01:09:54,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they better do something.

1228
01:09:54,417 --> 01:10:03,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that one where it's the combat type game, like the old Atari combat, but you can scan in your picture that you want to use as your tank.

1229
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:04,861
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just draw a picture.

1230
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:07,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put an actual tank on there, stuff like that.

1231
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:08,023
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1232
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:12,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like the Lunar Lander game that you make by drawing the pictures and stuff.

1233
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:13,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's pretty cool.

1234
01:10:14,885 --> 01:10:21,908
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they should be doing with the eye instead of just, I don't know, games where I have to move a ball around by waving my arm.

1235
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:26,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Trial of the Tupac, Orange Lounge Radio

1236
01:10:54,528 --> 01:11:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Last Minute Stories, Japan Post is giving away red DS lights, so yet another color you won't see over here in the US.

1237
01:11:03,376 --> 01:11:04,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray!

1238
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:19,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The PS3 is getting their own greatest hits, including such wonderful games as Resistance Fall Man, Folk Soul, or Folklore, I think that's what it's called over here, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Gundam Target in Sight, which I think sucked,

1239
01:11:19,972 --> 01:11:21,053
[SPEAKER_07]: and RidgeRacer7.

1240
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:24,376
[SPEAKER_07]: All those are going to be available for 3,800 yen, which translates to about 3,599.

1241
01:11:24,436 --> 01:11:27,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boy.

1242
01:11:28,259 --> 01:11:32,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I just picked up the phone, and who is there on the phone on the Orange Lingerie Skyline?

1243
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:34,584
[SPEAKER_03]: None other than Legend of Zaku.

1244
01:11:34,884 --> 01:11:35,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1245
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Eating a bag of chips by the sound of it.

1246
01:11:38,067 --> 01:11:39,488
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, Legend of Zaku?

1247
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:40,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

1248
01:11:42,293 --> 01:11:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing but just coming back from just, you know, going to Dave & Buster's or Super Bowl shit and stuff.

1249
01:11:50,897 --> 01:11:54,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, was it wild and crazy when the Giants won?

1250
01:11:55,339 --> 01:12:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it was kind of quiet when the game started, but then as we further went through, there was a lot of people there, and it was just madness on the way out of Times Square.

1251
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:15,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you actually watch the Super Bowl or did you just play DDR all night?

1252
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:21,983
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually had my buffalo wings, my beer, and all that other stuff.

1253
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually avoided DDR today.

1254
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:32,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But besides that, I don't know if you want to bring up Supernova 2 since it was probably brought up by other folks anyways.

1255
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:39,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't talked a lot about DDR recently on the program, but what are your thoughts on DDR Supernova 2?

1256
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's like this.

1257
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just Betzen.

1258
01:12:46,774 --> 01:12:48,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Betzen holding us back.

1259
01:12:48,515 --> 01:12:52,075
[SPEAKER_03]: They're holding us back for the fact that we can't even unlock songs right now.

1260
01:12:52,496 --> 01:12:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: We're being forced, against our will, to basically have to go as far as importing a game.

1261
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:06,899
[SPEAKER_03]: We're basically just telling the arcade owners that we have good relationships with, better than Betzen's, to just avoid it.

1262
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it without EMUs or a means of unlocking it.

1263
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:18,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're pissed they didn't bring the Japanese-only EMU system over to America to try and add a little something to the game?

1264
01:13:18,474 --> 01:13:21,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't we kind of lucky to have DDR still going in the arcades in the first place?

1265
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, think about it.

1266
01:13:22,715 --> 01:13:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That was...

1267
01:13:37,286 --> 01:13:42,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, in no way am I blaming Konami, because they're actually making a good effort in bringing it over here.

1268
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:58,721
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried it with this game, they tried it with Guitar Freak's Drum Mania, which hasn't seen a release date yet, but if Benton is trying to half-ass their way into this, the only thing I can see is Konami...

1269
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:05,536
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1270
01:14:05,656 --> 01:14:06,556
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

1271
01:14:09,197 --> 01:14:10,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Giving us a little Betson hate here on the show.

1272
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:11,638
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1273
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:15,079
[SPEAKER_08]: But what can Betson do to make things right with DDR?

1274
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say there's a Supernova 3.

1275
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:17,460
[SPEAKER_08]: What can they do to make things right?

1276
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's pretty much what...

1277
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:31,783
[SPEAKER_03]: What they had to do anyways, since I know this is most likely, the way they were picked out anyways was, you know, a contract.

1278
01:14:32,423 --> 01:14:50,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, since Konami put that bid, you know, bid out, you know, gave bets in the contract to distribute games in America, by not, by basically, you know, asserting Konami's will, you're, you know, that would be on the, you know, that would be grounds for breach of contract right there.

1279
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, Konami will sue for, you know, if it got that bad.

1280
01:14:55,686 --> 01:14:56,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami will sue?

1281
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:59,308
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was putting a damper on their sails.

1282
01:14:59,468 --> 01:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we gotta wrap up.

1283
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last minute thoughts, Zaku?

1284
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:05,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know.

1285
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:08,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass.

1286
01:15:08,812 --> 01:15:09,572
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say.

1287
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:10,233
[SPEAKER_08]: There you have it.

1288
01:15:10,293 --> 01:15:12,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass.

1289
01:15:12,414 --> 01:15:12,874
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.

1290
01:15:14,063 --> 01:15:15,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a Call of Duty fangirl?

1291
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:15,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1292
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:16,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, good times.

1293
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:17,905
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gorgeous.

1294
01:15:17,925 --> 01:15:20,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Call of Duty 3 sucked, but for good reason.

1295
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:21,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Call of Duty 3 was fun.

1296
01:15:21,567 --> 01:15:23,167
[SPEAKER_12]: It was an Infinity Ward.

1297
01:15:23,828 --> 01:15:30,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty 2 I liked, because there was one level that you can download that had a giant tower in the middle of that, and we absolutely loved playing multiplayer on that.

1298
01:15:30,451 --> 01:15:34,953
[SPEAKER_07]: It's whoever can stand, you know, king of the tower, I guess, instead of king of the hill, but...

1299
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:43,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty 3 was okay, but Call of Duty 4 was a lot better.

1300
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:47,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, because Call of Duty 3 was a completely different team.

1301
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I have some big news before we go to this next call.

1302
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:53,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburger...

1303
01:15:54,617 --> 01:16:00,440
[SPEAKER_08]: has deferred the prize, saying that unfortunately he only has a Wii, so the prize does him no good.

1304
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So the prize will go back into the prize pool, and we'll give it away next week here on the program in another lame game.

1305
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:10,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So tune in next week for your chance to win Rez HD.

1306
01:16:10,845 --> 01:16:14,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheeseburger says instead, my birthday is on the 14th.

1307
01:16:14,307 --> 01:16:16,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Say happy birthday on the show instead, okay?

1308
01:16:16,768 --> 01:16:19,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So happy birthday, Cheeseburger.

1309
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there you go.

1310
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:23,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good birthday on Valentine's Day.

1311
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:24,458
[SPEAKER_12]: That is so awesome.

1312
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:25,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And cute.

1313
01:16:26,299 --> 01:16:27,060
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

1314
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,040
[SPEAKER_08]: So cute.

1315
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,961
[SPEAKER_12]: So precious.

1316
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:30,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the sky flight.

1317
01:16:30,262 --> 01:16:31,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1318
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:31,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1319
01:16:34,585 --> 01:16:35,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we had someone on sky flight.

1320
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:35,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ranma.

1321
01:16:35,766 --> 01:16:36,186
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everyone?

1322
01:16:36,206 --> 01:16:37,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello, Ranma.

1323
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,767
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1324
01:16:38,648 --> 01:16:39,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

1325
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:41,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

1326
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I start, Jamie.

1327
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:45,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie stepped out for just a minute.

1328
01:16:45,993 --> 01:16:47,093
[SPEAKER_08]: She stepped out for just a minute.

1329
01:16:47,314 --> 01:16:48,554
[SPEAKER_08]: For a giant wee.

1330
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:50,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think she's taking a major wee.

1331
01:16:53,746 --> 01:16:56,387
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you have, can we relay something to her?

1332
01:16:56,427 --> 01:16:57,608
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you say if she was here?

1333
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, me or you, because I just wanted to say to her, I can have the Guinness, that's all.

1334
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:06,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a major lag tonight?

1335
01:17:06,472 --> 01:17:06,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there is.

1336
01:17:06,952 --> 01:17:08,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the cam's slowing things down.

1337
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:08,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1338
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be on my end.

1339
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:11,054
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is, I'm sorry.

1340
01:17:11,414 --> 01:17:11,794
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all right.

1341
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:12,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We forgive you.

1342
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:13,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can have the Guinness.

1343
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,116
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll relay the message to her.

1344
01:17:15,156 --> 01:17:17,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else you want to say about the program?

1345
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:20,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Join the show so far.

1346
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:24,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed part eight because out in a row of friends getting tattooed.

1347
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:27,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you missed Mo's lovely rendition of Still Alive.

1348
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:28,172
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare you?

1349
01:17:29,433 --> 01:17:31,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I will catch the replay on Justin TV.

1350
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:33,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is back.

1351
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:34,617
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to say to Jamie?

1352
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:36,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie.

1353
01:17:36,758 --> 01:17:36,978
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1354
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I can has a Guinness?

1355
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:40,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can has.

1356
01:17:43,143 --> 01:17:44,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I can has Guinness.

1357
01:17:45,685 --> 01:17:46,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I can has Smithwick's.

1358
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Smithwick's is what I called.

1359
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:48,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?

1360
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:52,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of tired of the DDR bashing by the diehards.

1361
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just let it be, okay?

1362
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:58,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We already realize that Konami doesn't care.

1363
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing what they can.

1364
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:04,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Just leave it be, because I'm just a happy-go-lucky player.

1365
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just happy that we even have the game in the arcades.

1366
01:18:06,752 --> 01:18:07,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just leave it at that?

1367
01:18:07,873 --> 01:18:10,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't we just all agree that DDR is gay?

1368
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:11,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't we all just get along?

1369
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can say that, because I am, so...

1370
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it gayer than you or gay as you?

1371
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:19,986
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

1372
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:20,986
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR is not gay.

1373
01:18:21,046 --> 01:18:26,108
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR is just... DDR totally does not like to sleep with other DDRs of the same gender.

1374
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:30,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd beg to differ.

1375
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:33,810
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

1376
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I've said the DDR argument so many times I'm like blue in the face.

1377
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:40,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to look at pretty Smash Bros.

1378
01:18:40,452 --> 01:18:41,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl more.

1379
01:18:41,052 --> 01:18:41,772
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I want.

1380
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:42,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

1381
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:45,113
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, Rob.

1382
01:18:45,673 --> 01:18:45,853
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1383
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:51,763
[SPEAKER_04]: A few episodes back, you said something about any things you would do to make DDR better.

1384
01:18:51,803 --> 01:18:53,044
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of glanced over it.

1385
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,005
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do to make it better?

1386
01:18:55,145 --> 01:18:56,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I really have to hear what you would do.

1387
01:18:56,967 --> 01:19:01,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I would scrap all the code that they've ever used to make DDR and build the game from the ground up.

1388
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:05,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to force them to think of some new ideas on how to make the game original again.

1389
01:19:05,472 --> 01:19:09,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would bring over some of the people that helped on the Xbox version if they're still with the company.

1390
01:19:10,196 --> 01:19:13,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, I would think about how to make the game more competitive than cooperative in nature.

1391
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, yes, there was the dance battle mode or whatever in Supernova.

1392
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,682
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think a mode like that should be the focus of the game next time and not an afterthought.

1393
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:22,663
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my thoughts.

1394
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:25,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally redesign the fundamentals of the game.

1395
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:34,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the game can still be single player and have those modes and it can have some cooperative features in it, but make it more of a tournament game.

1396
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:38,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Relaunch the game as Dance Dance Tournament or something, I don't know.

1397
01:19:39,153 --> 01:19:41,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Ranma, we gotta let you go try and get some more calls, okay?

1398
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing.

1399
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:46,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo World is now taking Classic only for Wii consoles.

1400
01:19:46,644 --> 01:19:47,004
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1401
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo World is only accepting plastic for Wii console sales.

1402
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:51,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

1403
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:53,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1404
01:19:53,651 --> 01:19:55,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sign in the window when you walk in.

1405
01:19:55,913 --> 01:19:56,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1406
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:57,134
[SPEAKER_08]: No checks?

1407
01:19:57,274 --> 01:19:57,795
[SPEAKER_08]: No cash?

1408
01:19:58,936 --> 01:19:59,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

1409
01:19:59,356 --> 01:20:01,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Same as Apple is doing with the iPhones.

1410
01:20:01,298 --> 01:20:01,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Plastic only.

1411
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:02,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1412
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,080
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1413
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:03,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks for the heads up.

1414
01:20:04,762 --> 01:20:05,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Our man in New York City.

1415
01:20:05,482 --> 01:20:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch you guys next week.

1416
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Our man in New York City, DJ Ranma S, right there.

1417
01:20:09,191 --> 01:20:10,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So is Zaku in New York City.

1418
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:12,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And SSJ100, this is a New York show tonight.

1419
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Our contestant was New York City, too.

1420
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:17,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Plastic, come to think of that, that actually leaves a data trail.

1421
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:19,213
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1422
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:21,134
[SPEAKER_10]: The cash money is almost untraceable.

1423
01:20:21,454 --> 01:20:22,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do one more call tonight.

1424
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:23,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1425
01:20:23,554 --> 01:20:23,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1426
01:20:24,895 --> 01:20:26,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is One Night Stands.

1427
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:28,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, One Night Stands.

1428
01:20:28,316 --> 01:20:29,076
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1429
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:30,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not much.

1430
01:20:30,936 --> 01:20:33,577
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after playing that game, I kind of just wanted to call in.

1431
01:20:34,698 --> 01:20:37,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you apologizing for your horrendous performance in the game?

1432
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:37,921
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm totally kidding.

1433
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:39,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did good.

1434
01:20:39,122 --> 01:20:40,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally kidding.

1435
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:40,523
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1436
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:46,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Games are so much easier when you're just watching and playing them, or playing along, but when you're actually a contestant, it's so much weirder.

1437
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:48,949
[SPEAKER_08]: The radio is high-stress stuff.

1438
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:49,670
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1439
01:20:51,191 --> 01:20:51,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ask Mo.

1440
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:53,372
[SPEAKER_08]: What did she say before the show?

1441
01:20:53,392 --> 01:20:54,813
[SPEAKER_08]: She was going to throw up chunks of her pancreas.

1442
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to throw up shards of my pelvis.

1443
01:20:58,156 --> 01:20:58,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1444
01:20:58,696 --> 01:20:59,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I'm sorry.

1445
01:20:59,317 --> 01:20:59,557
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here.

1446
01:20:59,997 --> 01:21:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you think I picked his name?

1447
01:21:01,018 --> 01:21:01,999
[SPEAKER_12]: It was One Night Stands.

1448
01:21:02,481 --> 01:21:02,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1449
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:03,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1450
01:21:04,322 --> 01:21:04,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1451
01:21:05,762 --> 01:21:06,702
[SPEAKER_08]: What else did you want to say?

1452
01:21:06,902 --> 01:21:09,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, what else did you want to say, One Night Stands?

1453
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:11,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?

1454
01:21:11,844 --> 01:21:18,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple weeks ago, I actually wrote in an email for the first time, and it was actually right on the air, I guess.

1455
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just, you know, just felt like saying hi.

1456
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:28,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I just wanted to know about the whole ASEN thing, if you really were coming out here.

1457
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1458
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:32,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't even think of anything right now.

1459
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:33,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what was that?

1460
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:35,662
[SPEAKER_08]: You were asking about what coming out here?

1461
01:21:37,703 --> 01:21:37,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1462
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:39,984
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that you just said?

1463
01:21:40,204 --> 01:21:41,104
[SPEAKER_08]: You dropped out for a minute.

1464
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:41,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1465
01:21:42,224 --> 01:21:42,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1466
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:45,846
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

1467
01:21:45,866 --> 01:21:46,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.

1468
01:21:46,246 --> 01:21:46,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

1469
01:21:47,046 --> 01:21:47,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1470
01:21:50,247 --> 01:21:50,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1471
01:21:51,747 --> 01:21:52,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye.

1472
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:55,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for calling One Night Stands.

1473
01:21:56,029 --> 01:21:56,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing personal.

1474
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:58,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype hates us tonight.

1475
01:21:58,811 --> 01:21:59,432
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with that?

1476
01:21:59,472 --> 01:22:00,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm punishing the Skype line.

1477
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:01,212
[SPEAKER_08]: We're closing that.

1478
01:22:01,232 --> 01:22:04,533
[SPEAKER_08]: In the future, we might just have to shut off Justin TV or something when we do Skype line.

1479
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:06,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, One Night Stands.

1480
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:07,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing personal.

1481
01:22:07,734 --> 01:22:08,275
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not you.

1482
01:22:08,335 --> 01:22:09,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the connection.

1483
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:10,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell's going on.

1484
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:15,317
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it for our Skype line tonight.

1485
01:22:15,737 --> 01:22:17,598
[SPEAKER_08]: But we encourage you to send more emails to us.

1486
01:22:17,658 --> 01:22:21,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or leave us voicemails.

1487
01:22:21,419 --> 01:22:27,041
[SPEAKER_08]: You can always call the Skype line when we're not live at 1-877-GAME-OLR and leave us lovely voicemails.

1488
01:22:28,106 --> 01:22:29,006
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always a good time.

1489
01:22:30,147 --> 01:22:31,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more last-minute stories, Loki?

1490
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:36,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, a couple things real quick.

1491
01:22:36,469 --> 01:22:43,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Monster Hunter, apparently Capcom is releasing this grip for the PSP.

1492
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:50,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks stupid, but it's the Monster Hunter grip accessory, and it's lame-looking.

1493
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,615
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks absolutely retarded.

1494
01:22:51,915 --> 01:22:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is retarded.

1495
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,717
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, do you have anything last for us?

1496
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:58,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I like fire.

1497
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:22,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire!

1498
01:23:40,596 --> 01:23:42,057
[SPEAKER_08]: You can Photoshop... I'm sorry.

1499
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:46,601
[SPEAKER_08]: One is a caption and me dancing with Pikachu is the one to caption.

1500
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:52,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And Photoshop is me and DarkSakura attacking Loki is the Photoshop challenge.

1501
01:23:52,646 --> 01:23:54,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So good luck with that.

1502
01:23:54,127 --> 01:23:56,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's some animated picture of me swimming.

1503
01:23:56,129 --> 01:23:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell that is.

1504
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,470
[SPEAKER_12]: That's beautiful.

1505
01:23:58,531 --> 01:23:59,291
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it is.

1506
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:00,993
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all in our forums.

1507
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:04,158
[SPEAKER_08]: over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1508
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:05,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Caption Photoshop Contest.

1509
01:24:05,818 --> 01:24:06,498
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't miss it.

1510
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't give away that res code any other way, we might have to do it there.

1511
01:24:10,559 --> 01:24:18,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope, though, our listeners want to win some free shit because all I'm going to say is that coming soon, we're going to be giving away a lot of stuff.

1512
01:24:19,062 --> 01:24:20,002
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stuff.

1513
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:22,003
[SPEAKER_08]: More details in the coming weeks.

1514
01:24:22,703 --> 01:24:22,963
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1515
01:24:23,873 --> 01:24:26,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around at this point and get everybody's final thought.

1516
01:24:28,116 --> 01:24:33,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Jake, I know you didn't say much tonight, but you were entertaining the Justin TV crowd with much playing of Smash Bros.

1517
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:33,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl.

1518
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,141
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, what do you think of Smash Bros.

1519
01:24:36,181 --> 01:24:36,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl?

1520
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:39,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Two words, fucking awesome.

1521
01:24:39,844 --> 01:24:40,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1522
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:42,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1523
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:45,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm tired and I want to go to bed.

1524
01:24:45,587 --> 01:24:46,268
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fair enough.

1525
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:48,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1526
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Need to find cage match song.

1527
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:51,271
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1528
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:54,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Mo, thanks so much for being here tonight.

1529
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,841
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad I'm not dead in a ditch.

1530
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:56,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerve-wracking?

1531
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:58,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is always the part after the show.

1532
01:24:58,743 --> 01:24:59,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

1533

1538
01:25:07,908 --> 01:25:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even have to bring a new song.

1539
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:10,969
