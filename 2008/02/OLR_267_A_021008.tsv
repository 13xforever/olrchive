0	20920	Today, February 10th, 2008, Xbox HD DVD gets a price cut, old favorites are revealed for
20920	29920	Street Fighter IV, and is an Oscar-nominated movie soon becoming a video game?
29920	35840	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35840	36840	Radio.
36840	42120	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
42120	43660	and the gamer lifestyle.
43660	45640	My name is Rob Roberts.
45640	50000	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie
50000	51000	Summers.
51000	52900	She is unfortunately out with sickness.
52900	59640	She's been having, you know, just the sickness, the plague and stuff, so she can't be here
59640	62400	tonight because she's worried she's contagious and doesn't want to give it to us.
62400	65760	So of course we understand, and we're kind of thankful that she's not here to spread
65760	67080	it to us.
67080	69000	But she will be back next week.
69000	73040	Meanwhile, we do have the one and only Loki, tech master, one and only.
73040	74040	Yeah.
74040	75040	How you doing?
75040	76040	Good.
76040	77040	Good.
77040	78040	Eating a sandwich.
78040	81080	But the problem is Subway was out of white bread, and I had wheat, and wheat tasted like
81080	82080	corn.
82080	83080	Oh, no.
83080	84360	Subway was out of something?
84360	85680	Wheat tastes like cardboard.
85680	88000	It's not that bad.
88000	89000	Bread is bread.
89000	91280	Yeah, but it's not even really wheat bread.
91280	94320	It's like they took white bread and kind of dyed it brown.
94320	96000	Well, it is Subway.
96000	99760	I wouldn't expect huge differences.
99760	101320	Does your cat scratch you or something?
101320	102800	I see big old claw marks.
102800	103800	Yes, that's my cat.
103800	104800	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
104800	110800	Well, that's because once she gets up in her tube sometimes, she starts to freak out, but
110800	113240	she's playing and stuff, so what do I try to do?
113240	115880	I try poking at her all the time.
115880	119920	I try petting her on her head, but then she just grabs her claws and she kind of catches
119920	120920	me sometimes.
120920	121920	Gotcha.
121920	122920	And she did.
122920	125280	It looks a lot more painful than it actually was.
125280	128000	All right, well, also joining us tonight, you might have heard his voice there just
128000	132640	a minute ago, it's Puppy, also known as Black Lab, or Ryan, depending on whatever we want
132640	133640	to call him.
133640	134640	How are you, Puppy?
134640	135640	I am tired.
135640	136640	Tired?
136640	143800	I had some insomnia this week, and kind of capped it off with getting woken up at 2.30
143800	146040	in the morning last night by gunfire.
146040	147880	Oh, fun!
147880	148880	Sorry to hear about the gunfire.
148880	150280	Were your neighbors fighting or something?
150280	153520	I don't know, it was probably something in the mall parking lot.
153520	155560	Okay, I gotcha.
155560	156560	Interesting.
156560	160680	You know, it's been just a crazy week in everybody's neighborhood.
160680	164360	There was gunfire in your neighborhood, and the house across the street from the studio
164360	168080	here burned down a couple days ago.
168080	173680	On the outside, it makes Rob's house much easier to find to get here.
173680	176160	That's unfortunate for those that affected.
176160	180040	I didn't even notice it, because that house was so run down to begin with, it's like,
180040	181040	really?
181040	182040	It burned down?
182040	183040	Couldn't tell.
183040	188920	All right, well, anyhow, let's not talk about neighborhood drama, let's talk about our gaming
188920	189920	weeks.
189920	191600	We'll start it off with how was your gaming week, and we'll go ahead and start off with
191600	192600	Loki tonight.
192600	193600	How was your gaming week?
193600	198040	First off, I'd like to say I have brought back the Ever360, it is back to life again.
198040	199040	Hooray!
199040	201400	The trick was I needed more heat.
201400	208280	I didn't stop until I got to about 850 degrees to 1,000 degrees, and sure enough, that worked!
208280	210800	So now I have six working 360s, hooray!
210800	214120	You're just loaded, aren't you?
214120	219280	And then, let's see, I played this week more Smash Bros. Brawl, and that's pretty awesome.
219280	225280	I actually got to dive in a little bit to the subspace emissary mode, and it's pretty
225280	226280	fun.
226280	233920	They have some really crazy-looking enemies in the game, just some weird stuff, but it's
233920	235120	pretty cool.
235120	238960	And then I've unlocked Rob the Robot, we went through the challenge, but I actually took
238960	242600	off work half a day to go visit one of my customers who really wanted to play the game,
242600	247840	so I took it down there and we played it for five hours.
247840	248840	He went through all the...
248840	249840	It didn't get old after five hours.
249840	254360	No, no, I didn't play it for the full five hours, I just kind of watched him for a little
254360	258080	bit, but we played through the challenges and trying to unlock some of that stuff, and
258080	262640	doing two-player co-op in the subspace emissary stuff.
262640	269080	But I don't know, the challenges weren't that hard, because we actually figured out what
269080	275320	to do without reading, obviously, because it's all in Japanese, but I don't know.
275320	277800	It's pretty cool.
277800	282320	I think, though, if I play through the entire subspace emissary stuff and then finish all
282320	284760	the other crap, I might get bored with the game a little bit.
284760	287620	So I actually need to play some people.
287620	292360	Other than Smash Brothers, I also played Silent Hill Origins, actually, on the PSP.
292360	294480	I went back to try that again.
294480	295480	And pretty cool.
295480	300240	I actually am looking forward to it coming out on PlayStation 2, because I just don't
300240	304920	like being tethered to my TV with a little cable, so it might be a little bit better
304920	309080	if I have a little bit more room to play.
309080	316660	And then, I also played a lot of Burnout Paradise, still trying to knock people off of the leaderboards
316660	319340	for the Showtime rankings.
319340	324320	I love how listeners will add us on Xbox Live, because they enjoy the show and so on, they
324320	329080	just kind of want to play a game with us occasionally, or what have you, whereas Loki makes it his
329080	333400	mission to dominate our listeners in whatever game he's playing.
333400	336880	He's like, oh no, I can't get beat by no listener.
336880	340040	I've got to control the Burnout map.
340040	344840	Right now I have about 26 of the roads, so I still have a ways to go.
344840	351040	But let's see, other than that, I played a little bit more DotStream on the Game Boy
351040	352040	Advance.
352040	353040	Pretty fun.
353040	356920	And I think that's pretty much it.
356920	358560	Oh, I tried playing Crysis again.
358560	363240	I actually uninstalled Crysis, reinstalled Crysis, tried to get that last level to fucking
363240	365760	work again, and sure enough, it does not work.
365760	370040	Still, I can't pass that last level in the game because it glitches out, and it stops
370040	371040	working.
371040	378440	So, I am sick of Crysis, although I did load up the physics little custom map that someone
378440	381720	made to play the physics of the game.
381720	388000	They actually released a new version of the map last week, and that was fun, because you
388000	394400	can slingshot barrels and the people and stuff, and catapult things, and you gotta love that.
394400	398340	But other than that, though, I fucking hate the last level of Crysis.
398340	399640	Did they not test it at all?
399640	404480	I mean, it's just really broken, which is bad, because the rest of the game is pretty
404480	408880	cool, but it's just that last level, right as you're about to finish the game and kind
408880	411440	of get the payoff for playing through the entire thing.
411440	414460	Oh no, you can't do that.
414460	416020	That would be too easy.
416020	418560	So I don't know.
418560	421040	I know you check out a lot of the new Xbox games that come out.
421040	422640	Did you check out Poker Smash this week?
422640	423640	Nope.
423640	424640	No.
424640	426800	I like a NYR fan in our chatroom, his description.
426800	430080	Of course, I haven't introduced the chat yet, but it's chat.orangelandradio.com.
430080	433600	We tape live on Sunday nights at our website, orangelandradio.com.
433600	436240	So remember, you are listening to live radio.
436240	439960	It's NYR fan, and chatroom says, Poker Smash is like Planet Puzzle League, but you make
439960	441120	poker hands.
441120	442120	That's kind of true.
442120	443120	Did you play Puppy?
443120	444120	Any Poker Smash?
444120	447960	No, it never really got any interest from me.
447960	451240	I thought it was going to be kind of lame, but it's actually kind of a unique sort of
451240	452240	puzzler.
452240	454060	I guess that's a good description of it.
454060	457760	It's like Planet Puzzle League, but the whole poker element kind of makes you think on two
457760	459840	different levels, which is very scary.
459840	463360	And I got thrown off by the colors when I first started playing, but then I realized
463360	468600	that the colors were just another way of designating the pink ones or queens, the yellow ones or
468600	470120	tens and so on.
470120	474160	But you still have to consider the suits of what you're dropping, so I know it makes it
474160	479000	sound really complicated, but it's easy to get easy combos, but it's much harder to get
479000	480800	the more difficult combos, if that makes sense.
480800	482400	I was kind of surprised.
482400	483400	Anyway.
483400	484400	Sorry.
484400	486440	Puppy, how was your gaming week?
486440	491620	Most of my week has been involved with Call of Duty 4 since I finally got a hold of it.
491620	496040	Even though I rented it through Gamefly, I'm probably going to end up keeping it anyways,
496040	498960	because I found that it's much better than Halo 3.
498960	503780	Even with the updates that Halo 3 finally added and are going to add in the near future,
503780	506000	I still will be playing Call of Duty 4 instead.
506000	509120	That's a pretty bold statement, that it's better than Halo 3.
509120	516240	I actually found it much more enjoyable than Halo, just because there's a lot more reality
516240	523600	to it, as opposed to, oh, armored space guys punching each other in a grossly malformed
523600	525100	way.
525100	530840	And then, other than Call of Duty 4, I sadly have fallen back into my puzzle pirate habit.
530840	531840	Sucker.
531840	532840	Yeah.
532840	534480	Well, how has Puzzle Pirates changed?
534480	537360	Because you were last addicted to the game, what, about two years ago?
537360	543360	Yeah, well, I stopped playing it about a year ago, because I didn't have the time to anymore.
543360	546480	And then, apparently a lot of stuff changed in that year.
546480	552720	They brought back, they brought a bunch of new puzzle games in, and added some new player
552720	559320	versus environment stuff, and it's getting popular, and I just found out, they just made
559320	564120	an announcement that they're selling game cards at Target now, so they must be making
564120	565120	it big or something.
565120	566120	Nice.
566120	568680	I'm noticing with the facial hair that you're starting to sprout here, you're starting to
568680	570760	look like a pirate a little bit.
570760	573320	This was much longer earlier this week, though.
573320	574320	I see.
574320	577560	But, yes, I could just throw on an eyepatch for a party.
577560	579880	It's great radio, too, to talk about Puppy's look.
579880	581440	Yeah, because I mean, even-
581440	583520	He's got a little facial growth that makes him look like a pirate.
583520	585440	I don't know if they can see it on Justin.TV, because you're blonde.
585440	588480	I could probably, well, yeah, I could probably stand right in front of the camera and they
588480	589480	wouldn't see it.
589480	590480	Yeah, why don't you go give them a nice close-up when you're done, then?
590480	591480	Yeah.
591480	592480	Go give them a nice close-up of your mug there.
592480	595480	Give them a nice little mug shot there, you know, side view.
595480	596480	Yeah.
596480	597480	All right.
597480	599480	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
599480	603280	Um, uh, rez, uh, various board games, and-
603280	604640	Isn't rez incredible?
604640	605640	Of course it is.
605640	606640	I love rez.
606640	608720	I really wish that I had a high-def TV to play it on.
608720	609720	Oh.
609720	610720	I do, and it's sexy.
610720	613760	I hate to rub it in, but yeah, yeah, you really do want one.
613760	615920	You need to have surround sound, too, when you're playing it.
615920	616920	That's true.
616920	620000	I seriously almost dug up my old surround sound system that's kind of crappy.
620000	621160	It's actually hooked up here in the garage.
621160	623960	I almost brought that into the house just to play rez HD with, but I'm going to get
623960	626080	a new sound system when I get my tax refund.
626080	631400	Yeah, I thought about getting a better TV with my tax refund, but I've got other stuff
631400	632920	that I need to pay for first.
632920	633920	Gotcha.
633920	634920	All right.
634920	635920	Now go supermodel for the camera.
635920	636920	I'll talk about my gaming week.
636920	640440	First, I want to mention in chat room, because this didn't come up earlier, Tiger Claw says,
640440	644280	Sky, I just realized, OLR is competing against the Grammys.
644280	645280	Who cares?
645280	646280	Seriously.
646280	649080	I mean, the Grammys, I don't know.
649080	652800	I find them to be incredibly irrelevant, and I think, like, did you see that article on
652800	656400	Digg earlier this week about the biggest Grammy snubs of all time?
656400	657400	It's pretty interesting.
657400	662160	It shows how, like, there's all these big name artists that always get snubbed by the
662160	664640	Grammys when there's people that were more deserving.
664640	665640	Well, whatever.
665640	666760	Forget it.
666760	668080	And I brought up tax refunds earlier.
668080	673000	I'm curious in our chat room, those that are getting tax refunds, if there's anything in
673000	676240	gaming that you're contemplating spending your tax refund on.
676240	678360	So let us know in our chat room, chat.orangewormsrated.com.
678360	679520	I'll read those in just a little bit.
679520	684640	But first, my gaming week, mostly spent, besides Poker Smash, playing a couple different games.
684640	686000	World of Warcraft, of course.
686000	688600	I know I talk about that a lot here on the program, but it has been a lot of my gaming
688600	689720	week recently.
689720	691280	And it really went to the next level this week.
691280	694560	I don't know how many hardcore WoW addicts we have that listen to the game.
694560	699920	But tonight, or I'm sorry, yesterday marked our first 10-man raid into Karazhan, which
699920	700920	is...
700920	701920	Oh, you're just moving on.
701920	702920	I know.
702920	703920	It's weird.
703920	707840	Like, I've never done endgame content in an MMO before, because Final Fantasy XI, oh my
707840	708840	God.
708840	712320	I mean, it just takes forever to get there, and WoW it does, too.
712320	717540	But I don't know, I guess more people I know play WoW for whatever reason.
717540	721280	So we finally got to the endgame content in that game, and it's something else.
721280	723280	It's just a whole other challenge.
723280	725640	Enjoy it while you can, because...
725640	728560	When Wrath of the Lich King comes out, then all that stuff gets antiquated, I know.
728560	729560	Oh, of course.
729560	733420	So, and we only have 10 people in our guild that can even do it.
733420	737060	So I notice it's tough to really arrange the times to go in there, but we did an awesome
737060	739160	job for anybody that does know WoW.
739160	743880	We killed Attuneman, we killed Moros, and we killed Maiden today.
743880	748040	So in our first weekend, we killed three of the bosses in Karazhan, which is pretty awesome,
748040	749040	and apparently is...
749040	751720	You know, I'm sure there's lots of people out there that go, whoa, my guild killed four
751720	752720	bosses, so fuck you.
752720	753720	Fuck you.
753720	754720	My guild clearly all in one night.
754720	758920	For us, when we were mostly casual players, it was pretty awesome.
758920	760900	So good times.
760900	765220	Just wait until you try to move on to 25-man content, and you've got three different groups
765220	767960	going to Karazhan at once, and they're like, oh, we don't want to split up, we don't want
767960	770520	to go all together, and then you'll end up breaking apart, and...
770520	771520	Oh, no.
771520	772520	Drama, drama, drama.
772520	773520	No, we don't want drama.
773520	774520	We're all...
774520	777640	Most of us actually live here in the area, in our guild-less form, mostly from real-life
777640	778640	people.
778640	783800	Like, my boyfriend is in the guild, and Irene is in the guild, but she's not level 70 yet.
783800	788520	Some of the other people you've heard on this show are in the guild, and yeah, good times.
788520	789520	So we're finally doing that stuff.
789520	790520	Let's see.
790520	793940	Looking at chat room, seeing what folks are saying they're gonna spend their tax refunds
793940	797000	on here.
797000	798000	Let's see.
798000	803520	SSJ100Matt says, my tax rebate is going towards an HD camera.
803520	809840	GS191 says, I'll probably spend my welfare, I mean, stimulus package check on a new PC.
809840	810840	That's right.
810840	811840	Yeah.
811840	812840	After that thing was passed.
812840	817520	I'm already spending that on a new computer, because I need something at home that doesn't...
817520	818520	That can run AutoCAD.
818520	819520	Nice.
819520	820520	All right.
820520	822440	Oh, DMN's gonna use his refund to come visit the show.
822440	824000	He's coming back to Sacramento.
824000	825000	Scary.
825000	826000	Oh, boy.
826000	827000	We'll use that refund to move.
827000	828000	Hide the pets and the children.
828000	829000	All right.
829000	830000	No, just kidding.
830000	833440	Also, okay, there's other games I've been playing besides MMO.
833440	835040	I also picked up a game on the Xbox 360.
835040	838280	I can't remember if I've talked about this previously on the show, but it's a game called
838280	843880	Cold Step Saga, and it's the sequel to a PlayStation 2 game that was simply called Cold Stepped,
843880	845960	and I think I did mention this once on the show.
845960	848320	I love this description of the game I've read on the internet.
848320	849680	It's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
849680	851960	I think that's the best way to describe the game.
851960	855840	You basically have a deck of cards, and you can customize them, and you move around this
855840	860720	board, and you lay down your creatures, and basically laying down a creature is kind of
860720	865920	like owning property in Monopoly, and you can level up the square, which is like buying
865920	869560	houses or a hotel, and you make your creatures more powerful, but when an opponent lands
869560	872340	on your square, it's not that they just have to pay rent.
872340	875740	They can choose to battle your creature with one from their hand, and then there's all
875740	879320	these enhancements cards that'll increase your strength, your defense.
879320	883840	So it's kind of a game where you really have to think before you play, and it's a lot of
883840	884840	fun.
884840	886320	I think it's a very unique concept.
886320	888900	It's kind of interesting to see it on the Xbox 360.
888900	893000	For me, they didn't really change a lot from the first game, and the animations are not
893000	899480	really anything to jump and scream about in this new age of gaming or whatever you want
899480	902680	to call it with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
902680	906680	You look at the Eye of Judgment, and there's very intricate battles that happen.
906680	910120	For all the shit we give that game on this show, the battles look kind of cool when the
910120	911480	cards do battle.
911480	916160	Here in Coldsept, it's like, you know, if a monster attacks with the claws, you see
916160	918640	big claw marks go across the cards.
918640	921680	So it's basically like Pokemon, just in high definition.
921680	924520	Well, like, literally the cards do battle.
924520	925880	It's kind of amusing.
925880	928080	And there's incredible Engrish in the game.
928080	932080	I think one of the lines is something like, I had to escape the poverty, or something
932080	938080	I don't remember, like very literal translations in some of the cutscenes, but it's cool.
938080	942880	I mean, for me, I think this game is mostly a second chance for people who missed it on
942880	946120	the PlayStation 2, because it's not a full-price Xbox game.
946120	947120	It's like that middle tier.
947120	952080	It's $39.99, so it's not quite as much as you pay for a brand new Xbox 360 game.
952080	953400	It's a pretty good deal.
953400	956360	I actually didn't own Coldsept on PlayStation 2.
956360	958280	One of my friends a couple years ago did.
958280	959560	That's how I got exposed to it the first time.
959560	961900	We spent a lot of nights just playing Coldsept.
961900	966320	By the way, just like in Magic, as you go through and battle monsters, you get to keep
966320	968800	some of their cards and build them into your deck.
968800	974120	So it's a pretty intricate game, and of course the Xbox One also has the new Xbox Live mode.
974120	981080	Yes, and apparently poor ol' Jeevan finally got his Xbox 360, and that's one of the games
981080	985280	he's been playing all the time now, after he got rezzed, of course.
985280	990000	Looking at Portal Combat in our chatroom says, Coldsept is the only game you can play while
990000	991920	reading Entertainment Weekly.
991920	993400	I don't think the game's that boring.
993400	996120	I mean, it's not a fast-paced game.
996120	997920	You read Entertainment Weekly.
997920	998920	I know.
998920	999920	What the hell's wrong with you?
999920	1000920	You read Entertainment Weekly?
1000920	1001920	Oh, I'm kidding.
1001920	1003840	All right.
1003840	1004840	That's it for my Gaming Week.
1004840	1009080	Anything else anyone wants to share with their Gaming Week?
1009080	1011080	There's people out there that actually paint cats.
1011080	1012080	I'm sorry.
1012080	1014880	What does that have to do with games?
1014880	1015880	Anything?
1015880	1016880	That's creepy.
1016880	1018760	What do you do during this program?
1018760	1020360	Do we pay you to surf the internet?
1020360	1021360	Yes.
1021360	1023660	Yeah, we don't pay you at all.
1023660	1026240	Tonight's housekeeping, obviously, there's no Jamie here tonight.
1026240	1027240	Sadness.
1027240	1029400	We're going to try to give her a call a little later in the show so she can participate in
1029400	1035740	one of her regular segments, but the good news is tonight we have a brand new game.
1035740	1037120	We've never played on the show before.
1037120	1038840	It's something brand new.
1038840	1040440	Here's the cool thing.
1040440	1044300	You might remember last week we had a copy of Res HD that we were unable to give away
1044300	1048880	on the show because the person who won it didn't have an Xbox 360, whatever, didn't
1048880	1049880	want it.
1049880	1051880	It's back in the prize pool tonight.
1051880	1057440	Tonight, everybody that is in our chat room at chat.orangehontraded.com and listening
1057440	1060440	to the show has a chance to win.
1060440	1062800	Everybody can play this game tonight.
1062800	1064200	That's the cool thing about it.
1064200	1065760	I'm really looking forward to it.
1065760	1071040	I'll be coming up in Part B, so stick around and make sure you're in our chat room.
1071040	1075820	Other than that, just the usual plugs for us on MySpace at Orange Honch Radio, our live
1075820	1079640	journal at Orange Lounge, we have a Facebook community called the OL Army, so search us
1079640	1080640	out there.
1080640	1084960	Help us spread the word about independent radio and independent podcasting, and that's
1084960	1085960	it.
1085960	1088200	Now, Loki, do you think you can take some time away from Painted Cats to read us some
1088200	1089440	news stories?
1089440	1094000	I think I can.
1094000	1100280	We've had this for a while now, the Xbox 360 arcade model, the one replacing the core.
1100280	1103560	Well, now Japan's going to get a chance to have it as well.
1103560	1109240	They're going to get theirs March 6th, and of course, the arcade system is the one that
1109240	1117040	features no hard drive, but it has a memory unit, as well as five Xbox Live arcade games.
1117040	1125280	It's going to actually cost 27,800 yen, which is about $20 less than what we paid for it
1125280	1127000	in the United States.
1127000	1132320	Hopefully, that will help drive more Xbox 360 sales, because right now they're hurting.
1132320	1134160	But this is the one that doesn't have a hard drive, right?
1134160	1135760	No, it doesn't have a hard drive.
1135760	1139120	I would think all the games that people are interested in playing in Japan probably require
1139120	1140120	that hard drive.
1140120	1141120	Probably.
1141120	1142120	I mean, like Blue Dragon.
1142120	1143640	Well, I guess Blue Dragon doesn't require a hard drive.
1143640	1146680	It's just, you know, for game saves and stuff, it's got to, you know, have a game.
1146680	1147680	Lost Odyssey.
1147680	1150120	I'm trying to think of the more Japanese-centered game.
1150120	1152360	Well, I don't think Lost Odyssey requires a hard drive.
1152360	1153360	I guess not, or Devil Might Cry.
1153360	1154680	I guess none of those games do.
1154680	1156800	No, that's just PlayStation 3.
1156800	1158160	They require the hard drive for that.
1158160	1159160	All right.
1159160	1160160	I don't know.
1160160	1161160	I guess that's true.
1161160	1166240	I keep thinking Final Fantasy XI as well, which is really probably the first Japan-centric
1166240	1170280	game that I can think of, anyway, to come out on the Xbox 360 on both shores, even though
1170280	1173440	it was an already existing game, so it wasn't that hard to get out here, I'm sure.
1173440	1176600	They've tried all sorts of bundles, though, in Japan, and so far hasn't really helped.
1176600	1181720	I mean, they've only sold, like, what, a quarter-million yen last year, so...
1181720	1186200	Pika Uno in our chat room actually lives in Japan and is quick to point out some of the
1186200	1187200	facts.
1187200	1190560	The Blue Dragon bundle that they actually sold over there was a core pack.
1190560	1193480	He says all bundle packs in Japan are cores, so...
1193480	1197240	Which is kind of ironic, because it was the original core that didn't even have a memory
1197240	1201160	unit or anything, so it's like, oh, Blue Dragon, oh, but you gotta buy a memory unit.
1201160	1202160	Oh, darn.
1202160	1204120	Oh, hey, it's just like the PS2 was.
1204120	1205760	Oh, hey, look, I want to play a game.
1205760	1210760	Oh, wait, I can't save unless I buy a card.
1210760	1211760	Dope.
1211760	1217200	RossdielUT in chat says, if a series of top-notch Japanese games don't do it, this won't.
1217200	1222360	I guess that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff coming out that's kind of, you
1222360	1226360	would think, appeals, and you really have to generalize to say a lot of this, too, really
1226360	1230120	appeals to the Japanese audience, you know, like Lost Odyssey, but I hear that game didn't
1230120	1231560	do so well over there.
1231560	1235280	It didn't get very good reviews over there, but, you know, I don't know if...
1235280	1241040	When I was at GameStop getting cult-stepped, the guy who was actually thinking of buying
1241040	1243760	cult-stepped, actually, he was holding it up when I walked up to the counter reading
1243760	1247600	the back of the box, and I told him that was the game I wanted, but he told me he was excited
1247600	1249720	about Lost Odyssey, as well, so there is a little bit of a bug going on.
1249720	1254560	I am excited about Lost Odyssey, although I have low expectations for it.
1254560	1259480	I only see it as probably going to be slightly better than Enchanted Arms.
1259480	1262800	Well, we will see.
1262800	1269340	Meanwhile, also in Xbox 360 news, there are some new classic video games making their
1269340	1275140	way to the Xbox Live Classic downloads very soon.
1275140	1277360	I think there might be some type of tie-in.
1277360	1281080	I think the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game must be coming out soon, because some of the
1281080	1286360	games that have been announced to the Xbox originals, Pirates, as well as Ninja Gaiden,
1286360	1291880	so more Ninjas and Pirates jokes abound, but also another Xbox classic, Black, and I know
1291880	1293340	a lot of people are really into this game.
1293340	1294980	Black is also coming out for the Xbox originals.
1294980	1297600	Black for Black History Month.
1297600	1298600	I don't know about that.
1298600	1301920	I am just trying to find you.
1301920	1303400	You are trying to be funny and failing miserably.
1303400	1305400	I am not trying to be funny.
1305400	1306400	That was a little...
1306400	1307560	I don't know.
1307560	1308560	Somebody might think that...
1308560	1310520	Wouldn't that be weird if they did try to tie it in that way?
1310520	1313680	Would that be more insulting to the game or to Black History?
1313680	1314680	Black History.
1314680	1315920	Are you saying the game was not that great?
1315920	1319200	It was good, but it has nothing to do with Black History Month.
1319200	1320200	All right.
1320200	1323560	It would just be like, huh, Black, huh.
1323560	1324560	I don't know.
1324560	1325560	I am just trying...
1325560	1328560	Just being your normal crazy self.
1328560	1329560	I am just trying to figure it out.
1329560	1330560	Always controversial, Loki.
1330560	1331560	I don't know what I am talking about.
1331560	1336520	So we are getting some download content for Mass Effect coming March 10th.
1336520	1341640	It's a brand new, I don't know, set of missions called Bring Down the Sky.
1341640	1347640	It has actually a brand new race that they are introducing as well in there, and I guess
1347640	1349520	they are calling it the Batarians.
1349520	1350520	The Batarians.
1350520	1351520	Yeah.
1351520	1352520	Batarians.
1352520	1353520	Batarians.
1353520	1354520	Whatever.
1354520	1355520	They look like an ant.
1355520	1356520	I mean, sort of.
1356520	1362040	They've got like a bunch of eyes and a weird little bat nose.
1362040	1368360	Actually they look like a quasi-bat ant thing, I don't know, whatever.
1368360	1376240	So you'll be able to, you know, go to the colony and actually be able to save them and
1376240	1377240	stuff.
1377240	1378240	Yeah.
1378240	1380520	Gigantic space bats, I guess that's what they are saying.
1380520	1384400	It's only going to be 400 Microsoft points or $5, so that's not bad, and it's going to
1384400	1389080	add about 90 minutes to the game, and also there's going to be 50 achievement points
1389080	1391880	you can earn from it as well.
1391880	1396360	One thing, though, I remember reading about this, though, is it's midway through the game,
1396360	1400800	so if you have a save that's kind of towards the end of the game, you might already have
1400800	1405560	passed the ability to play this so you have to start a new game, which kind of blows,
1405560	1412320	but if you had just one save file to begin with, you're already failing at RPG.
1412320	1416040	RastioUT in our chat room makes a good comment, he says he will wait for the special edition
1416040	1421280	of the game with all the download content included, since we all know it's coming.
1421280	1422280	But for how long?
1422280	1426040	We don't know how much DLC is coming for Mass Effect.
1426040	1428600	In other words, it could be two years until that edition is released, right?
1428600	1431920	It'll probably be a year, because that's what they've done with some of the other ones,
1431920	1435400	although I haven't really noticed Microsoft games doing that, where they come out with
1435400	1438840	content, because you didn't see Perfect Dark come out with another Perfect Dark Zero or
1438840	1439840	something like that.
1439840	1440840	But there have been others.
1440840	1444720	PCN, Marvel, there's a few.
1444720	1451240	Marvel and Call of Duty, that's all Activision, so they tend to do that, but Microsoft does
1451240	1452240	not.
1452240	1456640	Would that be Bioware's decision?
1456640	1459000	Yeah, it would be their decision.
1459000	1463920	I would just say, buy it.
1463920	1468280	If you're really desperate for download content, otherwise save that $5 for a new game, huh?
1468280	1470340	That's what I'm saying.
1470340	1471840	Put that $5 down towards ResHD.
1471840	1472840	Exactly.
1472840	1477060	Do you want to spend $5 on 90 minutes of entertainment, or do you want to spend $5 on an Xbox Live
1477060	1478060	Arcade game?
1478060	1484160	That could end up being a lot more fun, or at least, I don't know, not many Xbox Live
1484160	1488200	Arcade games that are 400 Microsoft points, but still, it'd be a lot more fun than 90
1488200	1489200	minutes.
1489200	1490760	I'd spend it on food.
1490760	1496400	Well, you could also put that $5 towards a brand new Xbox 360 HD DVD player, and you
1496400	1503120	know what, thanks to this recent news, that $5 gets you one-twenty-sixth of the way there.
1503120	1510800	For you math whizzes, that means the HD DVD player is now costing $130, so the HD DVD
1510800	1514680	player has been dropped to $130 in the US and Canada.
1514680	1518380	Actually, it was even cheaper if you looked on Amazon a couple days ago.
1518380	1522380	Amazon was running an $80 deal for a little while, probably trying to clean out their
1522380	1528580	inventory in recent HD DVD versus Blu-ray news not looking good for HD DVD, and I'm
1528580	1531300	sure this is just another fallout of that.
1531300	1534880	If you can't beat the news, you've got to drop the price, right?
1534880	1538480	This is how they're going to make this look that much more attractive.
1538480	1542660	So of course, as you all know, HD DVDs have been kicked, punched, and everything this
1542660	1547880	year thanks to all the Blu-ray news, so this is certainly a welcome kick in the pants for
1547880	1551900	HD DVD owners, hopefully to drive some more sales and therefore more software.
1551900	1557140	I own an HD DVD player, I have for quite a while, and I kind of think it's over and I'm
1557140	1558140	kind of sad.
1558140	1560460	I think I bought the wrong one this time.
1560460	1563540	I wanted one just for Matrix, but I'll wait.
1563540	1569860	Well, if inevitably Blu-ray wins in a year or so, and I don't mean these preemptive Blu-ray
1569860	1570860	wins.
1570860	1574020	Blu-ray wins when HD DVD folds, you know what I mean?
1574020	1576780	If that happens in a year or whatever, then Matrix will come out on Blu-ray.
1576780	1577780	You know it will.
1577780	1578780	Oh, it will.
1578780	1579780	Of course.
1579780	1581340	Then the Star Wars movies will all come out too.
1581340	1583740	Everything, just like in DVD.
1583740	1588860	I mean, just, I think we're at a point where like everything is out on DVD, right?
1588860	1591760	Is there any movies, like big, big movies, maybe Chad's going to have to help me here.
1591760	1594380	Any big, big movies that are not out on DVD at this point?
1594380	1599220	I mean, I was reading some article earlier this week that one of the companies, I don't
1599220	1605460	know if it's Universal or what, has sold their entire back catalog to some company to make
1605460	1606460	custom DVDs.
1606460	1611220	So in other words, if you want a movie made at any point in time by, I want to say it
1611220	1615300	was Universal, this company will make a DVD for you, even if it's some obscure ass movie
1615300	1618780	from the 60s that didn't do very well.
1618780	1620380	Rad is a non-DVD.
1620380	1621380	What is it?
1621380	1622380	Rad.
1622380	1623380	Rad?
1623380	1624380	Rad was awesome.
1624380	1625380	What is Rad?
1625380	1626560	Rad is a BMX bike movie.
1626560	1629500	It's one of those, you know, fight for the underdogs thing.
1629500	1634500	They had an entire sequence where they did a musical dance number using BMX bikes at
1634500	1638180	a school prom or homecoming or something like that.
1638180	1639180	It was awesome.
1639180	1640900	Is Cop Rock out on DVD?
1640900	1641900	I don't know.
1641900	1642900	That needs to be out on DVD.
1642900	1643900	That was a TV show.
1643900	1646780	But Rad and Gleaming the Cube is another one that was pretty cool.
1646780	1648660	Oh, I gotta love the 80s movies.
1648660	1650060	Gleaming the Cube, I remember.
1650060	1651060	Gotta love the 80s movies.
1651060	1653060	You know how I know Gleaming the Cube?
1653060	1657340	Because there's a trailer for it on Pump Up the Volume.
1657340	1659780	That's how I know that.
1659780	1663460	Which as an independent radio person, you know that's one of my favorite movies ever,
1663460	1664460	is Pump Up the Volume.
1664460	1666220	But anyway, that's for another time.
1666220	1668680	Monster Squad, Rad, and Gleaming the Cube.
1668680	1670140	Do yourself a favor, watch them.
1670140	1675020	I know they were really cool back in the 80s and they're not so cool now, but hey, it's
1675020	1676020	nostalgia.
1676020	1678860	Hey, Josie16's got a good point.
1678860	1679860	The Wizard?
1679860	1680860	Is The Wizard out on DVD?
1680860	1681860	Yes, it is.
1681860	1682860	I think I've seen it.
1682860	1683860	I think they did finally come out.
1683860	1684860	They were released in August or something.
1684860	1685860	It took them a while.
1685860	1687740	It took them a while, but it finally did.
1687740	1688740	I don't own it.
1688740	1691020	I need to put that on my birthday wish list.
1691020	1693020	Hey, wait until High Def.
1693020	1694020	High Def Wizardry.
1694020	1695020	That's true.
1695020	1700820	High Def Super Mario 3 or whatever that is.
1700820	1703060	Remember the lame announcer?
1703060	1712820	Yes, I want to be able to have, you know, He Touched My Breaths in 7.1.
1712820	1714420	Moving on.
1714420	1718140	So another game getting some download content, Project Gotham Racing 4.
1718140	1722260	It's going to bring some brand new cars as well as some new modes and of course, more
1722260	1724580	achievements.
1724580	1726780	Of the downloads, they're going to have one that's free.
1726780	1728640	It's called the Free Challenge Pack.
1728640	1736980	It has a playable hydrogen-powered pergo-flux car, I guess, tourist mode where you just
1736980	1741540	drive around the city and admire the scenery with no goal whatsoever, and free roam cat
1741540	1742540	and mouse mode.
1742540	1744300	See, the free roam stuff is pretty cool.
1744300	1750820	They're taking a little page from Burnout Paradise and of course, seven unlockable achievements.
1750820	1755340	The Premium Challenge Pack, which is going to be $5 or 400 Microsoft points, includes
1755340	1764260	700 new cars including the 1987 BMW M3 E30 DTM and the World Challenge Arcade mode with
1764260	1770140	20 new events in three themed chapters and three more unlockable achievements.
1770140	1774660	And these will be available on Valentine's Day.
1774660	1780060	Because nothing says love like a downloadable hydrogen car.
1780060	1784740	Hey, that's the love for the environment, okay?
1784740	1789140	Maybe if, you know, ladies want to get something for their husbands, not to be stereotypical,
1789140	1791420	I'm sure there's a lot of girl Project Awesomeers out there.
1791420	1793420	I got you this free download content.
1793420	1794420	Oh, thanks.
1794420	1795420	Thank you.
1795420	1798100	If Nellie bought you the content, you'd be happy, wouldn't you?
1798100	1799100	No, I wouldn't.
1799100	1800100	I'd be like...
1800100	1801100	You're a bad husband.
1801100	1804800	All right, she wouldn't touch the 360.
1804800	1806380	She doesn't know how to do that stuff.
1806380	1811220	She can't even figure out how to play a DVD on there.
1811220	1817860	All right, let's see, also, I want to go back and read some comments from chat.
1817860	1819620	I forgot about this DVD release.
1819620	1821820	This is a big DVD release that came out this week.
1821820	1825060	A NYR fan says, I saw the King of Kong the other day.
1825060	1826060	Yeah.
1826060	1827060	Did you see King of Kong yet?
1827060	1829060	Did you get that DVD?
1829060	1831480	Nope.
1831480	1835180	But they made me buy Donkey Kong for a week because they were going to do this big King
1835180	1837620	of Kong contest thing.
1837620	1839140	Never fucking paid me for it.
1839140	1840940	And then they ended up not doing it.
1840940	1842060	So we decided not to do it.
1842060	1846060	I'm like, where's my five bucks?
1846060	1847060	Sorry about that.
1847060	1850060	I'm like, thanks, bastards.
1850060	1851060	Nice.
1851060	1852060	Let's see.
1852060	1858080	Oh, joshi16 in chat says, about the wizard coming out in high def someday, so much batter
1858080	1859080	in HD.
1859080	1860080	Exactly.
1860080	1863380	That's what they should call it, the it's so batter edition.
1863380	1865500	Oh my God, it needs to be in 3D.
1865500	1866500	That'd be awesome.
1866500	1874500	Hey, you know they're doing that with a lot of old Disney movies, at least, are coming
1874500	1875500	back out in 3D.
1875500	1877740	Toy Story, all those are going to come out in 3D.
1877740	1881740	Toy Story is easy because they just have to render it with two camera angles.
1881740	1883140	That's simple stuff.
1883140	1884140	Sorry.
1884140	1885140	Child's Play.
1885140	1889180	In fact, Loki's going to go home and make Toy Story 3D for all of you.
1889180	1896300	I'll make a sequel, I can crap it out in a sec.
1896300	1897540	Let's see, moving on.
1897540	1900620	Something else that's going to be making its way to Xbox very soon.
1900620	1902460	Now this, here you go.
1902460	1903780	Here's a movie that needs to be in HD.
1903780	1905900	I don't think this is out in HD yet.
1905900	1906900	Tron.
1906900	1907900	That'd be cool.
1907900	1908900	Tron is winner.
1908900	1909900	Of course.
1909900	1915100	Tron, of course, the original Tron, that game is already out on the Xbox Live Marketplace,
1915100	1918000	but we all knew this game was coming, Disks of Tron.
1918000	1920300	That's right, the other Tron arcade game.
1920300	1923420	That is going to be coming out on Xbox Live and it makes its way when?
1923420	1924740	Why this week.
1924740	1927900	February 13th is the big day for Disks of Tron.
1927900	1930540	Now how would you feel if Nellie got you Disks of Tron for Valentine's Day?
1930540	1931540	That would be much cooler.
1931540	1932540	I fucking hate Disks of Tron.
1932540	1933540	What?
1933540	1937700	I don't like the Tron games, I'm sorry.
1937700	1939700	Disks of Tron is awesome.
1939700	1943260	Disks of Tron was, I'm trying to think of a game that it was very much like.
1943260	1946540	It's kind of like, it's really just an over glorified pong.
1946540	1950020	And if you've seen the movie, you remember that disc thing they would play, they did
1950020	1952620	that little dance and they'd throw the disc in the air and it would bounce off the wall
1952620	1955580	or whatever and hit the platform and make part of it disappear.
1955580	1957300	And ultimately you're trying to make your opponent disappear.
1957300	1958860	It's like that, but a real game.
1958860	1965500	They should have that at Disneyland, like actual Disks of Tron, wouldn't that be cool?
1965500	1970640	They could do it with some sort of motion capture stuff where you're in black lights,
1970640	1974100	one person's on the other side and you make the motion like you're throwing a disc and
1974100	1978140	it makes the image of a disc go, I mean, that'd be kind of cool.
1978140	1979140	Good times.
1979140	1980140	They could do it.
1980140	1981140	I don't know.
1981140	1984020	They just need to make sure the platform actually falls off from underneath you.
1984020	1986860	And then you fall to your untimely death at the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean.
1986860	1990020	And then you become a slave at Disneyland.
1990020	1991020	The end.
1991020	1994620	No, it could be like that, you remember that game show they had on Game Show Network?
1994620	1995620	Nick Arcade.
1995620	1996620	No, no, no.
1996620	1997620	Russian Roulette.
1997620	1998620	Oh, I remember that.
1998620	2001380	On the Game Show Network where they have that show.
2001380	2006820	Directed by Mark L. Wahlberg, which is like, how do you describe Mark L. Wahlberg?
2006820	2011180	He's the total, like, just, what's a word to describe him?
2011180	2013780	You know, he hosts that Moment of Truth show now, douche.
2013780	2019740	Like if you ever need like a total asshole to host your game show, like, Mark L. Wahlberg's
2019740	2020740	the guy to call.
2020740	2023260	And so he was awesome on, and I mean that as a compliment.
2023260	2026380	So he hosted Russian Roulette and you would pull, and I know we have an international
2026380	2029340	audience, so maybe not everybody has heard of this show, although they probably stole
2029340	2030700	it from another country.
2030700	2034980	You would, basically, you know, as people missed questions, lights would light up on
2034980	2039140	the ground, including one that you were standing under, and you had to pull the lever and spin
2039140	2044300	the lights, and if the light landed on you, then the floor would open and you fell.
2044300	2048020	Now obviously in the game show you just fell a few feet onto some padding.
2048020	2049020	Yeah.
2049020	2050020	Yeah.
2050020	2051020	I wish.
2051020	2052020	We'd like to believe that.
2052020	2053020	How awesome would that be?
2053020	2060140	In my mind, they fell through wood chipper, but that's, you know.
2060140	2061140	Alright.
2061140	2062140	You win $100!
2062140	2063140	Oh, I want the money!
2063140	2064140	Yeah, fuck you!
2064140	2065140	You're going through the floor!
2065140	2068140	I'm keeping the $100!
2068140	2070060	Sorry to get off track here.
2070060	2071220	Grand Theft Auto IV!
2071220	2075580	The website's actually been relaunched for the game, including some new video footage
2075580	2077420	that they have of it.
2077420	2084140	One is a mock commercial for a wireless communications company, including where they say that there's
2084140	2088940	no drop calls and they have reliable handsets, where the guy throws a handset at someone's
2088940	2089940	head and stuff.
2089940	2091100	It's pretty fun.
2091100	2097980	Also, if you want, there is a Lovemeat.net quiz, which is going to be the fictional kind
2097980	2104060	of eHarmony or whatever website that's going to be in the game for dating people.
2104060	2108180	You can take your quiz and figure out what personality type you have.
2108180	2114220	I know we did this at work and we came up with pervert, so that was kind of funny.
2114220	2118460	And I'm assuming they're going to be adding some more content to the website as the weeks
2118460	2120340	go along.
2120340	2125540	We're coming up on the April 29th date, which is when the game comes out.
2125540	2126660	Can't wait!
2126660	2128540	Some other stuff has come out about it as well.
2128540	2133980	Some leaked information, apparently, about the multiplayer details, including some of
2133980	2140820	the deathmatches that they have planned, co-op, team-based head-to-head battles, online races.
2140820	2147440	They had some names for them as well, Cops & Crooks, Bomb the Base, and Hangman's Noose.
2147440	2150820	The site that was running Destructoid was actually going to have a list of the achievements
2150820	2156940	as well until Rockstar said, uh-uh, don't put those up there.
2156940	2160360	So they wouldn't be threatened by lawyers, they decided not to put the content up there
2160360	2163460	and kind of retracted their original articles.
2163460	2170460	I'm glad a large, well-established, respectable website like Destructoid will also run away
2170460	2172620	with their tail behind their legs when threatened.
2172620	2179140	And yes, I'm referring to a year-old drama, but face it, that's a history of this show
2179140	2180380	that will never be let down.
2180380	2184620	Sorry to interrupt, I just had to work that in there.
2184620	2190620	And I think also to their defense, you probably wouldn't want to put that stuff up anyway
2190620	2192700	because it would spoil a lot of the game.
2192700	2196860	They basically said, hey, in respect for this game coming out in a few months here, just
2196860	2201260	not put this up yet because that will spoil a lot of the story for the game.
2201260	2203140	You don't want to spoil a game like this, it's going to be awesome.
2203140	2205320	Oh, there's also some minigames you can play in it as well.
2205320	2211780	Some of them, they mentioned Darts, you'll be able to play Pool, and some other game.
2211780	2213020	I don't know.
2213020	2217020	You know what though, here's the thing, if they got that list of achievements from a
2217020	2221100	press copy of the game or something, then I'd say they have no right to post them up
2221100	2222100	on the internet.
2222100	2228140	But if they're extracting them from the Xbox.com website or whatever because one of the Rockstar
2228140	2232020	employees went on with this copy of the game or something, I don't know.
2232020	2235340	I'm sure that's what's happened before with some other games.
2235340	2237980	I'm sure this stuff would be on PartnerNet or something like that.
2237980	2238980	Right.
2238980	2242020	I would say if it's out there on the public internet, it's free information put up.
2242020	2246700	No, this is from an insider that works at Rockstar or something else on the internet.
2246700	2250180	Yeah, can't do that.
2250180	2255940	If it's public information, they have nowhere to complain, but if it's an actual leak like
2255940	2259180	this, then yeah, they kind of have the right to take it down.
2259180	2263300	DMN is anticipating there will be a 15 gamer score achievement called Bitch Better Have
2263300	2264300	My Money.
2264300	2265300	Who knows.
2265300	2271500	DMN also predicts a 30 gamer score for Luke Warm Coffee.
2271500	2275040	I hope there is an achievement that pokes fun at hot coffee, there really, really should
2275040	2276040	be.
2276040	2279260	Like there should be an achievement like hot coffee, and it's actually you go buy coffee.
2279260	2281500	You actually do buy hot coffee.
2281500	2282500	Coffee from here.
2282500	2286500	You blow up a Starbucks or whatever they call it in Grand Theft Auto, a little parody name
2286500	2287500	or something.
2287500	2288500	That'd be funny.
2288500	2289500	Very cool.
2289500	2291820	Well, I know you must be looking forward to the multiplayer in this game.
2291820	2292820	Oh, fuck yeah.
2292820	2295420	We're going to own the world in this game.
2295420	2296420	I'm telling you, we...
2296420	2299260	Is this something you're looking forward to dominating the listeners on your season?
2299260	2300260	Oh, yeah.
2300260	2303980	I'm telling you, because we at work, we've been playing Grand Theft Auto, at least on
2303980	2308180	the PSP and multiplayer, for two years now, and now we've switched to Saints Row to kind
2308180	2312820	of bring ourselves up to speed on, you know, 360 multiplayer games and stuff, like Grand
2312820	2313820	Theft Auto.
2313820	2317220	But as soon as Grand Theft Auto comes out, man, we're playing this twice a day for fifteen
2317220	2321580	minutes each, and we're getting live in our work here pretty soon, so...
2321580	2325020	How much do you think you can kill in fifteen minutes?
2325020	2326700	I can kill quite a few people.
2326700	2332460	Usually in like Saints Row, I can rack up a score of twenty or more if we're playing
2332460	2333460	just rockets.
2333460	2339820	It's just all out, we usually end up being around, you know, ten to fifteen kills, but
2339820	2344940	if we do teams, like six man teams, oh man, we're going to own everybody, seriously, because
2344940	2349260	we have so much experience in this game, and we'll learn all the little nuances, it's just
2349260	2351180	not even going to be fun.
2351180	2356500	But you know, I don't think anyone's actually going to want to play online during our breaks.
2356500	2358220	I'll force them to, though.
2358220	2359700	I will be up to that challenge.
2359700	2363580	Well, I don't know how y'all feel about this, but I don't know.
2363580	2367540	As cool as Grand Theft Auto is, it's not really my kind of game, but this is one I could definitely
2367540	2370300	play a lot of online, it's Street Fighter IV.
2370300	2373720	And this is going to be a fun one, I bet to play online pretty soon, although it's really
2373720	2378160	no replacement for the arcade, and I think we all need to remember that, because sadly
2378160	2381780	arcades are dying and they're turning into ticket-spitting machine heaven.
2381780	2386160	But you know, Street Fighter IV, like it or not, it will be online, and what makes it
2386160	2391420	very cool is that, in a way, you're going to get to relive the past, because it was
2391420	2395900	announced this week that all the old Street Fighter II characters are coming back in Street
2395900	2396940	Fighter IV.
2396940	2401540	So it's not just Ryu, it's not just Ken, it's not just Chun-Li, as they originally said,
2401540	2408380	but you're also getting Guile, Blanca, Zangief, Dalsium, E. Honda, they're all back, the original
2408380	2411900	eight fighters in Street Fighter IV, and there's some scans from Famitsu Magazine that actually
2411900	2414420	show them in their new art style, and it's pretty rad.
2414420	2418180	And then there's even some more stuff with Crimson Viper, so it's not just the original
2418180	2421940	eight are going to be in Street Fighter IV, there's more, the family's growing.
2421940	2424780	Someone did post the achievement list, I guess, on Destructoid.
2424780	2431160	Oh wow, so uh, well then I retracted everything I said.
2431160	2434860	They have an achievement for demolishing 20 buildings using only your rocket launcher?
2434860	2436820	Wait, how do you know it's legit?
2436820	2439180	That's my next question.
2439180	2441340	That's someone's blog, I guess.
2441340	2445300	Okay, well I could be, so take with a grain of salt, in my opinion.
2445300	2446300	Yeah.
2446300	2449220	You want to say any others?
2449220	2455580	Let's see here, out of town, stay hidden for six days, that's one of the achievements.
2455580	2459660	Let me see if there's anything real quick for the hot coffee, I don't see anything on
2459660	2461540	here.
2461540	2468300	Let's see here, yeah it's probably not going to be in there, but it's a nice thought.
2468300	2471900	I like the hooker one on there.
2471900	2473700	I don't know if this is legit or not.
2473700	2478940	See, I'm saying when it shows up on somebody's little blog, I'm not saying that it's necessarily
2478940	2482020	a lie, but you do kind of have to take it with a grain of salt, because there are people
2482020	2487260	out there that want to lie, and especially probably because of the lulls that people
2487260	2490260	are having over the whole, well they know the list but they can't spoil it, you know
2490260	2491260	what I mean?
2491260	2494220	I wonder if there would be a lot more achievements in that there too.
2494220	2497340	Because there's an achievement that says I get it, and I'll read the first letter of
2497340	2504340	each achievement name, yeah it's fake, it says you're stupid for believing it, yeah
2504340	2508300	you suck donkey cock, yeah that's what it says, nice, okay, although that would be cool
2508300	2513500	if that was real, like Rockstar really should do that, like that's their hidden thing to
2513500	2517500	piss off the senators, like you know, when you take the first letter of each word it
2517500	2522640	says you know, senators are all gay or something, you know, I don't know, yeah you suck donkey
2522640	2527280	cock, don't trust anything, yeah, nice, nice, okay, nice touch there, yeah look you got
2527280	2533440	pwned, I didn't get pwned, oh my god it's legit, going back to Street Fighter 4 for
2533440	2540100	a minute, something we do know a little more about, RossdielUT in chat asks, oh no Cammy,
2540100	2544260	no not at this time, only the classic 8 Street Fighter 2 characters have been announced,
2544260	2547660	that doesn't even include boss characters, but honestly I don't know, if I were a betting
2547660	2551620	man I would think you're going to get all your 2 characters, all the super characters
2551620	2557840	meaning the bosses and Cammy and all them as well, I don't know, they might cut, did
2557840	2562640	anybody really use T-Hawk, I don't know, I think they might cut T-Hawk, the characters
2562640	2567060	nobody really used, I bet some of the Street Fighter 3 characters are going to be in this
2567060	2570220	too, oh of course, I think it's going to be epic, I think it's going to have a ton
2570220	2573420	of fighters, there's plenty of room for everybody, and if they don't put Dan in it
2573420	2577980	there's going to be a riot, there will be a riot, yeah, Tigerclaw says I wouldn't
2577980	2583620	be surprised if Akuma is in Street Fighter 4, absolutely, and of course, Shang Long has
2583620	2588940	to be in it, because you must beat Shang Long to stand a chance, anyway, forget it.
2588940	2594240	Well one game, which we thought for a second there, we thought, oh my god, hell froze over,
2594240	2602700	but Duke Nukem Forever, apparently there was an interview for the Dallas Business Journal,
2602700	2607340	where 3D Realms president Scott Miller confirmed all sorts of stuff, including that Duke Nukem
2607340	2612580	Forever was coming in 2008, and that Duke Nukem 3D was going to be coming to Xbox Live
2612580	2617440	Arcade, and some of the stuff that he said, we haven't officially announced any platform
2617440	2624660	for Duke Nukem Forever, but of course, hitting the big three makes most sense, PC, PS3, and
2624660	2630540	360, and he said 3D Realms is negotiating with Microsoft to get a release window of
2630540	2639380	some time this year on the title, and that's of course for Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade,
2639380	2644620	and he confirmed that Duke Nukem Forever would be coming out in 2008 to home consoles, but
2644620	2650340	shortly after he was claimed to have said all this stuff, 3D Realms was like, uh-uh,
2650340	2660380	we never said that, and apparently, which they said, the George Bressard of 3D Realms
2660380	2664540	said, in what appears to be an unfortunate turn of events, there seems to have been some
2664540	2669860	confusion between what was off the record and what was not. I suppose we're used to
2669860	2676400	dealing with the gaming press and not mainstream press. Lesson learned. So, I don't know if
2676400	2681340	that means that, uh, yeah, it is actually coming out in 2008, but shhh, we never said
2681340	2687180	that, you know, that type of thing, or... I think they're more afraid of the, uh, the
2687180	2691420	space-time continuing damage that would come from actually confirming this game. They basically
2691420	2697620	said the release date is still when it's done and will be until that appropriate moment.
2697620	2703460	Platforms have not been finalized or announced. You can... It'll be done when it's done and
2703460	2706940	stop asking. But here's the question, though. Anyone still... Just put that on a big piece
2706940	2712260	of paper and fax it to any website. Granted, this will be an instant purchase for me, but,
2712260	2716980	I mean, do I really care anymore about... I mean, this isn't like some huge epic game
2716980	2723460	anymore, just kinda, eh, whatever. It's limping along to the finish line. You'd buy it just
2723460	2726900	to see how terrible it actually turns out to be. Oh, it's not gonna be... I mean, it's
2726900	2733540	gonna be borderline terrible. Like, Duke Nukem 3D was borderline terrible, but, um, it'll
2733540	2737700	be awesome. Wait a minute, Duke Nukem 3D was kinda rad. It was rad, but see, it had the
2737700	2742260	cops shooting hookers. It had the B movie, like, it's cool for the same reason Evil Dead
2742260	2744860	is cool. Yeah, that's what I meant. Let's put it that way. Well, it's also cool because
2744860	2749980	they use a lot of lines from Evil Dead as well. True, true, true. Alright. I don't know.
2749980	2754420	Well, one thing that's not cool is, uh, going down and burning things down. And, uh, what's
2754420	2759980	even not cool, er, what's even more not cooler is to brag about it on the internet. And,
2759980	2766500	uh, so you know for this, we've gotta give out another one of these. That's right, it's
2766500	2772540	another Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award. The Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award this
2772540	2782180	week goes to a user on Game Facts. And their name is Jedi Knight 12345. Jedi Knight 12345,
2782180	2787100	uh, made a post in the current events section of the Game Facts forums. And what he was
2787100	2793820	doing is he was asking the folks on the forums if he should burn down a school and a church.
2793820	2802020	And what happened a little later in the town of Palmyra, Missouri? He burned down a church.
2802020	2806700	And so this boy was arrested on, uh, suspected arson charges. We don't know his real name
2806700	2811380	because he is under the age of 18 and they withhold that kind of stuff. Uh, so we can't
2811380	2815140	give out the stupid award by his real name but he certainly, if he's over the age of
2815140	2820220	like 4, he's old enough to know better. You know what I mean? Even at that age you should
2820220	2824540	know better. Do we really need more reason not to go on the Game Facts forums? Seriously.
2824540	2829580	I feel bad for Game Facts because everybody's just using this as a reason to attack them
2829580	2833460	like, you know, well that's what he gets for going to Game Facts, hahaha. You know, I'm
2833460	2839940	like okay, haha. Their community was terrible long before anyone cared. Well, seriously
2839940	2844660	though, this idiot could have been out there anywhere, you know, on any website. I swear,
2844660	2849460	if any of our listeners ever do anything this stupid, I will find you and beat you up myself
2849460	2853260	and it will not be pleasant. Do not do, don't do stupid things and if you're thinking about
2853260	2857540	doing something stupid, please call someone and ask for help. Yeah, how long is it going
2857540	2860140	to be before someone actually cleans? And don't log onto the internet and post on a
2860140	2866100	forum. Pick up the phone and call 911 and turn yourself in. Seriously. But that, then
2866100	2871660	they wouldn't be anonymous like they are on the internet. Can't catch me, I'm on Game
2871660	2878940	Facts. Amaze Satsuma says 12345, how did you know the combination for my briefcase? By
2878940	2883340	the way, Jedi, as if even just asking about it wasn't bad enough, it should also be noted
2883340	2890440	that Jedi Knight 12345 went back to the forum and bragged that he had in fact burned a church
2890440	2897440	and schooled down and he posted pictures of it on Game Facts. Now, to the users of Game
2898580	2903800	Facts credit, other forum posters immediately went and found the local news station in this
2903800	2907980	area and contacted them and the authorities and all that, you know, contacted people that
2907980	2912340	could do something about it and turned this guy in basically. So, hooray to the Game Facts
2912340	2916560	users that turned this guy in, you are exempt from the stupid award this week. However,
2916560	2922860	Jedi Knight 12345, it's your stupid award. Congratulations, you're stupid. There you
2922860	2929860	have it. In fact, this is just like a really stupid, stupid thing to do and this just makes
2930420	2934700	me mad that now, you know, he's probably going to come back and it's going to get somehow
2934700	2938940	tied back into the fact that he was a gamer. Oh, of course. You know, oh, he played too
2938940	2942420	much. What's a game where you set fire to things? Is there a game where you set fire
2942420	2945060	to things? There's got to be. Grand Theft Auto. He played too much Grand Theft Auto.
2945060	2951060	Too much Crackdown? Molotov Cocktage. He played too much Crackdown. He played too much Dracula,
2951060	2955220	throwing, or Castlevania, throwing the holy fire and learned how to start fires. So, playing
2955220	2962220	too much WoW as a mage. Geez. So, the complete idiocy of this guy makes me angsty. He fires
2962220	2976180	a magic missile into the darkness. You know this brings on the FUs of the Week. Loki,
2976180	2980420	your FUs of the Week, please. My FUs of the Week goes to a headache that's coming on right
2980420	2986220	about now and that sucks. I fucking hate getting headaches on Sundays and it's always on Sundays,
2986220	2992700	but not having anything to do with this show, of course. It's just I get headaches on Sundays.
2992700	2997820	Maybe you're allergic to Sunday. I'm allergic to the holy day, I guess. Sorry to hear that.
2997820	3003620	Puppy, do you have any FUs you'd like to give this week? FUs to Insomnia, letting me get
3003620	3010620	about ten hours of sleep over the course of four nights, and FUs to the charger from my
3010620	3017620	laptop for going up and now my laptop is running on battery power until it eventually dies.
3019540	3023540	My FUs of the Week goes to Sears. I don't want to give too many details about purchases
3023540	3028740	I made a while ago, but oh my god, I had to go back to the store twice in one day to clear
3028740	3035740	up this issue that I was having that wasn't even my fault with Sears. Ugh, horrible. Sears
3035740	3041140	is on my shit list this week. I had to speak to like five different people, three on the
3041140	3045140	phone, two in the store. It was horrible. But the last person I spoke to, it doesn't
3045140	3049420	always go this way, the last person I spoke to could have fixed everything the very first
3049420	3056420	time if I talked to that person first. Freaks. Let's move on with more news. Well, if I told
3056460	3062180	you that an Oscar-nominated game was coming, or a game based off an Oscar-nominated movie
3062180	3069180	coming out soon, you probably wouldn't guess Juno as the game being... I don't know. Why
3070340	3073620	would they make a game based off of Juno? I don't understand it. Teaching little girls
3073620	3079660	about pregnancy adventures? I haven't seen Juno, but I hear it's about teenage pregnancy
3079660	3083700	or whatever. I'm not exactly sure how that makes a game. Did they make a game out of
3083700	3090700	Napoleon Dynamite? I'm not sure how they'd make a game out of that either. Juno to me
3090700	3094820	feels like it might be this year's Napoleon Dynamite. It's really funny now, but when
3094820	3100820	it comes out on video, there's going to be a big backlash against it. Just do wait. So,
3100820	3106980	I don't know. Apparently, there is a panel at DICE, the summit going on in Las Vegas
3106980	3113980	right now, during the intellectual property migration specialists. It says people are
3113980	3120980	making a game based off Juno just to cater to the casual market. And they didn't specify
3121980	3128980	really anything about the game, but apparently it was... I don't know. He said it was probably
3130740	3137740	going to be following Nexon's free-to-play business model. So, I don't know. So it would
3137740	3143740	be like little mini-games for free or something? I'm sorry. This is probably going to be about
3143740	3150740	as good as that Dirty Dancing game that came out, or possibly the Princess Bride. Ryoma
3152260	3158300	in our chat room says, Skye, Juno is a lot less stupid than Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't
3158300	3163260	seen Juno, so I thought Napoleon Dynamite was funny. I didn't think it was the most
3163260	3167780	hilarious movie ever made, but I did find some things very amusing in that movie, like
3167780	3173860	the grandma especially, you know? Make me another Questadilla. And when she got in the
3173860	3179180	dirt bike accident, it was really funny. Forget it. Forget it, forget it. Let's talk about
3179180	3183220	some other games that are coming out around the world and will start tonight in the UK,
3183220	3187740	because usually Jamie does those dates, but she can't tonight. So I will be doing UK dates
3187740	3193700	for you guys this week. Coming out in Europe, Battalion Wars 2 makes its way to the Wii
3193700	3199020	on the 15th, along with 8-Ball All-Stars and the DS. Castlevania, the Dracula X Chronicles
3199020	3201740	is a big game that came out here a little while ago. Europe, you're finally getting
3201740	3206820	it on the PSP on the 15th, as well as Coded Arms Contingent, also on the PSP. Cooking
3206820	3211340	Mama 2 finally comes out on the Nintendo DS for you guys. Not as bad of a delay, though.
3211340	3216840	We just got it here about a month ago. Cruis'n makes its way to the Wii. I'm sorry. Dragon
3216840	3222940	Ball Z, Budokai Tekenshi 3 comes out on the Wii. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Elements
3222940	3229260	comes out on the Xbox 360. Coming out on the DS, a big title, Final Fantasy XII Revenant
3229260	3234140	Wings, which Loki was kind enough to get me for Christmas, and I still haven't played.
3234140	3237940	I'm very sorry, Loki. But I feel like I need to finish Final Fantasy XII on console first.
3237940	3244380	I will. Soon. Multi-platform wise, you got a game called Jumper coming out on PlayStation
3244380	3252340	2 and the Xbox 360. NBA 08 on the PlayStation 3, coming out on the Wii as well. The Destiny
3252340	3258880	of Zorro. That sounds like it could suck. Lastly, but certainly not leastly, where would
3258880	3264420	you Naruto fans be without a release for you? Naruto Ninja Destiny in the UK on the DS on
3264420	3273420	the 15th of February. In the US, we're getting quite a few things coming out, including Lost
3273420	3279780	Odyssey, that we've been seeing some pretty strange commercials for on TV. It makes it
3279780	3284180	look like some sort of hippie game, I don't know. I fast-forward all commercials, so what
3284180	3289580	makes it look so horrible? It's the music that they picked for. Yeah, I don't remember
3289580	3293880	what the name was. I don't know, it's just... But it's something about White Knight talking
3293880	3300660	backwards. Huh. Interesting. God, I wish I remembered the name of that song. I don't
3300660	3304740	wish I remembered the name of that song. It's horrible. Anyways, so that's... Now you know
3304740	3311820	I gotta look it up on YouTube, so... So that's coming out in the US on the 360. Today, actually,
3311820	3317540	Professor Layton and the Curious Village made its way out onto the DS. Also this week, Conflict
3317540	3327580	Denied Ops on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. On the PC, Penumbra, The Black Plague.
3327580	3333860	That's coming out. Jumper, a Griffin story on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and the Wii. It's
3333860	3338900	kind of a side story to the movie, which I hear the movie sucks, by the way, so... Why
3338900	3347220	am I not surprised? Dungeon Explorer, Warriors of the Ancient Arts for PSP and DS. Dark Messiah
3347220	3356000	of Might and Magic Elements on Xbox 360. Space Force Captains on PC. There's also a new episode
3356000	3362380	of the Sam & Max game, Episode 203, The Night of the Raving Dead. That's, of course, on
3362380	3373100	PC. Carrier Strike Force on PC. 13th Century Death of Glory. Wipeout Pulse on the PSP.
3373100	3379100	Innocent Life of Futuristic Harvest Moon, Special Edition on PlayStation 2. Yay! Futuristic
3379100	3387940	Harvest Moon. Yeah, it was on PSP before. RPG Maker VX on PC. And finally on PlayStation
3387940	3395780	2, and they moved it up quite a bit from March. Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation
3395780	3402540	2. It moved up a whole friggin' month. Here's what I love about live radio. We've got YouTube
3402540	3405920	right up here. We've got the chat room to help us find things on YouTube. Here's a little
3405920	3410300	piece of the Lost Odyssey TV commercial. And that funny, I mean, obviously, what horrible
3410300	3428020	radio, but Loki's talking about the strange audio. Oh, these are classic songs. Oh, this
3428020	3441060	is Jefferson Airplane. That was pretty rad. White Rabbit, my Jefferson Airplane. There
3441060	3447580	it is, right there on the side. Sorry, I am not up on my Jefferson Airplane. Okay. Also,
3447580	3451740	this week, or next weekend, I want you to go get some CDs. I want you to get Jefferson
3451740	3458900	Airplane. I want you to get Fog Hat. I want you to get some Pink Floyd, and Journey for
3458900	3465700	good measure, because you know I can't go get some Clean's Clearwater Revival. I want
3465700	3471740	you to smoke a big bonk. Just kidding, we don't endorse that. Some other fun stuff,
3471740	3476140	of course, this is the scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff, but oh, I forgot to mention
3476140	3485100	also the cobalt blue and black DS that came out today as well. Anyways, Go Diego Go Safari
3485100	3492740	Rescue 1 PlayStation 2, and the Wii. Got to pick that one up. There was also a Dora the
3492740	3497700	Explorer game coming out, but I don't really care what that is. Bloom Pop on the Wii. What
3497700	3502540	was that parody of Dora the Explorer they had on Saturday Night Live? I don't remember
3502540	3507820	that. I think I, like, wet myself laughing. It was so freaking hilarious, because, you
3507820	3514060	know, forget it. I'll save that for another show. Anyways, Bloom Pop for the Wii. It's
3514060	3519980	a really cheap puzzle game, so that's kind of neat. Rock Band, they're getting the stand-alone
3519980	3524780	drum sets. They're supposed to be coming out this week as well, so look for those. $90
3524780	3532940	peripherals. There's $80 peripherals. I thought it was $90 for the drum sets. No, $80. It's
3532940	3541860	still expensive, though. Yeah. And that's it. Sorry. Alright, let's move on to Japanese
3541860	3550620	release dates. Coming out in Japan on the 14th of February on the Xbox 360, WWE Smackdown
3550620	3554900	vs. Raw 2008. I don't know how popular Rasslin' is over in Japan. I think they have their
3554900	3559040	own wrestling league over there, because I've seen some YouTubage. But if you want to experience
3559040	3562900	the American version, there you go. It's also coming out on PlayStation 3, by the way, and
3562900	3566660	appears to be one of the bigger releases this week in Japan. There's not a lot else. It's
3566660	3570580	also coming out on the Wii. But if you're not a Rasslin' fan, you can get Medal of Honor,
3570580	3573820	Heroes 2. It does come out on the Nintendo Wii. By the way, there's also a bundle with
3573820	3580740	the Wii Zapper making its way to Japan. On the PlayStation 2, Decapo! The Origin comes
3580740	3588980	out. Another Pachinko game, Jisen Pachislot, Hisoho Selection, Salomon Kintaru, Slaughter
3588980	3593780	Kintaru, Oreno Sora. Yes, that's one name. It's another Sega Pachinko game. That's all
3593780	3600680	you need to know. Kimikiz comes out as well. Poison Pink. That sounds like it could be
3600680	3608260	kind of fun. And another Rasslin' game, Wrestle Angels Survivor. Good price. It might be a
3608260	3612820	price reduction on that. I don't know about that one. Interesting. Let's see what's coming
3612820	3618580	out on the handhelds on the Nintendo DS. Digimon Championship. A game called Happy, Happy Clover
3618580	3628060	comes out as well. And just in time for Valentine's Day, Otomeki Koikakume Love Revo DS comes
3628060	3632180	out as well. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything of note for you
3632180	3637540	guys over in Japan. Medal of Honor as well coming on the Sony PSP, Medal of Honor Heroes
3637540	3643540	that is. And where would your life be without another Gundam game? Mobile Suit Gundam, Giren
3643540	3649060	no Yabu, Axis no Koei comes out. Oh, that's a Korean date actually. It must have already
3649060	3656620	come out in Japan. There you have it. Your Japanese release dates. Sweet. Well, if you're
3656620	3662840	a little bit late to, say, returning your books to a library, if you happen to be in
3662840	3668900	this neck of the woods here, of the story here, you actually can play DDR to possibly
3668900	3676940	avoid late fees. Apparently, the story is of a librarian's annual patron appreciation
3676940	3683860	day, where he lets attendees to avoid overdue fines by donating non-perishables to a local
3683860	3691020	soup kitchen or playing a quick game of DDR. And the exact pay-for-play system, they didn't
3691020	3696680	really discuss that, but a 16-year-old who was apparently in the article needed a C grade
3696680	3704820	on her dance performance to erase a $14 fine from a record. So, that's pretty cool. Yeah,
3704820	3711180	I wonder how high they would go for late fees to be erased. Even though I never actually
3711180	3716860	went to a library in my life. That just proves that library late fees are stupid. Look, you
3716860	3722620	maybe ought to go volunteer to do some DDR for people's late fees. Fuck that. I don't
3722620	3726740	even know where this is. I'm not going to go there and play DDR for their late fees.
3726740	3733260	It's fucking paying me money for that. It's certainly a creative method. I'll give it
3733260	3742460	that, I guess. Also, a pretty creative game. There was a lot of people that loved Myst
3742460	3747340	Online. Unfortunately, they don't have much longer to love this game because GameTap will
3747340	3751900	be shutting down Myst Online in 60 days. They made the difficult decision earlier this week
3751900	3759020	that Myst Online Uro Live will be going down in 60 days, so that's somewhere in April when
3759020	3764220	the game will be coming down. And what's really cool is Rick Sanchez, who has actually been
3764220	3768420	on our show before. He was on, I want to say about a year and a half ago. He actually posts
3768420	3773180	on the GameTap forums and kind of had to make that very difficult post because, you know,
3773180	3778760	like any MMO, there's rabid fans. And, you know, Myst Online is no exception. It had
3778760	3783100	its share of rabid fans. And they're not happy to hear about the game going. People want
3783100	3789300	refunds and so on and so on. MystOnline.com will stay active, you know, as a tribute to
3789300	3794780	what was in the game. And, you know, in Rick's post, he said they were looking at, quote,
3794780	3799460	a wide variety of possibilities for maintaining the game. He swears up and down they're not
3799460	3802860	just a bunch of evil corporate types who do nothing but count pennies and wear Brooks
3802860	3807340	Brothers suits. So, you know, and honestly, I don't know how many of you guys have played
3807340	3812300	Myst Online. I checked it out a couple months ago for the sake of reviewing it on the show.
3812300	3817580	And what I noticed about the game is that there are real live people that play the game
3817580	3822700	in a, you know, making the story work type of capacity. For instance, if you were a new
3822700	3828300	person, you could go to these classes in Myst Online to learn about the world of Myst. And
3828300	3832700	it wasn't an automated thing. There was actually someone there. Like when I went in there,
3832700	3836140	the person said, you know, hello, Sky, are you, because that's the online name I use
3836140	3839660	as most of you know. The person said, hello, Sky, are you here for the class today? And
3839660	3842460	I was like, yes. And they're like, okay, just take a seat over there. We'll get started
3842460	3846660	soon. You know, like it's crazy. They actually have people in and I imagine that's got to
3846660	3852260	be very expensive thing to maintain. So I say kudos to GameTap for giving it a try.
3852260	3856300	And if the rest of you are pissed off, be pissed off at the fact that people didn't
3856300	3860940	play it. That's why it shut down. If your MMO doesn't have enough people playing it
3860940	3867200	to keep it, you know, running, it shuts down. In the end though, the rabid fans will find
3867200	3877180	a way to maintain it. I've had that experience before when I played Myth a long time ago
3877180	3888100	and when Bungie finally shut down the servers for Myth 2. It wasn't more than a month before
3888100	3892740	players had brought up their own servers that Bungie actually endorsed and said, hey, you
3892740	3896580	know, you're free to go ahead and play these servers now.
3896580	3902580	We'll turn the other cheek for this one. Let's see. Josie16 in chat, chat at orangeonshooter.com
3902580	3907660	says, Myst online was well thought through. Too bad to see it go. The problem with Myst
3907660	3912140	online, even though they had the class and everything, I found it very hard to just get
3912140	3916660	in and go. You know, like I think the reason why WoW, like one reason WoW is so fucking
3916660	3920180	popular is that I don't know how many of you have sit down to play it, you know, despite
3920180	3924420	how you feel about the game, but you can get up and running in World of Warcraft relatively
3924420	3928820	quickly. You know, there's kind of a learning curve as you level from levels 1 to 10. You
3928820	3931700	know, that's why people are like, oh, you can get to level 10 in an hour. That's because
3931700	3935460	level 1 to 10 is really the learning curve for noobs and it really walks you through
3935460	3940340	the game. You know, and I have the same bitch as Final Fantasy XI. I think if Final Fantasy
3940340	3944580	XI didn't have the Final Fantasy name in front of it, that was a very hard game to
3944580	3947500	just get up and running in, you know, to kind of figure out. Remember when we first bought
3947500	3950780	Final Fantasy XI, Loki, we bought it like the day it came out on the PC. It was back
3950780	3955700	when we were living together. We were so lost the first day. I didn't realize that the
3955700	3959700	world extended beyond the first like little area. I was like, when I went there and there
3959700	3964380	was like a whole like, you know, the plat, was it the Lathine Plateau or whatever. I'm
3964380	3969540	like, holy crap. And then like later on when you're playing the game, you're like, oh
3969540	3972900	wow, this world's even bigger. I'm gonna kill bunnies for the rest of my life. This
3972900	3978340	is fun. And then like you go, then you go into, what's the thing after, it's Ronfro
3978340	3982300	is the first area. Then you go into Lathine Plateau and you go into Lathine Plateau and
3982300	3986820	you try to kill a bunny there and they just murder you. You're like, I just got raped
3986820	3993340	by a bunny. Why do you hate me so much? Oh, now I remember. That's right. I'm so glad
3993340	4001860	I didn't have to deal with that. That game was fun. I miss it. But not really. Alright.
4001860	4007420	One game I'm probably not gonna miss either is Midway's brand new, this is Vegas. And
4007420	4013340	apparently if you're too, I don't know, poor to go to Vegas to be a whore or to gamble,
4013340	4019220	you can do it in this game. So that's awesome. They didn't really say what it was that you
4019220	4024500	would be doing in this. Apparently you would be able to live out your fantasies in Vegas
4024500	4032420	by fighting, gambling, driving, and partying. Strangely no mention of hookers. Well, I don't
4032420	4040100	know, in the trailer though, there was hooker-like people. But yeah, so this is Vegas coming
4040100	4047620	to Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. You know, I'm just, I'm wondering if people are going to start
4047620	4057660	doing this is spot on. This is Vegas. I'm sure it's somewhere on YTMND already. I'm
4057660	4063340	sure it's already there. I don't know. It's a weird idea for a game, but... Well, here's
4063340	4068480	something that will be coming out soon, and this is really not a surprise to anyone who
4068480	4074380	has played the game Puzzle Quest or one of its thousand ports. It's out on every freaking
4074380	4078600	system out there. But it is a great game. I mean, really, it kind of took a great idea,
4078600	4082380	which is like, you know, bejeweled, and just put a whole new spin on it that made it even
4082380	4088620	better. Puzzle Quest is just great, and Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel. It
4088620	4094740	was a press release put out this week from D3. It was mentioning the forthcoming sequel
4094740	4099460	to the game. Here's the quote from the press release. The company will also be releasing
4099460	4104660	video games based on Artiman's popular Shaun the Sheep character in 2008, alongside the
4104660	4109820	eagerly awaited follow-ups to the best-selling Ben 10 and Puzzle Quest. Now, see, I don't
4109820	4116340	know what I'm more excited about. Sequel to Puzzle Quest or Shaun the Sheep? I've never
4116340	4119660	fucking heard of it, but that sounds pretty awesome, I gotta say.
4119660	4124140	Sheep. And I don't remember Ben 10 being that popular, but okay.
4124140	4129340	Well, apparently it was popular enough for me to make a live-action movie about, even
4129340	4132380	though the only reason I know that is because I watch too much Cartoon Network.
4132380	4137180	Maybe something that's more popular in another country, I don't know. But I've never heard
4137180	4138460	of it personally, so there you go.
4138460	4141500	Who knows what 12-year-olds are watching these days, other than Hannah Montana?
4141500	4149300	Okay. I'm sure this, don't get me started on how fucking nuts it is that like, the theaters
4149300	4153700	are like packed with little girls and their moms, soon to see Hannah Montana. Like, you
4153700	4156940	know that movie is like crushing everything. And I hear people talking about it at work
4156940	4157940	all the time.
4157940	4161620	It's not a movie, it's a recording of a concert.
4161620	4162700	I know, it's crazy.
4162700	4163700	It's not a movie.
4163700	4168700	We want to talk about how the DS prints money. Dude, Miley Cyrus has money coming at her
4168700	4169700	ass, okay?
4169700	4177020	That's it. I wonder when she's going to do a cover of her dad's achy breaky heart, or
4177020	4178020	duet.
4178020	4179020	Nice.
4179020	4187460	I'm sure this is pure coincidence that I have this story, but apparently Mastiff has licensed
4187460	4194060	the rights to the Major League Eating, I didn't even know there was Major League Eating, but
4194060	4198540	apparently they're going to make a Major League Eating game. The game will play out like a
4198540	4206540	fighting game, and it will show people on screen eating. Using, you will have a mastery
4206540	4210820	of offensive defensive weapons, just like watching this show on Justin TV. You get to
4210820	4211820	watch people eat.
4211820	4221820	Hey, I am having dinner, okay? Whatever. I'm not like, oh, it's the fish! Mmm, food good!
4221820	4224060	You should do that one day on the show, though.
4224060	4225060	You really should.
4225060	4229980	So, you will have offensive and defensive weapons, including burps, belches, and mustard
4229980	4230980	gas.
4230980	4235060	This sounds like the ultimate small power-up.
4235060	4237980	This sounds like the ultimate, like, twelve-year-old boy game.
4237980	4238980	Teehee fart!
4238980	4245860	You know, like, seriously, that was horrible. And, of course, the technical mastery necessary
4245860	4251900	to avoid emptying one's stomach in doodly colored reversals of fortune. As they like
4251900	4252900	to put it.
4252900	4253900	Wow.
4253900	4254900	Yeah.
4254900	4259100	There was this, I don't think it was worth the effort to even make that eloquent.
4259100	4263380	Really, are you that desperate for licenses? Well, it is Mastiff, so, you know, I guess
4263380	4271500	so. I mean, they just came out with a Top Gun DS game, like, not too long ago. A little
4271500	4272500	late.
4272500	4278300	So, last week we had Major Wee, and this week we have Major Eating. That's nice. You'd
4278300	4283340	think it would go the other way around. That's all I have to say.
4283340	4287580	God damn, if this isn't a story that won't ever go away as, Apple's getting into gaming!
4287580	4289660	Oh my God, Apple's getting into gaming.
4289660	4294260	Hey, Newsflash. Apple's kind of already, well, A, Apple went into gaming a long time ago
4294260	4299660	and didn't do Too Hot. Pippin, hello. Apple's already, like, they're getting their big toe,
4299660	4303580	like, they're putting their big toe in the water and saying, hmm, me with. Like, they've
4303580	4307680	got some pretty awesome games on the iPod now, like Pagle on the iPod. I don't know
4307680	4311020	if I've officially reviewed it on the show or whatever, but Pagle on the iPod's pretty
4311020	4314240	awesome. Like, that's the system that game was made for, you know. That's a pretty awesome
4314240	4319180	game on the iPod. And, Faze, you know, basically Guitar Hero for your iPod, you know, of sorts.
4319180	4320540	Guitar Hero? What are you talking about?
4320540	4321540	Well, because, you know, you have to.
4321540	4324020	It's not Guitar Hero, it's Amplitude.
4324020	4327660	Okay, whatever, it's Amplitude. But, you know, sadly, more people probably know what I'm
4327660	4329780	talking about when I talk about Guitar Hero. So.
4329780	4332500	When we need to educate them.
4332500	4336300	Hitstun in chess is apparently the iPod version of Pagle is great. It really is. I think Pagle's
4336300	4340100	probably the best game you can get on the iPod right now, honestly. You know, and I
4340100	4344140	love Sonic the Hedgehog and all that stuff, too, but Pagle, just because of the nature
4344140	4349140	of, you know, how you rotate the gun to fire down the, it's like, imagine if Plinko was
4349140	4354460	a game. That's basically what Pagle is. And you can rotate the little gun with the dial.
4354460	4357020	It works perfectly. So.
4357020	4361620	We need a, like, online version of Price is Right the game. That would be awesome.
4361620	4363620	That would be kind of rad. Anyhow.
4363620	4364940	Use the touch wheel to spin the big wheel.
4364940	4370180	Well, hold on. We got to rail. We went from Apple to talking about Price is Right. A trademark
4370180	4375580	apparently was filed on February 5th and now has the room rails going again because Apple
4375580	4382580	has updated its trademark to now include toys, games, and playthings, namely handheld units
4383060	4387460	for playing electronic games, handheld units for playing video games, stand-alone video
4387460	4391020	game machines, electronic games other than those adapted for use of television receivers
4391020	4396500	only, LCD game machines, electronic educational game machines, toys, namely battery-powered
4396500	4398940	computer games.
4398940	4404140	I seem to recall earlier this year I made a prediction on the show, or I should say
4404140	4407980	late last year, that somebody was going to step up and challenge Nintendo's dominance
4407980	4411260	in the handheld market and it wasn't going to be Sony or Nintendo. Of course at the time
4411260	4415580	I think I said it wasn't going to be Apple either, but two out of three ain't bad. This
4415580	4417620	could be. It could be.
4417620	4422060	This is going to be such an abortion of a game system. It's not even funny. I mean,
4422060	4426020	seriously, this is from the guys that thought, you know what, having a CD-ROM drive in our
4426020	4431420	laptop, that would be stupid. What are we thinking? I mean, this is going to be a game
4431420	4435100	system that's not going to have a cartridge slot or anywhere to put the games in. You're
4435100	4441700	going to have to download the Wi-Fi from your computer or some shit. Lame! They don't understand.
4441700	4445060	They're just going to make it pink and pretty and stupid idiots will buy it.
4445060	4447420	Brace yourself. Brace yourself.
4447420	4448660	Withholding justice.
4448660	4452300	I am agreeing with Loki. Me of all people.
4452300	4455420	And you are an Apple fanboy of the highest caliber.
4455420	4460460	I do not think that Apple, I think they got lucky with the iPhone jumping into a completely
4460460	4466760	new market, but they, I think if they try to get into gaming, they're going to fail.
4466760	4472900	I just don't, style and design is not going to win when it's the software that sells the
4472900	4472900	games.
4472900	4476540	And I'm not necessarily talking about the MacBook Air and stuff like that, just that.
4476540	4484240	I'm just saying they choose to go aesthetics over functionality for a lot of stuff. And
4484240	4488260	I don't know. I mean, that works for some people, I guess, but the problem is I don't
4488260	4492300	think it's going to work for a console system or it's going to work for a handheld system
4492300	4497260	because they're going to want to change it constantly. I mean, you know, the PlayStation
4497260	4503460	3 does the same damn thing, but still, you can't. It's just going to get confusing and
4503460	4508060	they're going to want to do a ton of different things. It's going to be like the PSP, but
4508060	4509900	they're going to change it a lot more.
4509900	4514560	And it's not like you can release a new system like you can release a new version of an iPod
4514560	4520580	and it'll still have the same technology and functionality. Because they'll end up releasing
4520580	4524940	something new six months later and it won't be able to be backwards compatible with the
4524940	4525580	previous games.
4525580	4530340	And, you know, go ahead and try to take on Nintendo. I mean, sure, they need someone
4530340	4535220	to do it, but, you know, you had other people try, too, like Gizmondo. They thought that
4535220	4537580	they could take on Nintendo and that failed.
4537580	4541660	This is all I'm going to say, is that I will withhold judgment until it comes out, like,
4541660	4545020	you know, a good critic will. You know, you can't really judge it, tell the final things
4545020	4550020	out. But I wouldn't be surprised if you see the iPod go a little further into gaming.
4550020	4553420	Like, I could totally see them putting out, like, a controller or something that plugs
4553420	4554420	into the iPod.
4554420	4556180	That makes more sense, I don't think.
4556180	4559900	But I think that's as far as it's going to go. I don't see them, like, releasing a whole
4559900	4564980	new thing. I see it as some type of extension or enhancement for an iPod. That's it.
4564980	4569460	Yeah, and, I mean, the best stuff, the best games that will ever come out for an iPod
4569460	4575780	will probably be made by random people, not by Apple, that use, like, the iPod Touch's
4575780	4577100	touchscreen functionality.
4577100	4582180	Which, apparently, PopCap might be it. Which makes sense, because the type of games that
4582180	4586300	PopCap puts out is perfect for the iPod audience, right? Am I right?
4586300	4587300	Yeah, casual stuff.
4587300	4588780	Yeah. So there you have it.
4588780	4590660	Puzzle Pirates on an iPhone, hmm.
4590660	4595260	All right. Anyhow, part A is about over and we're going to be getting into part B tonight,
4595260	4598460	which, by the way, if I haven't mentioned yet, in part B tonight, I've mentioned this
4598460	4601300	a lot, actually. We're going to be playing a brand new game we've never played before
4601300	4607220	here on the show. Everybody in chat can play and possibly win tonight. It's going to be
4607220	4612260	amazing. But before we get to that in part B, we have to do one more segment here in
4612260	4617580	part A. And for that, we have to bring somebody special on the line.
4617580	4619180	Oh, caller, are you there on the line?
4619180	4620180	Yo.
4620180	4624140	Hey, Jamie, how are you feeling?
4624140	4627500	I'm feeling, um, stuff that I can't say on the air.
4627500	4631860	I see. So you're just kind of feeling a little, uh, you know, a little sick this week, basically?
4631860	4635580	It's viral.
4635580	4640340	Ugh. That's never any fun. Well, sorry to hear that you're sick, but you'll be back
4640340	4641340	next week, right?
4641340	4645780	Yes, I will. I didn't want to, I just didn't want to get you guys sick. I don't care about
4645780	4646780	my co-workers so much.
4646780	4647780	Yeah.
4647780	4651540	I'm just kidding. Because I got it from my co-workers, so.
4651540	4656420	Oh, snap. So you're going to go back and get some more of them sick then, right?
4656420	4659060	No, I figured if they weren't going to get sick, they would have already gotten sick
4659060	4660060	from it.
4660060	4663820	Alright. Well, anyway, Jamie, you know, we just couldn't do this segment without you.
4663820	4667660	We're at the end of part A, as you may know from listening or what have you. We've got
4667660	4670340	to do the Classic Game of the Week, so let's get in the music.
4670340	4680140	And Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the listeners to celebrate this
4680140	4681140	week?
4681140	4688100	The Classic Game of the Week is one of my personal favorites. It's Ys III, where it's
4688100	4695100	from Ys, which is, you know, being Ys III, it is the third in the series. So this one's
4695100	4699580	actually different from the other two. I don't know if anyone else was a big fan of it. If
4699580	4705340	I'm right, this was out on MSX. It was, I got used to the Super Nintendo version, but
4705340	4713500	it was also out on PC Engine. In fact, I've actually got the Duo version of it somewhere.
4713500	4717140	But the special thing about this one is that it's sort of a departure in gameplay from
4717140	4718140	the previous ones.
4718140	4719140	Very cool.
4719140	4720140	How?
4720140	4721140	Sorry, go ahead.
4721140	4730620	Well, with this one is that the previous ones were the whole top-down, you know, old-school
4730620	4741420	Zelda-style overhead view. And this one had primarily side-scrolling. You'd have to actually
4741420	4746580	mash a button to swing the sword and attack, and you also had rings that you could equip
4746580	4752220	for different special effects. So instead of having, like, magic, you would use your
4752220	4757940	ring power. And it was a pretty cool game. It was very, I thought, unique for the time
4757940	4763580	and the type of RPG that it was. But it also had, like, some really fantastic music. I
4763580	4766940	love this game a whole lot.
4766940	4775980	Let's take a listen to the music real quick. Now, one thing I should say about this game,
4775980	4780900	a very common mispronunciation of the title, right, because it looks like Y's, because
4780900	4781980	it's just the letter Y.
4781980	4782980	It's Y's.
4782980	4784980	Yeah, it's Y's. So.
4784980	4791980	Yeah. In fact, if you actually look at the name, the Japanese title romanized, it says
4791980	4792980	Isu.
4792980	4793980	So.
4793980	4794980	Very cool.
4794980	4795980	Does that help?
4795980	4798700	Now, the most recent Y's game, if I'm not mistaken, because I think we brought it up
4798700	4802260	on a previous edition of the show, they ported, or I guess they made a new version of this
4802260	4803260	game for the PSP, right?
4803260	4812660	There's, if I'm right, I think it was Y's V, technically, the arc of Mappus, Mappus
4812660	4820140	3. And then there was a Windows one that was like a remake of Y's V, which was the arc
4820140	4821140	of Spelcona.
4821140	4822140	Wow.
4822140	4827020	It was more like an expansion of Y's V.
4827020	4830980	I gotcha. So basically, you know, this game is so classic that it still continues to live
4830980	4831980	on today in sequels.
4831980	4837580	Pretty much. I mean, and anyone who's got, you know, Super Nintendo, if you can find
4837580	4841220	it and should be able to find it really cheap still, I recommend taking it up. It's a fun
4841220	4842220	game.
4842220	4846260	All right. Maybe someday a virtual console? Who knows?
4846260	4850300	I would hope so, but we'd probably get Ys I and II before we got Ys III.
4850300	4852340	I guess that's true. All right.
4852340	4853340	Yeah.
4853340	4858060	Well, there you have it, boys and girls, your classic game of the week, Wanderers from Ys,
4858060	4861940	the third game in the series. The music you were hearing was from the MSX version, but
4861940	4866660	you can find it also on Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx, if I'm not mistaken?
4866660	4867660	Yep.
4867660	4868660	Very cool.
4868660	4869660	Yep, it was a Turbo CD.
4869660	4872900	Well, Jamie, we look forward to having you back in the house next week. Rest up and feel
4872900	4874700	better and say hi to Dan for us.
4874700	4877780	Oh, well, he's in there playing Smash Brothers.
4877780	4881420	All right. Oh, you guys have the new Smash Brothers, right?
4881420	4886820	Yeah. Well, we don't have it. A friend of ours brought it over and so they've been going
4886820	4894340	through the whole adventure mode in there with the amazingly compatible team of Samus
4894340	4895340	and Pikachu.
4895340	4896340	Who would have thought?
4896340	4905740	What was it? Team Bishonen. They have the Bishonen Assault Squad, which is Pit and Link.
4905740	4907140	Wow. That sounds kind of fun.
4907140	4909100	And then the Fire Emblem team.
4909100	4912260	So do you approve of Super Smash Brothers Brawl after seeing it last week in studio
4912260	4915460	and experiencing it at your own house this week?
4915460	4916460	I quite approve.
4916460	4919620	All right. Very nice. There you have it. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, we're going to go
4919620	4923820	ahead and take our break and a brand new game for our listeners in Part B tonight. I'm sorry
4923820	4926540	you don't get to hear it, but we'll fill you in afterwards, okay?
4926540	4929540	Oh, I see how it is. You wait until I'm out and then you do the new stuff.
4929540	4934420	Well, because we have to fill time because you're not here to give us your viewpoint
4934420	4937260	and interrupt Loki when he's talking. Just kidding.
4937260	4939260	I'm just going to cry.
4939260	4943780	Aw, Dark Soccer, we love you. You should play in the game tonight. It would be funny if
4943780	4944780	you win.
4944780	4946940	I can't ever get the show to pull up on my laptop.
4946940	4951380	Aw, that's a bummer. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, take care. We'll see you next week,
4951380	4952380	okay?
4952380	4953380	Okay. Bye.
4953380	4954380	All right. Bye-bye.
4954380	4955380	Auf Wiedersehen.
4955380	4961100	All right. That's going to do it for this Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio. We're
4961100	4965820	going to take a quick break, though, and we'll be back with plenty more. However, here's
4965820	4970660	the deal. I got to close all my chat windows here. We're going to be asking a qualifying
4970660	4977460	question to qualify for tonight's game in Part B. Basically, one contestant will be
4977460	4981380	coming in via the Skype line. So I'm going to give you a question, very similar type
4981380	4983500	of question you might hear in tonight's game.
4983500	4987380	And if you think you know the answer, you're going to send me the answer in a private message
4987380	4991500	in the chat room. If you don't know how to send me a private message, ask somebody. And
4991500	4995860	you are going to send me your phone number. And by sending me your phone number, that
4995860	4999860	is consent that you approve of us calling you, please make sure you are by your phone
4999860	5003940	in the next hour or so, and that we don't get any surprises of Mommy or Daddy picking
5003940	5008820	it up. So don't submit an answer to this if you do not have control over your own phone.
5008820	5011660	So here it is. This is the qualifier question. You're going to send me the correct answer
5011660	5017140	to this question, and then you are going to send me your phone number if you want to play,
5017140	5021220	and we'll pick somebody randomly out of those that submit the correct phone number. So here
5021220	5025100	it is. And I'm putting this in the podcast because I felt those listening in the podcast
5025100	5032100	might want to play along. Here is the qualifying question. What game is this music from?
5032100	5039100	I wouldn't yell it out in chat or you are giving it away for everybody. Here are the
5041620	5045720	correct answers. I'm sorry, one of these is the correct answer. Here are the answers you
5045720	5052720	have to choose from. A. Nightmare on Elm Street. B. Halloween. C. Friday the 13th.
5052720	5059720	Again, if you know the answer, A. Nightmare on Elm Street. B. Halloween. C. Friday the
5064640	5069160	13th. Send me a private message in chat with the correct answer and your telephone number.
5069160	5073100	If you're listening on the podcast only and not live on Sunday night, sorry, but the game
5073100	5076480	has already ended and you're not eligible. We're taping live here on Sunday night, February
5076480	5080180	the 10th of 2008, at OrangeLaundry.com. We'll find out who's going to be playing the game
5080180	5084940	with us after tonight's break. So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange
5084940	5086400	Lounge Radio.
5086400	5090800	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5090800	5095600	a week. Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge
5095600	5102600	Radio.
