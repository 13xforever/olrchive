14031	25437	Tonight, February 10th, 2008, Xbox HD DVD gets a price cut, old favorites are revealed for Street Fighter 4, and is an Oscar-nominated movie soon becoming a video game?
31912	33594	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33654	36336	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36376	43502	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43602	45044	My name is Rob Roberts.
45484	50188	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
50548	52290	She is unfortunately out with sickness.
52810	55853	She's been having, you know, just...
56735	59637	Subway was out of white bread, I had wheat, and wheat tastes like cardboard.
86852	87652	It's not that bad.
87792	88473	Bread is bread.
90094	91214	It's not even really wheat bread.
91234	94036	It's like they took white bread and kind of dyed it brown.
95136	96016	Well, it is Subway.
96057	98218	I wouldn't expect huge differences.
99198	101319	Did your cat scratch you or something?
101359	102760	I see big old claw marks.
102840	103640	Yes, that's my cat.
103860	104541	I'm sorry you hear that.
104721	109723	Well, that's because when she gets up in her tube sometimes, she starts to freak out.
110183	113265	But she's playing and stuff, so what do I try to do?
113305	115406	I try poking at her all the time.
116056	120557	I tried petting her on her head, but then she just grabs her claws and she kind of catches me sometimes.
121238	121778	And she did.
122458	125019	It looks a lot more painful than it actually was.
125499	128500	All right, well, also joining us tonight, you might have heard his voice there just a minute ago.
128960	133021	It's Puppy, also known as Black Lab, or Ryan, depending on whatever we want to call him.
133041	133681	How are you, Puppy?
134362	135962	I am tired.
137162	142184	I had some insomnia this week and kind of capped it off with,
142694	145476	Getting woken up at 2.30 in the morning last night by gunfire.
145937	146517	Oh, fun!
147738	148839	Sorry to hear about the gunfire.
148899	150400	Were your neighbors, like, fighting or something?
150480	151121	Or what's the deal?
151161	151461	I don't know.
151481	153062	It was probably something in the mall parking lot.
153342	153622	Oh, okay.
153923	154243	I gotcha.
155188	155648	Interesting.
156529	160590	You know, it's been like just a crazy week in everybody's neighborhood.
160610	166513	There was gunfire in your neighborhood, and the house across the street from the studio here burned down a couple days ago.
168074	172676	On the outside, it makes Rob's house much easier to find to get here.
172696	175077	Well, it's unfortunate for those that affected.
175137	179119	Actually, I didn't even notice it because that house was so run down to begin with.
179179	180319	It's like, really?
180559	181219	It burned down?
181900	182460	Couldn't tell.
183120	183400	All right.
183420	184521	Well, anyhow, let's...
185387	187309	Let's not talk about neighborhood drama.
187349	188950	Let's talk about our gaming week.
188970	192193	So we'll start it off with how was your gaming week and we'll go ahead and start off with Loki tonight.
192233	192853	How was your gaming week?
193133	195515	First off, I'd like to say I have brought back the Ever360.
195656	197717	It is back to life again.
198038	198818	Hooray.
199179	200560	The trick was I needed more heat.
201661	207726	I didn't stop until I got to about 850 degrees to 1,000 degrees and sure enough, that worked.
208266	209907	So now I have six working 360s.
209948	210248	Hooray.
211449	212370	You're just loaded, aren't you?
212670	212870	Yeah.
214048	242690	and then let's see I played this week more Smash Brothers Brawl and that's pretty awesome I actually got to dive in a little bit to the subspace emissary mode and it's pretty fun they have some really crazy looking enemies in the game just some weird stuff but it's pretty cool and then I've unlocked Rob the Robot we went through the challenge but I actually took off work half a day to go visit one of my customers who really wanted to play the game so
243342	244762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
274441	274762	I don't know.
275222	275783	It's pretty cool.
276804	284392	I think, though, if I play through the entire Subspace Emissary stuff and then finish all the other crap, I might get bored with the game a little bit.
284692	285933	So I actually need to play some people.
287515	292340	Other than Smash Bros., I also played Silent Hill Origins, actually, on the PSP.
292380	293481	I went back to try that again.
294279	295579	and pretty cool.
296359	302941	Actually, I'm looking forward to it coming out on PlayStation 2 because I just don't like being tethered to my TV with a little cable.
303021	308022	So it might be a little bit better if I have a little bit more room to play.
308982	311983	And then I also played a lot of Burnout Paradise.
313063	318964	Still trying to knock people off of the leaderboards for the Showtime rankings.
319423	324264	I love how listeners will add us on Xbox Live because they enjoy the show and so on.
324284	327625	They just kind of want to play a game with us occasionally or what have you.
327885	333267	Whereas Loki makes it his mission to dominate our listeners in whatever game he's playing.
333327	336027	He's like, oh no, I can't get beat by no listener.
336928	338528	I've got to control the burnout map.
339789	343329	Well, right now I have about 26 of the roads, so I still have a ways to go.
344710	344870	But...
346138	351420	Let's see, other than that, played a little bit more DotStream on the Game Boy Advance.
352420	352860	Pretty fun.
353560	356581	And I think that's pretty much it.
356941	358402	Oh, tried playing Crysis again.
358682	365404	I actually uninstalled Crysis, reinstalled Crysis, tried to get that last level to fucking work again, and sure enough, it does not work.
365844	370285	Still, I can't pass that last level in the game because it glitches out, and it stops working.
371026	374847	So, I am sick of Crysis, although I did load up the...
375902	380084	The physics, a little custom map that someone made to play the physics of the game.
381665	384867	They actually released a new version of the map last week.
386187	387188	And that was fun.
387648	391890	Because you can slingshot barrels in the people and stuff and catapult things.
393251	393791	Gotta love that.
394311	397973	But other than that though, I fucking hate the last level of Crysis.
398273	399614	Did they not test it at all?
399634	401615	I mean, it's just really broken.
402264	416618	which is bad because the rest of the game is pretty cool but it's just that last level right as you're about to finish the game and kind of get the payoff from playing through the entire thing oh no, you can't do that that would be too easy so I don't know
417574	419135	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
447168	448349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
469947	470528	Halo 3 Halo 3
498817	505804	Even with the updates that Halo 3 finally added, and are going to add in the near future, I still will be playing Call of Duty 4 instead.
505864	507865	That's a pretty bold statement, that it's better than Halo 3.
508746	516673	I actually found it much more enjoyable than Halo, just because there's a lot more reality to it.
517254	523720	As opposed to, oh, armored space guys punching each other in a grossly malformed way.
525049	530170	And then other than Call of Duty 4, I sadly have fallen back into my Puzzle Pirate habit.
531411	531971	Sucker.
532431	533131	Yeah.
533431	534552	How has Puzzle Pirates changed?
534572	536712	Because you were last addicted to the game, what, about two years ago?
537792	542534	Yeah, well, I stopped playing it about a year ago because I didn't have the time to anymore.
543294	546415	And then apparently a lot of stuff changed in that year.
546475	554197	They brought a bunch of new puzzle games in and added some new player versus environment stuff.
555645	562667	and it's getting popular and I just found out, they just made an announcement that they're selling game cards at Target now.
563307	564968	So they must be making it big or something.
564988	565108	Nice.
565668	569789	Now I'm noticing with the facial hair that you're starting to sprout here, you're starting to look like a pirate a little bit.
570669	572790	This was much longer earlier this week.
573110	573350	I see.
573850	577571	But yes, I could just throw on an eye patch for a party.
577591	579692	It's great radio too to talk about puppies' look.
580663	583684	He's got a little facial growth that makes him look like a pirate.
583704	586345	I don't know if they can see it on Justin TV because you're blonde.
586925	588706	I could probably stand right in front of the camera and they wouldn't see it.
588726	590306	Why don't you go give them a nice close-up when you're done?
590466	592467	Give a nice close-up of your mug there.
592487	595048	Give a nice little mug shot there.
596488	597809	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
599749	602870	Rez, various board games.
603230	604271	Isn't Rez incredible?
604611	605171	Of course it is.
605351	608032	I really wish that I had a high-def TV to play it on.
608392	608492	Oh.
609480	610661	I do, and it's sexy.
611161	613603	I hate to rub it in, but yeah, you really do want one.
613623	615725	You need to have surround sound, too, when you're playing it.
615745	616245	That's true.
616345	619888	I seriously almost dug up my old surround sound system that's kind of crappy.
619928	620968	It's actually hooked up here in the garage.
621289	625772	I almost brought that into the house just to play Res HD with, but I'm going to get a new sound system when I get my tax refund.
626215	632420	Yeah, I thought about getting a better TV with my tax refund, but I've got other stuff that I need to pay for first.
632581	632921	Gotcha.
633681	635623	All right, now go supermodel for the camera.
635643	636544	I'll talk about my gaming week.
637265	643350	First, I want to mention in chat room, because this didn't come up earlier, TigerClaw says, Sky, I just realized OLR is competing against the Grammys.
644250	644791	Who cares?
645492	646893	Seriously, I mean, the Grammys...
648690	649031	I don't know.
649111	650793	I find them to be incredibly irrelevant.
651894	655839	Did you see that article on Dig earlier this week about the biggest Grammy snubs of all time?
656300	657261	It's pretty interesting.
657321	664469	It shows how there's all these big name artists that always get snubbed by the Grammys when there's people that were more deserving.
664509	665030	Well, whatever.
665390	665751	Forget it.
666673	668074	And I brought up tax refunds earlier.
668114	675800	I'm curious, in our chat room, those that are getting tax refunds, if there's anything in gaming that you're contemplating spending your tax refund on.
676181	678382	So let us know in our chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com.
678423	679423	I'll read those in just a little bit.
679443	680404	But first, my gaming week.
681125	684007	Mostly spent, besides Poker Smash, playing a couple different games.
684407	685949	World of Warcraft, of course.
686049	689311	I know I talk about that a lot here on the program, but it has been a lot of my gaming week recently.
689671	691293	And it really went to the next level this week.
691333	695236	I don't know how many hardcore WoW addicts we have that listen to the game, but tonight...
695751	696151	and DarkSakura.com.
714022	714883	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
729861	732963	And we only have 10 people in our guild that can even do it.
733363	736044	So I notice it's tough to really arrange the times to go in there.
736224	737385	But we did an awesome job.
737425	743508	For anybody that does know WoW, we killed Attuneman, we killed Morose, and we killed Maiden today.
743828	747990	So in our first weekend, we killed three of the bosses in Karazhan, which is pretty awesome.
748010	752992	And apparently, I'm sure there's lots of people out there who go, Whoa, my guild killed four bosses, so fuck you.
753072	754573	My guild killed it all in one night.
754613	758415	For us, when we were mostly casual players, it was pretty awesome.
758875	760275	So, good times.
760735	770097	Just wait until you try to move on to 25-man content and you've got three different groups going to Karazhan at once and they're like, oh, we don't want to split up, we don't want to go all together and then you'll end up breaking apart.
770157	770898	Oh, no.
770978	771938	Drama, drama, drama.
771978	772818	No, we don't want drama.
772858	783820	We're all, most of us actually live here in the area and our guild was formed mostly from real-life people like my boyfriend is in the guild and like Irene is in the guild but she's not level 70 yet.
784080	787761	Some of the other people you've heard on this show are in the guild and yeah, good times.
788467	789348	So we're finally doing that stuff.
789388	789688	Let's see.
790288	794391	Looking at chat room, seeing what folks are saying they're going to spend their tax refunds on here.
796873	799114	Let's see.
799214	802356	SSJ100Matt says, my tax rebate is going towards an HD camera.
803897	809341	GS191 says, I'll probably spend my welfare, I mean stimulus package check on a new PC.
809721	810202	That's right.
810462	811963	After that thing was passed.
812043	818327	I'm already spending that on a new computer because I need something at home that can run AutoCAD.
818686	818946	Nice.
819347	819607	All right.
819968	822271	Oh, DMN's going to use his refund to come visit the show.
822371	823472	He's coming back to Sacramento.
823793	824133	Scary.
824193	824634	Oh, boy.
824654	828018	We'll use that refund to pass it to the children.
828619	828879	All right.
828939	829360	No, just kidding.
831081	832082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
850143	850603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
870758	872260	It's not that they just have to pay rent.
872320	875063	They can choose to battle your creature with one from their hand.
875343	878927	And then there's all these enhancements cards that'll increase your strength, your defense.
879267	881890	So it's kind of a game where you really have to think before you play.
882751	884172	And it's a lot of fun.
884192	885954	I think it's a very unique concept.
886254	888557	It's kind of interesting to see it on the Xbox 360.
888877	893482	For me, they didn't really change a lot from the first game, and the animations are not really...
894202	902486	Anything to jump and scream about in this new age of gaming or whatever you want to call it with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
902646	906348	You look at the Eye of Judgment and there's very intricate battles that happen.
906628	911030	For all the shit we give that game on this show, the battles look kind of cool when the cards do battle.
911370	918533	Here in Cold Sept, it's like if a monster attacks with the claws, you see big claw marks go across the card.
918613	919894	So it's basically like Pokemon.
920194	921755	Just in high definition.
921775	924155	Well, like, literally the cards do battle.
924435	925476	It's kind of amusing.
925796	928077	And there's incredible English in the game.
928117	932078	I think, like, one of the lines is something like, I had to escape the poverty or something.
932118	936339	I don't remember, like, very literal translations in some of the cutscenes.
936439	937840	But it's cool.
938240	943502	I mean, for me, I think this game is mostly a second chance for people who missed it on the PlayStation 2.
943962	946002	Because it's not a full-price Xbox game.
946022	946803	It's like that middle tier.
946843	946943	It's $39.99.
948263	951664	So it's not quite as much as you pay for a brand new Xbox 360 game.
951964	952724	It's a pretty good deal.
953645	955985	I actually didn't own Cold Sept on PlayStation 2.
956265	958026	One of my friends a couple years ago did.
958066	959466	That's how I got exposed to it the first time.
959486	961547	We spent a lot of nights just playing Cold Sept.
961807	968349	And just like in Magic, as you go through and battle monsters, you get to keep some of their cards and build them into your deck.
968789	970010	So it's a pretty intricate game.
970050	973551	And of course, the Xbox One also has the new Xbox Live mode.
974151	974271	So...
974813	982338	Yes, and apparently, uh, poor old Sheevum finally got his Xbox 360 and got, that's one of the games he's been playing all the time now.
983959	984900	After he got Rez, of course.
985140	991384	Looking at Portal Combat in our chatroom says, Cold Sept is the only game you can play while reading Entertainment Weekly.
992004	993465	I don't think the game's that boring.
993505	995987	I mean, it's not a fast-paced game.
996087	997428	You read Entertainment Weekly.
998048	998389	I know.
999009	999730	What the hell's wrong with you?
999750	1000530	You read Entertainment Weekly?
1000550	1000930	No, I'm kidding.
1001411	1001691	Alright.
1001711	1001851	Alright.
1003688	1004728	That's it for my gaming week.
1004748	1006350	Anything else anyone wants to share with their gaming week?
1008951	1011133	There's people out there that actually paint cats.
1011774	1013955	What does that have to do with games?
1014956	1015656	That's creepy.
1016337	1017938	What do you do during this program?
1018759	1021901	Do we pay you to surf the internet?
1021921	1022201	Yes.
1023462	1026745	Tonight's housekeeping, obviously, there's no Jamie here tonight, sadness.
1026765	1030327	We're going to try to give her a call a little later in the show so she can participate in one of her regular segments.
1030848	1032269	But the good news is, tonight...
1033234	1035754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1062651	1090571	that's the cool thing about it so I'm really looking forward to it it'll be coming up in part B so stick around and make sure you're in our chat room other than that just the usual plugs for us on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio our live journal at Orange Lounge we have a Facebook community called the OL Army so search us out there help us spread the word about independent radio and independent podcasting and that's it now Loki do you think you can take some time away from Painted Cats to read us some news stories I think I can
1093251	1099994	So we've had this for a while now, the Xbox 360 arcade model, the one replacing the core.
1100534	1103316	Well, now Japan's going to get a chance to have it as well.
1103376	1105837	They're going to get theirs March 6th.
1106597	1115581	And, of course, the arcade system is the one that features no hard drive, but it has a memory unit, as well as five Xbox Live Arcade games.
1117002	1117982	It's going to actually cost 27,800 yen.
1123150	1126052	which is about $20 less than we'd pay for it in the United States.
1126973	1131936	And hopefully that will help drive more Xbox 360 sales because right now they're hurting.
1132256	1133977	But this is the one that doesn't have a hard drive, right?
1134657	1135678	No, it doesn't have a hard drive.
1135718	1139920	And I would think all the games that people are interested in playing in Japan probably require that hard drive.
1140080	1141221	Probably.
1141641	1143382	Well, I guess Blue Dragon doesn't require a hard drive.
1143563	1145324	It's just for game saves and stuff.
1145344	1146124	Lost Odyssey...
1148590	1150071	I'm trying to think of the more Japanese-centered game.
1150111	1152372	Well, I don't think Lost Odyssey requires a hard drive.
1152392	1153432	I guess not, or Devil May Cry.
1153452	1154353	I guess none of those games do.
1154793	1156454	No, that's just PlayStation 3.
1156714	1158014	They require the hard drive for that.
1159635	1160316	I guess that's true.
1160336	1172941	I keep thinking Final Fantasy XI as well, which was really probably the first Japan-centric game that I can think of, anyway, to come out on the Xbox 360 on both shores, even though it was an already existing game, so it wasn't that hard to get out here, I'm sure.
1173382	1176623	They've tried all sorts of bundles in Japan, and so far it hasn't really helped.
1176723	1178344	I mean, they've only sold, like, what,
1179079	1180420	Oh, hey, look, I want to play a game.
1180820	1183482	Oh, wait, I can't save it unless I buy a card.
1212226	1217089	RossDLUT in chat says, if a series of top-notch Japanese games don't do it, this won't.
1217989	1223533	I guess that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff coming out that's kind of, you would think, appeals.
1223973	1226174	You really have to generalize to say a lot of this, too.
1226194	1228996	It really appeals to the Japanese audience, you know, like Lost Odyssey.
1229336	1230997	But I hear that game didn't do so well over there.
1231558	1234820	It didn't get very good reviews over there, but, you know, I don't know if,
1236591	1246176	When I was at GameStop getting Cold Sept, the guy who was actually thinking of buying Cold Sept, actually he was holding it up when I walked up to the counter reading the back of the box, and I told him that was the game I wanted.
1246456	1249278	But he told me he was excited about Lost Odyssey as well.
1249438	1254520	I am excited about Lost Odyssey, although I have low expectations for it.
1254680	1258062	I only see it as probably going to be slightly better than Enchanted Arms.
1259703	1259843	Hmm.
1261351	1262011	Well, we will see.
1291631	1293192	And I know a lot of people are really into this game.
1293212	1294672	Black is also coming out for the Xbox Originals.
1294692	1296012	Black for Black History Month.
1297653	1298393	I don't know about that.
1299213	1301434	I'm just, I'm trying to find, you know.
1301854	1303435	You're trying to be funny and failing miserably.
1303495	1304575	I'm not trying to be funny.
1304595	1307196	I, that was a little, I don't know.
1307236	1309777	Wouldn't that be weird if they did try to tie it in that way?
1310417	1313058	Would that be more insulting to the game or to Black History?
1313538	1314138	Black History.
1314218	1315679	Are you saying the game was not that great?
1316319	1319100	It was good, but it's not, it has nothing to do with Black History Month.
1319120	1319880	All right.
1320685	1328209	I don't know, I'm just being your normal crazy self.
1329189	1331170	Always controversial, Loki.
1332111	1335873	So we're getting some download content for Mass Effect coming March 10th.
1336433	1340715	It's a brand new set of missions called Bring Down the Sky.
1341615	1345797	It has actually a brand new race that they're introducing as well in there.
1346698	1348899	And I guess they're calling it the
1349485	1352786	Batarians, Batarians, Batarians, whatever.
1353246	1354267	They look like an ant.
1355347	1356267	I mean, sort of.
1356667	1361769	They've got like a bunch of eyes and a weird little bat nose.
1361869	1364970	Actually, they look like a quasi-bat-ant thing.
1365010	1367211	I don't know, whatever.
1368311	1376074	So, you'll be able to, you know, go to the colony and actually be able to save them and stuff.
1376294	1379075	Yeah, gigantic space bats, I guess that's what they're saying.
1380468	1383410	It's only going to be 400 Microsoft points or $5, so that's not bad.
1383950	1386011	And it's going to add about 90 minutes to the game.
1386411	1390733	And also, there's going to be 50 achievement points you can earn from it as well.
1391854	1405560	One thing, though, I remember reading about this, though, is it's midway through the game, so if you have a save that's kind of towards the end of the game, you might already have passed the ability to play this, so you have to start a new game, which kind of blows, but
1406172	1410113	But if you had just one save file to begin with, you're already failing at RPG.
1412334	1414274	RossDLUT in our chat room makes a good comment.
1414295	1419696	He says he will wait for the special edition of the game with all the download content included since we all know it's coming.
1421157	1421957	But for how long?
1422577	1425658	We don't know how much DLC is coming for Mass Effect.
1425978	1428619	In other words, it could be two years until that edition is released, right?
1428639	1431560	It'll probably be a year because that's what they've done with some of the other ones.
1431880	1435361	Although I haven't really noticed Microsoft Games doing that where they come out with content.
1435811	1439354	Because you didn't see Perfect Dark come out with another Perfect Dark Zero or something like that.
1439374	1440135	But there have been others.
1440175	1441656	I mean, there was Oblivion, Marvel.
1441736	1442637	You know, there's a few.
1443738	1447361	Well, see, Marvel and Call of Duty, that's all Activision.
1447381	1449723	I mean, so they tend to do that.
1450183	1451584	But Microsoft does not.
1451724	1454847	So, I don't know.
1454887	1456408	Well, would that be Bioware's decision?
1457209	1458470	Yeah, it would be their decision.
1459110	1461532	I would just say buy it.
1461633	1461933	I mean...
1463895	1467539	If you're really desperate for download content, otherwise, save that $5 for a new game.
1467559	1469420	That's what I'm saying.
1470261	1472143	Put that $5 down towards Resident Evil.
1472163	1472383	Exactly.
1472403	1477628	Do you want to spend $5 on 90 minutes of entertainment, or do you want to spend $5 on an Xbox Live arcade game?
1477928	1488197	That could end up being a lot more fun, or at least, I don't know, not many Xbox Live arcade games that are 400 Microsoft points, but still, it'd be a lot more fun than 90 minutes.
1489418	1490239	I'd spend it on food.
1491274	1491895	XBOX 360 HD DVD Player
1503058	1507280	For you math whizzes, that means the HD DVD player is now costing $130.
1509080	1514142	So the HD DVD player has been dropped to $130 in the US and Canada.
1515102	1518304	Actually, it was even cheaper if you looked on Amazon a couple days ago.
1518484	1524606	Amazon was running an $80 deal for a little while, probably trying to clean out their inventory in recent HD DVD...
1525206	1525606	and DarkSakura.com.
1552018	1557683	I own an HD DVD player, I have for quite a while, and I kind of think it's over, and I'm kind of sad.
1558123	1559444	I think I bought the wrong one this time.
1560525	1562727	I wanted one just for Matrix, but I'll wait.
1563707	1570233	Well, if inevitably Blu-ray wins in a year or so, and I don't mean these preemptive Blu-ray wins.
1570333	1573575	Blu-ray wins when HD DVD folds, you know what I mean?
1573955	1576698	If that happens in a year or whatever, then Matrix will come out on Blu-ray.
1576718	1577198	You know it will.
1577498	1578259	Oh, it will, of course.
1579330	1580951	Star Wars movies will all come out too.
1594443	1594503	No.
1594523	1595044	Rad isn't on DVD.
1595064	1595264	What isn't?
1595284	1595364	Rad.
1595404	1595504	Rad.
1622000	1623621	Rad was awesome.
1623681	1624322	What is Rad?
1624442	1626483	Rad is a BMX bike movie.
1626503	1629125	It's one of those, you know, fight for the underdogs thing.
1629466	1637672	They had an entire sequence where they did a musical dance number using BMX bikes at a school prom or homecoming or something like that.
1638192	1638813	It was awesome.
1638973	1640254	Is Cop Rock out on DVD?
1640974	1641315	I don't know.
1641475	1642456	That needs to be out on DVD.
1642476	1643357	That was a TV show.
1643717	1646661	But Rad and Gleaming the Cube is another one that was pretty cool.
1647081	1648383	Oh, I gotta love the 80s movies.
1648403	1649644	Gleaming the Cube, I remember.
1649884	1650665	Gotta love the 80s movies.
1650685	1652387	You know how I know Gleaming the Cube?
1652888	1655351	Because there's a trailer for it on Pump Up the Volume.
1657153	1658174	That's how I know that.
1659690	1664234	Which, as an independent radio person, you know that's one of my favorite movies ever, is Pump Up the Volume.
1664254	1666035	But anyway, that's for another time.
1666175	1668497	Monster Squad, Rad, and Gleaming in a Cube.
1668657	1670078	Do yourself a favor, watch them.
1670218	1675843	I know they were really cool back in the 80s, and they're not so cool now, but hey, it's nostalgia, so.
1677224	1678785	Dang, Joshi16's got a good point.
1678845	1679345	The Wizard?
1679846	1680846	Is The Wizard out on DVD?
1680886	1681327	Yes, it is.
1681407	1682287	I think I've seen it.
1682307	1683528	I think it did finally come out.
1683548	1685530	They were released in August or something.
1685630	1686851	It took them a while, but it finally did.
1687853	1688353	I don't own it.
1688573	1690674	I need to put that on my birthday wish list.
1690714	1692435	Hey, wait until high def.
1692955	1693735	High def wizardry.
1693815	1694195	That's true.
1694255	1703018	We do need a high def Super Mario 3 or whatever that... Remember the lame announcer?
1703258	1706480	Yes, I want to be able to have, you know, he touch my breasts in 7.1.
1706640	1707120	Moving on.
1714352	1717293	So another game getting some download content, Project Gotham Racing 4.
1718073	1722875	It's going to bring some brand new cars as well as some new modes and of course more achievements.
1724535	1726676	Of the downloads, they're going to have one that's free.
1726716	1728056	It's called the Free Challenge Pack.
1728597	1734659	It has a playable hydrogen powered pergo flux car, I guess.
1735819	1740120	Tourist mode where you just drive around the city and admire the scenery with no goal whatsoever.
1740500	1742281	And free roam cat and mouse mode.
1742833	1744214	See, the free roam stuff is pretty cool.
1744234	1747116	They're taking a little page from Burnout Paradise.
1747817	1749478	And, of course, seven unlockable achievements.
1750859	1769153	The Premium Challenge Pack, which is going to be $5 or 400 Microsoft Points, includes 700 new cars, including the 1987 BMW M3 E30 DTM and the World Challenge Arcade Mode with 20 new events in three themed chapters and three more unlockable achievements.
1770034	1772636	And these will be available on Valentine's Day.
1774822	1779286	Nothing Says Love Like A Downloadable Hydrogen Car
1802882	1804123	She wouldn't touch the 360.
1804723	1806183	She doesn't know how to do that stuff.
1808144	1809785	She can't even figure out how to play a DVD on there.
1811145	1811425	Alright.
1813686	1814206	Let's see.
1814946	1817707	Also, I want to go back and read some comments from chat.
1818067	1819508	I forgot about this DVD release.
1819548	1821568	This is a big DVD release that came out this week.
1821808	1824609	NYRfan says, I saw The King of Kong the other day.
1826050	1827110	Did you see King of Kong yet?
1827130	1827850	Did you get that DVD?
1828050	1828210	Nope.
1830191	1830651	Whoop-de-doo.
1831397	1836739	But they made me buy Donkey Kong for the week because they were going to do this big King of Kong contest thing.
1837579	1838780	Never fucking paid me for it.
1839040	1840720	And then they ended up not doing it.
1840960	1842021	So we decided not to do it.
1842041	1844402	I'm like, where's my five bucks?
1846042	1846763	Sorry about that.
1846783	1849363	I'm like, thanks, bastards.
1850364	1850664	Nice.
1851584	1851924	Let's see.
1852144	1856626	Oh, Joshi16 in chat says about The Wizard coming out in high def someday.
1857206	1858627	So much batter in HD.
1859688	1860528	Exactly.
1860828	1861689	That's what they should call it.
1861729	1863609	The It's So Batter edition.
1863869	1865350	Oh my god, it needs to be in 3D.
1865370	1866110	That'd be awesome.
1867071	1869772	Hey, you know they're doing that with a lot of... Power glue!
1870792	1874193	You know, they're doing that with a lot of old Disney movies at least.
1874213	1875213	They're coming back out in 3D.
1875253	1875774	Toy Story.
1876094	1877234	All those are going to come out in 3D.
1877834	1880575	Toy Story is easy because they just have to render it with two camera angles.
1881596	1882596	That's simple stuff.
1882876	1883396	I'm sorry.
1883856	1884617	Child's Play.
1884917	1888458	In fact, Loki's going to go home and make Toy Story 3D for all of you.
1889249	1890030	I'll make a sequel.
1890050	1891432	I can crap it out in a sec.
1891612	1892093	That's easy.
1893654	1893995	All right.
1896138	1896538	Let's see.
1896658	1897219	Moving on.
1897319	1900263	Something else that's going to be making its way to Xbox very soon.
1900583	1902225	Now this, here you go.
1902345	1903727	Here's a movie that needs to be in HD.
1903887	1905309	I don't think this is out in HD yet.
1905449	1905970	Tron.
1906510	1906951	That'd be cool.
1906991	1907712	Tron is winner.
1908599	1910740	and Tron, of course, the original Tron.
1910800	1914741	That game is already out on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1915041	1916421	But we all knew this game was coming.
1916621	1917821	Discs of Tron.
1917861	1918281	That's right.
1918321	1919822	The other Tron arcade game.
1920142	1922843	That is going to be coming out on Xbox Live and it makes its way when?
1923343	1924243	Why, this week.
1924723	1927504	February 13th is the big day for Discs of Tron.
1927844	1930564	Now, how would you feel if Nelly got you Discs of Tron for Valentine's Day?
1930584	1931165	That would be much cooler.
1931185	1932145	I fucking hate Discs of Tron.
1932165	1932505	What?
1935006	1936066	I don't like the Tron games.
1936106	1936606	I'm sorry.
1937612	1938712	Disoftron is awesome.
1940731	1942872	I'm trying to think of a game that it was very much like.
1943172	1945973	It's kind of like, it's really just an over-glorified Pong.
1946473	1949154	And if you've seen the movie, you remember that disc thing they would play?
1949814	1955256	They did that little dance and they'd throw the disc in the air and it would bounce off the wall or whatever and hit the platform and make part of it disappear.
1955536	1957076	And ultimately you're trying to make your opponent disappear.
1957236	1958517	It's like that, but a real game.
1958797	1961758	They should have that at Disneyland, like actual discotron.
1961778	1963398	Wouldn't that be cool?
1964099	1968660	I mean, you don't necessarily... I mean, they could do it with some sort of motion capture stuff where they
1969618	1975763	You're in black lights, one person's on the other side, and you make the motion like you're throwing a disc, and it makes the image of a disc go.
1975823	1977164	I mean, that'd be kind of cool.
1978065	1978625	Good times.
1979265	1979746	They could do it.
1980086	1980406	I don't know.
1980646	1983268	They just need to make sure the platform actually falls out from underneath you.
1983949	1986791	And then you fall to your untimely death at the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean.
1986811	1989413	And then you become a slave at Disneyland.
1989969	1990790	The end.
1991030	1994452	No, it could be like that, you remember that game show they had on Game Show Network?
1994472	1995293	Nick Arcade.
1995433	1997074	No, no, no, Russian Roulette.
1997374	1998175	Oh, I remember that.
1998195	1998875	On the Game Show Network.
1998895	1999556	I love that show.
2000957	2006481	Hosted by Mark L. Wahlberg, which is like, how do you describe Mark L. Wahlberg?
2006521	2008062	Like, he's the total, like...
2008849	2011090	Just, what's a word to describe him?
2011110	2013111	You know, he hosts that Moment of Truth show now, too.
2013131	2013391	Douche.
2013671	2020475	Like, if you ever need, like, a total asshole to host your game show, like, Markel Wahlberg's the guy to call.
2020515	2022656	And so he was awesome on, and I mean that as a compliment.
2023216	2030099	So he hosted Russian Roulette, and you would pull, and I know we have an international audience, so maybe not everybody has heard of this show, although they probably stole it from another country.
2030680	2030880	You would...
2031480	2042902	Basically, you know, as people missed questions, lights would light up on the ground, including one that you were standing under, and you had to pull the lever and spin the lights, and if the light landed on you, then the floor would open and you fell.
2044243	2047723	Now, obviously, in the game show, you just fell a few feet onto some padding.
2048063	2048504	Yeah.
2048804	2049024	Yeah.
2049264	2049684	I wish.
2050704	2051684	We'd like to believe that.
2051904	2052684	How awesome would that be?
2052704	2055005	In my mind, they fell through a wood chipper, but that's, you know.
2060066	2060406	All right.
2061666	2090418	you win $100 oh I want the money fuck you you're going through the floor I'm keeping the $100 sorry to get off track here Grand Theft Auto 4 the website's actually been relaunched for the game including some new video footage that they have of it one is a mock commercial for a wireless communications company including where they say that there's no drop calls and they have reliable handsets where the guy throws a handset at someone's head and stuff it's pretty fun
2090942	2103431	Also, if you want, there is a lovemeet.net quiz, which is going to be the fictional kind of eHarmony or whatever website that's going to be in the game for dating people.
2103931	2107514	And you can take your quiz and figure out what personality type you have.
2107594	2112978	And I know we did this at work and we came up with pervert, so that was kind of funny.
2114159	2118962	And I'm assuming they're going to be adding some more content to the website as the weeks go along.
2119653	2121574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2147395	2153738	The site that was running Destructoid was actually going to have a list of the achievements as well until Rockstar said, uh-uh, don't put those up there.
2154299	2158481	And so they wouldn't be threatened by lawyers.
2158561	2163403	They decided not to put the content up there and kind of retracted their original articles.
2163523	2172187	I'm glad a large, well-established, respectable website like Destructoid will also run away with their tail behind their legs when threatened.
2173168	2177010	And yes, I'm referring to like a year-old drama, but...
2177970	2181091	Faceit, that's a history of this show that will never be let down.
2181111	2182571	Sorry to interrupt, I just had to work that in there.
2183412	2192274	No, I mean, and I think also to their, you know, defense, you probably won't put that stuff up anyway because it would spoil a lot of the game.
2192674	2200196	They basically, you know, said, hey, you know, in the respect for this game coming out in a few months here, just not put this up yet because that will spoil a lot of the story for the game.
2201216	2202297	You don't want to spoil a game like this.
2202317	2203017	It's going to be awesome.
2203117	2205178	Oh, there's also some minigames you can play in it as well.
2205238	2206578	Some of them, they mentioned DARTs.
2207616	2211379	Poole, and some other game.
2211960	2212260	I don't know.
2235337	2237858	I'm sure this stuff would be on PartnerNet or something like that.
2238298	2242298	If it's out there on the public internet, it's free information.
2242338	2246419	This is from an insider that works at Rockstar.
2246479	2247619	I can't do that.
2250140	2252840	If it's public information, they have nowhere to complain.
2254920	2259081	If it's an actual leak like this, they have the right to take it down.
2259141	2263722	DMN is anticipating there will be a 15-gamer score achievement called Bitch Better Have My Money.
2265668	2287755	DMN also predicts a 30 gamerscore for lukewarm coffee I hope there is an achievement that pokes fun at hot coffee There really should be There should be an achievement like hot coffee and it's actually you go buy coffee You actually do buy hot coffee Or you blow up a Starbucks or whatever they call it in Grand Theft Auto A little parody name or something That'd be funny
2288325	2289386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2318992	2321354	and we're getting live in our work here pretty soon.
2321874	2323795	How much do you think you can kill in 15 minutes?
2325076	2326356	I can kill quite a few people.
2326476	2333180	Usually in Saints Row I can rack up a score of 20 or more if we're playing just rockets.
2333280	2338684	If it's just all out, we usually end up being around 10 to 15 kills.
2338864	2343546	But if we do teams, like six-man teams, oh man, we're going to own everybody.
2343606	2346248	Seriously, because we have so much experience in this game.
2347100	2348843	We'll learn all the little nuances.
2348964	2350106	It's just not even going to be fun.
2351007	2355695	But, you know, I don't think anyone's actually going to want to play online during our breaks.
2356557	2357478	I'll force them to, though.
2358360	2359502	I will be up to that challenge.
2360205	2362546	Well, I don't know how y'all feel about this, but I don't know.
2363566	2368528	As cool as Grand Theft Auto is, it's not really my kind of game, but this is one I could definitely play a lot of online.
2368568	2372329	It's Street Fighter 4, and this is going to be a fun one I bet to play online pretty soon.
2372589	2381132	Although, it's really no replacement for the arcade, and I think we all need to remember that, because sadly arcades are dying and they're turning into ticket-spitting machine heaven.
2381592	2387954	But, you know, Street Fighter 4, like it or not, it will be online, and what makes it very cool is that
2388840	2389680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2407216	2409617	They're all back, the original eight fighters in Street Fighter 4.
2409677	2413940	And there's some scans from Famitsu Magazine that actually show them in their new art style, and it's pretty rad.
2414300	2416421	And there's even some more stuff with Crimson Viper.
2416441	2419483	So it's not just the original eight are going to be in Street Fighter 4.
2419523	2420203	There's more.
2420243	2421104	The family's growing.
2421764	2424225	Someone did post the achievement list, I guess, on Destructoid.
2424946	2426407	Oh, wow.
2427527	2428808	Well, then I retract everything I said.
2428828	2429688	Spoilers ahead.
2429769	2430689	I retract everything I said.
2431109	2434791	They have an achievement for demolishing 20 buildings using only your rocket launcher.
2434851	2435932	Wait, how do you know it's legit?
2436687	2437527	That's my next question.
2438968	2440728	That's someone's blog, I guess.
2441568	2442748	Okay.
2442848	2445089	So take with a grain of salt, in my opinion.
2445489	2445729	Yeah.
2447089	2447730	You want to say any others?
2449110	2449830	Let's see here.
2451370	2453411	Out of town, stay hidden for six days.
2453571	2454471	That's one of the achievements.
2455551	2458532	Let me see if there's anything real quick for the hot coffee.
2458852	2459972	I don't see anything on here.
2461413	2462233	Let's see here.
2464994	2466314	Yeah, it's probably not going to be in there.
2466877	2467697	But it's a nice thought.
2468358	2469519	I like the hooker one on there.
2471980	2473521	I don't know if this is legit or not.
2474201	2490150	See, I'm saying when it shows up on somebody's little blog, I'm not saying that it's necessarily a lie, but you do kind of have to take it with a grain of salt because there are people out there that want to lie, and especially probably because of the lulls that people are having over the whole, well, they know the list, but they can't spoil it.
2490170	2490570	You know what I mean?
2491051	2493372	I would think there would be a lot more achievements than that there, too.
2494019	2498482	Because there's an achievement that says, I get it, and I'll read the first letter of each achievement name.
2498702	2499622	Yeah, it's fake.
2499662	2500123	It's fast.
2500183	2504145	It says, uh... You're stupid for believing this.
2504165	2505466	Yeah, you suck donkey cock.
2505606	2505946	Oh, lovely.
2505966	2506606	That's what it says.
2506666	2506926	Nice.
2507107	2507407	Okay.
2507607	2509188	Although that would be cool if that was real.
2509308	2511689	Like, Rockstar really should do that.
2511749	2514731	Like, that's their hidden thing to piss off the senators.
2514811	2520614	Like, you know, when you take the first letter of each word, it says, you know, senators are all gay or something.
2520754	2521615	You know, I don't know.
2521775	2523016	Yeah, you suck, Donkey Kong.
2523116	2524017	Don't trust anything.
2524697	2524897	Nice.
2525238	2525418	Nice.
2525618	2525878	Okay.
2526078	2526679	Nice touch there.
2526719	2527720	Yeah, Loki got pwned.
2528160	2528960	I didn't get pwned.
2530442	2532063	Oh my god, it's legit!
2559938	2561779	I don't know, I think they might cut T-Hawk.
2562059	2563440	The characters, nobody really used.
2564941	2567223	I would bet some of the Street Fighter 3 characters are going to be in this too.
2568183	2569084	I think it's going to be epic.
2569204	2570805	I think it's going to have a ton of fighters.
2570825	2572026	There's plenty of room for everybody.
2572286	2574308	And if they don't put Dan in it, there's going to be a riot.
2574368	2575228	There will be a riot.
2576649	2579811	Yeah, Tigerclaw says, I wouldn't be surprised if Akuma is in Street Fighter 4.
2579951	2580472	Absolutely.
2581252	2584374	And of course, Shang Long has to be in it.
2585055	2586836	Because you must beat Shang Long to stand a chance.
2587736	2588657	Anyway, forget it.
2589262	2596384	One game which we thought for a second there, we thought, oh my god, hell froze over, but Duke Nukem Forever.
2596864	2612948	Apparently there was an interview for the Dallas Business Journal where 3D Realms President Scott Miller confirmed all sorts of stuff including that Duke Nukem Forever was coming in 2008 and that Duke Nukem 3D was going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2614179	2642586	and some of the stuff they said we haven't officially announced any platform for Duke Nukem Forever but of course hitting the big three makes most sense PC, PS3, and 360 and he said 3D Realms is negotiating with Microsoft to get a release window of sometime this year on the title that's of course for Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade and he confirmed that Duke Nukem Forever would be coming out in 2008 to home consoles
2644321	2651302	But shortly after he was claimed to have said all this stuff, 3D Realms was like, uh-uh, we never said that.
2652202	2668445	And apparently, which they said, George Broussard of 3D Realms said, In what appears to be an unfortunate turn of events, there seems to have been some confusion between what was off the record and what was not.
2668625	2673006	I suppose we're used to dealing with the gaming press and not mainstream press.
2674124	2674745	Lesson learned.
2675485	2679947	So, I don't know if that means that... Yeah, it is actually coming out in 2008, but... Shh!
2680587	2681688	We never said that!
2681928	2690411	You know, that type of thing, or... I think they're more afraid of the space-time continuing damage that would come from actually confirming this game.
2690852	2696994	They basically said the release date is still when it's done and will be until that appropriate moment.
2697114	2699675	Platforms have not been finalized or announced.
2700116	2702857	You can... It'll be done when it's done...
2703891	2704592	Stop asking!
2704632	2705572	But here's the question, though.
2705592	2709375	They should just put that on a big piece of paper and fax it to any website.
2709736	2717341	Granted, this will be an instant purchase for me, but, I mean, do I really care anymore about... I mean, this isn't like some huge epic game anymore.
2717402	2719803	Just kind of, eh, whatever.
2720704	2722225	It's limping along to the finish line.
2722886	2725668	You'd buy it just to see how terrible it actually turns out to be.
2725728	2729091	Oh, it's not going to be... I mean, it's going to be borderline terrible.
2729131	2731573	Like, Duke Nukem 3D was borderline terrible, but...
2733388	2735949	Wait a minute, Duke Nukem 3D was kind of rad.
2736089	2738931	It was rad, but see, it had the cops, shooting hookers.
2738951	2740211	It had the B-movie.
2740712	2742693	It's cool for the same reason Evil Dead is cool.
2742713	2743513	Yeah, that's what I meant.
2744013	2746895	Well, it's also cool because they use a lot of lines from Evil Dead as well.
2746915	2747475	True, true.
2748716	2748936	All right.
2749036	2749296	I don't know.
2749876	2753478	Well, one thing that's not cool is going down and burning things down.
2753958	2759381	And what's even more not cooler is to brag about it on the Internet.
2759861	2762823	And so you know for this, we've got to give out another one of these.
2765689	2769831	That's right, it's another Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award.
2770791	2779314	The Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award this week goes to a user on GameFAQs, and their name is JediKnight12345.
2780655	2792419	JediKnight12345 made a post in the current events section of the GameFAQs forums, and what he was doing is he was asking the folks on the forums if he should burn down a school and a church.
2793780	2797564	And what happened a little later in the town of Palmyra, Missouri?
2798705	2800066	He burned down a church.
2801948	2805271	And so this boy was arrested on suspected arson charges.
2805551	2809615	We don't know his real name because he is under the age of 18 and they withhold that kind of stuff.
2810276	2813219	So we can't give out the stupid award by his real name.
2813239	2817023	But he certainly, if he's over the age of like four, he's old enough to know better.
2817743	2818244	You know what I mean?
2819324	2820705	Even at that age, you should know better.
2820965	2824286	Do we really need more reason not to go on the GameFAQs forum?
2824566	2829608	I feel bad for GameFAQs, because everybody's just using this as a reason to attack them.
2829648	2832809	Like, you know, well that's what he gets for going to GameFAQs, ha ha ha.
2833149	2834770	You know, I'm like, okay, ha ha.
2834850	2835650	Their community was...
2836030	2836971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2864946	2868127	But then they wouldn't be anonymous like they are on the internet.
2870387	2872128	Can't catch me, I'm on GameFAQs.
2872448	2876669	AmazeSatsuma says, 12345, how did you know the combination for my briefcase?
2878909	2891332	By the way, as if even just asking about it wasn't bad enough, it should also be noted that JediKnight12345 went back to the forum and bragged that he had in fact burned a church and school down.
2892093	2893913	And he posted pictures of it!
2894565	2895185	on GameFAQs.
2897206	2910432	Now, to the users of GameFAQs credit, other forum posters immediately went and found the local news station in this area and contacted them and the authorities and all that and contacted people that could do something about it and turn this guy in, basically.
2910452	2914033	So, hooray to the GameFAQs users that turned this guy in.
2914333	2916054	You are exempt from the Stupid Award this week.
2916314	2918915	However, Jedi Knight 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, it's your Stupid Award.
2919515	2920816	Congratulations, you're stupid.
2922657	2923137	There you have it.
2923976	2925897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2949085	2954652	He played too much Dracula, or Castlevania, throwing the holy fire and learned how to start fires.
2954992	2956835	So playing too much WoW as a mage.
2956935	2957515	Jeez.
2958056	2961640	So the complete idiocy of this guy makes me angsty.
2961921	2963863	He fires a magic missile into the darkness.
2964083	2966026	You know this brings on the FUs of the week.
2975430	2977071	Loki, your FUs of the week, please.
2977652	2982035	Uh, my FU of the week goes to a headache that's coming on right about now, and that sucks.
2982375	2984296	I fucking hate getting headaches on Sundays.
2985037	2986238	And it's always on Sundays.
2986678	2989060	But not having anything to do with this show, of course.
2989140	2990881	It's just, I get headaches on Sundays.
2992522	2993623	Maybe you're allergic to Sunday.
2994404	2995985	I'm allergic to the holy day, I guess.
2997006	2997566	Sorry to hear that.
2998026	2999848	Uh, Poppy, do you have any FUs you'd like to give this week?
3000608	3004051	Uh, FU to insomnia, letting me get about a
3005445	3019411	10 hours of sleep over the course of four nights, and FU to the charger from my laptop for going up, and now my laptop is running on battery power until it eventually dies.
3019491	3021192	My FU of the week goes to Sears.
3021512	3033438	I don't want to give too many details about purchases I made a while ago, but oh my god, I had to go back to the store like twice in one day to clear up this issue that I was having that, you know, wasn't even like my fault with Sears.
3033958	3034058	Ugh.
3034825	3037067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3064824	3068506	You probably wouldn't guess Juno as the game.
3069726	3070086	I don't know.
3070286	3071767	Why would they make a game based off Juno?
3071947	3072567	I don't understand it.
3072587	3075188	Teaching little girls about pregnancy adventures?
3075569	3080210	I haven't seen Juno, but I hear it's about teenage pregnancy or whatever.
3080371	3081951	I'm not exactly sure how that makes a game.
3082912	3085193	Did they make a game out of Napoleon Dynamite?
3086293	3087934	I'm not sure how they'd make a game out of that either.
3087954	3088954	Juno to me...
3091505	3093406	Feels like it might be this year's Napoleon Dynamite.
3093586	3097108	It's really funny now, but when it comes out on video, there's going to be a big backlash against it.
3097128	3097629	Just you wait.
3098809	3101411	So, I don't know.
3101451	3111957	Apparently, there is a panel at DICE, the summit going on in Las Vegas right now, during the Intellectual Property Migration Specialists.
3114078	3119181	It says people are making a game based off Juno just to cater to the casual market.
3121098	3149965	and they didn't specify really anything about the game but apparently it was I don't know he said it's probably going to be following Nexon's free to play business model so I don't know so it would be like little mini games for free or something I'm sorry this is probably going to be about as good as that Dirty Dancing game that came out or possibly the what was it that one based off Prince's Bride
3151984	3156108	Ryoma in our chatroom says, Sky, Juno is a lot less stupid than Napoleon Dynamite.
3156329	3157710	Napoleon Dynamite I hated.
3157950	3161614	I haven't seen Juno, so I thought Napoleon Dynamite was funny.
3161734	3169221	I didn't think it was like the most hilarious movie ever made, but I did find some things very amusing in that movie, like the grandma especially, you know.
3170042	3171423	Make me another Quesadilla.
3172304	3175447	And when she got in the dirt bike accident, it was really funny.
3175968	3176268	Forget it.
3178055	3178516	DarkSakura.com

3267540	3279443	In the US, we're getting quite a few things coming out, including Lost Odyssey, that we've been seeing some pretty strange commercials for on TV.
3279463	3281724	It makes it look like some sort of hippie game, I don't know.
3282004	3285165	I fast-forward all commercials, so what makes it look so horrible?
3285545	3287365	It's the music that they picked for it.
3287625	3290586	Yeah, what's... I don't remember what the name was.
3290866	3294467	I don't know, it's just... But it's something about White Knight talking backwards...

3427512	3434474	All of this on this Jefferson Airplane.
3434494	3438375	That was pretty rad.
3439215	3440935	White Rabbit, my Jefferson Airplane.
3440955	3441996	There it is right there on the side.
3443036	3446077	Sorry, I am not up on my Jefferson Airplane, okay?

3470573	3479699	Some other fun stuff, of course, this is the scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff, but oh, I forgot to mention also the Cobalt Blue in Black DS.
3480560	3481881	That came out today as well.
3483022	3487585	Anyways, Go Diego Go Safari Rescue 1, PlayStation 2, and the Wii.
3488205	3490467	Gotta pick that one up.
3491508	3495691	There was also a Dora the Explorer game coming out, but I don't really care what that is.
3496454	3497534	Balloon Pop on the Wii.
3497594	3500975	What was that parody of Dora the Explorer they had on Saturday Night Live?
3501255	3502775	I don't remember that.
3503635	3505596	I think I wet myself laughing.
3505656	3507556	It was so freaking hilarious.
3508616	3509016	Forget it.
3509456	3510476	I'll save that for another show.
3511677	3513917	Anyways, Balloon Pop for the Wii.
3513977	3517258	It's a really cheap puzzle game, so that's kind of neat.
3517798	3519538	Rock Band, they're getting the drum sets.
3519558	3521978	The standalone drum sets are supposed to be coming out this week as well.
3522639	3523899	So look for those.
3524259	3525159	Great $90 prep rolls.
3526525	3527787	There's $80 peripherals.
3529369	3531432	I thought it was $90 for the drum sets.
3531472	3531733	No, $80.
3532854	3533936	It's still expensive, though.
3534176	3534376	Yeah.
3535999	3537661	And that's it.
3537681	3538463	Sorry.
3538523	3538723	Sorry.
3539764	3542885	Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates.
3543586	3551529	And coming out in Japan on the 14th of February on the Xbox 360, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008.
3551990	3554311	I don't know how popular wrestling is over in Japan.
3554351	3557332	I think they have their own wrestling league over there because I've seen some YouTubage.
3558124	3560306	But if you want to experience the American version, there you go.
3560346	3562408	It's also coming out on PlayStation 3, by the way.
3562828	3565110	And it appears to be one of the bigger releases this week in Japan.
3565150	3566071	There's not a lot else.
3566632	3567713	It's also coming out on the Wii.
3568133	3570975	But if you're not a Rasslin' fan, you can get Medal of Honor Heroes 2.
3571015	3572617	It does come out on the Nintendo Wii.
3572637	3576200	By the way, there's also a bundle with the Wii Zapper making its way to Japan.
3576660	3580183	On the PlayStation 2, Decapo, the origin, comes out.
3581244	3581725	Another...
3582682	3590785	Pachinko Game, Jisen, Pachislot, Hisoho Selection, Salerman, Kintaru, Slaughter, Kintaru, Ore no Sora.
3590965	3591926	Yes, that's one name.
3592266	3593567	It's another Sega Pachinko Game.
3593587	3594267	That's all I need to know.
3595207	3596928	Kimikis comes out as well.
3598168	3599129	Poison Pink.
3599989	3601230	That sounds like it could be kind of fun.
3601570	3604671	And another wrestling game, Wrestle Angels Survivor.
3605371	3605972	Good price.
3606572	3607873	That sounds like a good TV show.
3607993	3609353	Might be a price reduction on that.
3609393	3610153	I don't know about that one.
3610834	3611314	Interesting.
3612180	3614681	Let's see what's coming out on the handhelds on the Nintendo DS.
3614801	3620523	Digimon Championship, a game called Happy Happy Clover comes out as well.
3622403	3629045	And just in time for Valentine's Day, Otomeki Koi Kakume Love Revo DS comes out as well.
3629105	3633286	Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything of note for you guys over in Japan.
3633807	3637868	A Medal of Honor as well coming on the Sony PSP, Medal of Honor Heroes that is.
3638468	3638588	And
3639517	3641838	Where would your life be without another Gundam game?
3641879	3646121	Mobile Suit Gundam, Giren no Yabu, Axis no Koei comes out.
3646401	3648002	Oh, that's a Korean date, actually.
3648022	3649763	That must have already come out in Japan.
3650704	3652685	There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
3654146	3654626	Sweet.
3656247	3664052	Well, if you're a little bit late to, say, returning your books to a library, if you happen to be in this neck of the woods here,
3666232	3691766	you actually can play DDR to possibly avoid late fees apparently the story is of a librarian's annual patron appreciation day where he lets attendees to avoid overdue fines by donating non-perishables to a local soup kitchen or playing a quick game of DDR pay for play system, they didn't really discuss that
3692336	3694017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3722830	3723731	I don't even know where this is.
3723832	3726596	I'm not going to go there and play DDR for their late fees.
3726616	3728419	You're fucking paying me money for that.
3728819	3732725	It's certainly a creative method.
3732905	3733606	I'll give it that.
3733707	3734027	I guess.
3734448	3734768	Alright.
3735830	3736511	We'll leave it at that.
3736571	3737212	It's creative.
3738638	3740579	Also a pretty creative game.
3741079	3743300	There was a lot of people that loved Myst Online.
3743701	3749724	Unfortunately, they don't have much longer to love this game because GameTap will be shutting down Myst Online in 60 days.
3750125	3757129	They made the difficult decision earlier this week that Myst Online Uru Live will be going down in 60 days.
3757269	3760091	So that's somewhere in April when the game will be coming down.
3761011	3765074	And what's really cool is Rick Sanchez, who has actually been on our show before.
3765114	3766975	He was on almost about a year and a half ago.
3767655	3776044	He actually posts on the GameTap forums and kind of had to make that very difficult post because, you know, like any MMO, there's rabid fans.
3776104	3777906	And, you know, Myst Online is no exception.
3778586	3782010	It had its share of rabid fans, and they're not happy to hear about the game going.
3782712	3784394	People want refunds and so on and so on.
3785635	3790979	MistOnline.com will stay active as a tribute to what was in the game.
3791319	3797524	And in Rick's post, he said they were looking at, quote, a wide variety of possibilities for maintaining the game.
3798285	3803709	He swears up and down they're not just a bunch of evil corporate types who do nothing but count pennies and wear Brooks Brothers suits.
3804950	3808173	And honestly, I don't know how many of you guys have played MistOnline.
3808977	3811801	I checked it out a couple months ago for the sake of reviewing it on the show.
3812241	3821312	And what I noticed about the game is that there are real live people that play the game in a making the story work type of capacity.
3821352	3827860	For instance, if you were a new person, you could go to these classes in Myst Online to learn about the world of Myst.
3828240	3829641	and it wasn't an automated thing.
3829701	3831241	There was actually someone there.
3831561	3836704	Like when I went in there, the person said, you know, hello, Sky, are you, because that's an online name I use as most of you know.
3836984	3839245	The person said, hello, Sky, are you here for the class today?
3839605	3840445	And I was like, yes.
3840505	3841946	And they're like, okay, just take a seat over there.
3841966	3842726	We'll get started soon.
3842966	3844667	You know, like it's crazy.
3844707	3848248	They actually have people in and I imagine that's got to be a very expensive thing to maintain.
3848749	3856712	So I say kudos to GameTap for giving it a try and if the rest of you are pissed off, be pissed off at the fact that people didn't play it.
3857378	3858438	That's why it shut down.
3858518	3864201	If your MMO doesn't have enough people playing it to keep it running, it shuts down.
3864721	3868162	In the end, though, the rabid fans will find a way to maintain it.
3870283	3880126	Yeah, I've had that experience before when I played Myth a long time ago, and when Bungie finally shut down the servers for Myth 2, like,
3882621	3883602	God, how long ago was that?
3883702	3884123	Too long ago.
3885144	3896094	It wasn't more than a month before players had brought up their own servers that Bungie actually endorsed and said, hey, you're free to go ahead and play these servers now.
3896494	3898156	We'll turn the other cheek for this one.
3899632	3904996	Let's see, Josie16 in chat, chat.org.com says, Missed Online was well thought through.
3905096	3906117	Too bad to see it go.
3906517	3912801	You know, the problem with Missed Online, even though they had the class and everything, I found it very hard to just get in and go.
3913162	3925130	You know, like, I think the reason why WoW, like, one reason WoW is so fucking popular is that I don't know how many of you have sat down to play it, you know, despite how you feel about the game, but you can get up and running in World of Warcraft relatively quickly.
3925370	3928152	You know, there's kind of a learning curve as you level from levels 1 to 10, right?
3929032	3931093	That's why people are like, oh, you can get to level 10 in an hour.
3931373	3936596	That's because level 1 to 10 is really the learning curve for noobs, and it really walks you through the game.
3937637	3939658	I have the same bitch as Final Fantasy XI.
3939678	3946442	I think if Final Fantasy XI didn't have the Final Fantasy name in front of it, that was a very hard game to just get up and running in, to kind of figure out.
3946462	3948503	Remember when we first bought Final Fantasy XI, Loki?
3948523	3950264	We bought it the day it came out on the PC.
3950564	3951544	It was back when we were living together.
3952725	3953926	We were so lost the first day.
3954586	3957848	I didn't realize that the world extended beyond the first little area.
3957868	3958148	I was like,
3958578	3959699	I'm gonna kill bunnies for the rest of my life!
3959719	3960059	This is fun!
3975163	3979086	And then you go into, what's the thing after, it's Ronfro's the first area.
3979386	3984949	Then you go into Lathene Plateau, and you try to kill a bunny there, and they just murder you.
3984969	3987430	You're like, I just got raped by a bunny.
3987730	3989151	Why do you hate me so much?
3989431	3990312	Oh, now I remember.
3990712	3991312	That's right.
3992893	3994374	I'm so glad I didn't have to deal with that.
3995755	3996695	That game was fun.
3997155	3997656	I miss it.
3998496	3999116	But not really.
3999717	4000017	All right.
4001817	4006739	One game I'm probably not going to miss either is Midway's brand new This is Vegas!
4007319	4014481	And apparently if you're too, I don't know, poor to go to Vegas to be a whore or to gamble, you can do it in this game.
4014802	4016122	So that's awesome.
4016882	4019983	They didn't really say what it was that you would be doing in this.
4020844	4026986	Apparently you would be able to live out your fantasies in Vegas by fighting, gambling, driving, and partying.
4027006	4029847	Strangely, no mention of hookers.
4030567	4030827	Well...
4032196	4036699	I don't know, in the trailer though, there was hooker-like people.
4037720	4043624	But yeah, so this is Vegas, coming to Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
4043764	4051969	You know, I'm just, I'm wondering if people are going to start doing, you know, this is Sparta, and this is Vegas.
4053170	4056132	I'm sure it's somewhere on YTMND already.
4057613	4058453	I'm sure it's already there.
4058854	4059194	I don't know.
4059434	4061075	It's a weird idea for a game, but.
4063032	4064573	Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel.
4089052	4091173	Press release put out this week from D3.
4092214	4095676	It was mentioning the forthcoming sequel to the game.
4095896	4097678	Here's the quote from the press release.
4097978	4108545	The company will also be releasing video games based on Aardman's popular Shaun the Sheep character in 2008 alongside the eagerly awaited follow-ups to the best-selling Ben 10 and Puzzle Quest.
4109226	4113469	Now see, I don't know what I'm more excited about, sequel to Puzzle Quest or Shaun the Sheep.
4115284	4119306	I've never fucking heard of it, but that sounds pretty awesome, I gotta say.
4119827	4120147	Sheep.
4120707	4124069	And I don't remember Ben 10 being that popular, but okay.
4125089	4132273	Well, apparently it was popular enough for them to make a live-action movie about, even though the only reason I know that is because I watch too much Cartoon Network.
4132493	4134875	Maybe something that's more popular in another country, I don't know.
4135975	4138276	But I've never heard of it personally, so there you go.
4138596	4141578	Who knows what 12-year-olds are watching these days other than Hannah Montana.
4141598	4142318	Okay.
4144295	4153481	I'm sure this... Don't get me started on how fucking nuts it is that, like, the theaters are, like, packed with little girls and their moms going to see Hannah Montana.
4153521	4155362	Like, you know that movie is, like, crushing everything.
4155702	4157663	And I hear people talking about it at work all the time.
4157683	4159304	It's not a movie.
4159364	4160965	It's a recording of a concert.
4161726	4162086	I know.
4162146	4162826	It's crazy.
4163367	4164367	It's like... Not a movie.
4164387	4166108	Don't talk about how the DS prints money.
4166709	4169130	Dude, Miley Cyrus has money coming out her ass.
4169610	4169931	Okay?
4170351	4170651	That's it.
4171561	4175063	I wonder when she's going to do a cover of her dad's achy breaky heart.
4176884	4177464	Or duet.
4179325	4179546	Nice.
4180266	4196855	I'm sure this is pure coincidence that I have this story, but apparently Mastiff has licensed the rights to the Major League Eating I didn't even know there was Major League Eating, but apparently they're going to make a Major League Eating game.
4197296	4199297	The game will play out like a fighting game.
4200363	4203205	and we'll show people on screen eating.
4205486	4208227	You will have a mastery of offensive and defensive weapons.
4208247	4210328	Just like watching this show on Justin TV.
4210388	4211809	You get to watch people eat.
4212529	4214130	Hey, I am having dinner, okay?
4215190	4215590	Whatever.
4216431	4218232	I'm not like, oh, it's the fish.
4219452	4220673	Boom, food good.
4222318	4224059	You should do that one day on the show, though.
4224739	4230481	So, you will have offensive and defensive weapons, including burps, belches, and mustard gas.
4230501	4237684	This sounds like the ultimate 12-year-old boy game.
4237964	4238784	Tee hee fart!
4239044	4240224	You know, like, seriously.
4240284	4241065	That is horrible.
4242705	4250068	And, of course, the technical mastery necessary to avoid emptying one's stomach and vividly colored reversals of fortune.
4251548	4252308	As they like to put it.
4254769	4255530	Wow.
4256230	4259131	I don't think it was worth the effort to even make that eloquent.
4259151	4261252	Really, are you that desperate for licenses?
4261312	4263773	Well, it is Mastiff, so, you know, I guess so.
4264213	4268515	I mean, they just came out with a Top Gun DS game, like, not too long ago.
4270315	4270996	A little late.
4272496	4276498	So, last week we had Major We, and this week we have Major Eating.
4276938	4277398	That's nice.
4278258	4279419	You'd think it would go the other way around.
4280558	4281339	That's all I have to say.
4283140	4287565	Goddamn, if this isn't a story that won't ever go away, is Apple's getting into gaming.
4287765	4289386	Oh my god, Apple's getting into gaming.
4289727	4295332	Hey, Newsflash, Apple's kind of already... Well, A, Apple went into gaming a long time ago and didn't do too hot.
4295392	4296133	Pippin, hello.
4296854	4299656	Apple's already, like, they're getting their big toe.
4299716	4302319	Like, they're putting their big toe in the water and saying, hmm, me...
4303460	4307422	They've got some pretty awesome games on the iPod now, like Peggle on the iPod.
4307482	4311645	I don't know if I've officially reviewed it on the show or whatever, but Peggle on the iPod is pretty awesome.
4311685	4313306	That's a system that game was made for.
4313626	4314867	That's a pretty awesome game on the iPod.
4315287	4319109	And Phase, basically Guitar Hero for your iPod of sorts.
4319229	4319850	Guitar Hero?
4319870	4320970	What are you talking about?
4321311	4322511	It's not Guitar Hero.
4322692	4323992	It's Amplitude.
4324092	4324613	Okay, whatever.
4324653	4325333	It's Amplitude.
4326054	4329096	Sadly, more people probably know what I'm talking about when I talk about Guitar Hero.
4330216	4331217	We need to educate them.
4332413	4335215	HitStun in chat says apparently the iPod version of Peggle is great.
4335275	4335735	It really is.
4335815	4338517	I think Peggle is probably the best game you can get on the iPod right now, honestly.
4339218	4349525	You know, and I love Sonic the Hedgehog and all that stuff too, but Peggle, just because of the nature of, you know, how you rotate the gun to fire down the... It's like, imagine if Plinko was a game.
4350085	4351246	That's basically what Peggle is.
4351986	4354548	And you can rotate the little gun with the dial.
4354588	4355308	It works perfectly.
4355929	4356049	So...
4357096	4360697	We need a, like, online version of Price is Right, the game.
4360737	4361738	That would be awesome.
4362098	4362918	That would be kind of rad.
4362978	4363218	Anyhow.
4363318	4364959	Use the touch wheel to spin the big wheel.
4364979	4365539	Well, hold on.
4365559	4366139	We got derailed.
4366159	4368300	We went from Apple to talking about Price is Right.
4368740	4384405	A trademark apparently was filed on February 5th that now has the room reels going again because Apple has updated its trademark to now include toys, games, and playthings, namely handheld units for playing electronic games and
4384645	4397266	Hamheld units for playing video games, standalone video game machines, electronic games other than those adapted for use of television receivers only, LCD game machines, electronic educational game machines, toys, namely battery-powered computer games.
4398237	4398678	Safety Net
4415501	4416241	This could be.
4416902	4417522	It could be.
4417542	4418042	I don't know.
4438798	4439798	Lame!
4440458	4441639	They don't understand.
4441699	4444719	They're just going to make it pink and pretty and stupid idiots will buy it.
4445120	4447180	Brace yourself.
4447600	4450001	I am agreeing with Loki.
4451501	4452281	Me of all people.
4452361	4454222	And you are an Apple fanboy.
4455542	4465605	I do not think that Apple... I think they got lucky with the iPhone jumping into a completely new market, but they... I think if they try to get into gaming, they're going to fail.
4466865	4467405	I just don't...
4468553	4472856	Style and design is not going to win when it's the software that sells the game.
4472896	4476478	And I'm not necessarily talking about the MacBook Air and stuff like that, just that.
4476618	4482341	I'm just saying they choose to go aesthetics over functionality for a lot of stuff.
4482762	4484763	And I don't know.
4484783	4486584	I mean, that works for some people, I guess.
4486744	4494549	But the problem is I don't think it's going to work for a console system or it's going to work for a handheld system because they're going to want to change it constantly.
4494589	4494809	I mean.
4496395	4501077	You know, the PlayStation 3 does the same damn thing, but still, you can't.
4501677	4505478	It's just going to get confusing, and they're going to want to do a ton of different things.
4505558	4509319	It's going to be like the PSP, but they're going to change it a lot more.
4509979	4517162	And it's not like you can release a new system like you can release a new version of an iPod, and it'll still have the same technology and functionality.
4518582	4523984	Because they'll end up releasing something new six months later, and it won't be able to be backwards compatible.
4524554	4525715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4546562	4550304	I wouldn't be surprised if you see the iPod go a little further into gaming.
4550424	4554246	I could totally see them putting out a controller or something that plugs into the iPod.
4554406	4555647	That makes more sense, I think.
4555987	4557708	But I think that's as far as it's going to go.
4557948	4560589	I don't see them releasing a whole new thing.
4560629	4563791	I see it as some type of extension or enhancement for an iPod.
4564191	4566012	That's it.
4566192	4570514	The best games that will ever come out for an iPod will probably be made...
4570999	4577081	by random people, not by Apple, that use the iPod Touch's touchscreen functionality.
4577222	4579683	Which, apparently, PopCap might be it.
4579923	4584745	Which makes sense, because the type of games that PopCap puts out is perfect for the iPod audience.
4585045	4585265	Right?
4586025	4586365	Am I right?
4586405	4586925	Casual stuff.
4586945	4588686	So there you have it.
4588726	4589807	Puzzle Pirates on an iPhone.
4590687	4590907	All right.
4591403	4595304	Anyhow, Part A is about over and we're going to be getting into Part B tonight.
4595324	4601885	Which, by the way, if I haven't mentioned yet, in Part B tonight, I've mentioned this a lot actually, we're going to be playing a brand new game we've never played before here on the show.
4602905	4606826	Everybody in chat can play and possibly win tonight.
4606866	4607626	It's going to be amazing.
4607666	4616547	But before we get to that in Part B, we have to do one more segment here in Part A. And for that, we have to bring somebody special on the line.
4617687	4619228	Oh, caller, are you there on the line?
4620368	4620588	Yes.
4621072	4622894	Hey, Jamie, how are you feeling?
4624195	4627079	I'm feeling stuff that I can't say on the air.
4627579	4627879	I see.
4627960	4631904	So you're just kind of feeling a little sick this week, basically?
4633786	4635688	It's viral.
4637190	4638191	That's never any fun.
4638691	4641094	Well, sorry to hear that you're sick, but you'll be back next week, right?
4642239	4642819	Yes, I will.
4643020	4645181	I just didn't want to get you guys sick.
4645221	4647182	I don't care about my co-workers so much.
4647342	4647943	I'm just kidding.
4649364	4650925	Because I got it from my co-workers.
4651946	4652826	Oh, snap.
4652866	4655228	So you're going to go back and get some more of them sick then, right?
4656288	4659391	Well, I figured if they were going to get sick, they would have already gotten sick from it.
4659711	4659991	All right.
4660371	4663313	Well, anyway, Jamie, we just couldn't do this segment without you.
4663733	4666956	We're at the end of Part A, as you may know from listening or what have you.
4667376	4669297	We've got to do the classic game of the week.
4669337	4670318	So let's get in the music.
4675367	4680488	and DarkSakura, what classic game have you picked for the listeners to celebrate this week?
4682048	4686189	The classic game of the week is one of my personal favorites.
4686750	4693851	It's Ys III, where it's from Ys, which is, you know, being Ys III, it is the third in the series.
4694491	4696912	So this one's actually different from the other two.
4696932	4699012	I don't know if anyone else was a big fan of it.
4699032	4701033	If I'm right, this was out on MSX.
4701133	4701313	It was...
4703354	4708518	I got used to the Super Nintendo version, but it was also out on PC Engine.
4708618	4711880	In fact, I've actually got the Duo version of this somewhere.
4713301	4717945	But the special thing about this one is that it's sort of a departure in gameplay from the previous ones.
4720647	4721447	Very cool.
4722168	4722628	Huh?
4723128	4723709	Sorry, go ahead.
4723909	4732195	Well, with this one is that the previous ones were the whole top-down, you know, old-school Zelda-style, you know,
4732822	4737245	Overhead View, and this one had primarily side-scrolling.
4740628	4748013	You'd have to actually mash a button to swing the sword and to attack, and you also had rings that you could equip for different special effects.
4748774	4753017	So instead of having magic, you would use your ring power.
4753637	4755519	And it was a pretty cool game.
4755559	4760042	It was very, I thought, unique for the time and the type of RPG that it was.
4760825	4763406	But it also had, like, some really fantastic music.
4763486	4765867	I love this game a whole lot.
4766807	4768087	Let's take a listen to the music real quick.
4774349	4779511	Now, one thing I should say about this game, a very common mispronunciation of the title, right?
4779531	4782272	Because it looks like Y's, because it's just the letter Y. It's Ys.
4782572	4783172	Yeah, it's Ys.
4784513	4784673	So...
4786351	4793817	In fact, if you actually look at the name, the Japanese title, Romana, it says Isu.
4793897	4794277	Very cool.
4794297	4795599	Does that help?
4795879	4803285	Now, the most recent Ys game, if I'm not mistaken, because I think we brought it up on a previous edition of the show, they ported, or I guess they made a new version of this game for the PSP, right?
4806507	4811411	If I'm right, I think it was Ys V, technically, the Ark of Napis Simp.
4815108	4821330	And then there was a Windows one that was like a remake of Ys III, which was the Earth of Stalkana.
4823830	4825811	It was more like an expansion of Ys III.
4827071	4827671	I gotcha.
4827691	4831872	So basically, you know, this game is so classic that it still continues to live on today in sequels.
4833373	4833893	Pretty much.
4833913	4839294	And I mean, anyone who's got, you know, Super Nintendo, if you can find this one, you should be able to find it really cheap still.
4839795	4840775	I recommend picking it up.
4840815	4841495	It's a fun game.
4842532	4842712	All right.
4843072	4844453	Maybe someday a virtual console?
4844953	4845294	Who knows?
4846394	4850156	I would hope so, but we'd probably get Ys I and II before we got Ys III.
4850356	4850997	I guess that's true.
4852037	4852377	All right.
4852738	4852998	Yeah.
4853518	4854659	Well, there you have it, boys and girls.
4854679	4859361	Your classic game of the week, Wanderers from Ys, the third game in the series.
4859521	4866245	The music you were hearing was from the MSX version, but you can find it also on Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx, if I'm not mistaken?
4866745	4866925	Yep.
4867305	4867685	Very cool.
4867705	4868486	Yep, it was a Turbo CD.
4869150	4869410	All right.
4869810	4872011	Well, Jamie, we look forward to having you back in the house next week.
4872231	4874731	Rest up and feel better, and say hi to Dan for us.
4876211	4877552	Oh, he's in there playing Smash Brothers.
4877852	4878152	All right.
4878752	4881492	Oh, you guys have the new Smash Brothers, right?
4882833	4884153	Yeah, well, we don't have it.
4884173	4895075	A friend of ours brought it over, and so they've been going through the whole adventure mode in there with the amazingly compatible team of Samus and Pikachu.
4895095	4895995	Okay.
4896940	4902842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4926607	4927448	Oh, I see how it is.
4927488	4929529	You wait until I'm out, and then you do the new stuff.
4929589	4936193	Well, because we have to fill time, because you're not here to give us your viewpoint and interrupt Loki when he's talking.
4936894	4937254	Just kidding.
4937274	4938055	I'm going to cry.
4939816	4940977	Aw, DarkSakura, we love you.
4940997	4942117	You should play in the game tonight.
4943218	4944499	It would be funny if you win.
4944759	4946941	I can't ever get the show to pull up on my laptop.
4947541	4948181	Aw, that's a bummer.
4948482	4948762	All right.
4949662	4950763	Well, DarkSakura, take care.
4950783	4951704	We'll see you next week, okay?
4951724	4952865	Okay.
4952885	4953085	Bye-bye.
4953245	4953465	All right.
4953485	4953925	Bye-bye.
4954366	4955026	Auf Wiedersehen.
4956247	4956487	All right.
4957708	4960971	That's going to do it for this Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4960991	4964474	We're going to take a quick break, though, and we'll be back with plenty more.
4964955	4966296	However, here's the deal.
4966516	4968819	I've got to close all my chat windows here.
4969159	4979449	We're going to be asking a qualifying question to qualify for tonight's game in Part B. Basically, one contestant will be coming in via the Skype line.
4979609	4982772	So I'm going to give you a question, very similar type of question you might hear in tonight's game.
4983332	5000928	and if you think you know the answer you're going to send me the answer in a private message in the chat room if you don't know how to send me a private message ask somebody and you are going to send me your phone number and by sending me your phone number that is consent that you approve of us calling you please make sure you are by your phone in the next hour or so
5001648	5025986	and that we don't get any surprises of mommy or daddy picking it up so don't submit an answer to this if you do not have control over your own phone so here it is this is the qualifier question you're gonna send me the correct answer to this question and then you are going to send me your phone number if you want to play and we'll pick somebody randomly out of those that submit the correct phone number so here it is and I'm putting this in the podcast because I felt those listening in the podcast might want to play along
5026610	5028070	Here's the qualifying question.
5028650	5031531	What game is this music from?
5038292	5041133	I wouldn't yell it out in chat or you're giving it away for everybody.
5041213	5042553	Here are the correct answers.
5043373	5044993	I'm sorry, one of these is the correct answer.
5045033	5046474	Here are the answers you have to choose from.
5046974	5049034	A, Nightmare on Elm Street.
5049534	5051075	B, Halloween.
5051595	5053035	C, Friday the 13th.
5060558	5060938	Thanks for watching!
5080994	5082615	After tonight's break.
5082955	5085776	So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
