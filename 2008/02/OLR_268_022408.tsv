0	20060	Today, February 24th, 2008, community games come to Xbox Live and Zune, Microsoft officially
20060	25140	abandons HD DVD, and Nintendo reveals that there is much more in store for the Wii Balance
25140	32520	board.
32520	36480	Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36480	41520	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41520	42520	lifestyle.
42520	46360	Yes, we are back from an unexpected vacation last week, we'll tell you more about what's
46360	50380	going down in just a little bit, but it wouldn't be a show if I couldn't introduce my lovely
50380	55480	co-host over there as the one and only Happiest Bunny on the Farm, Ms. Dark Sakura, Jamie
55480	56480	Summers.
56480	57480	Yo.
57480	58480	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
58480	59480	I'm satiated.
59480	60480	You're satiated?
60480	61480	That's good.
61480	62480	Yes.
62480	66680	I've had a mostly unsatisfactory day as far as things to dine on.
66680	67960	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
67960	73760	I've had a power bar and ice cream until this year.
73760	74760	That's not healthy.
74760	75760	That's all we had.
75760	76760	Oh, sorry to hear it.
76760	81440	So, I'm going to be going to the store tomorrow.
81440	82440	How about you, Loki?
82440	84080	Are you well fed today?
84080	88320	I just had McDonald's because it was on the way.
88320	89840	The one and only tech master, Loki.
89840	90840	You always have McDonald's.
90840	91840	I don't always have McDonald's.
91840	93840	You use the spice up once in a while.
93840	96560	Try Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, oh, you did have Subway.
96560	97560	I don't like Carl's Jr.
97560	102440	Carl's Jr. is actually pretty nasty, but Jack in the Box, that's also pretty nasty.
102440	107520	McDonald's, it's nasty, but in smaller portions, so I don't know.
107520	110600	Burger King, now that's the only fast food that's not so nasty.
110600	112760	I haven't had Burger King in a long time.
112760	113760	I don't know.
113760	117360	There's one really, really good thing that they would occasionally have on their menu.
117360	118360	What's that?
118360	119360	I actually miss.
119360	120360	What's that?
120360	122640	Those chicken sandwiches that were on the long buns.
122640	123640	Oh, okay.
123640	124640	You had that Italian one.
124640	125640	Oh, my God, that was so good.
125640	126640	You know, it's so funny.
126640	129120	We're a video game podcast, yet we keep talking about food.
129120	130120	It's like the two go hand-in-hand.
130120	131120	I'm not sure.
131120	136520	It's because our modern society is patterned around food and feeding.
136520	140840	Well, hello to everybody in our chat room at chat.orangelaundryradio.com.
140840	144240	Also we're live on Justin TV with our webcam, and they have a chat room as well.
144240	145240	We try to keep an eye on it.
145240	149600	It's justintv.com slash orangelaundryradio that always has the video archive of our shows.
149600	154960	You can see our smiling faces, or tonight, according to one of our chatters, frowning
154960	157120	face.
157120	162720	It's a comment from a NYR fan in chat, chat.orangelaundry.com, says, Rob sounds sad this week.
162720	163720	I'm not sad.
163720	164720	I'm just sick.
164720	166880	If it's not one thing, it's another.
166880	169400	Last week, we weren't here with the show.
169400	171840	What happened is that I was in Long Beach.
171840	173800	William and I were away for the weekend.
173800	175600	We went to the Star Trek tour in Long Beach.
175600	176600	Shut up.
176600	177600	Don't laugh.
177600	178600	It was awesome.
178600	182680	But what wasn't awesome was my car breaking down over the grapevine on the way there.
182680	187480	So I had to find a mechanic in Long Beach Saturday morning, paid him like $450 to fix
187480	188480	my car.
188480	189600	But they did do a lot on my car.
189600	193280	And then as I was driving home, one of the stinking lights came on again.
193280	197240	Something's wrong with something in the oil, and I would explain it, but it would bore
197240	198240	you to tears.
198240	201320	I've probably told like 50 different people about what's going on.
201320	204340	So needless to say, I couldn't rush home on Sunday, and I made it back late.
204340	206680	So unfortunately, we didn't have a show on Sunday.
206680	207980	And now this week, I'm sick.
207980	209240	So if it's not one thing, it's another.
209240	213920	And then we're starting late tonight, I mean, podcast listeners, you guys don't hear a difference.
213920	217580	But for those listening live tonight, we're about 15 minutes late because the Wi-Fi in
217580	220620	studio wasn't working and some of our computers couldn't get online.
220620	223000	So it's just February's broken.
223000	224000	I want a refund.
224000	225240	And then Jamie wasn't here two weeks ago.
225240	227040	I mean, February's just broken.
227040	228040	That's because I was sick.
228040	229040	I know.
229040	230040	It was nasty, too.
230040	232200	And then we're up against the Oscars tonight.
232200	233200	Yeah, fuck them.
233200	234200	Oscars suck.
234200	235200	But who cares?
235200	236200	Who cares about the Oscars?
236200	237200	It's not even a good name.
237200	239320	It's not got people sucking each other's, anyway.
239320	241360	Why do they call the Oscars anyway?
241360	242360	Who's Oscar?
242360	245280	It's the award, but it's actually the Academy Awards.
245280	247120	Yeah, you could probably read it on Wikipedia.
247120	249240	Why did they name it after somebody named Oscar?
249240	251080	I think it's short for something.
251080	252720	Oscar is short for something?
252720	254440	I don't know.
254440	256920	Let's just talk about our gaming week, shall we?
256920	258800	Let's be better than those Oscars.
258800	259800	How was your gaming week?
259800	262240	What games would you give an Oscar to this week, Dark Soccer?
262240	267200	Did some Half-Life 2 and lots of Ragnarok.
267200	271360	Now I have another character over 100.
271360	273360	Rebirth, by the way.
273360	274360	Addict.
274360	275360	So.
275360	285440	And I played, I looked at my copy of Imagine Babies, laughed and put it back up.
285440	289320	And then, although it spawned an interesting conversation about whether or not you could
289320	292080	raise them like Pokemon.
292080	296760	And I thought it was kind of silly.
296760	304420	And then there was also some more burnout going on in my house, but I think that Dan's
304420	305420	getting tired of it.
305420	310680	I think it'd be cool, though, if you could raise them like Pokemon and then have them
310680	312960	fight in underground baby cage matches.
312960	314680	That would be great.
314680	319920	It'd be like cockfighting, but with babies, put little razor blades on their feet.
319920	324280	The babies couldn't actually fight because they don't have any motor coordination when
324280	326000	they're that little.
326000	329040	That's why you pop them up on crack and then, you know.
329040	332320	You have a one-year-old battle when they're old enough to walk.
332320	333320	Yeah.
333320	338380	And then I played Wedding the Game, which was me just sitting there going, how much
338380	341400	more can I drink?
341400	343400	That's about it.
343400	346420	Let's see, this week I played a few things.
346420	351480	I got around to playing some Lost Odyssey, and that game is pretty awesome.
351480	356280	Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy VIII, just not necessarily, well, I guess a little bit
356280	360520	like the gameplay, but more of just the environment reminds me of Final Fantasy VIII.
360520	363660	But it's good, and I like the game.
363660	369960	And I played more Burnout, Paradise, because it's available, and I don't know.
369960	374480	Mainly this entire weekend, or actually the entire week for that matter, I've been trying
374480	381280	to get this other 360 of mine to work, and it's not three-ringed anymore, but it freezes
381280	384280	up every now and then.
384280	388680	It was freezing up after about 30 seconds when I take it to work, however before that
388680	390760	it would run for like nine hours straight.
390760	391760	Just fine.
391760	396320	So, I got really frustrated with that, but I think I may have figured out what it was.
396320	398040	Maybe it's allergic to your job.
398040	399560	No, well, I think it would be.
399560	407000	I had these screws in it that were too large, so it was causing the board to bend too much.
407000	409200	So I replaced them with some different stuff.
409200	416520	I did a 12-volt mod on the fan, and also put heat sinks on the different chips in there,
416520	421840	and made heat sinks out of pennies and aluminum tape for the bottom of the board.
421840	424840	So hopefully with all that stuff done, it should work.
424840	429540	If not, I've already soldered in a fan connector for additional fans, and I just found my own
429540	436840	Dremel today, so I can cut the case open to put a 120mm fan on it.
436840	439720	Other things I've been playing.
439720	445040	I actually was trying out, and we'll get to some of this stuff later, the XNA community
445040	449460	games, and they had a few that were pretty cool, some that really sucked.
449460	452120	One of which that was pretty cool was the dishwasher.
452120	453800	I knew it would be the dishwasher.
453800	454800	That game was awesome.
454800	459040	The minute I played that game, I was like, this is Loki's dream game right here.
459040	463880	This is not my dream game, but it totally could be a TV series or something like that.
463880	465480	It was just really, really cool.
465480	467520	Something you would see on Adult Swim.
467520	470120	But absolutely bloody game.
470120	473920	It kind of reminds me a little bit also of Alien Hominid or something like that.
473920	475800	That's the exact same thing I thought.
475800	476920	That's so funny.
476920	482040	But less shooting, more slashing with swords and stuff.
482040	489280	Other things I tried, I tried Gummy Car or Jelly Car, where the fuck it was called.
489280	490440	It was okay.
490440	495440	I didn't really, I mean it was a neat idea, but not executed too well.
495440	500040	You know what makes Jelly Car hilarious is when you realize that all the noises or some
500040	505280	guy doing it in his microphone, like, boop boop boop boop boop, meow meow meow meow.
505280	506280	That's great.
506280	507280	I'm sorry.
507280	508880	I laughed my ass off playing Jelly Car.
508880	513640	It's very customizable, with its little completely different looks, like you can play the blueprint
513640	517320	looking things or the, you can kind of completely change the look of the game and the options.
517320	518320	Check it out.
518320	519320	Oh, I didn't even play with the options.
519320	521760	Oh yeah, you can mess with the options and make the game look completely different.
521760	522760	It's great.
522760	523760	That's cool.
523760	525240	Other than that though, it was alright.
525240	528920	Some of the levels seemed kind of broken, but whatever.
528920	532040	Then there was Culture, which was neat.
532040	536800	I don't know, it's an interesting puzzle game, I guess, with flowers.
536800	537920	Pretty flowers.
537920	545000	And then, gosh, I played that, was it Little Gamers, I think it was called?
545000	546100	That was okay.
546100	549480	That's actually just based off of a webcomic, I guess.
549480	555520	And it was okay, but it just reminded me a lot of, like, there wasn't a lot of movement
555520	556520	or dodging you can do.
556520	561120	It was just kind of shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, and very bloody.
561120	563560	But hey, that's cool.
563560	567980	And I don't know, that was pretty much it though.
567980	571160	There were some games that they showed off at Game Developers Conference that I wish
571160	579240	were on there, like iSheep or, what was it, there was a dancing one, like a breakdancing
579240	580240	thing.
580240	583320	Now, wait a minute, did you, and I'm sorry, I ran in the house and you were talking about
583320	586680	your game a week, but I didn't hear anything about N. Didn't you play N this week on X
586680	587680	Motion Life?
587680	588680	No.
588680	589680	I thought you loved that game.
589680	593440	I love N, but I haven't gotten a chance to download it, and I really, I mean, I've played
593440	599000	it before, so, you know, it's not, it's not like I'm, I don't know, I don't know what
599000	600000	it is.
600000	604320	Also, finally, I was going to say I played Space Invaders Extreme, I actually was playing
604320	607740	that this afternoon, and awesome game.
607740	611240	Really needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game or something like that, and it's coming out
611240	615840	the DS and on PSP as well, so, absolutely cool.
615840	619600	All the stuff in the game kind of goes with the music, like when you're firing and stuff,
619600	623640	it's all in time with the music, and, you know, stuff kind of remixes a little bit,
623640	625720	a little like Musaguchi and stuff.
625720	629240	They have little bonus things that go in there, plus the backgrounds are all really flashy
629240	630240	and stuff.
630240	631360	It'll be cool.
631360	634120	Definitely worth picking up when it comes out.
634120	635760	So you're all done with your gaming week?
635760	636760	Yes.
636760	641400	Then I will move on to mine, because I just want to say I did play N this week on Xbox
641400	645360	360, and it was kind of cool, well, at least I should clarify, I only played the demo,
645360	649280	I didn't play the full version, I don't want to give the false impression or anything,
649280	653400	but I played the demo of N, because I remember Loki spoke very highly of this game, and I
653400	657560	remember playing it a little bit on the free web thing or whatever.
657560	661380	Here's the problem I had with N, is that I played it after I played those Xbox community
661380	664560	games, and I was kind of playing it going, you know what, I don't think I want to spend
664560	668360	$10 on this, especially after just playing those other things that are potentially, I
668360	671440	mean I guess we don't know much about pricing, I think we'll get into it later in the show,
671440	675520	but potentially these other games are going to be free or, you know, very low cost.
675520	679220	And if you haven't tried those Xbox Live community games, I recommend doing that, since they
679220	681400	are timed demos.
681400	686000	But I think, and it's kind of fun, I just think $800 is the wrong price point, I think
686000	689120	$400 would have been a little more appropriate, I probably would have bought it for $400,
689120	694160	especially when you consider it's based off a free web game, just, I don't know, I feel
694160	698800	like I've played a lot of free games on the web like it, although there's a certain sense
698800	702800	of humor to N that I think is really funny, like I watch, I like watching a little stick
702800	707440	guy get blown to bits, and it certainly has a very, you know, kind of action pace, I just,
707440	711280	I don't know, in this day of those microtransactions, you really kind of think about every point,
711280	714200	and I just don't think it was worth $800.
714200	719520	Something that was money well spent, I am madly in love with Lost Odyssey, this is the
719520	723580	game I have totally been waiting for on the 360, and I know, you know, I'm going to admit,
723580	727600	I am kind of biased, well I don't want to say I'm biased, but I definitely have a preference
727600	731520	towards Japanese RPGs, that's no big secret, those are the type of games I like, I don't
731520	736400	play a lot of sports games, I like these type of games, and so, you know, the Xbox 360 has
736400	742240	been sorely lacking in this department, we've had Blue Dragon, which was, eh, it was okay,
742240	748360	but it wasn't great, it was a good game, not a great game, and then we had Enchanted Arms,
748360	753120	same thing, decent, I think better than a lot of people gave it credit for, but it started
753120	757960	to get a little monotonous towards the end, Lost Odyssey, I'm loving it, like, it's tearing
757960	761760	me away from wow, which is saying something, you know, because you hear about how much
761760	766160	I've been playing World of Warcraft lately and doing this stuff, I cannot put down Lost
766160	769840	Odyssey, and it's funny because I've been reading reviews, because I'm kind of curious,
769840	772440	I usually don't read a lot of reviews on the internet, but I was kind of curious what the
772440	776200	critics think of Lost Odyssey, and I was very surprised to see on Metacritic that the game
776200	780040	only has like a 76 or something like that, I am shocked!
780040	786040	This is like an old school RPG, you know, it's so old, everyone's complaining that it's
786040	791040	like very old, but yet when you go back to the RPGs of the past, like all the Final Fantasy
791040	795520	games, they really didn't change much between each other, and you don't have to innovate
795520	799920	on something, don't try and reinvent it if it's good in the first place.
799920	804640	And here, here's a comment in chat I have to respond to, chat.orgiliterator.com, rawstealut
804640	808560	says, so Sky likes games that are all the same, no, that's your perception of these
808560	812480	types of games, I look at sports games, I look at these Madden games, and I go, pfft,
812480	815080	they're all the same to me, these games are all the same.
815080	818920	It's the story that go along with it, I mean it's not necessarily the combat and stuff,
818920	823760	it's just kind of, yeah, it's fun, or you know, it's grinding or whatever, but, um...
823760	829200	You know, and I've heard people say it reminded them too much of Final Fantasy, and I'll admit,
829200	833160	there's a lot in this game that reminds me of Final Fantasy X, I wouldn't call it Final
833160	837480	Fantasy VIII because it has a good combat system on like VIII, Final Fantasy X it really
837480	838480	reminds me of.
838480	839480	I like the combat system.
839480	842960	And you know, it does, it innovates it on it enough, where like, I love the ring thing
842960	846680	because it makes you pay attention to kind of what's going on, you know, to make sure
846680	852760	you get the perfect hits and all that stuff, and the game is just gorgeous, it is like
852760	859240	playing a Final Fantasy type game on a next-gen system, but without a whiny, spiky-haired
859240	863120	guy as the lead character, instead you get more of a, you know, badass, not gonna talk
863120	864120	type guy.
864120	867120	Besides, I don't know if you heard, and I'm pretty sure this is not in the show role,
867120	872840	but Final Fantasy XIII, what, Spring 2010 is when they said?
872840	875160	So I'm glad we have games like this to hold this over.
875160	876160	Exactly.
876160	881420	You know, if you enjoy Japanese RPGs in the slightest, you are doing yourself a disservice
881420	883800	by not at least checking out Lost Odyssey.
883800	887960	Don't listen to reviewers, because their big complaints are, they don't like these type
887960	892600	of games in the first place, which, fine, this game is not gonna win you over to the
892600	897680	Japanese RPG world, it's not, so, you know, if you already, if you don't like the Final
897680	899160	Fantasy games, you're not gonna like this.
899160	904240	That's why they have places that rent games, because, you know, just because one guy doesn't
904240	908560	like it doesn't mean you should base your opinion on that one guy, I mean, you know,
908560	913240	some of these reviews I read are just like, oh, well, this game's been done so many times,
913240	914240	that's why I hate it.
914240	915240	No?
915240	916240	Well, who cares?
916240	917240	Action movies.
917240	919080	Oh my god, it's an action movie with guns in it.
919080	921680	Oh, should I not go see it, because this one had guns too?
921680	923240	It's just beautiful to watch.
923240	927440	My roommate who doesn't play a lot of games, you know, he's, the game he's been playing
927440	931120	a lot lately is Cold Sep Saga, that's the one game he's been getting really into lately,
931120	935600	because he likes the more puzzle-type games, but he's been watching me play Lost Odyssey,
935600	939080	and he's always kind of, like, appreciated the Fantasy games too, and he's just like,
939080	940080	this game is outstanding.
940080	944880	He's just like, the way it moves, and we were kind of talking about it, the fluidity of
944880	952000	the game and the way the battle systems just look gorgeous, the in-game battles are phenomenal.
952000	958680	So I totally like this game, I love this game, you know, and I will kind of put this out
958680	962320	there as a disclaimer, I'm only about eight hours in, I haven't had a chance to really
962320	963380	fully immerse myself.
963380	968180	It could be one of those games that gets shitty and monotonous as it goes on, that is a possibility,
968180	972160	but for right now, I'm saying there's money well spent, and I fully enjoy the eight hours
972160	975000	I've put in so far, which is more than some games I've dropped six months on.
975000	980360	My only gripe in the game is these dreams that you have, which are basically reading
980360	985040	a bunch of text, and there's no real cutscene, I would think with a game that, you know,
985040	990040	is four to slong, that they would at least do some sort of cutscene with the in-game
990040	991040	engine.
991040	995840	It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, that detail or something, but seriously,
995840	1000640	I don't want to read, you know, all this stuff in the game, and I know it's optional to get
1000640	1001800	some of the backstory stuff, but...
1001800	1002800	You know what's funny?
1002800	1003800	Have you actually read it, though?
1003800	1004800	Have you actually read it?
1004800	1005800	I have read it.
1005800	1011080	I thought the writing was amazing in those little stories, and I kind of get it, though,
1011080	1015320	I think I would like to see maybe a little more of the animation side, but I don't know,
1015320	1019000	there's something about that whole using your imagination book thing, you know, that you
1019000	1020560	don't really see in video games.
1020560	1021560	I don't know.
1021560	1022560	I kind of don't mind.
1022560	1027000	Like, if they did the cutscenes more like, you know, folklore a little bit, where it's
1027000	1030360	actually like a comic book and stuff, in fact, that's how I remember they were describing
1030360	1035000	the cutscenes in, or at least the dreams and stuff in this game, and there is actually
1035000	1039200	a part where you do have a dream, and it is a cutscene, that kind of thing, but I would
1039200	1043480	have appreciated it more like that, you know, it doesn't even have to be anything, it'd
1043480	1046760	be just still pictures or whatever, just a little bit more effort put into it other than
1046760	1048920	just having text.
1048920	1052220	One more fangasm over this game and then I promise I'll shut up, and you can send your
1052220	1058120	emails about what a fanboy I am, okay, the voice acting in this game is actually really
1058120	1062580	good, and I'm using the English soundtrack, shock and awe, like, English voice acting
1062580	1067160	in these games is usually pretty terrible, but I actually think it's very well voice
1067160	1073440	acted so far, I am, I'm like, just shocked, so, and my roommate had said the same thing,
1073440	1077220	he's like, wow, the voice acting is actually pretty good, the comic relief guy especially
1077220	1082000	is pretty funny, and I, just the way the cutscenes are done, all the comic book stars are, I
1082000	1086300	could sit here for an hour and have a fangasm about how wonderful I think Lost Odyssey is,
1086300	1090080	but I'm gonna play it more, and I'll let you know if it starts sucking, okay, I'll keep
1090080	1093800	an open mind about it, but, whatever, I'm totally fanboy over this game, I'll admit
1093800	1094800	it.
1094800	1098320	I've also been playing the same XNA games that Loki earlier spoke of, and I'll wait
1098320	1103340	for more thoughts on that when we get to the stories tonight, otherwise I've been playing
1103340	1104340	Wow!
1104340	1107240	X-Saga as well, I mentioned that a little earlier, my roommate's been playing a lot
1107240	1112560	of that, but I have two, just a real different kind of game, still think they could've pulled
1112560	1117300	it off on Xbox Live Arcade and it would've been better suited for that, but, it's kinda
1117300	1120900	one of those games that's really hard to put down, but, I, seriously, rounds in Cold
1120900	1126440	Step Saga can go on for like an hour and a half, it's crazy, but I'm having a good time.
1126440	1131040	I guess I'll do it for my gaming week, I don't have a lot else to share, so, then let's get
1131040	1138880	to tonight's housekeeping, we wanted to formally apologize for last week's show, or lack thereof,
1138880	1143240	you know, what can we say, get what you pay for, it's a free show, so sorry, and we're
1143240	1146360	here tonight, and actually, I gotta admit, tonight we're only gonna do a short show,
1146360	1150200	we're gonna do like, just one part, there's not gonna be part A, part B, just because
1150200	1155720	of the fact I'm sick, I'm having a hard time being here, any other week, probably would've
1155720	1158980	just canceled it, but we didn't wanna go two weeks without a show, because consistency
1158980	1164280	is important, and a lot of, not a lot, but sometimes I've been asked by other podcasters
1164280	1168200	like what, you know, because we've been doing this for like, we've been podcasting ever
1168200	1171600	since, you know, it was first out pretty much, and we've been doing internet radio for six
1171600	1174400	years and people say, you know, what's your trick, what do you do to keep listeners, I'm
1174400	1179760	always like consistency, it's all about consistency, if you're not consistent, then people will
1179760	1182840	go look elsewhere, I mean, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, because there's lots
1182840	1186360	of great independent shows out there, but that's how you lose listeners, is that if
1186360	1190280	you're inconsistent, then people look elsewhere to fill in time, so I hate, I hate missing
1190280	1196620	a show, but it had to be done, so, that's that, otherwise, you can join our Myspace
1196620	1200560	community at Orange Launch Radio, our Facebook community is the OLRME, and our LiveJournal
1200560	1205460	community is Orange Launch, one other thing I wanna plug, completely has nothing to do
1205460	1209880	with video games, but it's another passion of mine, something I've been getting into
1209880	1216320	over the past six months is these ORGs, these online reality games, where people play games
1216320	1221680	based on reality shows on web forums, if that makes sense, there's a lot of strategy involved,
1221680	1225460	if you're like into the strategical thinking that goes behind a lot of shows, such as like
1225460	1229680	Survivor and Big Brother and all those, you know, types of shows that are on TV, these
1229680	1233040	games are a lot of fun, and I've met a lot of really interesting people playing them,
1233040	1237600	I am gonna be hosting a game on LiveJournal, I'm actually co-hosting with somebody you
1237600	1241400	might recognize from this show, Shane, so if you want more information on that, we're
1241400	1245000	looking for some new players, people that might be into this, so if this sounds like
1245000	1248700	something you might be into, it's certainly much different from a video game, but check
1248700	1254360	it out, we're taking applications right now, it's SurvivorLJ, just ran that all together,
1254360	1260440	SurvivorLJ.LiveJournal.com, so there you go, I hope some of you guys will check that out,
1260440	1264360	maybe sign up to play, LiveJournal's free and all that good stuff, you do have to have
1264360	1267840	a LiveJournal account to play, but they're all like free, and many of us use it, and
1267840	1269480	we've been on there for a long time.
1269480	1273640	Okay, I will shut up now and do some video game news, actually I'm not gonna shut up
1273640	1276680	because I'm doing video game news, but I'll shut up about my personal life.
1276680	1279280	First off, I want to cover some things we missed last week since we didn't have a show
1279280	1284240	last week, some of the stories we missed last week, one of them is a rumor that Netflix
1284240	1289120	is soon going to be streaming to the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, and this is based
1289120	1293000	off some type of survey that Netflix has been conducting recently, and the question that
1293000	1296640	was in the survey was this, quote, if as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly
1296640	1301960	watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS3 or Xbox 360, how likely would you
1301960	1304480	or anyone in your household be able to do that?
1304480	1306840	Hmm, so who knows about that?
1306840	1313340	Rumor says that there could be a special Netflix disc that could cost as little as $3 will
1313340	1315000	enable this all to work.
1315000	1317320	So I don't know, this could be interesting.
1317320	1321320	It's not too incredibly surprising when you consider Netflix is already doing those PC
1321320	1326760	downloads where you can watch the movies if you have a Netflix account on your PC.
1326760	1330300	This seems like a logical next step, but then again, would Microsoft and Sony want to lose
1330300	1332400	those dollars if they could pocket themselves?
1332400	1335560	I don't know, but it would be a very formidable alliance.
1335560	1340940	EA is rumored to be working on The Sims 3, and this is actually not a rumor because that's
1340940	1346400	according to The Sims studio creative director Rod Humble, and this was on the forum called
1346400	1348400	Quarter to Three.
1348400	1353520	He says, Rod Humble says there will be new information soon.
1353520	1357400	In other news, Madden 2010, scheduled for next year.
1357400	1361640	I know, it's kind of obvious news when you think about it, but at the same time it's
1361640	1364400	been a while since I've heard anything about The Sims.
1364400	1368960	Anything that ever was kind of like Sims news was another expansion for an existing Sims
1368960	1369960	game.
1369960	1374600	They should have Sims 3 where I can import my Spore characters and attack the Sims characters.
1374600	1376040	Yet another way to kill Sims.
1376040	1380720	I would like to see if Sims 3 comes to light, maybe some type of link between the PC and
1380720	1381720	the consoles.
1381720	1382720	I don't know.
1382720	1387200	Maybe that's just the console fan in me, because The Sims is kind of at heart a PC game, even
1387200	1389920	though they've had all those spin-offs on systems and such.
1389920	1392560	The Sims is kind of a PC game, but it would be kind of neat.
1392560	1397200	I'm all about connectivity between all the crap I have and my friends have.
1397200	1400840	One other story we missed last week, which I think is kind of funny, there are some filmmakers
1400840	1407640	that are going to be producing a documentary about the E.T. landfill.
1407640	1412000	For a quote from the Auburn University students who are putting this together, quote, we are
1412000	1415360	proud to announce our upcoming documentary, E.T.'s March.
1415360	1419280	Over the course of a week this March, we will go on a road trip from Auburn, Alabama to
1419280	1420980	El Paso, Texas.
1420980	1425640	From there, we will take the actual path of those 14 trucks took that faithful day into
1425640	1428040	the heart of Alamogordo, New Mexico.
1428040	1431240	Along the way, we will take in the video game culture of our great country.
1431240	1435240	The documentary will be released for free via the internet this summer.
1435240	1437140	I almost went to school there.
1437140	1441440	I think it's kind of interesting that they're going to make a whole documentary about this.
1441440	1445800	Of course, video game documentaries, King of Kong did very well.
1445800	1446800	Who knows?
1446800	1447800	The DVD should be out now, I think.
1447800	1448800	It is out.
1448800	1449800	I still haven't seen it.
1449800	1450800	I haven't.
1450800	1451800	I still haven't seen it.
1451800	1452800	I need to borrow it.
1452800	1453800	It's an interesting watch.
1453800	1454800	I need Netflix it or something.
1454800	1455800	I really want to see it.
1455800	1457160	I feel like I'm totally missing something.
1457160	1458160	I'll loan it.
1458160	1459160	Okay, cool.
1459160	1461200	I'll also loan you this other one I have that's really stupid.
1461200	1470120	It's about the first, they claim they're the first ever internet radio show about games.
1470120	1472000	It's uber stupid.
1472000	1473000	I actually watch the DVD.
1473000	1474440	It's a game review show.
1474440	1475440	It's lame.
1475440	1476440	Oh, whatever.
1476440	1480480	Let's get to this week's news.
1480480	1482760	That's all I really want to touch on from last week.
1482760	1485720	Last week, actually, ironically enough, was a little bit of a slow news week because this
1485720	1489820	week we started getting into Game Developers Conference and some big bombshells dropped
1489820	1490820	at GDC.
1490820	1491820	Correct?
1491820	1492820	Yes.
1492820	1495760	Unfortunately, this year they didn't have keynotes from a bunch of other people like
1495760	1499600	Nintendo and Sony and stuff like that, but Microsoft was there and they were doing their
1499600	1500600	keynote.
1500600	1504360	Their big thing they announced, of course, was the Xbox Live Community Arcade.
1504360	1511540	It will be kind of an easy way for people that develop games in XNA to share their games
1511540	1513080	with the world.
1513080	1518120	It'll allow people that are members of, I think, live, I'm not sure if it's just the
1518120	1525080	XNA community, to rate their games and basically give feedback and that kind of stuff.
1525080	1532360	Also, they will be able to sell their games or offer them free and that kind of stuff.
1532360	1534320	Tons and tons and tons of stuff out there.
1534320	1539320	Of course, they said, now 10 million people on Xbox Live get to play your game.
1539320	1541420	It's all user created content.
1541420	1548560	They put up a brief sampling of about nine games or so on there, including some of what
1548560	1554740	we talked about, Jelly Car and Dishwasher and stuff like that.
1554740	1558920	Pretty cool stuff and very exciting, especially if you're into game development and stuff
1558920	1559920	in XNA.
1559920	1563360	As far as I'm aware, I think the software is free and all you have to do is pay for
1563360	1566680	the membership if you want to upload your games, $100 a year.
1566680	1570960	So if you're really interested in that stuff, I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will probably all
1570960	1572800	over this kind of thing.
1572800	1577360	I seem to recall he was creating some type of Crazy Eights game from what I was following
1577360	1578640	on a show, but who knows?
1578640	1581480	Now maybe that he'll be able to post it to the world, he might finish that up.
1581480	1582480	I don't know.
1582480	1583480	I'll have to ask him.
1583480	1584960	It'll be a little while.
1584960	1590720	And then, of course, other things that they announced to go along with that is that you
1590720	1593920	will finally be able to game on your Zune as well.
1593920	1597880	They're going to allow XNA games to come to the Zune and you'll be able to play them kind
1597880	1602840	of similar to playing stuff on an iPod or something like that.
1602840	1606720	And they said, of course, XNA Zune games can also support custom soundtracks since it is
1606720	1613800	an MP3 player and you'll be able to take your games from Windows to Xbox to Zune.
1613800	1617440	And you haven't really announced anything else additional to that.
1617440	1619520	Now, I don't know if it's just me.
1619520	1621920	This news is fucking huge, this news.
1621920	1622920	This is huge.
1622920	1630120	I think a lot of us saw this coming, but I kind of see this as kind of a turning point
1630120	1634600	in gaming and I think this is what is going to set the Xbox 360 really apart from its
1634600	1636120	competitors right now.
1636120	1637120	You know what I mean?
1637120	1638120	Well, they said also...
1638120	1639120	I think this is huge news.
1639120	1643360	They said at the end of this year they're going to have 1,000 games on Xbox 360 and
1643360	1647120	that's not including the Xbox Live community games.
1647120	1649040	You know what this is?
1649040	1652000	This is YouTube, but with video games.
1652000	1654480	Yeah, it's YouTube of games that they were...
1654480	1656480	And that's kind of what it's going to turn into.
1656480	1662160	And I know people's opinions is that a lot of the user stuff is crap.
1662160	1664920	You know, a lot of user-made stuff is crap and you look on YouTube and yeah, a lot of
1664920	1665920	YouTube is crap.
1665920	1668480	There's 14-year-old girls doing their blogs and shit.
1668480	1669480	No one wants to watch that.
1669480	1672200	I understand that a lot of it's crap, but you know, at the same time I think these people
1672200	1673200	are actually...
1673200	1674200	I mean, YouTube is free.
1674200	1677640	Any idiot with a camera can go and shoot something and throw it up on YouTube.
1677640	1681360	This you actually pay membership, you know, you have to have the tools to develop the
1681360	1682360	games and stuff like that.
1682360	1684500	You have to be somewhat intelligent to even do this.
1684500	1688140	It's not an easy thing to just throw something together and put it on there and stuff.
1688140	1691240	I would be really interested to see this stuff on here because a lot of it is going to be
1691240	1692240	independent games.
1692240	1695200	You're going to have people that are developing some of these free web games to put it on
1695200	1698280	there now and they can make a little bit of money off of it and that kind of stuff.
1698280	1703000	I think that's great and also at the same time, it's something that Sony or Nintendo
1703000	1706540	doesn't have that they can brag about.
1706540	1708940	This is something you can play these games if you want.
1708940	1714460	They're optional, obviously, but on top of the two games that we get released each week
1714460	1717500	on Xbox Live Arcade, now you're going to have a ton of these games that are going to be
1717500	1721000	available on there and yes, some of them will be crap, but you know what?
1721000	1723280	That's why you can do your research out there.
1723280	1728060	Obviously, they will not be requiring demos, I don't think, for these things, but some
1728060	1737980	of them will have demos available so you can test them out and plus also read the ratings.
1737980	1744680	For those that say that the user-created games are crap, fucking go check out that Dishwasher
1744680	1746480	game and the Jelly Car game.
1746480	1751180	Put it next to some of the things that they're actually charging money for on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1751180	1755340	They've got some crappy games on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.
1755340	1758760	There is certainly some good stuff that can come of this, absolutely, and there's a lot
1758760	1763040	of great independent games that, you know, so I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot
1763040	1765520	of crap that you're going to have to weed through, but I think this whole community
1765520	1769260	kind of aspect of it where it's the peer review, I think that's kind of a smart way to kind
1769260	1770260	of weed it out.
1770260	1771260	Not everything independent is crap either.
1771260	1774660	I mean, look at, you know, N Plus started off as an independent game.
1774660	1779040	You have two Mickey Fighters, that started off as an independent game.
1779040	1782640	You have, you know, Everyday Shooter.
1782640	1787340	Just a ton of stuff out there that, you know, was independent stuff is now becoming mainstream
1787340	1789060	and it's not bad.
1789060	1794200	It's just, you know, a lot of times it costs a lot of these people a lot of money to develop
1794200	1797920	these games and if they don't have a lot of money to put into them, they can't, you know,
1797920	1798920	get a wide release for them.
1798920	1802660	Now, this is allowing people that may not have the funds to advertise their game or
1802660	1806880	do anything like that to do a lot smaller scale and, you know, advertise their stuff
1806880	1810760	on websites and that kind of thing and then throw it on this, you know, community arcade
1810760	1815220	and have a lot of people actually get to play their game instead of just not ever hearing
1815220	1816220	about it.
1816220	1820060	And I do think that the fact that these games are going to be playable on Zune, I think
1820060	1824140	that's huge too because I think Microsoft can really be positioning themselves to do
1824140	1826260	a game handheld if they want.
1826260	1831220	Imagine if Microsoft releases a portable gaming handheld, not necessarily a Zune, but something
1831220	1835580	that is more along, you know, is strictly a gaming machine, imagine they release it
1835580	1840200	and they support XNA on this handheld, boom, this thing comes out, it instantly supports
1840200	1845560	thousands of games that you can get, I mean, that's what I think is big and I kind of see
1845560	1850440	like this could be Microsoft positioning the chess pieces and kind of seeing how much this
1850440	1852180	takes off.
1852180	1854460	How many people do this and put this on their Zune?
1854460	1857060	How many kind of get into this whole thing?
1857060	1861760	So I kind of think this is big news and we're really looking down the next couple years
1861760	1862760	of gaming.
1862760	1868540	Maybe I'm running around screaming like a lunatic cultist, which is fine, but I think
1868540	1871700	this is huge and I look forward to seeing some of the games that are going to come out
1871700	1872700	from this.
1872700	1877700	What do you think they would call it if they did a Microsoft handheld?
1877700	1879940	A Microsoft handheld system?
1879940	1880940	Yeah.
1880940	1889120	The, not the Xbox, but the X brick, no, I don't know, I have no idea, X game, I have
1889120	1890120	no idea.
1890120	1895360	It could be like the X paper, I don't know.
1895360	1897740	Paper, rock, scissors, I don't know.
1897740	1898740	X book says frisbee.
1898740	1899740	That's kind of funny.
1899740	1901120	Yes, make it sound like a Mac product.
1901120	1902120	There you go.
1902120	1904160	I'd sell it.
1904160	1907160	You never know.
1907160	1909480	What about something like Xbox Go?
1909480	1913420	Something really quick to the point, Xbox Go, doesn't that make you, doesn't that kind
1913420	1917860	of have the ring of, hey, it's an Xbox product, but you go and you take it places.
1917860	1919740	I think that's a fine name.
1919740	1922980	I'm going to trademark that name right now so Microsoft can't use it.
1922980	1923980	Just kidding.
1923980	1930620	Well, I have some interesting news, and you know, everybody, well, for the most part loves
1930620	1931620	Portal.
1931620	1936620	It's been a big, big internet phenomenon, especially with that psychotic song at the
1936620	1943020	end of the game that's so funny, but that song, Still Alive, is going to be in a rock
1943020	1945860	band.
1945860	1948260	That's cool.
1948260	1950380	This was a triumph.
1950380	1952060	Now we've got to get Mo back.
1952060	1953060	Yeah.
1953060	1955260	You realize we've got to download this song.
1955260	1957220	See, we've got a whole band going right here.
1957220	1958780	Loki can play the drums.
1958780	1959780	You enjoy bass, right?
1959780	1960780	You can play bass.
1960780	1961780	I'll play whatever guitar.
1961780	1963860	Actually, I usually play the drums when we play at the house.
1963860	1965340	Well, then you two can fight over it.
1965340	1966340	I don't really care.
1966340	1967540	I'll play regular guitar.
1967540	1968540	I'm just not singing.
1968540	1970700	Well, Mo can sing because she's got a pretty voice.
1970700	1973900	She can do the singing, and we'll have ourselves a little OLR house band.
1973900	1974900	It'll be fun.
1974900	1976180	And you know what?
1976180	1980860	Maybe by the time that comes out, we'll have the rock band stage kit, and we can have the
1980860	1982860	smoke and the lights.
1982860	1983860	Hell yeah.
1983860	1984860	Rob almost snorted his coffee.
1984860	1986740	Are you really wasting money on that stage kit?
1986740	1989980	I want to get it because it sounds so stupid that I have to get it.
1989980	1991620	It's one of those things.
1991620	1992940	I'm not spending money on it.
1992940	1995460	I'll use store credit, obviously.
1995460	1999460	That is money that you could spend on something more better.
1999460	2000460	More better.
2000460	2002460	Yes, more better.
2002460	2003740	Okay.
2003740	2004740	I'm sick.
2004740	2006620	Leave me alone.
2006620	2008380	I spend money on stupid things, though.
2008380	2009380	I don't know.
2009380	2012580	I'll have to look at it to see what it is, because if it's something really retarded,
2012580	2014260	I don't know if it works out.
2014260	2015540	Now the chat room is up in arms.
2015540	2016540	Loki must sing.
2016540	2017540	Loki must sing.
2017540	2018540	Can I finish my story?
2018540	2019540	Loki must play vocals.
2019540	2020540	Yes, you may.
2020540	2021540	Okay.
2021540	2027660	Well, it was also stated, though, that they've confirmed that another portal is in the works.
2027660	2032540	In fact, the words Portal 2 were actually used.
2032540	2037260	In other news, Madden 2010, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts III, and all these other
2037260	2038260	games confirmed.
2038260	2042500	Well, here's the thing about, you know, the Portal 2 thing.
2042500	2046260	It was kind of like, you know, her comment was, oh, I think that they've announced this
2046260	2047260	already.
2047260	2050460	She didn't say that, you know, they have, but obviously they're going to make a Portal
2050460	2051460	2, duh.
2051460	2054580	I mean, oh my god, a sequel to a game that made a lot of money?
2054580	2055580	Hmm.
2055580	2058900	I always think it's funny that it was a throwaway to begin with, pretty much, wasn't it?
2058900	2062220	I mean, it was more of a nod to an old project.
2062220	2063220	Yeah, really.
2063220	2065860	Well, I think it's because we all know it's coming.
2065860	2066860	Hello.
2066860	2071740	I mean, Portal, little game with not that big a budget, I don't think, has humongous
2071740	2077420	success and practically a cult following, duh, it's going to have a sequel.
2077420	2081580	It's kind of last year's Katamari Damacy.
2081580	2085540	Let's just hope they don't run it into the ground like they did Katamari.
2085540	2086540	That's my only concern.
2086540	2089500	Like, can too much Portal be too much of a good thing?
2089500	2090500	Absolutely.
2090500	2094340	Too much Portal when you're intoxicated is too much of a good thing.
2094340	2100180	I fully support Portal 2, but when we start getting, you know, Portal DS, Portal PSP,
2100180	2101180	Portal your brain out.
2101180	2103180	Could you imagine Portal DS?
2103180	2105940	Yeah, it would be all sorts of lame.
2105940	2112300	Yeah, no, I just stick to the formula that works, make little improvements as you need
2112300	2113580	to, that's fine.
2113580	2115940	How about multiplayer Portal?
2115940	2119340	There you go, might be kind of fun.
2119340	2121580	That would be a processing nightmare.
2121580	2125420	Just put a giant knife on the end of the Portal gun, there you go.
2125420	2126420	Yeah.
2126420	2127420	Portal deathmatch.
2127420	2128420	Giant bayonet.
2128420	2132460	Imagine what a Portal deathmatch would be like.
2132460	2133460	With no actual...
2133460	2134460	Confusing as hell.
2134460	2135780	With no actual weapon.
2135780	2141180	Of course, the comparison between Portal and Katamari leads AJ Mix in our chatroom to say,
2141180	2143180	me and my Portal.
2143180	2144180	That would be cute.
2144180	2149620	Active Dad says, Portal 5 Disney Edition.
2149620	2153020	Oh lordy.
2153020	2154020	We'll see what happens.
2154020	2157940	A game that I'm kind of looking forward to, strangely enough, Fable 2, even though the
2157940	2161020	first one kind of lost interest in that for a little while.
2161020	2162020	I'm all over this game.
2162020	2164260	I am all over some of these more recent announcements.
2164260	2168000	You know, I think this is great, and one of the huge things that they announced in Fable
2168000	2170820	2, co-op play.
2170820	2174620	It's pretty big for a somewhat role-playing adventure game.
2174620	2179900	You get co-op play, so if you and someone else own Fable 2, you can suddenly go into
2179900	2184660	their single-player world, do your thing, and then leave.
2184660	2185660	Kind of like the...
2185660	2186660	Do they spread rumors about them?
2186660	2187940	Well, the same idea, like in Crackdown.
2187940	2191260	If somebody's playing the game, you just kind of hop in and join, hello, and leave.
2191260	2198500	Well, the demo that they showed, actually, Jamie, the woman, or Peter's character, who
2198500	2202660	was a woman, her husband was kind of pissing this other guy off, so he shot him in the
2202660	2203660	head with a gun.
2203660	2204660	That's great.
2204660	2212140	And now, you know, his character's child or whatever will be put into an orphanage, seriously,
2212140	2214300	and you can visit and stuff.
2214300	2215300	That's crazy.
2215300	2219900	I just hope it's one of those things that doesn't sound really good, and then the execution
2219900	2220900	of it is kind of...
2220900	2223420	Because, like, to me, that was kind of the first Fable game.
2223420	2228180	I'm like, this sounds great, and then I played it, and I'm like, this plays mediocre.
2228180	2229180	It's going to be awesome.
2229180	2230700	I kind of hope that it's...
2230700	2236860	Yeah, I have very high hopes, so I'm hoping I'm not let down, but I am a little bit worried.
2236860	2241460	Also, you know, you have the little doggy companion that follows you and all that good
2241460	2249500	stuff, and also, this is big, Xbox Live mini-game that will interact with the full Fable 2 game.
2249500	2252580	In other words, I guess it's some type of, like, little gambling game that you can play,
2252580	2255760	and they're actually going to release this game a couple weeks before Fable 2 actually
2255760	2259540	hits shelves, so you can actually start building gold in the gambling game that you will be
2259540	2260940	able to spend in Fable 2.
2260940	2263300	Yeah, it's a game that they had in the first Fable game.
2263300	2270180	It was called Keystones, like, compared to Craps meets Roulette, and yeah, you can earn
2270180	2272220	lots of money and be rich and stuff.
2272220	2276180	What's also cool, though, when you're doing co-op, you actually earn experience, and you
2276180	2280900	split your golden items, and when you're, like, introducing someone into the co-op game,
2280900	2283040	you can decide on what the split is going to be like.
2283040	2286740	If you want to, say, for example, help someone out, you could give them 100% of the gold
2286740	2292820	and 100% of, you know, item drops or whatever, or you can do 50-50, so that's kind of neat.
2292820	2296780	What would happen, though, if a really high-level advanced character came into your world and
2296780	2298820	gave you an Uber sword?
2298820	2301900	Is there anything to safeguard the game from essentially cheating like that?
2301900	2305340	I don't know about that, but, you know, if it's like some Final Fantasy games, you can
2305340	2310020	only be, you have to be a certain level before you can use, you know, X sword, but yeah,
2310020	2311020	I mean, sure, why not.
2311020	2312540	Anything back to the first Fable, it's been so long.
2312540	2315780	It's what we did in Crackdown, you know, someone would come in with a rocket launcher and give
2315780	2318560	it to you, and there you go, now you have a rocket launcher, it makes the game a hell
2318560	2320620	lot easier, so.
2320620	2327460	Well, I'm looking forward to this game and checking it out, that's pretty cool, and I,
2327460	2331000	it's kind of funny, the whole Xbox Live connection, you know what it reminds me of?
2331000	2336220	It reminds me of the Pocket Station, like, remember Chocobo Breeding and Final, or, it
2336220	2339780	wasn't Chocobo Breeding, it was some type of, like, raise your Chocobo, like, a Tamagotchi
2339780	2343140	type thing that you could have on a little Pocket Station for Final Fantasy VIII?
2343140	2344140	Yes.
2344140	2347420	Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that, but instead of something in your pocket on the go, it's
2347420	2348420	Xbox Live.
2348420	2351460	I don't know, I don't know, that's the comparison I get in my mind.
2351460	2354280	The great thing about the Pocket Station game is it'll play itself, so all you have to do
2354280	2359820	is just leave it on a Playstation system and just leave it, like, running for days at a
2359820	2360820	time.
2360820	2363340	Boom, you come back and you have, like, thousands of items.
2363340	2364340	Awesome.
2364340	2367700	Nice, well I'm looking forward to Fable 2.
2367700	2371700	Another game that's coming out here pretty soon in the US will be Wii Fit.
2371700	2376540	Nintendo has officially announced a date for it, it's going to be coming out May 19th,
2376540	2384060	and also around the same time the WiiWare service will be launching in the US, May 12th,
2384060	2388020	and they did have a press release and stuff, of course, you know, this game is insanely
2388020	2395880	popular in Japan right now, just absolutely selling millions of copies, and I'm sure we'll
2395880	2400180	do the same over here, just, you know, leave them to announce...
2400180	2403540	It's going to keep Wii Mania alive in soccer mom's households.
2403540	2406500	Yeah, yeah, yeah, just leave them to announce another...
2406500	2410500	See, I knew this was coming out this time, in fact, you know, I know when some other
2410500	2416840	games are coming out, but I can't say that, but yeah, Wii Fit's going to be doing awesome
2416840	2420740	and there'll be some other games before it that'll be even more awesome, so...
2420740	2424260	I'm looking in the chat room and, let's see, who called it Wii Fat?
2424260	2427500	Somebody called it Wii Fat, I think it was GS68, somebody...
2427500	2429420	It'd be like an eating game.
2429420	2435260	Yeah, eat as much as you can, then get on the balance board, and then I'm very happy
2435260	2439900	that we finally have a date for WiiWare, finally, kind of after all this speculation, oh, it's
2439900	2443660	going to be out last Christmas, oh, I guess first quarter, oh, second quarter, now we
2443660	2448220	have a date, so that's finally when Nintendo will kind of be, you know, showing us what
2448220	2449220	they have there.
2449220	2452500	Get on board with what everyone else has been doing for years already.
2452500	2457140	In a way, but, you know, I don't know, Nintendo often can surprise, you know, they can do
2457140	2461460	this shit later and sometimes surprise us, so we'll see, we'll see, it all depends on
2461460	2463460	the quality of the games, in my opinion.
2463460	2468140	Well, it's something else that they're enacting is something called, it's a payment service
2468140	2474940	called Wii Connection Pay and Play, so it's that you can buy the WiiWare stuff with Wii
2474940	2475940	Points.
2475940	2481300	I think that's kind of interesting, I mean, they say that there's already, you know, we've
2481300	2484420	got that with a virtual console, pretty much, but.
2484420	2488100	This is a little different, though, this is actually for online play in certain games,
2488100	2492900	you have to pay with Wii Points, and it's for download content and that kind of thing.
2492900	2493900	I've, I've.
2493900	2494900	That's what I was getting to.
2494900	2495900	Oh, go ahead.
2495900	2499260	That's okay, we've pretty much already said it.
2499260	2505420	I've heard this concept said before for what Xbox Live should have done, is that, especially
2505420	2509220	for these retro arcade titles that, you know, you play them once and you're kind of done,
2509220	2513360	like wouldn't it be nice if you actually only played a quarter to play Tron, or, oh, here's
2513360	2514360	a great example.
2514360	2518900	I love Tron, but Disks of Tron, that game gets old a little bit fast for me.
2518900	2522740	I don't know, it was one of those games that's better left in my memories of being a seven-year-old,
2522740	2529900	is Disks of Tron, so I wish I could have only paid 25 cents to play it once and then be
2529900	2534380	done with it, and not have it permanently for five dollars, if that makes sense.
2534380	2539420	So hearing that Nintendo might be adopting a model like this, that's kind of interesting
2539420	2540420	to me.
2540420	2543780	I don't really have a better word, but interesting.
2543780	2549900	Do you think that's a better price model, Dark Sakura, to do more pay-to-play?
2549900	2550900	It depends.
2550900	2555220	I think that there should be the option of having the full thing and then having the,
2555220	2559260	it should either be pay for all of it or pay-to-play.
2559260	2561660	Like a, give you a choice.
2561660	2565980	Gerardimo in chat asks a good question, says, but Rob, isn't that what the demos are for?
2565980	2569100	Kinda, but what if you can get really far on one quarter?
2569100	2571220	I mean, that's how the old-school arcades work.
2571220	2572980	Sometimes you're really good at the game naturally, you know?
2572980	2574780	I took this news as something totally different.
2574780	2578260	I thought that this was going to be, like, extended services that they're going to be
2578260	2582460	adding to, like, we say, for example, voice chat or something in a game, and you would
2582460	2586100	have to pay extra for that kind of thing, because they were saying that, I thought they
2586100	2593260	were saying that this was actually going to be used in disc-based games as well as, you
2593260	2599260	know, the WiiWare games and stuff, but I guess I read that wrong, I don't know.
2599260	2603140	Because I was understanding, you know, okay, their service kind of sucks right now as far
2603140	2607300	as what they have available online, and so some stuff they were going to add later on,
2607300	2610700	or in order to finance that, they were going to charge for some of the services, like,
2610700	2615180	say for example, you know, leaderboards or friends lists or something like that online,
2615180	2618820	similar, like, live services, but, oh well.
2618820	2626740	Well, one of the other things I was going to bring up is that there is the whole Nintendo
2626740	2633140	channel, we're supposed to be getting that over here and in Europe, which will let you
2633140	2638700	get to screenshots, videos of new games, play demos of DS titles, and then after you've
2638700	2643180	played for an hour, you can rate it, but you only, of course, do that through the Nintendo
2643180	2651540	channel, and it'll keep track of what you play, what you use to find new games, so it'll,
2651540	2658180	it's basically more like, it's like TiVo, I guess, for your games, you know, it sees
2658180	2663060	what types of games you've been looking into and says, well, here's others, you know.
2663060	2665780	That's kind of interesting.
2665780	2670900	And then the WiiWare games will be stored on the console and accessed through the channel
2670900	2674940	on the Wii menu, and you can store them on your SD cards.
2674940	2680340	You'll get manuals online, too, from the Wii Shop channel, so you can check them out so
2680340	2686620	that you know what you're paying for before you do it.
2686620	2690780	And you can only get them, of course, through your Wi-Fi connection, and they're, again,
2690780	2693460	going to be based on, like, what you like.
2693460	2700380	Another thing that they're launching in Japan that we're probably not going to get is another
2700380	2705780	type of channel that shows TV program listings so that you can see what you want to watch.
2705780	2710420	I mean, then again, we basically already have that already built into cable, you know.
2710420	2711420	TV Guide channel.
2711420	2713420	Yeah, the TV Guide channel.
2713420	2718000	But, and it doesn't really say anything else about that, but they're saying that they're
2718000	2720700	not going to bring it out anywhere else yet.
2720700	2721700	Huh.
2721700	2722700	Interesting.
2722700	2727500	Yeah, I doubt we're going to get that, since I think it's all for Japanese channels anyways,
2727500	2730780	unless we really care what's on Japanese TV, I don't know.
2730780	2733780	You know, between everything Jamie's saying here about what's coming to the Wii and what
2733780	2736540	we were talking about earlier with the XNA Creators Club, this is going to be a really
2736540	2738220	big year for digital distribution.
2738220	2742580	And then if the Netflix thing turns out to be true, this is a big, big year for download
2742580	2743580	stuff.
2743580	2745300	I think that's the way everything's going.
2745300	2747080	I think we've all known that for quite some time.
2747080	2748080	This is kind of interesting.
2748080	2749660	To see it actually happen?
2749660	2750660	Yes.
2750660	2751660	Yeah.
2751660	2752660	Yeah.
2752660	2754420	It's one thing to talk about, and it's one thing to see how it plays out, if that makes
2754420	2755420	sense.
2755420	2761580	Well, I'm also curious to see how the Wii Balance Board plays out, and apparently, according
2761580	2766780	to Reggie Fils-Aime, over 10 Wii Balance Board games are in development.
2766780	2770700	The most common problem with a peripheral, they come out, there's only one or two games
2770700	2771700	for it.
2771700	2774940	If that game fails, the whole damn peripheral fails, they obey the bots, it feels like they
2774940	2776260	wasted their money.
2776260	2781600	Now it seems like, you know, when these peripherals come out, a company's throwing a lot of money
2781600	2785200	behind it to try and make them take off, and that's certainly one thing that they're doing
2785200	2787260	with the Wii Balance Board.
2787260	2790220	Maybe the fact that it's already done so well in Japan helps, who knows?
2790220	2795700	But Reggie Fils-Aime commented in something he was speaking to with IGN, he said, quote,
2795700	2799740	there are over 10 games in development that take advantage of the Balance Board.
2799740	2803740	All we know so far would be Wii Fit, and then the skiing game that Namco's putting out,
2803740	2805200	but who knows what else?
2805200	2808700	Could it be that the other Wii Balance Board games are some of these download titles that
2808700	2810340	you'll be able to play?
2810340	2812060	Or another WarioWare game?
2812060	2815180	Oh, I bet a WarioWare game's a given, actually.
2815180	2817700	That's a good thought.
2817700	2824780	To kind of go back to that last story we were talking about, Nintendo's Takashi Aoyama,
2824780	2828420	actually they were saying, his description of the service was that Nintendo will begin
2828420	2833440	collecting fees for some services that will allow us to adapt flexibility.
2833440	2839180	So in other words, it's subsidizing additional services like new channels and stuff like
2839180	2840180	that.
2840180	2843540	And it will be something that's on boxes, like they said that it's going to be an orange
2843540	2846540	logo that's going to be right next to the Wi-Fi Connect logo.
2846540	2848780	So I think this is something additional.
2848780	2854060	It's not just like an arcade kind of format where you pay X amount of Wii points to play
2854060	2857080	a game or something like that online.
2857080	2860940	So I don't know, we'll have to see when it finally comes out.
2860940	2867060	SSJ100Matt says, why couldn't anyone bring back the Sega Activator?
2867060	2869660	Speaking of peripherals, it didn't do so hot.
2869660	2875940	Well, that's another reason why games like Para Para didn't really take off either.
2875940	2878100	They had similar type of peripherals.
2878100	2881300	Hey, I have an activator.
2881300	2885940	I had one and I disassembled it because I was going to turn it into a Para Para controller.
2885940	2886940	Isn't that ironic?
2886940	2891500	I had no time in my life that I owned an activator.
2891500	2898180	Anyways, so another game that of course we're looking forward to pretty soon is Mario Kart
2898180	2907660	Wii, and luckily the rest of the world knows when it's coming out, except the US.
2907660	2909360	Isn't that ironic?
2909360	2915500	But apparently though, Mario Kart Wii will be hitting Japan on April 10th.
2915500	2920300	Also coming to Europe the day after on the 11th.
2920300	2921300	So that's pretty awesome.
2921300	2926220	Of course it's going to be bundled with the Wii Wheel, a piece of plastic crap that you're
2926220	2930100	going to stick the remote in, however you do not need to use that to play the game.
2930100	2935660	In fact, you'll have as many control options as Smash Bros. did, so that's awesome, including
2935660	2937020	GameCube and Classic Controllers.
2937020	2942060	Okay, if I used logic, if it's coming out the same week in Japan and Europe, wouldn't
2942060	2944900	it be logical to say that's going to be the same time frame we get it here?
2944900	2949180	I mean, that would be my guess.
2949180	2951500	I can't comment on that.
2951500	2952860	You bastard, you know, don't you?
2952860	2956340	You're just afraid of a Katamari redo.
2956340	2957340	Alright fine.
2957340	2958340	I know when it's coming out.
2958340	2959340	Okay, tell me this.
2959340	2960340	Am I right or am I wrong?
2960340	2961340	You're wrong.
2961340	2962340	But you're close.
2962340	2963340	Oh, shiz.
2963340	2964340	You're wrong.
2964340	2965340	Alright, fair enough.
2965340	2967820	We'll leave it at that.
2967820	2968820	I know when.
2968820	2969820	I know when.
2969820	2970820	I know, I know, I know.
2970820	2971820	What?
2971820	2972820	Soon.
2972820	2973820	You're a bitch.
2973820	2974820	I know.
2974820	2975820	Heart.
2975820	2980740	Well, I have some fun news and stuff that actually I can say when it's coming out because
2980740	2982740	it already has.
2982740	2986940	And this is our UK Virtual Console.
2986940	2991420	And this is pretty cool because this is actually, speaking of the Activator, this is a game
2991420	2993900	that I bought with my Activator.
2993900	2995300	Was Eternal Champions.
2995300	2996300	Nice.
2996300	2997980	I love Eternal Champions.
2997980	3001180	That game is, actually I love Eternal Champions CD a lot more.
3001180	3002740	That was a really good transition.
3002740	3009420	No, I'm just saying for the Activator, that was a really good transition.
3009420	3010420	That's all.
3010420	3011420	Oh, okay.
3011420	3012420	I just want to take time out to acknowledge that really good transition.
3012420	3013420	Thank you, Rob.
3013420	3014420	You're welcome.
3014420	3019460	I feel very confident now in my announcing skills.
3019460	3021540	Thank you.
3021540	3023740	As if an endorsement from me is what's needed.
3023740	3024740	Alright, I'll shut up.
3024740	3025740	I'm ruining the show.
3025740	3026740	No, you're not.
3026740	3032340	Anyway, Eternal Champions is like one of those, like, if you have wanted violence in video
3032340	3034100	games, this is what did it, you know.
3034100	3040740	You had your over-kills, you know, how each level would have like this, like, you know,
3040740	3045780	super destructive violent move and you had people from all over the world and all through
3045780	3053100	time you had a robot kickboxer and a caveman and like, what's your face that had the really
3053100	3055180	cool snake look and dress thing?
3055180	3056180	She was really cool.
3056180	3057180	I didn't play it.
3057180	3060220	And there was one guy who, I can never remember what he was called, but I always called him
3060220	3068180	Darkman because he had the hat and the coat and everything, but this is just a really,
3068180	3075220	really fun game, but it's going to be, it's 800 Wii points, really, really fun, but this
3075220	3078380	also raises a question that I was thinking of.
3078380	3080620	Which is?
3080620	3086020	Do we have any Sega CD games that have come out on Wii?
3086020	3087940	Sega CD?
3087940	3088940	Not that I can think of.
3088940	3096340	If we're getting Turbo Duo games, and why can't we get...
3096340	3098460	Night Trap on virtual consoles?
3098460	3103300	Please say we can have, or, dude, I want Criss Cross Make Your Own Video.
3103300	3104300	Rob?
3104300	3105300	What?
3105300	3107900	I have that game.
3107900	3109340	I have that one too.
3109340	3110900	And the Marky Mark and the Funky Munch one?
3110900	3111940	I have that one too.
3111940	3112940	That is awesome.
3112940	3113980	Dude, you didn't bring those over.
3113980	3115220	We need to play it one night.
3115220	3118340	Well, if I can find where we put them, but you know what I need to bring over?
3118340	3119340	What?
3119340	3120340	Because I think that you would like this one.
3120340	3121340	What?
3121340	3122340	Do you like Information Society?
3122340	3123720	I guess.
3123720	3128900	I have one of the karaoke CDs that came on the Sega CD.
3128900	3129900	Anyway.
3129900	3137100	So, also out for UK Virtual Console, and this is also super happy, Phantasy Star 2.
3137100	3140660	Which is another 800 Wii Points game.
3140660	3145460	And it's actually, I'd have to say, probably tops to me in the series, because it had Nae
3145460	3147500	in it, and she was really cool.
3147500	3151940	DJ Dark Knight in Chat would like you to know the girl's name was Jetta Max.
3151940	3152940	That was it.
3152940	3158100	And I should have remembered that, because my favorite character on Gem was Jetta.
3158100	3160900	But that's another story.
3160900	3162700	Plus it's a pretty cool car.
3162700	3163700	Okay.
3163700	3164700	Alright.
3164700	3174820	But for the Phantasy Star games, it was like, you know, you had your different viewpoint
3174820	3179520	where you played from behind the characters and could attack for your different scenes
3179520	3182620	and your little dungeon crawl areas.
3182620	3183620	You know, it was really cool.
3183620	3188940	I mean, pretty, I'd have to say, the story wasn't all that great, but it was just a fun
3188940	3190760	game to play.
3190760	3200140	And moving forward, we also have Street Gangs that was a Nintendo NES game for 500 points,
3200140	3208780	and it's not worth, and actually, the cool thing about this is, you want to know what's
3208780	3209780	super cool about it?
3209780	3210780	What?
3210780	3212820	The River City Ransom is what it is.
3212820	3214380	Ah, okay.
3214380	3215380	Yep.
3215380	3220100	Which, the Japanese name of it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.
3220100	3221100	That sounds fun.
3221100	3223500	When you phrase it that way, that sounds a lot of fun.
3223500	3227060	I have to tell you this, and if I can find my copy of it, because I only have a burn
3227060	3233660	of it, I haven't been able to find an original yet, is it has voice on the PC Engine Duo
3233660	3234660	version.
3234660	3235660	Wow.
3235660	3241900	You know, the scenes where you go inside and go order food, you know, they start off the
3241900	3245860	adashimase, and then talk to you all cutesy and everything.
3245860	3249780	When the guys die, do they actually say, barf?
3249780	3251300	They make more punch noises.
3251300	3252300	Do they?
3252300	3253300	Like, ooh.
3253300	3257900	Because that's all I remember is in the NES one, when you killed people, they'd go barf.
3257900	3267380	Well, I will have to, if you would like, I would have to find my burn of the PC Engine
3267380	3269700	Duo ones that you can see.
3269700	3273500	It just adds a completely different element to the game, having the voice with it, but
3273500	3275500	anyway, that's just me.
3275500	3281140	One weekend, we need to have a marathon gaming session with Jamie's Rare Fucking Games
3281140	3285520	Weekend or something, where we just play these obscure-ass video games that we've been talking
3285520	3286520	about all night long.
3286520	3289060	I have a ton of obscure games for the Wii.
3289060	3292740	And we could raise money for charity, like all those marathon gamer people do.
3292740	3295900	You know what game I'd have to bring you, if I can find my copy of it?
3295900	3297580	Psychic Storm.
3297580	3301700	And this game has a subtitle.
3301700	3307140	Dan calls it I Get Pissed Off, because when they say Psychic Storm, they say it in a very
3307140	3311460	thick accent, and Dan thinks they're saying I Get Pissed Off.
3311460	3314020	And there's another one that I'm going to have to get from a friend of mine that I think
3314020	3320700	I've talked about on the show before, that's called Silphia, where it's a shooter game
3320700	3322180	with fairies.
3322180	3323340	Interesting.
3323340	3327140	I would be actually, like maybe we could do something where we bring in a whole stock
3327140	3331300	of games, and we'll play each game for an hour, and we let the chat vote on which game
3331300	3332300	we'll play next or something.
3332300	3335180	Dude, you know it's going to be over as soon as I put Dracula X in, because you won't get
3335180	3336180	me off that game.
3336180	3338140	Maybe save that for last.
3338140	3339140	Who knows?
3339140	3346060	But anyway, the last game on the list is Adventure Island, for 500 Wii points, and Adventure
3346060	3347860	Island is just, it's classic.
3347860	3354980	I mean, it's, I don't mean, today it's, you know, maybe kind of, you know, more repeat,
3354980	3358580	repeat, repeat, but Adventure Island is one of the major classics, so I'm glad that's
3358580	3359580	in there.
3359580	3361180	That is one of the first NES games I actually remember playing.
3361180	3363980	It's also technically a Wonder Boy game.
3363980	3364980	That's right.
3364980	3371940	I know, though, that series spawned one of my favorite games, Wonder Boy Monster Land.
3371940	3375420	You know, actually, one game I loved in the Adventure Island series was Super Adventure
3375420	3376420	Island.
3376420	3377420	Did you ever play that on Super Ninja?
3377420	3380060	And you know what I loved about Super Adventure Island was the music.
3380060	3383820	I thought it had one of the best soundtracks, and years later, I figured it out.
3383820	3386900	Do you know why Super Adventure Island had such a kickass soundtrack?
3386900	3387900	Yuzo Koshiro.
3387900	3388900	Huh?
3388900	3394220	Well, I'll tell you what, though, I've got the TurboGrafx Adventure Island cue card.
3394220	3395220	Fun.
3395220	3396220	That's pretty cool.
3396220	3401380	But, um, you know, though, I would really, really like to see, um, is, uh, I haven't
3401380	3410300	seen, at least as far as I've paid attention, I haven't seen any of the Alex Kidd games.
3410300	3411500	Maybe someday.
3411500	3415560	I would personally like to see Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
3415560	3417340	You seem to bring that up every chance you get.
3417340	3418340	You want Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
3418340	3419340	It's a great game.
3419340	3420340	One of these days, it's gonna be my classic game.
3420340	3421340	Alright.
3421340	3422340	Not anytime soon.
3422340	3427300	Alright, well, if that's all that's coming to the Virtual Console, then we will move
3427300	3430780	on with what is coming to a store near you around the world.
3430780	3433900	We'll start with Japan and the Japanese release dates.
3433900	3439820	Coming out on February 28th, Call of Juarez and the Idolmaster live for you on the Xbox
3439820	3440820	360.
3440820	3445320	Idolmaster is pretty big over in Japan, and so it's a pretty big title coming out this
3445320	3446920	week for them.
3446920	3453640	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, nothing, but you do get Guitar Hero 3 next week, so
3453640	3455420	stay tuned for that.
3455420	3461820	Also in Japan, coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Choro Q Wii, sorry, Koro Q Wii.
3461820	3465780	Remember, part of the fun is listening to me horribly mispronounce Japanese names, especially
3465780	3466780	when I'm sick.
3466780	3469060	The Koro 2 games are fun.
3469060	3474540	Also coming out, more games in the Simple Wii series, the block Kuzushi and the Wai
3474540	3476820	Wai Combat are coming out.
3476820	3483200	Also Uchi Suri, Sega Bass Fishing will be coming out as well on the Nintendo Wii in
3483200	3484200	Japan this week.
3484200	3488620	Moving on to the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3 Take Down comes out.
3488620	3489940	I think that's a price reduction, though.
3489940	3492440	I don't think that's actually a new release.
3492440	3496840	Final Approach 2, First Priority comes out from one of my favorite companies, Princess
3496840	3499720	Soft comes out there.
3499720	3503460	Also coming out, lots of price reductions, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed Underground
3503460	3504460	2.
3504460	3510460	I like this title, Night Wizard the Video Game, Denial of the World is coming out.
3510460	3511460	That sounds like fun.
3511460	3512460	It sounds so emo.
3512460	3513460	It does.
3513460	3514460	Denial of the World.
3514460	3515460	Deny.
3515460	3524340	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Soma Bringer, as well as Akajawa Jiro Mystery, Yasu Kiyoku
3524340	3527020	is coming out as well.
3527020	3535980	Coming out on the PSP in Japan is nothing but a new pouch in mint green.
3535980	3539660	Enjoy that, but no games.
3539660	3540660	That's it.
3540660	3542780	The U.S. is getting in quite a few things.
3542780	3548860	Potapon on the PSP, it's a pretty cool rhythm game, also a bit of action thrown in there.
3548860	3556160	On the 360 and PC, no PS3 version for this, Frontline's Fuel War, another military first
3556160	3558140	person shooter.
3558140	3562380	Lost Via Domus coming to Xbox 360, PC, and PS3.
3562380	3564300	Good spin off of this show.
3564300	3570500	Turning Point, Fall of Liberty on 360, PC, and PS3, kind of an alternate World War II
3570500	3571500	shooter game.
3571500	3577500	Naruto Ninja Destiny on the DS, it's a Naruto 3D fighter game.
3577500	3582460	The Sims 2 Free Time for PC.
3582460	3588060	Lost Planet Extreme Condition on the PS3, which includes bonus characters like Mega
3588060	3592700	Man, Frank from Dead Rising, and some of the other characters from the PC version.
3592700	3598740	Plus, it's only $39.99, so pretty good price for a game that came out a year ago.
3598740	3604100	Destroy All Humans Big Willy Unleashed for the Wii, looks awesome, I love the Destroy
3604100	3605820	All Humans series.
3605820	3613340	Mazes of Fate DS, it's an RPG, kind of a traditional one for the DS there.
3613340	3620140	Agatha Christie's and Then There Were None for the Wii, an adventure game.
3620140	3625140	Let's see here, Arma Gold Edition for PC.
3625140	3631620	Heavenly Guardian for PlayStation 2, it's kind of an anime style 2D shooter game.
3631620	3637700	Puzzle Guzzle for the PSP, that's another...
3637700	3638700	Puzzle Guzzle?
3638700	3639700	Puzzle Guzzle.
3639700	3643060	That is the dumbest name I've ever heard for games, sorry to the makers of Puzzle Guzzle,
3643060	3644060	whoever you are.
3644060	3645060	It's huge tech.
3645060	3647820	But that's a bad name, that's a bad name.
3647820	3654140	Some GameStop exclusive stuff, Fantasy Aquarium, yes, you can raise all sorts of different
3654140	3658420	fish and sea life, including dolphins.
3658420	3662580	Sea Man 3, I was just going to say, can you raise a Sea Man?
3662580	3664660	I don't know if you can.
3664660	3670320	This actually is also coming out, not GameStop exclusive, Block is Portable Steam Bot Championship.
3670320	3673940	This is actually a game that was in that Steam Bot Chronicles game, which I thought was very
3673940	3681200	niche anyways, and now you can play it away from the game, yay, I guess.
3681200	3691340	And let's see, Bubble Bobble Doubleshot on the DS, hopefully with level 30 as well.
3691340	3692340	And let's see...
3692340	3694340	I see what you did there.
3694340	3695340	Exactly.
3695340	3701540	Brain Assist, that's coming out on the DS from Sega, yet another brain training game.
3701540	3707960	Sega Bass Fishing for the Wii, that's not necessarily using the Dreamcast fishing rod,
3707960	3711380	but you can pretend with the Wii Remote.
3711380	3718420	And Spitfire Heroes Tales Royal Air Force for the DS by Destineer, because they put
3718420	3721100	out a lot of shit.
3721100	3728420	And I believe that's it, but I like this title that's coming out next week, though, it's
3728420	3735880	a horse riding sim, but if you say the name of the title a little bit, it sounds weird.
3735880	3741880	Let's Ride Friends Forever.
3741880	3746460	Don't say that out loud really fast, because that sounds really, really bad.
3746460	3753820	Oh, and Tigers, or Pets, Wild Animals, Tigers game, yes, because now you can raise tigers.
3753820	3757500	Oh, and Bratz Super Babies, I forgot about that.
3757500	3762380	Hey, Jamie, let's go ride friends forever.
3762380	3766460	Only friends let friends ride friends.
3766460	3768500	Nice.
3768500	3773180	Oh, is that it for US releases?
3773180	3778140	Uh, yeah, and this isn't really a game, but the extra guitars for Guitar Hero 3 are coming
3778140	3784780	out for PS3 and the Wii now, so, um, if you're looking for extra guitars, there you go.
3784780	3787700	Is that a copy of Bejeweled I'm seeing on the table over there?
3787700	3791020	That's actually already been given away, I just haven't gotten to the post office yet.
3791020	3792020	I was like...
3792020	3793700	What was the week you were here?
3793700	3795980	I think I'm baffled by that, but that's okay.
3795980	3796980	Bejeweled 2, even better.
3796980	3797980	Yes.
3797980	3798980	You know what I thought?
3798980	3800340	Um, you guys were talking about obscure games.
3800340	3803060	This isn't really obscure, but I guess it's obscure now.
3803060	3804060	Commander Keen.
3804060	3805060	Ooh!
3805060	3806060	Play some of that.
3806060	3807060	I remember those.
3807060	3811500	Bunch of, uh, EGA colored games, that'd be fun.
3811500	3814860	You know, you know what other game, though, I was thinking about just the other day?
3814860	3817620	Was Jazz Jackrabbit.
3817620	3819740	How about Jill of the Jungle?
3819740	3820740	I remember that game.
3820740	3821740	The game was rad.
3821740	3822740	That's what it is.
3822740	3823740	How about him?
3823740	3827740	You know me, though, my favorite PC game is so super obscure right now.
3827740	3829420	Anyway.
3829420	3832260	On the 28th, we have Lost on PC.
3832260	3834340	Um, yay.
3834340	3841700	29th, um, we have, uh, 8 Ball All-Stars on DS.
3841700	3846780	We have, uh, Asterix at the Olympic Games comic series.
3846780	3849820	And then we have, like, a French version, I think.
3849820	3852020	Because it's in, because the, uh, title's in French.
3852020	3856180	We have Beautiful Katamari on the 29th on Xbox 360.
3856180	3857180	Blacksite Area 51.
3857180	3863940	We have Bleach, Shattered Blade, and the Blade of Fate, um, Wii and DS, respectively.
3863940	3867820	Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.
3867820	3870940	Fish Tycoon.
3870940	3872860	My brain's still wrapping around that, sorry.
3872860	3876700	Frontlines Fuel of War on Xbox 360 and PC.
3876700	3879980	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on Wii.
3879980	3886300	Um, Jamster All-Stars, King of Clubs, Lost, um, yeah.
3886300	3893460	Lost Odyssey, Lost Planet Extreme Condition, Namco Museum on DS, Persona 3, SpongeBob Atlantis
3893460	3900260	SquarePants, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empire, and Zoo Hospital.
3900260	3905300	All right, sounds like an exciting week over there.
3905300	3908660	That's a, that's a long wait for Beautiful Katamari.
3908660	3909980	I would say so.
3909980	3910980	Wow.
3910980	3911980	Poor, poor guys over here.
3911980	3915780	Epic and Apogee, or 3D Realms now, they really need to go back and remake a lot of their
3915780	3917980	older games, like Shareware stuff.
3917980	3918980	Seriously.
3918980	3922380	Those are some IPs that need to be, be gone and revisited, seriously.
3922380	3923380	Yeah.
3923380	3926820	Who doesn't want a new Jill of the Jungle 3D shooter, or something?
3926820	3930540	Hey, you know, people are looking for that, uh, good female heroine.
3930540	3937660	Well, hey, speaking of new IPs, uh, based on old ideas, possibly, um, Activision apparently
3937660	3942580	has filed a trademark for a game name called DJ Hero.
3942580	3944500	You just couldn't stop there, could you?
3944500	3946260	You just have it going.
3946260	3949300	You know, I think a lot of us have seen this coming for a long time, and of course the
3949300	3953500	reason why, you know, a lot of us, remember, Orange Launch Radio, hello, look at our name.
3953500	3958900	We started a long time ago as a station dedicated to music-based video games, and one of them
3958900	3963060	specifically was Beatmania, and I think a lot of us called this a long time ago when
3963060	3965060	we started seeing Guitar Hero's success.
3965060	3966060	It's only a matter of time.
3966060	3969500	If Konami's gonna sit on it and not do anything with it, somebody else is gonna pick it up
3969500	3971500	and run with it, and I think that's what we're gonna see happen.
3971500	3975920	I mean, well, I'm sure Konami's gonna license, you know, the rights for their controller-type
3975920	3979660	design and that stuff, but they've already done one here, so we know that they have trademarks
3979660	3985060	and, you know, copyrights in place for stuff like that, like Beatmania, but, um...
3985060	3990300	I think Sega does also have the Kraken DJ1 licensed over here, too.
3990300	3995100	But here's what I'm wondering, though, with this, is, um, really all they're doing, and
3995100	3999500	I mean, this isn't that big of a surprise, because most buying games are like that, too.
3999500	4004660	All they're really doing is just swapping out guitar for, you know, a turntable and
4004660	4005660	buttons.
4005660	4008660	I mean, if that's what they're gonna be doing with this.
4008660	4013100	They're really whoring that Guitar Hero franchise and kind of running it into the ground, I
4013100	4015880	think.
4015880	4017620	I think it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.
4017620	4019180	I don't think it's gonna be a clone of Beatmania.
4019180	4023160	I mean, they're not gonna do that, but it's gonna be interesting to see kind of what happens
4023160	4024160	with it, what they decide to change.
4024160	4025620	I hope it's Kraken DJ!
4025620	4030500	I think you're gonna see something like frequency amplitude, but with a different type of controller.
4030500	4032220	I don't think that's what it's gonna be.
4032220	4033660	But we'll see.
4033660	4034660	I hope.
4034660	4036280	I hope it's something different.
4036280	4040380	I'm thinking this is gonna be announced at E3 this year.
4040380	4041380	Wait for it.
4041380	4043380	I'm sorry, go ahead.
4043380	4044380	Oh, nothing.
4044380	4045380	Go ahead.
4045380	4050220	So, Microsoft is officially, well, along with everyone else...
4050220	4051220	Wait, I gotta say this.
4051220	4052220	This is a very good point.
4052220	4053220	A.J.
4053220	4055380	Mixx says, this isn't a Harmonic 6 Activision.
4055380	4059660	True point, but, you know, still, it could be something like that.
4059660	4060660	That's all.
4060660	4061660	Okay.
4061660	4067100	So, Microsoft, as well as everyone else, is pretty much getting up on HD DVD.
4067100	4073620	Rightly so, they have stopped supporting their HD DVD players.
4073620	4077180	They will, of course, still warranty the product and stuff like that, but they're no longer
4077180	4079460	manufacturing them.
4079460	4082860	In other news, and, you know, this hasn't really made it out there that well, other
4082860	4090740	than a rumor, they have dropped the price of $50, you know, and that's official, so...
4090740	4095420	So, you're gonna actually get one so I can hang out with my laser disc player and the
4095420	4096420	Betamax in our closet.
4096420	4099420	I mean, if you're looking for something cheap...
4099420	4104620	I kind of laughed because I saw an ad on the Xbox 360 not even, like, six hours ago that
4104620	4109780	said HD DVD player now only $129, and I just kind of snickered.
4109780	4110780	Yeah.
4110780	4113020	There's a lot of good movies out on HD DVD, though, but...
4113020	4114020	$50.
4114020	4115020	Good luck finding them, though.
4115020	4117500	I know GameStop's not carrying them anymore and they're not selling their movies.
4117500	4121220	In fact, they had a pretty good deal, buy two, get two free type thing, but...
4121220	4122220	Damn it.
4122220	4126060	I need to start looking for these deals, because I need to stock up on HD DVDs now that my
4126060	4127300	player isn't gonna be able to do shit.
4127300	4129460	I only own, like, four HD DVD movies.
4129460	4130460	Yeah.
4130460	4131460	Thank God I have Stardust.
4131460	4132460	I love that movie.
4132460	4133460	And Batman Begins.
4133460	4134580	Oh, I hope that that comes out.
4134580	4139300	See, I think if you can get a hold of one of these for pretty dirt cheap, I mean, just
4139300	4140300	hold out.
4140300	4141300	It's just like UMDs, man.
4141300	4145940	Those UMD movies, they're dirt cheap, because no one wants them, and, you know, people start
4145940	4150980	trying to get rid of these things and I think you'll be able to find them pretty, you know,
4150980	4151980	cheap.
4151980	4155020	Plus, I mean, there's no real difference between those and Blu-ray movies anyways as
4155020	4159500	far as, you know, image quality goes, so I don't think you're gonna notice.
4159500	4163980	Well, I don't know about some of you guys, but me as somebody who picked up an HD DVD
4163980	4169420	player, I'm mad that it's all over and that makes me angsty and that means it's time for
4169420	4170420	the FUs of the Week.
4170420	4193940	My FUs of the Week goes towards this stupid, clearly compensating for something, man driving
4193940	4196100	a truck.
4196100	4198020	We had a very, very rainy day.
4198020	4206100	It was very rainy, very windy, kind of nasty, and there's this one particular turn where
4206100	4210780	it's a little sharper than I think that it needs to be to turn, and it's pretty much
4210780	4217540	a two-lane left turn, and so this one guy was in the inside lane and I was in the outside
4217540	4218540	lane.
4218540	4225420	Well, when we turned in, he basically cut me off in the middle of the turn, which isn't,
4225420	4228820	you know, just rude.
4228820	4230060	It's incredibly dangerous.
4230060	4233340	It's something that only an idiot would do.
4233340	4239060	So he cuts me off and then he starts to spin out, and then I start to spin out because
4239060	4244860	I was trying to, you know, avoid the tail end of these retarded, you know, small penis
4244860	4246340	truck.
4246340	4254940	So in his spinning out and me losing control, and I actually, I, you know, steered into
4254940	4256940	it and managed to get myself straightened out.
4256940	4263780	By the time I got my car, you know, back lined up and everything was fine, he swung out again,
4263780	4271420	and if I hadn't stopped when I did, then he would have pretty much taken off my bumper.
4271420	4277940	So the other really kind of scary part about this is that, you know, there's that, well,
4277940	4281580	I'm sure those of us in the room know, there's that ditch on the side, and I didn't want
4281580	4285580	to go in that ditch, that would have gotten my car dirty.
4285580	4294740	But it was just really the fact that there are people who should have to take psychological
4294740	4298020	exams before they are permitted to drive.
4298020	4300820	That's what I have to say.
4300820	4308060	This person driving this truck was clearly of poor judgment, very, very poor driving
4308060	4311180	skills and substandard intelligence.
4311180	4316540	So F you to stupid people who drive.
4316540	4321580	My FUs ought to be pretty obvious this week, F you to being sick, F you to my car not working
4321580	4326620	completely right when I pay a lot of money for my car, and F you to the Wi-Fi here not
4326620	4330060	working and just F you to February.
4330060	4332060	That's it.
4332060	4338220	F you to my 360 sort of working, or at least playing games with me, and once I think it's
4338220	4342780	working, you know, I've tested it extensively, I take it to work, it starts up, ten seconds
4342780	4344500	later it freezes.
4344500	4348900	It really fucking pisses me off because I can't figure out what's wrong with it, although
4348900	4354020	I'm getting close to where there's nothing more I can fix on it, so I'm going to have
4354020	4358620	to cut a hole in the side of it, just because I think that's necessary that I get the Dremel
4358620	4359620	out.
4359620	4362220	And it'll look cool.
4362220	4366340	As it is, it sounds like a jet coming out of that thing now that I've, you know, twelve
4366340	4368660	of modded the fan.
4368660	4371700	Alright, is that it?
4371700	4375420	Yeah, and that broke an intercooler too because I took it apart.
4375420	4376420	Is that it?
4376420	4377420	Yes, but...
4377420	4378420	That's fine.
4378420	4383020	Alright, let's keep moving on with the news.
4383020	4385980	You know, for supposedly being a short show tonight, I don't think we're going to be that
4385980	4386980	short of a show.
4386980	4387980	We'll see.
4387980	4389780	It's just kind of like one long show.
4389780	4390780	That's right.
4390780	4392780	It'll be fun, right, Jamie?
4392780	4393780	Fun?
4393780	4395060	Yeah, fun.
4395060	4396060	We're having fun, right?
4396060	4398060	The more you have fun, the more drunk I am.
4398060	4399060	No, I'm kidding.
4399060	4400060	Right.
4400060	4401060	Anyway, um...
4401060	4403660	We're fans of the Commodore 64, wouldn't you say?
4403660	4404660	Fuck yes we are!
4404660	4405660	I love the Commodore 64.
4405660	4408660	By we, I mean Rob.
4408660	4409660	I get...
4409660	4411460	The Commodore 64 was my first gaming system, okay?
4411460	4417060	I mean, I had an Atari 2600, but I played tons of games on Commodore 64.
4417060	4418060	I love the C64.
4418060	4420060	My first one makes me cry.
4420060	4422940	It was the Odyssey.
4422940	4424940	That would make me cry too.
4424940	4431900	Anyway, the Commodore 64 is coming to the European Virtual Console later this year.
4431900	4438060	The first two games to be out are Iridium and International Karate.
4438060	4446500	So it looks to me like they're also going to be charging for them 500 Wii points.
4446500	4452900	There's not any kind of notice as if we're going to be getting them over here.
4452900	4461580	And I think the other thing that they've recently announced is Master System games.
4461580	4465380	I hope some of the classic Commodore 64 games come out, but then again, I think about it,
4465380	4469300	and a lot of the games I played on Commodore 64 were ports of arcade games and things that
4469300	4472340	are out in various other types of ways now, so I don't know.
4472340	4476140	But there were some old C64 games that were kind of fun, but a lot of them required a
4476140	4477140	keyboard.
4477140	4478140	I just want Impossible Mission, okay?
4478140	4479140	That's what I want.
4479140	4484380	I want more than anything.
4484380	4488740	Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel, or is it?
4488740	4492460	It seems like they've taken a game that was already in development and slapped the Puzzle
4492460	4494180	Quest name on it.
4494180	4500260	The game is called Galactrix, and it's now being called Puzzle Quest Galactrix.
4500260	4504340	Is it possibly D3 just using the Puzzle Quest name to sell copies of a game that might not
4504340	4505540	have sold much otherwise?
4505540	4513100	I don't know, but it looks interesting, because now instead of having squares in a more bejeweled-ish
4513100	4518500	type of setting, now it looks like you have hexagons, and I don't know if it's hexic or
4518500	4519500	what the deal is.
4519500	4520500	It's Galactrix.
4520500	4521500	It's not hexic.
4521500	4523740	It's clearly different.
4523740	4528300	But apparently now it has a whole sci-fi theme as opposed to a fantasy theme.
4528300	4530100	You know what?
4530100	4531100	I don't know.
4531100	4532380	I'm going to withhold judgment until I play it.
4532380	4535980	It does look like it has spells and all that good stuff from the old one, but you know
4535980	4537780	what they say about too much of a good thing.
4537780	4541900	Don't oversaturate the market with all these sub-par puzzle games that you slap the name
4541900	4544060	Puzzle Quest on or you're going to be in trouble.
4544060	4545060	That's all I think.
4545060	4546060	But I don't know.
4546060	4547060	Puzzle Quest?
4547060	4548060	Bookworm Adventures?
4548060	4549060	This game might be kind of fun, so we'll see.
4549060	4551780	Dude, Bookworm Adventures is rad.
4551780	4552780	Don't be knocking Bookworm Adventures.
4552780	4553780	Besides, there's two different people.
4553780	4555340	You're talking PopCap Games.
4555340	4559500	Somebody else that apparently likes to take PopCap Cans and remake them.
4559500	4561180	Puzzle Quest is just like Bejeweled.
4561180	4565900	I mean, that's the only reason Nelly plays it, so I don't know.
4565900	4569660	Rob with Two Bees in Chat says, I want Puzzle Quest Pirates Booty.
4569660	4571180	We need a good pirate puzzle game.
4571180	4573300	Oh wait, we have puzzle pirates.
4573300	4577740	So EA, being the pompous asses that they are, decided, hey, we're fucking EA.
4577740	4579540	We're going to try to buy Take Two.
4579540	4582500	We're going to offer you two billion dollars.
4582500	4594660	Anyway, of course, Take Two looked at it and said, no, sorry.
4594660	4595940	You know why I think this is interesting?
4595940	4598460	Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Take Two own 2K games?
4598460	4600420	Yeah, Take Two owns 2K games.
4600420	4604980	They also own Rockstar.
4604980	4609220	Basically buying this would have EA would have a monopoly on those sports games.
4609220	4612620	I was going to say, if that happened, EA would have a sports monopoly.
4612620	4614260	That's crazy talk.
4614260	4616660	No, that's EA talk.
4616660	4620060	I mean, it's not surprising to hear about all these murders.
4620060	4622260	Our games may not be great, but you have no other choice.
4622260	4627140	I think it's interesting that Take Two just said, no.
4627140	4628140	That's not good.
4628140	4631220	When your companies look at being bought like that, though, sometimes it's not good.
4631220	4632220	I mean, I don't know.
4632220	4633220	Well, it was unsolicited.
4633220	4636540	I mean, you know, they weren't saying, hey, who wants to buy us?
4636540	4641940	EA is just like, hey, we've got $2 billion.
4641940	4644540	We want to buy you because Grand Theft Auto is awesome.
4644540	4645940	But, see, that's the thing.
4645940	4652780	I think 2K and Take Two, they may have had financial trouble earlier, but I think they're
4652780	4655100	going to make a turnaround, especially with Grand Theft Auto IV.
4655100	4657100	They're going to make all sorts of money with that shit.
4657100	4658820	I don't know.
4658820	4661540	This reminds me of the whole Microsoft Yahoo thing that's been going on the past couple
4661540	4665700	of weeks, where apparently Microsoft's been trying to buy Yahoo, but Yahoo's been kind
4665700	4668220	of saying no, or the stockholders have been saying no.
4668220	4669220	Very interesting stuff.
4669220	4672060	It's like just because you have the money doesn't mean they're going to sell to you.
4672060	4673220	I mean, it's true.
4673220	4679020	If I was Take Two, I'd be like, fuck you, I'm not going to sell my company $2 billion.
4679020	4683380	Well, in other news, though, Orange Lounge Radio is up for sale for the highest bidder.
4683380	4686200	We will take $2 billion, trust each.
4686200	4687200	I don't care.
4687200	4692020	We'll put EA presents EA's Orange Lounge Radio by EA.
4692020	4693020	I really don't care.
4693020	4694540	We would sell out like that.
4694540	4698300	I will talk, hell, presented by Madden, Madden's Orange Lounge Radio.
4698300	4699620	I don't give a crap.
4699620	4700860	$2 billion, man.
4700860	4703500	I do whatever they want with this show.
4703500	4704500	I quit.
4704500	4710660	Can you imagine Madden's Orange Lounge Radio?
4710660	4712180	I'd be foaming at the mouth.
4712180	4716180	Featuring the gay guy, the angry man, and the woman who...
4716180	4719020	We'll build a room of money.
4719020	4724020	Who I love and adore.
4724020	4727320	You want to know what sucks is that I wasn't thinking about what all to spend that much
4727320	4728320	money on.
4728320	4732540	I was thinking about, well, technically I was, but I was thinking pay off credit cards,
4732540	4740820	pay off student loans, buy a house, and then move to Europe.
4740820	4745860	Act Deaf has made the first bid for Orange Lounge Radio at $2.
4745860	4747500	We need more money.
4747500	4748620	Let's sell the station on eBay.
4748620	4749860	That would be fun.
4749860	4751900	Dude, you want to?
4751900	4757900	When we're ready to just call it quits, which, you know, we've been doing this six years.
4757900	4759300	Who knows when it's going to happen?
4759300	4763140	When we finally decide to call it quits, I say we sell it all on eBay to the highest
4763140	4773260	bidder and just have a good...spend all the money on a goodbye party with crack and hookers.
4773260	4780340	We should do random eBay stuff because it's like, I don't know if you know when they were
4780340	4785820	having all this stuff on the Gorillaz website, they actually sold 2D shoes on eBay.
4785820	4786820	Nice.
4786820	4788100	So we could do stuff like that.
4788100	4789100	Like I have...
4789100	4790340	Okay, I need to say something.
4790340	4791420	Chat room, knock it off.
4791420	4795820	We didn't say the station is actually for sale, so bidding is not up to $50, okay?
4795820	4796820	Shut up.
4796820	4797820	I'll sell a date.
4797820	4798820	I'll go out with somebody.
4798820	4799820	You're married.
4799820	4803500	So my husband will be fine with it.
4803500	4806180	I get free food and we get money.
4806180	4807180	What's bad about that?
4807180	4812780	I'll tell you what, Rob, because you know how that one Guitar Hero controller or Guitar
4812780	4818060	Hero game or whatever was sold for like thousands of dollars because some father took it away
4818060	4821180	from his pot smoking son, supposedly?
4821180	4826180	Well that copy of Bookworm Adventures, that copy was stolen from the President of the
4826180	4828820	United States.
4828820	4832820	From his secret bunker where he's holding Bin Laden.
4832820	4836620	I think that we should put that on eBay and see how much money we can get.
4836620	4838780	And there's an image of the Virgin Mary in the plastic.
4838780	4842260	Oh yes, there is.
4842260	4847660	By the way, just so that you know, there's a chance that we may have Dan next week.
4847660	4848660	Nice.
4848660	4849660	Dan the man.
4849660	4850660	Yes.
4850660	4851660	Have we even...
4851660	4853860	My God, in the six year history of the show, has Dan ever been on it?
4853860	4854860	Once.
4854860	4855860	Yes he has.
4855860	4856860	Once.
4856860	4857860	I wasn't there.
4857860	4858860	Once.
4858860	4859860	I wasn't there when it happened.
4859860	4860860	I think you were.
4860860	4861860	No, it was a week that you...
4861860	4862980	I was gone and the show turned...
4862980	4864700	This is way back in the day before the podcast.
4864700	4865920	This is the day of the apartment.
4865920	4869880	This was when you guys, you guys did the show from your apartment and you ended up watching
4869880	4873300	a biography of Ron Jeremy while the show was going on.
4873300	4877300	No, Dan was at your guys' old place.
4877300	4879180	Dan was at your guys' old place before.
4879180	4880900	Oh, he did come to the show once there.
4880900	4881900	That's right.
4881900	4883060	Because we have the picture from the webcam.
4883060	4884060	I remember that.
4884060	4885060	I remember that.
4885060	4886060	That's true.
4886060	4889580	The Ron Jeremy thing was great because we were like, dude, the stories are just not
4889580	4890580	all that great.
4890580	4891580	Let's just watch porn.
4891580	4893300	Or watch, you know, porn documentary.
4893300	4894740	Oh, the days.
4894740	4896700	The good old golden days of Orange Lounge Radio.
4896700	4899380	Rastiel Ute says, Loki, we know that's bullshit.
4899380	4902100	W.A. doesn't know what a book is, much less bookworms.
4902100	4905860	Yes, but see, you know, it's cute and he likes cute things, so...
4905860	4909260	Hey, dates don't mean you have to go get nookie or anything.
4909260	4910260	Chat room.
4910260	4911260	Pervs.
4911260	4914900	All right, let's get to the mailbag segment of the show.
4914900	4918200	I'm sure the mailbag's very full after not having a show last week, so Dark Soccer's
4918200	4921860	had to be super selective in what she picks out to read tonight.
4921860	4924900	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.
4924900	4940800	Hi, so that Lucky Nuts guy emailed me back, the one who I was kind of upset with for my
4940800	4943740	comments about physics.
4943740	4951540	So he said he was sorry for making me angry and they were just poking some fun.
4951540	4956960	I was just, I'm just going to let you know that I go on PMS-related tangents quite regularly
4956960	4962140	and if you're going to deal with women, you've just got to get used to it.
4962140	4969900	We have that going on, although I have to say that it was more or less of a WTF moment,
4969900	4972940	so don't worry about it, whatever.
4972940	4974940	So next actual email.
4974940	4978100	Hi, O.L.R. team.
4978100	4979100	We're a team now?
4979100	4980100	Yes.
4980100	4981100	Okay.
4981100	4982820	We put the EA in team.
4982820	4987060	Does that mean that we have to go on team buildings and have the company pay for lunch?
4987060	4988060	Maybe.
4988060	4990060	We don't have a company.
4990060	4991060	We're lunch money.
4991060	4992060	Yeah, we do.
4992060	4993060	Anyway.
4993060	4996660	I have been listening to the podcast since sometime last year when I discovered it while
4996660	4999580	browsing for websites that were formatted for the PSP.
4999580	5001220	Yeah, Lucky, another one.
5001220	5007060	I won't go into a long dribble here, but suffice to say, I really enjoyed listening to you
5007060	5011060	rambling on about games, the Olive Garden, and Moist Cake.
5011060	5014740	Since I travel a lot doing my job, it's hard to play all the games or even to keep up with
5014740	5019560	what's going on, what's coming out all the time, knowing that I'm missing out on something
5019560	5026060	but not knowing what is worse than listening to O.L.R. and hearing how great Burnout Paradise
5026060	5028220	and COD4 must be.
5028220	5031320	So thanks Ego++ to you.
5031320	5036900	The last few weeks, I have been riding a daily ferry from Margarita Island in Venezuela to
5036900	5038420	Coach Island where I'm teaching.
5038420	5043260	I'm a kiteboarding instructor, and that's when I usually get to listen to the podcast
5043260	5044740	on my PSP.
5044740	5049680	Since I work in Spain during the summer months, I can't listen to O.L.R. live due to the time
5049680	5055620	shift, but if my internet connection doesn't fail on me this weekend, I might make it to
5055620	5057020	listen to you live this Sunday.
5057020	5059620	After all, Venezuela is at least on the same side of the globe.
5059620	5061020	Finally, a short question.
5061020	5065220	You've already mentioned Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once, and I was wondering if you
5065220	5069580	could maybe get him over to the Skyline to drop in for a quick chat.
5069580	5073000	His video reviews are a weekly highlight for me, and I would love to see O.L.R. chat with
5073000	5074000	him for a while.
5074000	5075000	I doubt it.
5075000	5076000	He's in Australia.
5076000	5077000	Yeah.
5077000	5078000	And busy.
5078000	5079000	Yeah.
5079000	5080000	It is.
5080000	5081000	Thanks and keep up the independent, informative, and very funny show.
5081000	5084940	And this is from MVH808.
5084940	5085940	That was very nice.
5085940	5086940	Thank you.
5086940	5087940	Next email.
5087940	5091500	Hey folks, at the O.L.R. headquarters.
5091500	5093140	I've got two quick questions here.
5093140	5094140	First is for Loki.
5094140	5098020	I know this show doesn't condone shady topics, but bear with me.
5098020	5102980	I originally purchased a Wii key for my Wii because people in my home like to mall discs,
5102980	5107100	and I'd rather have backup copies lying around than $50 discs.
5107100	5109580	So what is your thoughts on this mod chip?
5109580	5114380	Well, which Wii mod chip do you use, and how hard is it to install one of these because
5114380	5117260	I have not the slightest experience in soldering?
5117260	5121860	Also, how many Subway sandwiches with white bread would I have to bribe you with to install
5121860	5122860	mine?
5122860	5125100	Do you use ham and cheese?
5125100	5126100	No.
5126100	5127100	No.
5127100	5128100	I have a Cyclo-Wiz.
5128100	5132540	I think it's Cyclo-Wiz V2, I don't know.
5132540	5136900	Whatever the second series, V version 2, I think, is what it was.
5136900	5142180	They're really friggin' tiny, and it was kinda scary trying to solder it.
5142180	5148060	But the thing about the soldering, though, is it actually, the one I have, it has a thing
5148060	5153100	called quick solder, and basically there's two points on the board that you fill up these
5153100	5154100	holes with solder.
5154100	5157320	Of course, you have to put flux on the board because the solder didn't want to stick to
5157320	5159380	it at first.
5159380	5163020	And then once you've got that on there, the chip is basically on there, and what you can
5163020	5170020	do is you tin two wires and solder them onto three really, really, really tiny points on
5170020	5173860	the board and connect it to the chip.
5173860	5181100	It wasn't easy at all, and I got lucky, I guess, that it worked just fine.
5181100	5183420	Just be careful, I guess.
5183420	5185740	But don't electrocute yourself.
5185740	5187860	You're not going to electrocute yourself.
5187860	5189500	And remember, you're going to void your warranty.
5189500	5194380	Yeah, you will void your warranty, but to be honest, I wouldn't worry too much.
5194380	5200500	Just worry about bridging stuff that you shouldn't, like, those three points on the board that
5200500	5204780	you would be soldering wires to are really close together, so if you put too much solder
5204780	5209500	on there, they will bridge each other, and it just won't work, but, you know, you can
5209500	5216960	always take the solder off there and also make sure you don't lift any of the traces
5216960	5221820	on there as well by putting too much heat on there.
5221820	5227940	Just be careful, use really, really, really small gauge wire, like, I think I used 30
5227940	5232340	gauge wire, I think, I can't remember, really, really tiny stuff.
5232340	5233340	And then...
5233340	5235620	An YR fan in chat confessed, I electrocuted myself once.
5235620	5236620	Be careful.
5236620	5238660	Just, yeah, be careful with that stuff.
5238660	5243540	I love the CycloWiz, I mean, they're the only ones that were running, you know, at
5243540	5249300	initially Smash Brothers, so I was able to import Smash Brothers that way, and also they
5249300	5253740	were one of the first to be able to use Super Mario Galaxies, so I like them.
5253740	5258060	Weeki's pretty good, I guess, because I was going back and forth between Weeki and CycloWiz,
5258060	5263940	but I ended up, you know, with a CycloWiz, so, you know, like I said, just be careful,
5263940	5267660	also if you don't own one yet, you're going to need a tri-wing screwdriver, so be sure
5267660	5270900	to buy one of those.
5270900	5275100	We know about Nintendo and having specially assembled stuff.
5275100	5279100	Yep, they love the tri-wing, I don't know why.
5279100	5283860	Well, the next question says, second question is a show related one.
5283860	5288740	I liked Puppy in studio last week when he actually spoke and enjoyed another perspective.
5288740	5292020	I wondered as a permanent part of the show if you guys had ever thought about having
5292020	5294460	a fourth chair with a rotating guest.
5294460	5298340	I mean, one person wouldn't always be relied on to be there and you'd always have a fresh
5298340	5299620	perspective from someone.
5299620	5303460	I just thought it was a really cool idea and figured I would pitch it over there to sit
5303460	5304460	on.
5304460	5310980	Well, we do have guests fairly regularly, but...
5310980	5316140	Okay, my mic's been totally off that whole time.
5316140	5318900	Probably been able to hear me a little bit.
5318900	5319900	Shit, where was I?
5319900	5323900	Oh, yes, I was saying, I think the door is like already kind of open for people to come
5323900	5328460	in and, you know, have that, and I think the reason why we don't add a fourth guest permanently
5328460	5332260	is it just makes the kind of, like the credits and everything that goes in the show, it just
5332260	5334340	kind of makes it too long, you know what I mean?
5334340	5339100	And plus, you know, Loki and Dark Sakura have kind of, and myself, we've made this part
5339100	5340340	of our routine.
5340340	5343660	I mean, to have somebody else give up their Sunday, I mean, that's a lot.
5343660	5346860	Every Sunday just about, I mean, give or take, obviously we weren't here last week, but give
5346860	5350500	or take every Sunday for the past six years, that's a huge commitment that not many people
5350500	5351500	can take.
5351500	5357020	So it's hard to say we want to, you know, add somebody on a very permanent basis, but
5357020	5361820	the door's always open to our guests and I remember back in the day there were some people
5361820	5364500	that it seemed like they were here every week for a while.
5364500	5365500	Yeah.
5365500	5369740	I want to say like DDR Angel was here at least every other week for a while and when he was
5369740	5376980	here, Shane was here every week, you know, just depends on what's going on that week.
5376980	5379700	It's more or less the, do I have anything else going on?
5379700	5380700	Let's go to OLR.
5380700	5384540	I've been trying to get other people to come on though, that's why I'm really hoping Dan
5384540	5390180	makes it next week because it'll be cool to kind of fuss at him, I think, inside into
5390180	5393940	my bizarre marriage, but anyway.
5393940	5396780	Love the show guys, hope Sakura is feeling better and this came from J-Rod and thank
5396780	5399540	you, I am feeling much better two weeks later.
5399540	5404100	I was feeling like crap the other week, it was not pretty and also because I have to
5404100	5408260	read it, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and
5408260	5409260	breadsticks.
5409260	5410260	Nice.
5410260	5412260	Shall I move on?
5412260	5413260	Sure.
5413260	5417260	Hello, Rob, Jamie and Loki.
5417260	5421660	Just thought I would chime in with my thoughts about the game you played last week, one versus
5421660	5422660	the chat room.
5422660	5424540	That was the week you weren't here, Jamie.
5424540	5426540	I understand that.
5426540	5429060	Just thought I'd fill that in.
5429060	5430060	Okay.
5430060	5433060	It was badass and officially my favorite game of the show.
5433060	5436660	It allows all the live listeners a chance to play and win, not just the caller.
5436660	5440220	For podcast people, it's fun too just because trivia gets you thinking.
5440220	5444040	By the way, I agree with that person who said there should be a Bimani edition.
5444040	5445140	Also three random thoughts.
5445140	5449460	One, I laughed so hard at Rama's little loop.
5449460	5453020	Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video remix.
5453020	5454020	Okay.
5454020	5458520	Two, every time you guys spot a fly in the studio, you should all give a girly squeal
5458520	5460340	on the count of three just for shits and giggles.
5460340	5462260	It hasn't been that bad lately, actually.
5462260	5463260	This one's for me.
5463260	5466940	It says you should call your mom and talk about the Wii with her on the show just because
5466940	5469460	Rob's talk with his mom a while back was hilarious.
5469460	5470460	All right.
5470460	5471460	Enough with this email.
5471460	5472460	I'll be live soon.
5472460	5473460	That's from Osprey.
5473460	5479620	Well, I would say we should call my mama, but it's a quarter to ten right now in Alabama.
5479620	5483980	Well, actually, I think my mom would be awake, but she would be winding down.
5483980	5485300	Now, let's save it for Mother's Day.
5485300	5486300	Ooh, yeah.
5486300	5488020	Let's call my mom on Mother's Day.
5488020	5489740	It'd be, hi, mom.
5489740	5490740	I'm in jail.
5490740	5491740	Wait.
5491740	5493860	I'm in Rob's garage.
5493860	5496020	Which is kind of like jail.
5496020	5499180	Only more comfy with better insulation and computers.
5499180	5501780	Even Gold Banjo in chat says I missed that one versus the chat room game.
5501780	5502780	I hope you guys do it again.
5502780	5503780	We'll come back.
5503780	5505100	The reception was very, very positive.
5505100	5507220	We will do that game again.
5507220	5508220	Next email.
5508220	5509220	With more music, of course.
5509220	5511620	Yes, with more variety of music next time.
5511620	5512620	Next email?
5512620	5513620	Yes.
5513620	5514620	Hey, OLR crew.
5514620	5518900	I just wanted to say thank you guys for keeping this show, specifically the live show, going.
5518900	5522420	Sometimes I have horrible weekends, and this show for me is a nice escape from reality
5522420	5526260	and whatever fail comes my way during the weekend.
5526260	5531500	I never have anything to do on Sunday nights, so this show helps keep me from getting bored.
5531500	5533840	I also want to give a shout out to DMN.
5533840	5534840	Great show.
5534840	5535840	Keep it up, too.
5535840	5539300	The screwiness and the chat room cage match definitely brighten up my Wednesday nights.
5539300	5543980	Even though you borderline abusively kick me, SacraMax and some other listeners, said
5543980	5545700	kicking only makes the show even better.
5545700	5547540	Dude, I'll kick you if you want.
5547540	5548540	You're in the chat room, aren't you?
5548540	5549540	Yeah.
5549540	5550540	Give me a kick.
5550540	5551540	I will in a minute.
5551540	5552540	I'm going to finish.
5552540	5554340	I'm at least going to read the email, and then I'll kick you so you can brace for it.
5554340	5555340	Okay.
5555340	5556980	Because this is GS68, by the way.
5556980	5558420	Unless you want to do the honors.
5558420	5559420	Sure, I'll kick them.
5559420	5560420	Okay.
5560420	5565300	Finally, I would just like to give a shout out to the Orange Lounge chat room for being
5565300	5567020	the best friends I've ever met.
5567020	5571740	I mean, yeah, you guys get crazy sometimes, but it's that craziness that keeps me distracted
5571740	5573620	from whatever is depressing me.
5573620	5576700	And if the depression is too big, it's nice to have an outlet for that.
5576700	5580520	Hell, even when there's no show, I lurk in the chat room just to see who's inside and
5580520	5581980	join in whatever's getting discussed.
5581980	5586020	I just want to say that you guys, and girls, are a great bunch in makeup, a good 60 to
5586020	5589140	70 percent of the fun during the live show, and that I love you all.
5589140	5590140	Aww, sweet.
5590140	5591140	Aww.
5591140	5592140	That's nice.
5592140	5593140	Violin music.
5593140	5594140	Violin music.
5594140	5597100	You guys are what set the difference between listening to this show live and listening
5597100	5598100	to it via podcast.
5598100	5603140	Here's to many more episodes of hilarious chat room moments, and then in, it says, takes
5603140	5604740	a shot of water, I guess.
5604740	5607020	I'm running out of non-alcoholic drink ideas.
5607020	5612580	Anyway, great show, O-L-R-N-D-M-N, and thank you, PoundOrangeLounge, for keeping me sane
5612580	5614100	through the Sunday and Wednesday nights.
5614100	5615100	Love, GS68.
5615100	5616940	That was a very sweet email.
5616940	5622700	You know, comments like that, and the little groupies we have in Orange Lounge, our chat
5622700	5623700	room and everything.
5623700	5627060	Just, you know, keep us going, and let us know we're not wasting our time here, that
5627060	5631300	we really are, you know, letting people have a good time on Sunday nights.
5631300	5632820	It's just about having fun.
5632820	5633820	It's awesome.
5633820	5634820	Okay.
5634820	5636820	Well, next email?
5636820	5637820	Sure.
5637820	5642060	Hi, Sky Dark Sakura, and last but definitely least, Loki.
5642060	5643300	Sorry I had to say that.
5643300	5645860	I love you too.
5645860	5650100	I live in Australia, and I don't know if you've noticed over there, but I've become very irritated
5650100	5655660	at the fact that the Japanese gaming companies such as Square Enix see fit-to-release games
5655660	5662460	like Kingdom Hearts, and a few months later think to themselves, hey, I know how we can
5662460	5666060	rip off some people and piss off foreigners, and then release something like Kingdom Hearts
5666060	5667940	Final Mix.
5667940	5672540	I don't know if they realize it, but not only are they missing out on an incredibly large
5672540	5676620	fan base, but they're leaving a great big gaping hole in plots for us.
5676620	5680360	I understand that they may be busy, but really, think of the children.
5680360	5682420	That was in bold text, by the way.
5682420	5686660	Also, I'd like to point out that I'm trying to spread the word to every online community
5686660	5691460	I'm in so that we can reach our goal with eye of judgment, or as it's more commonly
5691460	5694700	known, that piece of trash would rather burn.
5694700	5698820	Thank you all for something to keep me laughing on the bus in the morning with numerous strange
5698820	5705380	looks, and as I'm listening to the podcast on my PSP, I shall try to get on the chat
5705380	5707300	room one morning and join in on the fun.
5707300	5709340	You're sincerely one-winged angel.
5709340	5712060	All righty.
5712060	5715300	I'm glad to hear we're making the wheels on the bus go round and round.
5715300	5716300	We have more.
5716300	5717300	Okay.
5717300	5721780	But this one's actually a poem.
5721780	5724140	Oh, yay, Poetic Emails.
5724140	5725420	By Strip Majong.
5725420	5727380	I love that name.
5727380	5728380	That's great.
5728380	5729380	Okay.
5729380	5733380	This is called The Lay of OLR, or Damn It I Wish I Had Remembered to Upload Some Extra
5733380	5736220	Podcasts Last Night.
5736220	5740940	I sit and stare at my computer screen and eat my workday lunch of fine cuisine.
5740940	5746020	I browse through my podcast list, which grows thin, wondering where my OLR has been.
5746020	5747260	Is it Thursday already?
5747260	5752700	Far too long since last I heard that OLR theme song, or the classic Game of the Week segment.
5752700	5754700	No F's either.
5754700	5756420	At traffic, none vent.
5756420	5759820	I direct my browser to the website and am reminded of why I'm in this plight.
5759820	5765020	The OLR crew could not meet Sunday, for that real-life thing had to get in their way.
5765020	5769900	I sit back in my chair and give a sigh, longing for this show on which I rely, to help ease
5769900	5775140	the pain of a boring job, and yet no anger I can feel at Rob, DarkSakura, or Loki, since
5775140	5778860	these three give us so much entertainment for free.
5778860	5785460	And so to next week's show I now look toward, but for the moment, damn, I'm freaking bored.
5785460	5786460	Aww.
5786460	5788340	Well, here we are.
5788340	5789340	We're back.
5789340	5790340	Hi.
5790340	5791340	Heart, heart, heart.
5791340	5793460	And then someone wants us to put a song in rotation.
5793460	5795260	What song's that?
5795260	5800860	The Elder Scrolls IV intro song.
5800860	5801860	Guess what?
5801860	5802860	It's already there.
5802860	5803860	It's already in rotation.
5803860	5807900	It's just that you're probably not listening quite long enough to actually hear it.
5807900	5810140	So it's actually there.
5810140	5815020	But does that mean they want to hear it on the show, or do they want to hear it in the
5815020	5817340	24-hour rotation that's on the station when we're not here?
5817340	5822540	I'm thinking in the rotation, because, I mean, just suggesting a song to put in is what it
5822540	5823540	looked like.
5823540	5826140	And then the mailbox just went down, so that's the last one I'm going to read.
5826140	5828140	Well, here, I'll give you a little taste.
5828140	5833460	There you go, that's all you get.
5833460	5838260	All right, wonderful, yeah, it sounds like the Wi-Fi might be down in studio again.
5838260	5839260	It just came back.
5839260	5841820	That's the perfect time for that to happen.
5841820	5842820	All right.
5842820	5846900	And finally, the computer that broadcasts out the signal for Live 365 and all that stuff
5846900	5847900	is wired.
5847900	5851700	We actually have a ginormous wire that runs all the way out here into the garage just
5851700	5855380	for this computer so that we don't have those types of problems on here.
5855380	5860140	So anyhow, one more story for you guys, and we're going to open up the Skype line, and
5860140	5863420	that has to do with Guitar Hero 3.
5863420	5867740	Activision is going to be offering refunds for the Wii version of Guitar Hero 3, yes,
5867740	5870060	all over that whole sound issue.
5870060	5874300	Remember about how the sound was a mess, it wasn't actually the surround sound or whatever,
5874300	5878020	it was all mono sound or what have you?
5878020	5883140	Activision is offering refunds for that, so if you do not want to actually replace your
5883140	5886500	disk, you can actually replace the disk with money.
5886500	5888060	You can get a refund.
5888060	5893060	So if that's something that interests you, check Activision's site for more details.
5893060	5899100	Although, seriously, just stick with the game, the game's fine.
5899100	5902580	But I understand, some of y'all have those big sound systems and things like that you
5902580	5906660	don't want to cut back on all that.
5906660	5910680	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for your telephone calls.
5910680	5917000	The number to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
5917000	5920380	The phones are open now, I just turned them on.
5920380	5922980	So go ahead and give us a call, and we will talk to you.
5922980	5926980	We're going to take a couple calls tonight, not a whole lot of them, but I'm sure some
5926980	5931140	of our listeners have some things to say about things like DJ Hero, maybe the XNA, I'm really
5931140	5933020	curious to see what you guys have to say about that.
5933020	5936380	Meanwhile, while we wait for the buffer and for folks to get the phone number and call
5936380	5938580	in, do we have any last minute stories?
5938580	5939580	Yes.
5939580	5945460	Magic the Gathering is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox Live Arcade.
5945460	5950180	So suck it, I have judgment.
5950180	5955620	Microsoft of course and Epic announce Gears of War 2 coming November 2008.
5955620	5959740	No word on the details of what's going to be in that, but of course the Unreal 3 engine
5959740	5962060	has been enhanced and all fun stuff like that.
5962060	5963620	All right, let's go to a call.
5963620	5964620	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
5964620	5965620	Who's this?
5965620	5967620	Hello, this is RossDielUT.
5967620	5971900	Well, hello RossDielUT, what is on your mind?
5971900	5975100	Not much, not much, just a few things.
5975100	5977960	First off, yes, I was going to mention the whole EA deal.
5977960	5989340	I was incredibly relieved to hear that they rejected the EA's offer.
5989340	5994120	I think we all know that it's basically they're trying to get rid of the NBA 2K franchise
5994120	6000460	because the NBA has so far been resistant towards exclusivity talks and this is pretty
6000460	6002740	much all they have left.
6002740	6003960	I agree.
6003960	6007060	What better way to get rid of your competition than buy them out?
6007060	6014260	Yeah, but it's good to see that Take-Two realizes that sticking around and keeping their company
6014260	6017180	is going to make them more money in the long run.
6017180	6023340	They already had a hit with Bioshock, they're going to have an enormous hit with GTA 4,
6023340	6035300	and NBA 2K is doing amazingly well, so there's really no reason to jump ship just yet.
6035300	6040540	I just think EA creates such a monopoly out there in the marketplace.
6040540	6045660	We're starting to get to this point where you've got EA, Activision, Nintendo, Sega,
6045660	6050980	Namco, Konami, and there's less than ten at this point, you know what I mean?
6050980	6052460	It seems like back in the day there were a million.
6052460	6060100	It hasn't gotten that bad yet, but that is the direction we're going and it is sort of
6060100	6066380	sad because you see that happen and pretty much innovative game ideas would be impossible
6066380	6068380	under that environment.
6068380	6076100	We all saw what EA did to Origin, Bullfrog, and Westwood.
6076100	6082900	People just have to remember that they also don't have to buy Madden every single year.
6082900	6086980	The thing is, I don't think it's gamers who buy Madden, it's sports fans.
6086980	6092060	They probably don't buy anything else, which is why EA doesn't really have to try.
6092060	6093700	I think you're absolutely right.
6093700	6098420	I think that's the whole reason an Xbox 360 core edition exists is for those people.
6098420	6103300	There are people that bought an Xbox 360 for Madden and that's it, you know what I mean?
6103300	6106340	And that's it, and that's not going to be a market for third parties, and I think most
6106340	6113220	third parties realize that, because that's probably what, two million people?
6113220	6119660	That's what Madden sells, are you like one million and a half, two million every year?
6119660	6122460	I don't think the only people that buy Madden are those type of people.
6122460	6125060	It's probably a certain percentage.
6125060	6128380	Probably there's a percentage of that million that buy nothing but Madden and maybe the
6128380	6134180	other occasional sports game like the basketball game or the street or underground editions
6134180	6136780	and racing games here and there, that's it.
6136780	6141100	But yeah, that's clearly not the majority of the gaming audience and I would really
6141100	6145820	hate to see the entire industry screwed up by that.
6145820	6153340	Although I do see a silver lining, we all saw what happens when the actual talent leaves
6153340	6155860	and they rebrand.
6155860	6159900	If I remember correctly, Molyneux was part of Origin originally, if I remember correctly,
6159900	6161700	and then he went on to form Lionhead.
6161700	6164260	I think you are correct.
6164260	6170160	So I think we're going to see that eventually, especially with a lot of studios like BioWare.
6170160	6175060	They don't do a lot of sequels, they might just stick around to complete Mass Effect
6175060	6177500	and then be out, just pack up and rebrand.
6177500	6179420	You see that a lot in this industry.
6179420	6182580	That's very true, you do see a lot of guys getting up and leaving.
6182580	6184300	Especially for EA.
6184300	6189500	Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?
6189500	6192620	Just a personal note about the show itself.
6192620	6197540	I do enjoy the show, but I do have to say this.
6197540	6207000	I do wonder why we get so much into the mod talk, like the letter segment.
6207000	6210860	That guy was making a flimsy excuse, we all know he wants to steal Wii games.
6210860	6219580	I don't see why you guys have to serve, basically, thieves.
6219580	6225260	That always troubled me and as much as I like the show, that always sort of tugged at me
6225260	6227140	a little bit.
6227140	6231660	I think from our perspective, this show is about the gaming community and all the things
6231660	6236520	that are going on in the community, the good stuff and the stuff behind closed doors.
6236520	6240260	So whether that guy was being honest or not, I suppose we'll never know.
6240260	6245740	But I think it is important sometimes to talk about what goes on in the whole dark side
6245740	6253100	and gaming and all that stuff to see how the companies respond to that or how they don't.
6253100	6257340	For instance, I find this whole thing back and forth with Sony and the people that hacked
6257340	6261340	the PSP back and forth, I find that whole thing hilarious, honestly.
6261340	6266460	In a way, I shouldn't say hilarious, but I find it fascinating how constantly Sony patches
6266460	6268580	it and somebody breaks it.
6268580	6271340	That whole is so interesting to me.
6271340	6272340	But certainly...
6272340	6275340	I can certainly see where someone would find that interesting.
6275340	6280300	I just find it disgusting because you see the turnaround, PSP software doesn't sell
6280300	6284220	as well as it should, at least until recently.
6284220	6287100	There are good PSP games and they don't do well.
6287100	6292580	And now you see the same thing is going to start happening with the DS as the R4 gets
6292580	6296740	more popular.
6296740	6300620	Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer.
6300620	6305380	Well, I think at the same time, though, us not talking about it is not going to make
6305380	6306380	it go away.
6306380	6311660	Oh, it's not going to make it go away, but the last thing anyone needs to be doing is
6311660	6315380	giving tips of all things.
6315380	6318020	At that point, you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
6318020	6319020	All right.
6319020	6322740	Well, we've heard your opinion and hopefully you've heard ours, so thanks so much for the
6322740	6323740	call as always.
6323740	6324740	All right.
6324740	6325740	Have a good night, buddy.
6325740	6326740	All right.
6326740	6327740	Bye-bye.
6327740	6328740	Take care.
6328740	6329740	All right.
6329740	6336740	Thank you so much for the call, and we'll see you next time.
6336740	6362220	Bye-bye.
6362220	6369220	Bye-bye.
6392220	6399220	Bye-bye.
6422220	6429220	Bye-bye.
6452220	6459220	Bye-bye.
6482220	6489220	Bye-bye.
6512220	6519220	Bye-bye.
6542220	6549220	Bye-bye.
6572220	6579220	Bye-bye.
6602220	6610220	Bye-bye.
6632220	6639220	Bye-bye.
6662220	6669220	Bye-bye.
6692220	6699220	Bye-bye.
6722220	6730220	Bye-bye.
6752220	6760220	Bye-bye.
6782220	6789220	Bye-bye.
6812220	6819220	Bye-bye.
6842220	6849220	Bye-bye.
6872220	6879220	Bye-bye.
6902220	6909220	Bye-bye.
6932220	6939220	Bye-bye.
6962220	6970220	Bye-bye.
6992220	6999220	Bye-bye.
7022220	7030220	Bye-bye.
7052220	7058220	Bye-bye.
7082220	7085220	All right.
7085220	7092220	Well, anyway, we just could not end the show if we did not have an opportunity to respect our elders by paying tribute to a classic game as we do every week here on the program.
7092220	7096220	It's time for Dark Sakura to bring in her classic game of the week.
7096220	7107220	The classic game of the week is one that I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on.
7107220	7119220	It's definitely one of the top games in the side-scrolling shooter genre, and that is none other than R-Type.
7119220	7123220	R-Type is great.
7123220	7132220	In fact, I'd have to say that R-Type is probably my favorite shooter, even though I'm not all that great at it.
7132220	7140220	This music is like the best ever. The first level music is so much my favorite in the game.
7140220	7143220	So what sets this shooter apart from other games, Dark Sakura?
7143220	7147220	This particular shooter has a very unique weapon system.
7147220	7155220	You get this item called the Force, which is, since you're watching the clip, you see that ball that's right in front of it.
7155220	7165220	You can pick up different power-ups for ones that make it grow based on different types of energy power-ups you pick up.
7165220	7174220	You have a red one that's a counter air laser. That's the one that's on right now, the blue and red sort of spiral-looking laser.
7174220	7180220	You also get a rebound laser that shoots these thin beams that bounce off the walls.
7180220	7183220	Certain weapons are better for certain stages.
7183220	7190220	You also get the counter ground laser, which is basically like a flamethrower that goes out on the ceiling and on the ground.
7190220	7195220	Which is a very, very, very good thing to have for the third boss.
7195220	7200220	Well, actually for the third level, because the entire level is the boss battle.
7200220	7213220	The other various things that you can get are these little spheres that will float above and below your ship that will shoot missiles for you.
7213220	7219220	The other cool thing about the Force attachment is that you can move it around.
7219220	7231220	By the way, the ship one is the third level. You can fire it off and have it sort of hang in mid-air, although it will try to reattach itself.
7231220	7238220	But you can have it attached to the back of your ship and fire the weapon from the back and you can have it attached to the front.
7238220	7246220	In fact, a lot of the bosses are supposed to be really hard, but they all have a trick to them.
7246220	7255220	Like the first one, there's one place where nothing will hit you and you just fire off the Force thing and it will just kill the thing for you.
7255220	7270220	One of the stages is you fight this heart of this creature and there's a place where you can nestle your ship in and fire off the Force thing by the place where the little heart of it pops up.
7270220	7279220	You don't get hit, you kill off all the tentacles and otherwise it's a really intensely long, annoying battle.
7279220	7289220	The game is so hard. I mean, I have often completely died in the first level. I am not the best R-Type player.
7289220	7297220	But I have, however, seen my husband beat this game on one credit and that is hardcore.
7297220	7303220	And on top of that, I've seen someone beat it in the arcade on an actual single quarter.
7303220	7311220	I notice our chat room is in a little bit of a Gradius versus R-Type debate. Care to comment? Is there room for both games or is one better than the other?
7311220	7327220	It's all a matter of what you prefer because Gradius is a different style of shooter, I think. Honestly, and this is again just my opinion, I think it takes a more skilled player to play through R-Type.
7327220	7334220	I really think it takes a lot more skilled and patient of a player to play R-Type.
7334220	7349220	And of course, we've had many sequels since then. We've had, if I am correct in order, after this came, we had R-Type 2 and then, God, there was some other game.
7349220	7360220	Let's see, Super R-Type came out, R-Type Leo, R-Type 3, R-Type Delta, R-Type Final and there's recently been an R-Type Tactics game which still completely boggles me.
7360220	7367220	That's coming out over here in April. R-Type Command. There's still a lot of love for R-Type out there.
7367220	7389220	But this is put out by Iron which, I'm sorry, this is still my favorite game. I actually have the versions of this, the home versions. My favorite version is the TurboGrafx one because it is probably the closest apart from playing it on PlayStation that you'll get to the arcade version.
7389220	7401220	It came out on two HuCards and a little bit of trivia is that when on the Japanese Virtual Console, you actually still have to download R-Type in both parts as opposed to one.
7401220	7413220	And they came out with an R-Type Complete or something that was a PC Engine duo combination that had the entire thing uncut.
7413220	7430220	Also, other games that were rumored to have been spawned by R-Type though were Polestar, although Polestar actually dates back to the very early 80s, but a lot of the gameplay in Polestar is a lot like R-Type.
7430220	7444220	Also, a game called Resnon that came out in 91, very similar. A Magic series core, the game called Magic Dragon that was supposed to be almost everything exactly like R-Type with redone sprites.
7444220	7458220	We haven't seen that before in Super Mario 2. Also, for the game Turrican 2, you actually can see the force in a hangar and the third level of that game is based on R-Type.
7458220	7470220	And another game, and this is actually, I almost picked this as my classic game, but it's a little on the obscure side. It's a game called, if I'm pronouncing it right, Zexes, which is just spelled X-E-X-E-X.
7470220	7482220	And we got it in America as Orius, it's a Konami game. And it's also that same type of shooter game. So, very, very classic. Very good game.
7482220	7489220	Alright. I have my love for Gradius, especially Gradius 2, don't get me wrong, but R-Type.
7489220	7496220	There you have it. Your classic game of the week is R-Type, which you can check out a version of that on the Virtual Console if you are so inclined.
7496220	7499220	And I believe that's available in all the different regions.
7499220	7503220	I do believe so. Just remember, if you are in Japan, you have to pay for two of them.
7503220	7512220	Alright. Well, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for tonight's short show, although it wasn't much of a short show. We've been here for over two hours, so it's almost like just doing one long show with no break.
7512220	7518220	So, you can't say you got ripped off this week, but I am definitely spent. I am done. I'm ready to go rest.
7518220	7523220	So, we're going to wrap it up and go around and give everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?
7523220	7531220	I'm going home and hopefully going to be able to play some Lost Odyssey since everything tonight's reruns, except for the Food Network. They have new stuff on there.
7531220	7538220	My final thought is medication. Menthol. Cough drops. Hooray. Dark soccer, your final thought?
7538220	7543220	Let's have tea will kill me if I don't say it, so reject false icons.
7543220	7548220	There you have it. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.
