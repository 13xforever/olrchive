13985	25588	Tonight, February 24th, 2008, community games come to Xbox Live and Zune, Microsoft officially abandons HD DVD, and Nintendo reveals that there is much more in store for the Wii Balance Board.
27869	36390	Orange Lounge Radio Hi everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36430	38831	We are that podcast dedicated to video games.
39363	42025	Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42085	45268	Yes, we are back from an unexpected vacation last week.
45308	50952	We'll tell you more about what's going down in just a little bit, but it wouldn't be a show if I couldn't introduce my lovely co-hosts.
51673	55656	Over there is the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55976	56296	Yo.
56657	57677	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
58078	58858	I'm satiated.
59499	60319	You're satiated?
60359	60940	That's good.
61320	61560	Yes.
62361	66484	I've had a mostly unsatisfactory day as far as things to dine on.
67145	67925	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
68065	68506	I've had a
70109	72010	Power Bar, and Ice Cream.
100928	102109	That's also pretty nasty.
102349	105412	McDonald's, it's nasty, but in smaller portions.
106713	110677	Burger King, that's the only fast food that's not so nasty.
111218	112619	I haven't had Burger King in a long time.
113440	116943	There's one really, really good thing that they would occasionally have on their menu.
117243	117543	What's that?
117563	118704	That I actually miss.
119005	119325	What's that?
119765	122388	Those chicken sandwiches that were on the long buns.
123420	124101	DarkSakura.com
137031	140612	Well, hello to everybody in our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com.
140672	144193	Also, we're live on Justin.TV with our webcam, and they have a chat room as well.
144213	145073	We try to keep an eye on it.
145093	147454	It's justintv.com slash orangelongeradio.
147514	149094	It always has the video archive of our shows.
149554	155036	You can see our smiling faces, or tonight, according to one of our chatters, frowning face.
157037	159557	It's a comment from a NYR fan in chat.
159597	162338	Chat.orangelongeradio.com says, Rob sounds sad this week.
162779	164220	I'm not sad, I'm just sick.
164580	166341	If it's not one thing, it's another.
166401	168202	You know, last week we weren't here with the show.
169343	172025	What happened is that I was in Long Beach.
172205	173746	William and I were away for the weekend.
173806	175687	We went to the Star Trek tour in Long Beach.
175747	178048	Shut up, don't laugh, it was awesome.
178328	182191	But what wasn't awesome was my car breaking down over the grapevine on the way there.
182571	189135	And so I had to find a mechanic in Long Beach Saturday morning, paid him like $450 to fix my car, but they did do a lot on my car.
189555	190676	And then as I was driving home,
191246	193212	One of the stinking lights came on again.
193232	195520	Something's wrong with something in the oil.
196061	197907	I would explain it, but it would bore you to tears.
198609	200730	I probably told like 50 different people about what's going on.
201270	204192	So needless to say, I couldn't rush home on Sunday and I made it back late.
204292	206473	So unfortunately, we didn't have a show on Sunday.
206613	207794	And now this week, I'm sick.
207934	209194	So if it's not one thing, it's another.
209214	211015	And then we're starting late tonight.
211115	213837	I mean, podcast listeners, you guys don't hear a difference.
213857	220500	But for those listening live tonight, we're about 15 minutes late because the Wi-Fi in studio wasn't working and some of our computers couldn't get online.
220580	222661	So it's just February is broken.
223062	223802	I want a refund.
223822	225263	And Jamie wasn't here two weeks ago.
225303	226623	I mean, February is just broken.
226903	227904	That's because I was sick.
228456	228816	I don't know.
229277	230077	It was nasty, too.
230458	232199	And then we're up against the Oscars tonight.
232759	234060	Yeah, fuck them.
234140	234681	Oscars suck.
234741	235822	Who cares about the Oscars?
235842	236562	It's not even a good name.
236582	239184	A bunch of stuck-up people sucking each other's... Anyway.
239705	241126	Why do they call it the Oscars anyway?
241226	241766	Who's Oscar?
241806	245209	It's the award, but it's actually the Academy Awards.
245429	247071	Yeah, you could probably read it on Wikipedia.
247091	249152	Why did they name it after somebody named Oscar?
249312	250553	I think it's short for something.
251274	252475	Oscar is short for something?
253596	253896	I don't know.
254349	256289	Let's just talk about our gaming week, shall we?
256709	256809	Yeah.
256829	258190	Let's be better than those Oscars.
258250	259650	How was your gaming week?
259690	261830	What games would you give an Oscar to this week, DarkSakura?
262070	266431	Played some Half-Life 2 and lots of Ragnarok.
267171	268331	Now have another character over 100.
268492	272072	Rebirth, by the way.
272452	272712	Addict.
273172	275113	So.
276313	282554	And I played... I looked at my copy of Imagine Babies, laughed, and put it back up.
285379	290323	And then, although it spawned an interesting conversation about whether or not you could raise them like Pokemon.
291944	294206	And I thought it was kind of silly.
296688	305195	And then there was also some more burnout going on in my house, but I think that Dan's getting tired of it.
306156	312962	I think it'd be cool, though, if you could raise them like Pokemon and then have them fight in underground baby cage matches.
313402	314243	That would be great.
315182	317044	It'd be like cockfighting but with babies.
317544	318945	Put little razor blades on their feet.
319866	324851	But babies couldn't actually fight because they don't have any motor coordination when they're that little.
325832	329074	That's why you hop them up on crack and then, you know.
329175	331076	You have a one-year-old battle when they're old enough to walk.
332538	332938	Yeah.
333138	339444	And then I played Wedding the Game, which was me just sitting there going, how much more can I drink?
339464	341766	And that's about it.
343345	346207	Let's see, this week I played a few things.
346567	350549	I got around to playing some Lost Odyssey, and that game is pretty awesome.
351109	360155	It reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy VIII, just not necessarily, well, I guess a little bit like the gameplay, but more of just the environment reminds me of Final Fantasy VIII.
360395	362276	But it's good, and I like the game.
363497	369460	And I played more Burnout Paradise because it's available, and I don't know.
369929	371030	Maybe it's allergic to your job.
399796	406602	I had these screws in it that were too large so it was causing the board to bend too much.
406942	409184	So I replaced them with some different stuff.
409244	421075	I did a 12 volt mod on the fan and also put heat sinks on different chips in there and made heat sinks out of pennies and aluminum tape for the bottom of the board.
421776	424657	So hopefully with all that stuff done, it should work.
424817	428459	If not, I've already soldered in a fan connector for additional fans.
428979	435362	And I just found my Dremel today, so I can cut the case open to put a 120mm fan on it.
436742	437843	Other things I've been playing...
440093	445136	I actually was trying out, and we'll get to some of this stuff later, the X and A community games.
445656	448537	And they had a few that were pretty cool, some that really sucked.
449418	452139	One of which that was pretty cool was The Dishwasher.
452219	453880	I knew it would be The Dishwasher.
454620	458722	The minute I played that game, I was like, this is Loki's dream game right here.
458942	463744	It's not my dream game, but it totally could be a TV series or something like that.
463845	465225	It was just really, really cool.
465245	466726	Something you would see on Adult Swim.
467344	469825	But absolutely bloody game.
470065	473347	It kind of reminds me actually a little bit also of Alien Hominid or something like that.
473887	475788	That's the exact same thing I thought.
475928	476568	That's so funny.
476808	480770	But less shooting, more slashing with swords and stuff.
481910	483091	Other things I tried.
483391	487012	I tried Gummy Car or Jelly Car, whatever the fuck it was called.
489233	489914	It was okay.
490514	492835	I didn't really... I mean, it was a neat idea, but...
493934	495134	Not executed too well?
495374	497215	You know what makes Jelly Car hilarious?
497655	501916	Is when you realize that all the noises are some guy doing it at his microphone.
501956	504277	Like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
504737	505897	Like, that's great.
505977	506498	I'm sorry.
506538	508458	I laughed my ass off playing Jelly Car.
508718	512019	And it's very customizable with its little completely different looks.
512039	514280	Like, you can play the blueprint-looking things.
514920	517300	You can kind of completely change the look of the game and the options.
517441	517761	Check it out.
517821	519121	Oh, I didn't even play with the options.
519141	519441	Oh, yeah.
519521	521682	You can mess with the options and make the game look completely different.
521722	522042	It's great.
522362	522642	That's cool.
523551	525433	Um, other than that, it was alright.
525453	527774	Some of the levels, though, seemed kind of broken, but whatever.
528375	531897	Um, then there was Culture, which was neat.
532138	534720	I don't know, it's an interesting, like, puzzle game, I guess.
535240	535900	With flowers.
536641	537241	Pretty flowers.
537842	540164	And then, um, gosh.
540564	544167	I played that, was it, uh, Little Gamers, I think it was called?
544947	545648	That was okay.
545988	548770	That's actually just based off of a webcomic, I guess.
549430	549791	And it was...
550987	556631	It was okay, but it just reminded me a lot of, like, there wasn't a lot of movement or dodging you can do.
556651	560794	It was just kind of shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, and very bloody.
561014	561795	But, hey, that's cool.
563376	566218	And, um, I don't know.
566258	567599	That was pretty much it, though.
567879	575965	There were some games that they showed off at Game Developers Conference that I wish were on there, like Ice Sheep, or, um, what was it?
576025	579508	There was a dancing one, like a breakdancing thing.
580020	587084	Now, wait a minute, did you, and I'm sorry, I ran in the house and you were talking about your game of the week, but I didn't hear anything about N. Didn't you play N this week on Xbox Live?
587545	588385	I thought you loved that game.
588966	599272	I love N, but I haven't gotten a chance to download it, and I really, I mean, it's, I've played it before, so, you know, it's not, it's not like I'm, I don't know, I don't know what it is.
600033	603255	Also, finally, I was going to say I played Space Invaders Extreme.
603275	606897	I actually was playing that this afternoon, and awesome game.
607572	609973	Really needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game or something like that.
610193	613734	And it's coming out the DS and on PSP as well.
615115	615695	Absolutely cool.
615815	618076	All the stuff in the game kind of goes with the music.
618296	620797	Like when you're firing and stuff, it's all in time with the music.
621257	623418	And stuff kind of remixes a little bit.
623438	625739	It's a little like Mizuguchi and stuff.
625979	627379	They have little bonus things that go in there.
627439	629760	Plus the backgrounds are all really flashy and stuff.
630320	630740	It'll be cool.
631121	632561	Definitely worth picking up when it comes out.
634102	635062	So you're all done with your gaming week?
636105	636525	Uh, yes.
636786	643389	Then I will move on to mine, because I just wanted to say, I did play M this week on Xbox 360, and it was kind of cool.
643549	646411	Well, at least I should clarify, I only played the demo, I didn't play the full version.
646871	648732	I don't want to give a false impression or anything.
649132	655896	But I played the demo of M, because I remember Loki spoke very highly of this game, and I remember playing it a little bit on the free web thing or whatever.
657432	658472	XBOX LIVE COMMUNITY GAMES
681141	685505	But I think, and it's kind of fun, I just think $800 is the wrong price point.
685525	687327	I think $400 would have been a little more appropriate.
687347	688468	I probably would have bought it for $400.
689088	691551	Especially when you consider it's based off a free web game.
691711	693853	Just... I don't know.
693873	697216	I feel like I've played a lot of free games on the web like it.
697356	701079	Although there's a certain sense of humor to end that I think is really funny.
701119	703842	Like I like watching little stick guy get blown to bits.
704242	706304	And it certainly has a very, you know, kind of action pace.
706364	706705	I just...
707469	707769	I don't know.
708069	712310	In this day of those microtransactions, you really kind of think about every point, and I just don't think it was worth 800.
714031	718452	Something that was money well spent, I am madly in love with Lost Odyssey.
718912	728834	This is the game I have totally been waiting for on the 360, and I know, you know, I'm going to admit it, I am kind of biased, well, I don't want to say I'm biased, but I definitely have a preference towards Japanese RPGs.
728874	729954	That's no big secret.
729994	731254	Those are the type of games I like.
731334	732475	I don't play a lot of sports games.
732535	733455	I like these type of games.
733860	738101	and so, you know, the Xbox 360 has been sorely lacking in this department.
738401	743062	We've had Blue Dragon, which was, it was okay, but it wasn't great.
743322	744863	It was a good game, not a great game.
745243	748164	And then we had Enchanted Arms.
748224	748764	Same thing.
749004	749484	Decent.
750624	754385	I think better than a lot of people gave it credit for, but it started to get a little monotonous towards the end.
754685	756486	Lost Odyssey, I'm loving it.
756606	756766	Like,
757495	764217	It's tearing me away from WoW, which is saying something, you know, because you hear about how much I've been playing World of Warcraft lately and doing this stuff.
765257	766598	I cannot put down Lost Odyssey.
767078	769778	And it's funny because I've been reading reviews because I'm kind of curious.
769898	778081	I usually don't read a lot of reviews on the internet, but I was kind of curious what the critics think of Lost Odyssey, and I was very surprised to see on Metacritic that the game only has like a 76 or something like that.
778401	779921	I am shocked.
779961	786203	This is like an old school RPG, you know, it's so old, you know, everyone's complaining that it's like
786866	788011	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
791866	793787	They really didn't change much between each other.
794347	796048	You don't have to innovate on something.
796609	799130	Don't try to reinvent it if it's good in the first place.
799870	802472	And here's a comment in chat I have to respond to.
802712	806374	Chat.NormalNationalCenter.com Ross Steel UT says, so Sky likes games that are all the same.
806814	809296	No, that's your perception of these types of games.
809496	810676	I look at sports games.
810756	813398	I look at these Madden games and I go, they're all the same to me.
813978	814979	These games are all the same.
815039	816720	It's the story that go along with it.
816820	818901	It's not necessarily the combat and stuff.
818921	820422	It's just kind of, yeah, it's fun.
821082	827547	Or, you know, it's grinding or whatever, but... You know, and I've heard people say it's reminded them too much of Final Fantasy.
827587	835754	And I'll admit, there's a lot in this game that reminds me of Final Fantasy X. I wouldn't call it Final Fantasy VIII because it has a good combat system, unlike VIII.
836354	838055	But Final Fantasy X, it really reminds me of.
838075	839216	I like the combat system.
839236	845301	And you know, it innovates it on it enough where, like, I love the ring thing because it makes you pay attention to kind of what's going on.
845865	846486	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
870796	875058	I'm glad we have games like this to hold us over.
876039	883023	You know, if you enjoy Japanese RPGs in the slightest, you are doing yourself a disservice by not at least checking out Lost Odyssey.
883583	889646	Don't listen to reviewers, because their big complaints are they don't like these type of games in the first place, which, fine.
890887	893809	This game is not going to win you over to the Japanese RPG world.
893889	895850	It's not, so, you know.
896913	898837	If you don't like the Final Fantasy games, you're not going to like this.
898957	902803	That's why they have places that rent games.
902924	907171	Just because one guy doesn't like it doesn't mean you should base your opinion on that one guy.
908493	910136	Some of these reviews I read are just like,
910852	913973	Oh, well, this game's been done so many times, that's why I hate it.
914053	914293	No?
914353	915034	Well, who cares?
915634	916334	Action movies.
916974	918935	Oh my god, it's an action movie with guns in it.
919095	920095	Oh, should I not go see it?
920135	921416	Because this one had guns too.
921596	923176	It's just beautiful to watch.
923216	928918	My roommate, who doesn't play a lot of games, the game he's been playing a lot lately is Cold Step Saga.
928958	933260	That's the one game he's been getting really into lately, because he likes the more puzzle-type games.
933720	938782	But he's been watching me play Lost Odyssey, and he's always kind of appreciated the Final Fantasy games too, and he's just like,
939022	939503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
957349	959610	I will kind of put this out there as a disclaimer.
959850	961210	I'm only about eight hours in.
961230	963071	I haven't had a chance to really fully immerse myself.
963351	966872	It could be one of those games that gets shitty and monotonous as it goes on.
966932	967852	That is a possibility.
968113	975235	But for right now, I'm saying it's money well spent, and I've fully enjoyed the eight hours I've put in so far, which is more than some games I've dropped six months off.
975255	983277	My only gripe in the game is these dreams that you have, which are basically reading a bunch of text, and there's no real cutscene.
983357	984718	I would think with a game that is...
985970	986970	I thought the writing was amazing.
1008519	1009900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1039033	1040774	I would have appreciated it more like that.
1042354	1043335	It doesn't even have to be anything.
1043375	1044856	It would be just still pictures or whatever.
1044896	1047877	Just a little bit more effort put into it other than just having text.
1048897	1051579	One more fangasm over this game and then I promise I'll shut up.
1051639	1053599	And you can send your emails about what a fanboy I am.
1055360	1058442	The voice acting in this game is actually really good.
1058782	1060482	And I'm using the English soundtrack.
1060683	1061463	Shock and awe.
1061863	1064084	English voice acting in these games is usually pretty terrible.
1064364	1068026	But I actually think it's very well voice acted so far.
1068146	1068326	I am...
1069379	1070500	I'm like, just shocked.
1071440	1071660	So.
1072200	1073401	And my roommate said the same thing.
1073421	1075121	He's like, wow, the voice acting is actually pretty good.
1075822	1077863	The comic relief guy especially is pretty funny.
1078183	1081884	And just the way the cutscenes are done, all the comic books start.
1081964	1085246	I could sit here for an hour and have a fangasm about how wonderful I think Lost Odyssey is.
1086206	1089427	But I'm going to play it more, and I'll let you know if it starts sucking, okay?
1089547	1091148	I'll keep an open mind about it, but...
1091877	1092758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1116983	1118864	It's kind of one of those games that's really hard to put down.
1119165	1122427	But seriously, rounds in Cold Step Talk can go on for like an hour and a half.
1122928	1123468	It's crazy.
1123928	1124649	But I'm having a good time.
1126450	1127791	I guess I'll do it for my gaming week.
1127931	1128852	I don't have a lot else to share.
1129392	1133415	So, then let's get to tonight's housekeeping.
1134656	1138299	We wanted to formally apologize for last week's show, or lack thereof.
1138800	1140101	You know, what can we say?
1140121	1140901	You get what you pay for.
1140941	1142362	It's a free show, so sorry.
1142863	1144644	And we're here tonight, and actually I gotta admit,
1144943	1146224	Tonight we're only going to do a short show.
1146244	1148245	We're going to do just one part.
1148265	1151007	There's not going to be part A, part B, just because of the fact that I'm sick.
1151047	1152168	I'm having a hard time being here.
1152428	1154149	Any other week, probably wouldn't.
1154676	1155377	www.DarkSakura.com
1177587	1180849	If you're not consistent, then people will go look elsewhere.
1180889	1188614	I mean, not that that's necessarily a bad thing because there's lots of great independent shows out there, but that's how you lose listeners, is that if you're inconsistent, then people look elsewhere to fill in time.
1188634	1192316	So I hate, I hate missing a show, but it had to be done.
1192936	1193857	So that's that.
1195337	1198199	Otherwise, you can join our MySpace community at Orange Lounge Radio.
1198219	1201741	Our Facebook community is the OLR Army, and our live journal community is Orange Lounge.
1201921	1203142	One other thing I want to plug.
1204136	1207758	Completely has nothing to do with video games, but it's another passion of mine.
1208798	1219824	Something I've been getting into over the past six months is these ORGs, these online reality games, where people play games based on reality shows on web forums, if that makes sense.
1219844	1221265	There's a lot of strategy involved.
1221665	1228308	If you're into the strategical thinking that goes behind a lot of shows, such as Survivor and Big Brother and all those types of shows that are on TV...
1229568	1230829	SurvivorLJ.livejournal.com So, there you go.

1283584	1287206	That Netflix is soon going to be streaming to the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
1288047	1292049	And this is based off some type of survey that Netflix has been conducting recently.
1292469	1303776	And the question that was in the survey was this, quote, If as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS3 or Xbox 360, how likely would you or anyone in your household be able to do that?
1304156	1306059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1336444	1347394	EA is rumored to be working on The Sims 3 and this is actually not a rumor because that's according to The Sims Studio creative director Rod Humble and this was on a forum called Quarter to Three.
1348375	1351858	He says, Rod Humble says there will be new information
1352959	1353820	and DarkSakura.
1374461	1375661	Yet another way to kill Sims.
1376141	1381283	I would like to see if Sims 3 comes to light, maybe some type of link between the PC and the consoles.
1381423	1381783	I don't know.
1382323	1389225	Maybe that's just the console fan in me, because The Sims is kind of at heart a PC game, even though they've had all those spin-offs on systems and such.
1389885	1391185	The Sims is kind of a PC game.
1391625	1392345	But it'll be kind of neat.
1392685	1395866	I'm all about connectivity between all the crap I have and my friends have.
1397167	1403128	One other story we missed last week, which I think is kind of funny, there's some filmmakers that are going to be producing a documentary about
1403867	1404693	E.T.
1404834	1405459	Landfill
1407805	1411307	A quote from the Auburn University students who are putting this together.
1411627	1414469	Quote, we are proud to announce our upcoming documentary, E.T.
1414449	1414849	's March.
1415289	1420432	Over the course of a week this March, we will go on a road trip from Auburn, Alabama to El Paso, Texas.
1420892	1427455	From there, we will take the actual path of those 14 trucks took that faithful day into the heart of Alamogordo, New Mexico.
1427896	1430897	Along the way, we will take in the video game culture of our great country.
1431217	1434979	The documentary will be released for free via the internet this summer.
1435319	1436180	I almost went to school there.
1437405	1441107	I think it's kind of interesting that they're going to make a whole documentary about this.
1441408	1445730	Of course, video game documentaries, King of Kong did very well.
1446071	1447411	The DVD should be out now, I think.
1447551	1448072	It is out.
1448472	1449413	I still haven't seen it.
1449933	1450673	I still haven't seen it.
1451234	1451914	I need to borrow it.
1451954	1453175	It's an interesting watch.
1453195	1454336	I need Netflix it or something.
1454376	1455056	I really want to see it.
1455396	1457117	I feel like I'm totally missing something.
1457137	1457538	I'll loan it.
1457878	1458298	Okay, cool.
1458758	1460980	I'll also loan you this other one I have that's really stupid.
1461140	1466143	It's about the first... They claim they're the first ever internet...
1467665	1469627	Kind of like an internet radio show about games.
1469647	1471248	And it's uber stupid.
1472108	1474110	I actually watched the game review show.
1474350	1474850	It's lame.
1475731	1476151	Oh, hmm.
1476492	1476792	Whatever.
1479044	1480285	Let's get to this week's news.
1480325	1482546	That's all I really want to touch on from last week.
1482586	1491270	Last week, ironically enough, was a little bit of a slow news week because this week we started getting into Game Developers Conference and some big bombshells dropped at GDC, correct?
1491491	1491711	Yes.
1492091	1499875	Unfortunately, this year they didn't have keynotes from a bunch of other people like Nintendo and Sony and stuff like that, but Microsoft was there and they were doing their keynote.
1499915	1504097	Their big thing they announced, of course, was the Xbox Live Community Arcade.
1504337	1505798	It will be kind of a
1507068	1507708	Thanks for watching!
1531957	1534219	Tons and tons and tons of stuff out there.
1534379	1538142	Of course, they said now 10 million people on Xbox Live get to play your game.
1538662	1540824	And it's all user-created content.
1541364	1552752	They put up a brief sampling of about nine games or so on there, including some of the way you talked about Jelly Car and Dishwasher and stuff like that.
1553433	1558917	So pretty cool stuff and very exciting, especially if you're into game development and stuff.
1558957	1560518	And XNA, as far as I'm aware, I think,
1561284	1562364	The software is free.
1562424	1565385	All you have to do is pay for the membership if you want to upload your games.
1565405	1566266	$100 a year.
1566566	1571848	So if you're really interested in that stuff, I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will probably all over this kind of thing.
1572928	1577829	I seem to recall he was creating some type of Crazy Eights game from what I was following on a show.
1577869	1578230	But who knows?
1578570	1580590	Now maybe that he'll be able to post it to the world.
1580630	1581391	He might finish that up.
1581451	1581771	I don't know.
1581911	1582571	I'll have to ask him.
1582891	1583811	I haven't talked to him in a little while.
1584872	1585132	And then...
1586235	1593258	And of course, other things that they announced to go along with that is that you will finally be able to game on your Zune as well.
1593838	1602201	They're going to allow XMA games to come to the Zune and you'll be able to play them kind of similar to playing stuff on an iPod or something like that.
1602761	1607663	And they said, of course, XMA Zune games can also support custom soundtracks since it is an MP3 player.
1608384	1612465	And you'll be able to take your games from Windows to Xbox to Zune.
1613726	1613826	And...
1615162	1617223	You haven't really announced anything else additional to that.
1617743	1620804	Now, I don't know if it's just me, this news is fucking huge.
1621265	1621725	This news.
1621845	1622625	This is huge.
1622885	1635571	I think this is like, I think a lot of us saw this coming, but I kind of see this as kind of a turning point in gaming, and I think this is what is going to set the Xbox 360 really apart from its competitors right now.
1636075	1637196	You know what I mean?
1637897	1638938	I think this is huge news.
1638978	1646624	They said at the end of this year they're going to have a thousand games on Xbox 360 and that's not including the Xbox Live Community games.
1647065	1647725	You know what this is?
1648206	1651609	This is YouTube but with video games.
1652264	1656247	Yeah, it's YouTube of games that they were... And that's kind of what it's going to turn into.
1656367	1662291	And I know people's opinions is that a lot of the user stuff is crap.
1662311	1663392	A lot of user-made stuff is crap.
1663432	1665653	And you look on YouTube, and yeah, a lot of YouTube is crap.
1665693	1668395	It's these 14-year-old girls doing their blogs and shit.
1668415	1669156	No one wants to watch that.
1669176	1673679	I understand that a lot of it's crap, but at the same time, I think these people are actually... I mean, YouTube is free.
1673999	1677201	Any idiot with a camera can go and shoot something and throw it up on YouTube.
1677521	1678902	This, you actually pay membership...
1680163	1682204	You have to have the tools to develop the games and stuff like that.
1682224	1684345	You have to be somewhat intelligent to even do this.
1684425	1687967	It's not an easy thing to just throw something together and put it on there and stuff.
1688267	1691889	I would be really interested to see this stuff on here because a lot of it is going to be independent games.
1691929	1697932	You're going to have people that are developing some of these free web games to put it on there now and they can make a little bit of money off it and that kind of stuff.
1698332	1699112	I think that's great.
1699372	1704495	And also at the same time, it's something that Sony or Nintendo doesn't have that they can –
1705233	1706574	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1737502	1746051	You know, and for those that say that the user-created games are crap, fucking go check out that Dishwasher game and the Jelly Car game.
1746352	1750336	Put it next to some of the things that they're actually charging money for on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1750376	1753459	Some of the, you know, they got some crappy games on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.
1754560	1757163	You know, there is certainly some good stuff that can come of this.
1757723	1758244	Absolutely.
1758264	1760286	And there's a lot of great independent games that, you know...
1761215	1769439	So, I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot of crap that you're going to have to weed through, but I think this whole community kind of aspect of it where it's the peer review, I think that's kind of a smart way to kind of weed it out.
1769459	1770980	Not everything independent is crap either.
1771000	1774562	I mean, look at, you know, N Plus started off as an independent game.
1774582	1777023	You have Tamiki Fighters.
1777343	1778924	That started off as an independent game.
1778964	1780505	You have, you know, Everyday Shooter.
1782465	1787488	Just a ton of stuff out there that, you know, was independent stuff that is now becoming mainstream and
1788075	1788836	It's not bad.
1788956	1798782	It's just, you know, a lot of times it costs a lot of these people a lot of money to develop these games, and if they don't have a lot of money to put into them, they can't get a wide release for them.
1798842	1815512	Now this is allowing people that may not have the funds to advertise their game or do anything like that to do a lot smaller scale and advertise their stuff on websites and that kind of thing, and then throw it on this community arcade and have a lot of people actually get to play their game instead of just not ever hearing about it.
1816351	1840935	and I do think that the fact that these games are going to be playable on Zune I think that's huge too because I think Microsoft can really be positioning themselves to do a game handheld if they want imagine if Microsoft releases a portable gaming handheld not necessarily a Zune but something that is more along you know as strictly a gaming machine imagine they release it and they support XNA on this handheld boom this thing comes out it instantly supports thousands of games
1842312	1844953	I mean, that's what I think is big.
1844973	1850956	And I kind of see, like, this could be Microsoft positioning the chess pieces and kind of seeing how much this takes off.
1851276	1854378	How many people do this and put this on their Zune?
1854398	1856418	How many kind of get into this whole thing?
1856979	1862181	So I kind of think this is big news, and we're really looking down the next couple years of gaming.
1862521	1869004	Maybe I'm, you know, running around screaming like a lunatic cultist, which is fine, but I think this is huge.
1869980	1872041	And I look forward to seeing some of the games that are going to come out from this.
1872501	1877343	What do you think they would call it if they did a Microsoft handheld?
1877783	1878963	A Microsoft handheld system?
1879284	1881024	Yeah.
1882665	1885446	Not the Xbox, but the Xbrick?
1885526	1885966	No, I don't know.
1886046	1886686	I have no idea.
1888247	1888707	Xgame.
1888987	1889547	I have no idea.
1891248	1893569	It could be like the Xpaper.
1895149	1895910	Paper, rock, scissors?
1896210	1896470	I don't know.
1897677	1899538	Xbox says Frisbee.
1899718	1900978	Yes, make it sound like a Mac product.
1901018	1901438	There you go.
1902618	1903159	That'd sell it.
1904079	1904539	You never know.
1907060	1908680	What about something like Xbox Go?
1909260	1910741	Something really quick to the point.
1911301	1912021	Xbox Go.
1912081	1916842	Doesn't that kind of have the ring of, hey, it's an Xbox product, but you go and you take it places.
1917883	1918723	I think that's a fine name.
1919643	1922024	But I'm going to trademark that name right now so Microsoft can't use it.
1922844	1923224	Just kidding.
1924164	1926165	Well, I have some interesting news.
1927322	1931124	And you know, everybody, well, for the most part, loves Portal.
1931964	1939067	It's been a big, big internet phenomenon, especially with that psychotic song at the end of the game that's so funny.
1940088	1943389	But that song, Still Alive, is going to be in a rock band.
1945690	1946211	That's cool.
1948171	1949392	This was a triumph.
1950413	1951353	Now we've got to get Moe back.
1953010	1953270	Yeah.
1953590	1955271	You realize we've got to download this song.
1955311	1956871	See, we've got a whole band going right here.
1957191	1958271	Loki can play the drums.
1958752	1959652	You enjoy bass, right?
1959692	1960312	You can play bass.
1960732	1961812	I'll play whatever guitar.
1961832	1963793	I'm sure you should play the drums when we play at the house.
1963833	1965273	Well, then you two can fight over it.
1965473	1966114	I don't really care.
1966134	1967114	I'll play regular guitar.
1967654	1968714	I'm just not singing.
1968914	1970695	Well, Mo can sing because she's got a pretty voice.
1970715	1971495	She can do the singing.
1971795	1973716	And we'll have ourselves a little OLR house band.
1973736	1974596	It'll be fun.
1975456	1976076	And you know what?
1976356	1980117	Maybe by the time that comes out, we'll have the rock band stage kit.
1980518	1982118	We can have the smoke and the lights.
1982748	1983408	Hell yeah.
1983628	1984709	Rob almost snorted his coffee.
1984749	1986750	Are you really wasting money on that stage?
1986870	1989791	I want to get it because it sounds so stupid that I have to get it.
1989911	1990771	It's one of those things.
1990851	1992852	It's just, I'm not spending money on it.
1993032	1994993	I'll use store credit, you know, obviously.
1995053	1998534	But that is money that you could spend on something more better.
1999355	1999875	More better.
2000035	2000995	Yes, more better.
2001476	2001836	Okay.
2003817	2004437	I'm sick.
2004537	2005257	Leave me alone.
2006718	2008318	I spend money on stupid things, though.
2009179	2009479	I don't know.
2009499	2010919	I'll have to look at it to see what it is.
2010939	2012440	Because if it's something really retarded...
2014243	2015463	Now the chat room is up in arms.
2015543	2016324	Loki must sing.
2016384	2016944	Loki must sing.
2016984	2017964	Loki must play vocals.
2018024	2018404	Yes, you may.
2018984	2019245	Okay.
2020165	2026226	Well, it was also stated, though, that they've confirmed that another portal is in the works.
2027667	2031748	In fact, the words Portal 2 were actually used.
2032526	2038109	In other news, Madden 2010, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts 3, and all these other games confirmed.
2038249	2042371	Well, here's the thing about, you know, the Portal 2 thing.
2042511	2046613	It was kind of like, you know, her comment was, oh, I think that they've announced this already.
2047314	2048794	She didn't say that, you know, they have.
2048854	2050675	But obviously they're going to make a Portal 2, duh.
2050915	2054417	I mean, oh my god, sequel to a game that made a lot of money?
2054597	2054938	Hmm.
2054958	2058780	I always think it's funny that it was a throwaway to begin with, pretty much, wasn't it?
2059220	2061561	I mean, it was more of a nod to an old project.
2062162	2062722	Not really.
2063002	2065664	Well, I think it's because we all know it's coming.
2065764	2066244	Hello!
2066344	2074568	I mean, Portal, little game with not that big a budget, I don't think, has humongous success and practically a cult following.
2075688	2077069	God's gonna have a sequel.
2077369	2079430	It's kind of last year's Katamari Damacy.
2081491	2084052	Let's just hope they don't run it into the ground like they did Katamari.
2085413	2086413	That's my only concern.
2087363	2089124	Can too much Portal be too much of a good thing?
2089224	2089705	Absolutely.
2090065	2092827	Actually, too much Portal when you're intoxicated is too much of a good thing.
2094508	2100771	I fully support Portal 2, but when we start getting Portal DS, Portal PSP, Portal your brain out.
2100811	2102032	Could you imagine Portal DS?
2103593	2105674	Yeah, it would be all sorts of lame.
2106274	2112538	Yeah, no, I just stick to the formula that works, make little improvements as you need to.
2113078	2113499	That's fine.
2113539	2115500	How about multiplayer Portal?
2115865	2116345	There you go.
2116525	2117306	Might be kind of fun.
2119226	2121087	That would be a processing nightmare.
2121447	2123928	Just put a giant knife on the end of the portal gun.
2123968	2124469	There you go.
2125529	2125989	Yeah.
2126109	2126890	Portal deathmatch.
2126990	2127970	Giant bayonet.
2129591	2131251	Imagine what a portal deathmatch would be like.
2133012	2134293	Confusing as hell.
2134333	2135633	With no actual weapon.
2136234	2141856	Of course, the comparison between Portal and Katamari leads AJ Mix in our chatroom to say, me and my portal.
2143004	2143944	That would be cute.
2143964	2146365	Son of Dad says, Portal 5, Disney Edition.
2149866	2150406	Oh, lordy.
2152967	2153727	We'll see what happens.
2154047	2157108	A game that I'm kind of looking forward to, strangely enough, Fable 2.
2157648	2160268	Even though the first one kind of lost interest in everyone.
2160288	2160969	I'm all over this game.
2161129	2164470	I am all over some of these more recent announcements.
2164950	2165610	I think this is great.
2165870	2169791	And one of the huge things that they announced in Fable 2, co-op play.
2170600	2174281	That's pretty big for a somewhat role-playing adventure game.
2174541	2175542	You get co-op play.
2175622	2183324	So if you and someone else own Fable 2, you can suddenly go into their single-player world, do your thing, and then leave.
2184504	2186465	Just spread rumors about them?
2186565	2188086	Well, the same idea like in Crackdown.
2188126	2190206	If somebody's playing the game, you just kind of hop in and join.
2190246	2191186	Hello, and leave.
2191567	2199129	In the demo that they showed, actually, Jamie, Peter's character, who is a woman,
2199534	2200134	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2229413	2235919	I have very high hopes, so I'm hoping I'm not let down, but I am a little bit worried.
2237961	2241704	Also, you have the little doggy companion that follows you and all that good stuff.
2241945	2248691	And also, this is big, Xbox Live minigame that will interact with the full Fable 2 game.
2249432	2250013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2269690	2270211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2290136	2292558	or you can do 50-50, so that's kind of neat.
2292738	2297902	What would happen, though, if a really high-level advanced character came into your world and gave you an uber sword?
2298802	2301945	Is there anything to safeguard the game from essentially cheating like that?
2301985	2310511	I don't know about that, but, you know, if it's like some Final Fantasy games, you have to be a certain level before you can use, you know, X sword, but yeah, I mean, sure, why not?
2310551	2312352	Trying to think back to the first Fable, it's been so long.
2312372	2319397	That's what we did in Crackdown, you know, someone would come in with a rocket launcher and give it to you, and there you go, now you have a rocket launcher, it makes the game a hell of a lot easier, so.
2321397	2325140	Well, I'm looking forward to this game and checking it out.
2325180	2326321	That's pretty cool.
2327402	2329564	It's kind of funny, the whole Xbox Live connection.
2329584	2330645	You know what it reminds me of?
2330965	2333608	It reminds me of the Pocket Station.
2334008	2335249	Remember Chocobo Breeding?
2335289	2336930	It wasn't Chocobo Breeding.
2336950	2342876	It was some type of Razor Chocobo, like a Tamagotchi type thing that you could have on a little Pocket Station for Final Fantasy VIII?
2343236	2343516	Yes.
2343976	2348040	Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that, but instead of something in your pocket on the go, it's Xbox Live.
2349744	2350044	I don't know.
2350464	2351444	That's the comparison I get in my mind.
2351464	2359866	The great thing about the Pocket Station game is it'll play itself, so all you have to do is just leave it on a PlayStation system and just leave it running for days at a time.
2360366	2360686	Boom!
2360746	2362947	You come back and you have thousands of items.
2364707	2364987	Awesome.
2365387	2365587	Nice.
2365607	2366647	Well, I'm looking forward to Fable 2.
2367547	2370728	Another game that's coming out here pretty soon in the U.S.
2370748	2371588	will be Wii Fit.
2371688	2373709	Nintendo has officially announced a date for it.
2373749	2374929	It's going to be coming out May 19th.
2376432	2381234	And also, around the same time, the WiiWare service will be launching in the U.S.
2382035	2383075	May 12th.
2383875	2385856	And they did have a press release and stuff.
2386136	2392059	Of course, this game is insanely popular in Japan right now.
2392559	2396981	Just absolutely selling millions of copies, and I'm sure it will do the same over here.
2398502	2398682	Just...
2399648	2403271	It's going to keep Wii Mania alive in soccer moms' households.
2403511	2404772	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2404852	2406313	Just need them to announce another.
2406653	2408214	See, I knew this was coming out this time.
2408254	2412437	In fact, I know when some other games are coming out, but I can't say that.
2414038	2419842	But yeah, Wii Fit's going to be doing awesome, and there'll be some other games before it that'll be even more awesome.
2420863	2424105	I'm looking in the chat room, and let's see, who called it Wii Fat?
2424205	2425526	Somebody called it Wii Fat.
2426287	2427288	I think it was GS68.
2427388	2428829	It'd be like an eating game.
2428849	2429249	Yeah.
2429893	2447056	uh eat as much as you can then get on the balance board uh and then um I'm very happy that we finally have a date for WiiWare finally kind of after all this speculation oh it's gonna be out last Christmas oh I guess first quarter oh second quarter now we have a date so that's finally when Nintendo will kind of be
2447988	2452149	Get on board with what everyone else has been doing for years already.
2452169	2453989	Well, it's something else that they're enacting.
2454009	2456330	It's a payment service called Wii Connection Pay and Play.
2456350	2458170	It's that you can buy the WiiWare stuff with Wii Points.
2477563	2479224	I think that's kind of interesting.
2479244	2482967	I mean, they said there's already, you know... We've got that with the virtual console, pretty much.
2484068	2485329	This is a little different, though.
2485369	2488011	This is actually for online play in certain games.
2488051	2489692	You have to pay with Wii Points.
2490493	2492715	And it's for download content and that kind of thing.
2492735	2494456	That's what I was getting to.
2494476	2495117	Oh, go ahead.
2495877	2496357	That's okay.
2496418	2497398	We've pretty much already said it.
2499420	2500801	I've heard this concept...
2501431	2512518	said before for what Xbox Live should have done, is that especially for these retro arcade titles that you play them once and you're kind of done, wouldn't it be nice if you actually only played a quarter to play Tron?
2513118	2513979	Oh, here's a great example.
2514399	2518822	I love Tron, but Disks of Tron, that game gets old a little bit fast for me.
2518962	2523865	I don't know, it was one of those games that's better left in my memories of being a seven-year-old, is Disks of Tron.
2524205	2530429	So I wish I could have only paid 25 cents to play it once and then be done with it.
2531021	2531321	DarkSakura.com
2561677	2565420	Gerardimo in chat asks a good question, says, but Rob, isn't that what the demos are for?
2565440	2569142	Mm, kinda, but what if you can get really far on one quarter?
2569282	2571104	I mean, that's how the old school arcades work.
2571144	2572985	Sometimes you're really good at a game naturally, you know?
2573045	2574766	I took this news as something totally different.
2574806	2591097	I thought that this was going to be, like, extended services that they're going to be adding to, like, we say, for example, voice chat or something in a game, and you would have to pay extra for that kind of thing, because they were saying that, I thought they were saying that this was actually going to be used in disc-based games as well as,
2592138	2616757	um you know the WiiWare games and stuff but I guess I read that wrong I don't know because I was understanding you know okay their service kind of sucks right now as far as what they have available online and so some stuff they were going to add later on or in order to finance that they were going to charge for some of the services like say for example you know leaderboards or friends lists or something like that online similar like live services but
2619628	2621939	One of the other things I was going to bring up is that
2623124	2627267	There is the whole Nintendo channel.
2627908	2636615	We're supposed to be getting that over here and in Europe, which will let you get to screenshots, videos of new games, play demos of DS titles.
2637996	2641018	And then after you've played for an hour, you can rate it.
2641439	2643600	But you only, of course, do that through the Nintendo channel.
2645061	2650546	And it'll keep track of what you play, what you use to find new games.
2650606	2652127	So it's basically...
2652591	2653011	TVO, SD Cards
2674892	2678515	You'll get manuals online, too, from the Wii Shop channel.
2679256	2683019	So you can check them out so that you know what you're paying for before you do it.
2686502	2689345	And you can only get them, of course, through your Wi-Fi connection.
2690005	2692507	And they're, again, going to be based on what you like.
2693288	2697171	Another thing that they're launching in Japan that we're probably not going to get is...
2700226	2705751	Another type of channel that shows TV program listings so that you can see what you want to watch.
2706171	2709934	Then again, we basically already have that already built into cable.
2710255	2711055	TV Guide Channel.
2711135	2712036	Yeah, the TV Guide Channel.
2713637	2720303	And it doesn't really say anything else about that, but they're saying that they're not going to bring it out anywhere else yet.
2722425	2722685	Huh.
2723005	2723286	Interesting.
2723306	2727329	I doubt we're going to get that since I think it's all for Japanese channels anyways.
2727952	2730293	Unless we really care what's on Japanese TV, I don't know.
2730733	2738117	You know, between everything Jamie's saying here about what's coming to the Wii and what we were talking about earlier with the XNA Creators Club, this is going to be a really big year for digital distribution.
2739037	2743459	And then if the Netflix thing turns out to be true, this is a big, big year for download stuff.
2743619	2744960	I think that's the way everything's going.
2745520	2746981	I think we've all known that for quite some time.
2747001	2748101	This is kind of interesting.
2748482	2749402	To see it actually happen?
2749422	2750182	Yes, yeah.
2750643	2750803	Yeah.
2750963	2754464	It's one thing to talk about, and it's one thing to see how it plays out, if that makes sense.
2755625	2755785	Yeah.
2756673	2760034	Well, I'm also curious to see how the Wii Balance Board plays out.
2760194	2766316	And apparently, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé, over 10 Wii Balance Board games are in development.
2766756	2771098	The most common problem with a peripheral, they come out, there's only one or two games for it.
2771418	2773839	If that game fails, the whole damn peripheral fails.
2773899	2775619	Everybody that bought it feels like they wasted their money.
2776240	2784022	Now it seems like, you know, when these peripherals come out, companies are throwing a lot of money behind it to try and make them take off.
2784042	2786143	And that's certainly one thing that they're doing with the Wii Balance Board.
2787041	2790082	Maybe the fact that it's already done so well in Japan helps, who knows.
2790142	2794724	But Reggie Fils-Aimé commented in something he was speaking to with IGN.
2794764	2798525	He said, quote, there are over 10 games in development that take advantage of the balance board.
2799686	2804647	All we know so far would be Wii Fit and then the skiing game that Namco's putting out, but who knows what else.
2805067	2809389	Could it be that the other Wii balance board games are some of these download titles that you'll be able to play?
2810329	2811870	Or another WarioWare game.
2812810	2814691	Oh, I bet a WarioWare game's a given, actually.
2815051	2815631	That's a good thought.
2817637	2833043	To kind of go back to that last story we were talking about, Nintendo's Takashi Aoyama, actually they were saying his description of the service was that Nintendo will begin collecting fees for some services that will allow us to adapt flexibility.
2833383	2839185	So in other words, it's subsidizing additional services like new channels and stuff like that.
2839785	2842147	And it will be something that's on boxes.
2842207	2846470	Like they said, it's going to be an orange logo that's going to be right next to the Wi-Fi Connect logo.
2846510	2848592	So I think this is something additional.
2848712	2856137	It's not just like an arcade kind of format where you pay X amount of Wii points to play a game or something like that online.
2857018	2858759	So I don't know.
2859259	2860640	We'll have to see when it finally comes out.
2861441	2864743	SSJ100Matt says, Why couldn't anyone bring back the Sega Activator?
2867045	2868686	Speaking of peripherals that didn't do so hot.
2870498	2875821	Well, that's another reason why games like Parapar didn't really take off either.
2876462	2878003	They had similar type of peripherals.
2879263	2880024	I have an activator.
2881365	2885267	I had one, and I disassembled it because I was going to turn it into a Parapar controller.
2885907	2886708	Isn't that ironic?
2886728	2891211	I had no time in my life that I owned an activator.
2891411	2898575	Anyways, so another game that of course we're looking forward to pretty soon is Mario Kart Wii.
2899316	2907244	and luckily the rest of the world knows when it's coming out, except the US.
2907625	2908426	Isn't that ironic?
2909307	2919077	But apparently though, Mario Kart Wii will be hitting Japan on April 10th, also coming to Europe the day after on the 11th.
2920240	2921301	So that's pretty awesome.
2921341	2927324	Of course, it's going to be bundled with the Wii wheel, a piece of plastic crap that you're going to stick the remote in.
2927764	2930105	However, you do not need to use that to play the game.
2930305	2933067	In fact, you'll have as many control options as Smash Bros.
2933127	2933347	did.
2933467	2936809	So that's awesome, including GameCube and classic controllers.
2936849	2944693	Okay, if I use Logic, if it's coming out the same week in Japan and Europe, wouldn't it be logical to say that's going to be the same time frame we get it here?
2944993	2946674	I mean, that would be my guess.
2949181	2951543	Well, I have some fun news and stuff that, uh,
2978855	2981477	Actually, I can say when it's coming out because it already has.
2982777	2985118	And this is our UK virtual console.
2986819	2992943	And this is pretty cool because this is actually, speaking of the Activator, this is a game that I bought with my Activator.
2993863	2994884	It was Eternal Champions.
2995944	2996245	Nice.
2996705	2997865	I love Eternal Champions.
2998586	3000667	Actually, I love Eternal Champions CD a lot more.
3001087	3002388	That was a really good transition.
3004491	3007932	No, I'm just saying from the Activator to the Eternal.
3007952	3009573	That was a really good transition, that's all.
3009913	3010273	Oh, okay.
3010513	3012394	I just want to take time out to acknowledge that really good transition.
3012434	3012714	Thank you, Rob.
3012734	3013215	You're welcome.
3013415	3016616	I feel very confident now in my announcing skills.
3019217	3019897	Thank you.
3021558	3023579	As if an endorsement from me is what's needed.
3023619	3024399	All right, I'll shut up.
3024439	3025219	I'm ruining the show.
3025239	3026120	No, you're not.
3026960	3029121	Anyway, Eternal Champions is like one of those, like,
3030531	3033392	If you have wanted violence in video games, this is what did it.
3033472	3042574	You had your overkills, how each level would have this super destructive, violent move.
3043134	3046195	You had people from all over the world and all through time.
3046235	3050096	You had a robot kickboxer and a caveman.
3051937	3055337	What's your face that had the really cool snake-looking dress thing?
3055958	3056498	She was really cool.
3056758	3057258	I didn't play it.
3057788	3059349	Do we have any Sega CD games that have come out on Wii?
3059369	3059529	Sega CD?
3087850	3088791	Not that I can think of.
3088851	3098215	If we're getting Turbo Duo games, and why can't we get... Night Trap on virtual consoles?
3098415	3102858	Please say we can have... Or, dude, I want Criss Cross to make your own video.
3103058	3103298	Rob?
3103958	3104258	What?
3104939	3105659	I have that game.
3108004	3108524	Fantasy Star 2
3136969	3140051	Which is... It's another 800 Wii Points game.
3140592	3146796	And it's actually, I'd have to say, probably tops to me in the series because it had Ney in it and she was really cool.
3148297	3151539	DJ Dark Knight in chat would like you to know the girl's name was Jetta Max.
3151819	3152320	That was it.
3152600	3152940	Thank you.
3154561	3157523	And I should have remembered that because my favorite character on Gem was Jetta.
3158023	3158824	But that's another story.
3160865	3161966	Plus it's a pretty cool car.
3164008	3164248	Okay.
3164928	3165228	Alright.
3165589	3166009	But, um...
3167902	3189624	for the Phantasy Star games, it was like you had your different viewpoint where you played from behind the characters and could attack for your different scenes and your little dungeon crawl areas it was really cool, I'd have to say the story wasn't all that great, but it was just a fun game to play
3190610	3209535	and moving forward we also have Street Gangs that was a Nintendo NES game for 500 points and it's not worth and actually the cool thing about this is you want to know what's super cool about it?
3209775	3209975	what?
3210875	3219377	River City Ransom is what it is ah okay yep which the Japanese name of it was Hot Blooded Downtown Story
3220011	3222312	When the guys die, did they actually say, BARF!
3249264	3251086	They make more punch noises.
3251126	3251306	Do they?
3251646	3252127	Like, ooh.
3253107	3255269	Because that's all I remember is in the NES one.
3255529	3257411	When he killed people, they'd go, barf!
3258932	3268741	Well, I will have to, if you would like, I would have to find my burn of the PC Engine Duo ones that you can see.
3268881	3269001	It's
3269548	3270088	Psychic Storm
3297475	3300077	And this game has a subtitle.
3301538	3302859	Dan calls it, I Get Pissed Off.
3304560	3310884	Because when they say Psychic Storm, they say it in a very thick accent, and Dan thinks they're saying, I Get Pissed Off.
3311404	3321171	And there's another one that I'm going to have to get from a friend of mine that I think I've talked about on the show before, that's called Sylphia, where it's a shooter game with fairies.
3322751	3323191	Interesting.
3324011	3332453	I would be, actually, like, maybe we could do something where, like, we bring in a whole stock of games, and, like, we'll play each game for an hour, and we let the chat vote on which game we'll play next or something.
3332493	3334694	Did you know it's going to be over as soon as I put Dracula X in?
3334714	3335834	Because you won't get me off that game.
3337115	3338055	Maybe save that for last.
3338075	3338355	Who knows?
3338375	3339035	All right.
3339075	3345057	But anyway, the last game on the list is Adventure Island for 500 Wii points.
3345137	3347857	And Adventure Island is just, it's classic.
3347897	3350198	I mean, it's...
3351670	3352491	Wonder Boy Monsterland
3371880	3377402	Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island
3397205	3406208	You know, though, I would really, really like to see... I haven't seen, at least as far as I've paid attention, I haven't seen any of the Alex Kidd games.
3410129	3410769	Maybe someday.
3411629	3413670	I would personally like to see Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
3415510	3417251	You seem to bring that up every chance you get.
3417271	3418531	You want Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
3418571	3420271	One of these days it's going to be my classic game.
3420952	3421192	All right.
3421512	3422192	Not anytime soon.
3423223	3424285	Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan
3433735	3440298	Coming out on February 28th, Call of Juarez and the Idolmaster live for you on the Xbox 360.
3440738	3445840	Idolmaster is pretty big over in Japan, and so it's a pretty big title coming out this week for them.
3446741	3450902	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, nothing!
3451383	3454284	But you do get Guitar Hero 3 next week, so stay tuned for that.
3455264	3461247	Also in Japan, coming out on the Nintendo Wii, ChoroQ Wii, sorry, ChoroQ Wii.
3462099	3462820	Uchi Suri Sega Bass Fishing
3480444	3483967	will be coming out as well on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week.
3484007	3488590	Moving on to the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3 Takedown comes out.
3488690	3489971	I think that's a price reduction, though.
3489991	3491473	I don't think that's actually a new release.
3492233	3498478	Final Approach 2, First Priority comes out from one of my favorite companies, Princess Soft comes out there.
3499579	3503382	Also coming out, lots of price reductions, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed Underground 2.
3504423	3510207	I like this title, Night Wizard the Video Game, Denial of the World is coming out.
3510930	3511510	That sounds like fun.
3511530	3512511	That sounds so emo.
3512671	3513952	Denial of the world.
3513972	3514672	Deny.
3515553	3525520	Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Soma Bringer, as well as Akajawa Jiro Mystery, Yasu Kyoku is coming out as well.
3526820	3535146	Coming out on the PSP in Japan is Nothing But a New Pouch in Mint Green.
3535826	3536387	Enjoy that.
3536647	3537247	But no games.
3539529	3539849	That's it.
3540345	3542246	The US is getting quite a few things.
3542647	3548150	Pot of Pawn on the PSP, it's a pretty cool rhythm game, also a bit of action thrown in there.
3548810	3556796	On the 360 and PC, no PS3 version for this, Frontlines Fuel of War, another military first person shooter.
3557856	3563440	Lost Viadomus coming to Xbox 360, PC and PS3, good spin off of this show.
3564170	3570852	Turning Point Fall of Liberty on 360 PC and PS3, kind of an alternate World War II shooter game.
3571832	3576514	Naruto Ninja Destiny on the DS, it's a Naruto 3D fighter game.
3577494	3580575	The Sims 2 Free Time for PC.
3582296	3592519	Lost Planet Extreme Condition on the PS3, which includes bonus characters like Mega Man, Frank from Dead Rising, and some of the other characters from the PC version.
3592895	3597638	Blast is only $39.99, so pretty good price for a game that came out a year ago.
3598538	3601000	Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed for the Wii.
3602341	3603061	Looks awesome.
3603541	3604842	Love the Destroy All Humans series.
3605783	3607364	Mazes of Fate DS.
3608244	3612787	It's an RPG, kind of a traditional one for the DS there.
3613467	3616869	Agatha Christie's, and then there were none for the Wii.
3618010	3618911	An adventure game.
3620051	3620632	Let's see here.
3620812	3622433	Arma, Gold Edition for PC.
3624394	3627075	Heavenly Guardian for PlayStation 2.
3627455	3630615	It's kind of an anime-style 2D shooter game.
3631536	3633816	Puzzle Guzzle for the PSP.
3634416	3638257	That's another... Puzzle Guzzle?
3638337	3639077	Puzzle Guzzle.
3639537	3641498	That is the dumbest name I've ever heard for a game.
3641518	3643638	Sorry to the makers of Puzzle Guzzle, whoever you are.
3643658	3644078	It's Age Tech.
3644098	3645339	But that's a bad name.
3645479	3646319	That is a bad name.
3647719	3649900	Some GameStop-exclusive stuff.
3650300	3651560	Fantasy Aquarium...
3652398	3656840	Yes, you can raise all sorts of different fish and sea life, including dolphins.
3658361	3658881	Seaman 3.
3660061	3661782	I was just going to say, can you raise a seaman?
3662643	3664343	I don't know if you can.
3664584	3667345	This actually is also coming out, not a GameStop exclusive.
3667385	3669646	Block is Portable SteamBot Championship.
3670226	3677669	This is actually a game that was in that SteamBot Chronicles game, which I thought was very niche anyways, and now you can play it away from the game.
3678810	3679810	Yay, I guess.
3681011	3681191	And
3682512	3687714	Let's see, Bubble Bobble Double Shot on the DS, hopefully with level 30 as well.
3691756	3692496	I see what you did there.
3693616	3694177	Exactly.
3695077	3700959	Brain Assist, that's coming out on the DS from Sega, yet another brain training game.
3701480	3703040	Sega Bass Fishing for the Wii.
3703560	3709963	That's not necessarily using the Dreamcast fishing rod, but you can pretend with the Wii Remote.
3711211	3719279	and Spitfire Heroes Tales Royal Air Force for the DS by Destineer because they put out a lot of shit.
3720880	3724323	And I believe that's it.
3724423	3728167	But I like this title that's coming out next week though.
3728307	3731810	It's a horse riding sim.
3731850	3735453	But if you say the name of the title a little bit, it sounds weird.
3735734	3737155	Let's Ride Friends Forever.
3741721	3746543	Don't say that out loud really fast, because that sounds really, really bad.
3746803	3751545	Oh, and Tigers, or Pets, Wild Animals, Tigers game.
3751945	3753865	Yes, because now you can raise tigers.
3754386	3755586	Oh, and Bratz Super Babies.
3756106	3756806	I forgot about that.
3757787	3758247	Hey, Jamie.
3758987	3760368	Let's go ride friends forever.
3762268	3763629	Only friends let friends ride friends.
3768711	3768991	Nice.
3771621	3772802	Oh, is that it for US releases?
3773342	3780966	Uh, yeah, and this isn't really a game, but, uh, the extra guitars for Guitar Hero 3 are coming out for PS3 and the Wii now, so, um... Wii.
3781826	3783307	Yeah, if you're looking for extra guitars.
3784788	3787329	Is that a copy of Bejeweled I'm seeing on the table over there?
3787549	3792832	That's actually already been given away, I just haven't gotten to the post office yet, so... I was like... Oh, it was the week you weren't here.
3793773	3795794	I think I'm baffled by that, but that's okay.
3796034	3797034	Bejeweled 2, even better.
3797234	3797374	Yes.
3797414	3798515	You know what I thought, um,
3798936	3800337	You guys were talking about obscure games.
3800357	3802578	This isn't really obscure, but I guess it's obscure now.
3802978	3803878	Commander Keen.
3804659	3805039	Ooh!
3805939	3806400	Play some of that.
3806420	3806920	I remember those.
3808100	3810642	Bunch of EGA-colored games.
3810662	3811202	That'd be fun.
3811442	3813943	You know what other game, though, I was thinking about just the other day?
3813963	3815864	It was Jazz Jackrabbit.
3817525	3818666	How about Jill of the Jungle?
3819806	3820366	I remember that game.
3820386	3820807	It was rad.
3820847	3821927	How about our UK releases?
3822207	3822748	How about them?
3823228	3823908	You know me, though.
3823948	3826329	My favorite PC game is so super obscure right now.
3827570	3827810	Anyway...
3829395	3831557	On the 28th, we have Lost on PC.
3833419	3834880	Yay.
3835140	3841026	29th, we have 8 Ball All-Stars on DS.
3841687	3845170	We have Asterix at the Olympic Games comic series.
3846712	3851797	And then we have a French version, I think, because the title's in French.
3852861	3863364	We have Beautiful Katamari on the 29th on Xbox 360, Blacksite Area 51, Bleach, Shattered Blade, and the Blade of Fate, Wii and DS respectively.
3863864	3879029	Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed, Fish Tycoon, Frontlines Fuel of War on Xbox 360 and PC, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on Wii,
3880720	3899009	Jamster All-Stars, King of Clubs, Lost Odyssey, Lost Planet Extreme Condition, Namco Museum on DS, Persona 3, Spongebob Atlanta Squarepants, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empire, and Zoo Hospital.
3902371	3905652	Alright, sounds like an exciting week over there.
3906072	3908133	That's a long wait for beautiful Katamari.
3908814	3909394	I would say so.
3911511	3913933	Epic and Apogee are 3D Realms now.
3913953	3917195	They really need to go back and remake a lot of their older games like Shareware.
3917235	3917956	Seriously.
3918776	3921798	Those are some IPs that need to be gone and revisited.
3921878	3922339	Seriously.
3923159	3926221	Who doesn't want a new Jill of the Jungle 3D shooter or something?
3927502	3930324	You know, people are looking for that good female heroine.
3930945	3941596	Well, hey, speaking of new IPs, based on old ideas, possibly, Activision apparently has filed a trademark for a game name called DJ Hero.
3942537	3944419	You just couldn't stop there, could you?
3944479	3945580	You just had to go and
3946212	3953116	You know, I think a lot of us have seen this coming for a long time, and of course the reason why a lot of us... Remember, Orange Lounge Radio, hello, look at our name.
3953456	3960479	We started a long time ago as a station dedicated to music-based video games, and one of them specifically was Beatmania.
3960840	3964622	And I think a lot of us called this a long time ago when we started seeing Guitar Hero's success.
3965002	3965782	It's only a matter of time.
3965802	3971265	If Konami's going to sit on it and not do anything with it, somebody else is going to pick it up and run with it, and I think that's what we're going to see happen.
3972241	3976843	I'm sure Konami is going to license the rights for their controller type design and that stuff.
3976863	3977903	But they've already done one here.
3978003	3984165	So we know that they have trademarks and copyrights in place for stuff like that, like Beatmania.
3985166	3990007	I think Sega does also have the Kraken DJ-1 licensed over here too.
3990207	3992488	But here's what I'm wondering though with this is,
3993218	4004903	Um, really all they're doing, and I mean this isn't that big of a surprise because most buying games are like that too, all they're really doing is just swapping out a guitar for, you know, a turntable and buttons.
4005083	4007384	I mean, if that's what they're going to be doing with this.
4008584	4013526	They're really whoring that Guitar Hero franchise and kind of running it into the ground, I think.
4016207	4017628	I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
4017668	4019208	I don't think it's going to be a clone of Beatmania.
4019229	4020369	I mean, they're not going to do that, but
4020973	4024515	It's going to be interesting to see kind of what happens with it, what they decide to change.
4025736	4030278	I think you're going to see something like frequency amplitude, but with a different type of controller.
4030298	4032679	I don't know what it's going to be, but we'll see.
4033760	4034100	I hope.
4034660	4036161	I hope it's something different.
4036421	4038822	I'm thinking this is going to be announced at E3 this year.
4040283	4040743	Wait for it.
4042544	4044525	I'm sorry, go ahead.
4044806	4045286	Oh, nothing.
4045326	4045546	Go ahead.
4047014	4050177	So Microsoft is officially, well, along with everyone else...
4073559	4078161	They will, of course, still warranty the product and stuff like that, but they're no longer manufacturing them.
4079441	4086664	In other news, and this hasn't really made it out there that well other than a rumor, they have dropped the price to $50.
4089285	4090085	And that's official.
4090225	4096507	So you can actually get one so I can hang it with my LaserDisc player and the Betamax in our closet.
4096567	4098028	I mean, if you're looking for something cheap...
4099488	4100569	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4129451	4129691	Yeah.
4130531	4131452	Thank God I have Stardust.
4131472	4132052	I love that movie.
4132152	4132953	And Batman Begins.
4133333	4134433	Oh, I hope that that comes out.
4134733	4139816	See, I think if you can get a hold of one of these for pretty dirt cheap, I mean, just hold out.
4139836	4141076	It's just like UMDs, man.
4141096	4144277	Those UMD movies, they're dirt cheap because no one wants them.
4144798	4150780	And people start trying to get rid of these things, and I think you'll be able to find them pretty cheap.
4151461	4157163	Plus, I mean, there's no real difference between those and Blu-ray movies anyways as far as image quality goes.
4157303	4159104	So I don't think you're going to notice.
4159594	4170200	Well, I don't know about some of you guys, but me, as somebody who picked up an HD DVD player, I'm mad that it's all over, and that makes me angsty, and that means it's time for the FUs of the Week.
4187654	4194340	My FE of the week goes towards this stupid, clearly compensating for something man driving a truck.
4196102	4198044	We had a very, very rainy day.
4198164	4200606	It was very rainy, very windy, kind of nasty.
4201587	4212317	And there's this one particular turn where it's a little sharper than I think that it needs to be to turn, and it's pretty much a two lane left turn.
4213582	4217863	And so, this one guy was in the inside lane and I was in the outside lane.
4218663	4223805	And when we turned in, he basically cut me off in the middle of the turn.
4224305	4228106	Which isn't, you know, just rude.
4228686	4230286	It's incredibly dangerous.
4230346	4232267	It's something that only an idiot would do.
4233307	4235787	So he cuts me off and then he starts to spin out.
4237028	4242329	And then I start to spin out because I was trying to, you know, avoid the tail end of these
4243055	4245216	Retarded, you know, small penis truck.
4246276	4256519	So, in his spinning out and me losing control, and I actually, you know, steered into it, managed to get myself straightened out.
4256899	4270703	By the time I got my car, you know, back lined up and everything was fine, he swung out again, and if I hadn't stopped when I did, then he would have pretty much taken off my bumper.
4271343	4271543	So...
4274100	4282267	The other really kind of scary part about this is that, you know, there's that, well, I'm sure those of us in the room know, there's that ditch on the side, and I didn't want to go in that ditch.
4283047	4285209	I would have got my car dirty.
4285409	4297739	But it was just really the fact that there are people who should have to take psychological exams before they are permitted to drive.
4298840	4299701	That's what I have to say.
4300695	4310817	This person driving this truck was clearly of poor judgment, very, very poor driving skills, and substandard intelligence.
4311097	4313998	So, F you to stupid people who drive.
4316519	4318139	My F yous ought to be pretty obvious this week.
4318299	4328822	F you to being sick, F you to my car not working completely right when I pay a lot of money for my car, and F you to the Wi-Fi here not working, and just F you to February.
4329882	4330202	That's it.
4332082	4336945	F you to my 360 sort of working, or at least playing games with me.
4337666	4343669	Once I think it's working, I've tested it extensively, I take it to work, it starts up, 10 seconds later it freezes.
4344510	4348132	It really fucking pisses me off because I can't figure out what's wrong with it.
4348792	4355156	Although I'm getting close to where there's nothing more I can fix on it, so I'm going to have to cut a hole in the side of it.
4355696	4358798	Just because I think that's necessary that I get the Dremel out.
4359918	4360639	And it'll look cool.
4362202	4367525	As it is, it sounds like a jet coming out of that thing now that I've, you know, 12-volt modded the fans.
4370406	4371327	Alright, is that it?
4371947	4374528	Yeah, and I broke an intercooler too because I took it apart.
4375409	4375929	Is that it?
4376049	4379511	Yes, but... That's fine.
4381512	4382953	Alright, let's keep moving on with the news.
4382973	4386655	You know, for supposedly being a short show tonight, I don't think we're going to be that short of a show.
4386695	4387015	We'll see.
4387055	4388856	It's just kind of like one long show.
4389616	4390036	That's right.
4390196	4391157	It'll be fun, right, Jamie?
4392540	4392800	Fun?
4394081	4394722	Yeah, fun.
4394962	4395763	We're having fun, right?
4395903	4397324	I have fun the more drunk I am.
4397424	4397844	No, I'm kidding.
4397864	4398044	Right.
4398865	4403549	Anyway, we're fans of the Commodore 64, wouldn't you say?
4403629	4404509	Fuck yes, we are.
4404549	4405350	I love the Commodore 64.
4405490	4406691	By we, I mean Rob.
4409173	4411735	The Commodore 64 was my first gaming system, okay?
4411775	4415818	I mean, I had an Atari 2600, but I played tons of games on Commodore 64.
4415878	4418120	I love the C64.
4418140	4419461	My first one makes me cry.
4419481	4421683	It was the Odyssey.
4422862	4423702	That would make me cry too.
4424783	4425123	Anyway.
4426763	4430884	The Commodore 64 is coming to the European Virtual Console later this year.
4431885	4436966	The first two games to be out are Iridium and International Karate.
4437986	4444168	So it looks to me like they're also going to be charging for them 500 Wii Points.
4446389	4447009	There's not a...
4447851	4452859	Any kind of notice as if we're going to be getting them over here.
4453280	4457006	And I think the other thing that they've recently announced is Master System Games.
4458449	4458589	So...
4461970	4464331	I hope some of the classic Commodore 64 games come out.
4464351	4471195	But then again, I think about it, and a lot of the games I played on Commodore 64 were like ports of arcade games and things that are out in various other types of ways now.
4471275	4471895	So I don't know.
4472255	4475197	But there were some like old C64 games that were kind of fun.
4475217	4476397	But a lot of them required a keyboard.
4476417	4477958	I just want Impossible Mission, okay?
4478058	4478558	That's what I want.
4478858	4479759	That's what I want more than anything.
4484181	4486362	Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel.
4487543	4488043	Or is it?
4488632	4490093	Puzzle Quest Galactrix Puzzle Quest Galactrix
4517955	4518996	or what the deal is.
4519056	4519877	It's Galactrix.
4519977	4520878	It's not Hexic.
4521459	4522620	It's clearly different.
4523642	4527025	But apparently now it has a whole sci-fi theme as opposed to a fantasy theme.
4528247	4528707	You know what?
4530329	4530669	I don't know.
4530689	4532271	I'm going to withhold judgment until I play it.
4532351	4535155	It does look like it has spells and all that good stuff from the old one, but...
4535802	4537502	You know what they say about too much of a good thing.
4537582	4543443	Don't oversaturate the market with all these, you know, subpar puzzle games that you slap the name Puzzle Quest on or you're going to be in trouble.
4543903	4544504	That's all I think.
4544564	4545124	But I don't know.
4545184	4547904	I mean, again, this game might be kind of fun.
4548084	4548524	So we'll see.
4548964	4550505	Dude, Bookworm Adventures is rad.
4551645	4552725	Don't be knocking Bookworm Adventures.
4552745	4553725	Besides, it's two different people.
4553745	4554625	You're talking PopCap games.
4555145	4555565	Somebody else.
4556166	4559066	That apparently likes to take PopCap games and remake them.
4559286	4561006	Puzzle Quest was just like Bejeweled.
4561186	4563087	I mean, that's the only reason Nelly plays it.
4563167	4564647	So, I don't know.
4565720	4568742	Rob with two B's in chat says, I want Puzzle Quest Pirate's Booty.
4569142	4571143	We need a good pirate puzzle game.
4571223	4572163	Oh wait, we have Puzzle Pirates.
4573244	4577626	So EA, being the pompous asses that they are, decided, hey, we're fucking EA.
4577666	4579107	We're going to try to buy Take-Two.
4579447	4582528	We're going to offer you two billion dollars.
4583489	4591453	Anyways, of course, you know, Take-Two looked at it and said, no, sorry.
4592413	4594334	So, I don't know.
4594602	4595823	You know why I think this is interesting?
4595883	4598244	Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Take-Two own 2K Games?
4598544	4600265	Yeah, Take-Two owns 2K Games.
4600365	4603426	They also own Rockstar.
4604566	4609109	Basically, buying this would have EA would have a monopoly on most sports.
4609189	4612090	Yeah, I was going to say, if that happened, EA would have a sports monopoly.
4612450	4613671	That's crazy talk.
4615291	4616272	No, that's EA talk.
4618459	4619919	I mean, it's not surprising to hear about all these murders.
4619939	4622420	It's like, listen, our games may not be great, but you have no other choice.
4622600	4624681	I think it's interesting that Take-Two just said, no.
4626761	4627521	But that's not good.
4627661	4630982	When your companies look at being bought like that, though, sometimes it's not good.
4631302	4631862	I mean, I don't know.
4632082	4633463	Well, it was unsolicited.
4633543	4636143	I mean, you know, they weren't saying, hey, who wants to buy us?
4636203	4640344	You know, EA is just like, hey, we've got $2 billion.
4641905	4644545	We want to buy you because Grand Theft Auto is awesome.
4645226	4645886	But see, that's the thing.
4646026	4646746	I think, like, you know,
4647726	4654847	2K and Take-Two, they may have had financial trouble earlier, but I think they're going to make a turnaround, especially with Grand Theft Auto 4.
4654927	4656768	They're going to make all sorts of money with that shit.
4658268	4658568	I don't know.
4658708	4667650	This reminds me of the whole Microsoft-Yahoo thing that's been going on the past couple weeks, where apparently Microsoft's been trying to buy Yahoo, but Yahoo's been kind of saying no, or the stockholders have been saying no.
4668090	4668890	Very interesting stuff.
4669270	4671911	It's like just because you have the money doesn't mean they're going to sell to you.
4672151	4672451	It's true.
4673203	4675365	If I was to take two, I'd be like, fuck you!
4676245	4678727	I'm not going to sell my company for $2 billion.
4679307	4682589	Well, in other news, though, Orange Lounge Radio is up for sale for the highest bidder.
4683370	4684250	We will take $2 billion.
4684291	4685892	Trust... Each.
4686492	4687052	I don't care.
4687172	4691055	We'll put EA presents EA's Orange Lounge Radio by EA.
4691155	4693096	I mean, I really don't care.
4693116	4694457	We would sell out like that.
4694677	4696959	I will talk... Hell, presented by Madden.
4696999	4698320	Madden's Orange Lounge Radio.
4698380	4699261	I don't give a crap.
4699921	4700301	$2 billion, man.
4700341	4700361	I...
4702120	4703282	Do whatever they want the show.
4703582	4704063	I quit.
4706286	4710151	Can you imagine Madden's Orange Lounge Radio?
4710591	4712113	I'd be foaming at the mouth.
4712153	4717400	Featuring the gay guy, the angry man, and the woman who... We'll build a room of money.
4718982	4720144	Who I love and adore.
4723955	4725476	You want to know what sucks?
4725536	4728957	I wasn't thinking about what I'll spend that much money on.
4729537	4734439	Technically I was, but I was thinking pay off credit cards, pay off student loans, buy a house.
4737700	4739981	And then move to Europe.
4740741	4743742	Actdeft has made the first bid for Orange Lounge Radio at $2.
4745842	4746563	We need more money!
4747063	4748763	Let's sell the station on eBay.
4748783	4749363	That would be fun.
4750264	4750844	Do you want to?
4753467	4754568	We should do random eBay stuff because...
4776866	4785373	It's like, I don't know if you know, when they were having all this stuff on the Gorillaz website, they actually sold 2D shoes on eBay.
4785994	4786214	Nice.
4786674	4787935	So we could do stuff like that.
4788036	4790097	Okay, I need to say something.
4790197	4791358	Chat room, knock it off.
4791398	4793460	We didn't say this station is actually for sale.
4793580	4795422	So bidding is not up to $50.
4795542	4796322	Okay, shut up.
4796483	4797303	I'll sell a date.
4797383	4798284	I'll go out with somebody.
4798725	4799365	You're married.
4799805	4800046	So?
4800886	4802107	My husband will be fine with it.
4803589	4805030	I get free food and we get money.
4806098	4808518	Hey, I'll tell you what, Rob.
4808558	4820460	Because you know how that one Guitar Hero controller or Guitar Hero game or whatever was sold for thousands of dollars because some father took it away from his pot-smoking son, supposedly?
4821101	4827282	Well, that copy of Bookworm Adventures, that copy was stolen from the President of the United States.
4828702	4832303	From his secret bunker where he's holding Bin Laden.
4833023	4834803	I think that we should put that on eBay.
4835592	4836533	and see how much money we can get.
4836553	4838655	And there's an image of the Virgin Mary in the plastic.
4838735	4839616	Oh, yes, there is.
4842239	4846903	By the way, just so that you know, there's a chance that we may have Dan next week.
4847624	4847964	Nice.
4848785	4849346	Dan the man.
4850307	4853650	Have we even... My God, in the six-year history of this show, has Dan ever been on it?
4853830	4854571	Oh, yes, he has.
4854831	4854971	Once.
4855172	4855812	I wasn't there.
4856213	4857274	I wasn't there when it happened.
4857814	4858435	I think you were.
4858874	4859234	DarkSakura.com
4877375	4879016	Dan was at your guys' old place before.
4879237	4879757	Oh, he did.
4879797	4880898	He did come to the show once there.
4880918	4881158	That's right.
4881178	4882740	Because we have the picture from the webcam.
4883220	4883680	I remember that.
4883720	4884421	I remember that.
4884441	4885602	That's true.
4885622	4890146	The Ron Jeremy thing was great because we were like, dude, the stories are just not all that great.
4890186	4893108	Let's just watch porn or watch, you know, porn documentary.
4893569	4896651	Oh, the days, the good old golden days of Orange Lounge Radio.
4896671	4899394	Ross DLUT says, Loki, we know that's bullshit.
4899734	4902076	WA doesn't know what a book is, much less bookworms.
4902406	4904767	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4933909	4936330	So that lucky nuts guy emailed me back.
4936910	4942131	The one who I was kind of upset with for my comments about physics.
4943691	4949692	So he said he was sorry for making me angry and they were just poking some fun.
4951913	4956414	I'm just going to let you know that I go on PMS-related tangents quite regularly.
4957214	4961755	And if you're going to deal with women, you just got to get used to it.
4962095	4962775	We have...
4963925	4964465	That going on.
4965225	4969806	Although I have to say that it was more or less of a WTF moment.
4969846	4971407	So don't worry about it.
4972007	4972287	Whatever.
4972887	4974208	So next actual email.
4976028	4977348	Hi, OLR team.
4977989	4978689	We're a team now?
4979349	4979589	Yes.
4979869	4980409	Okay.
4981249	4982790	We put the EA in team.
4983050	4986551	Does that mean that we have to go on team buildings and have the company pay for lunch?
4987211	4987451	Maybe.
4987611	4988331	We don't have a company.
4989411	4989992	Or lunch money.
4990712	4991072	Yeah, we do.
4991552	4991772	Anyway.
4992435	4999580	I have been listening to the podcast since sometime last year when I discovered it while browsing for websites that were formatted for the PSP.
4999660	5000701	Yeah, Loki, another one.
5001321	5009988	I won't go into a long dribble here, but suffice to say, I really enjoy listening to you rambling on about games, The Olive Garden, and Moist Cake.
5011069	5017533	Since I travel a lot doing my job, it's hard to play all the games or even to keep up with what's going on, what's coming out all the time.
5017953	5021396	Knowing that I'm missing out on something but not knowing what is worse than listening
5021957	5024519	Thanks Ego++ to you.
5040771	5044093	And that's when I usually get to listen to the podcast on my PSP.
5044593	5057018	Since I work in Spain during the summer months, I can't listen to OLR live due to the time shift, but if my internet connection doesn't fail on me this weekend, I might make it to listen to you live this Sunday.
5057118	5059600	After all, Venezuela is at least on the same side of the globe.
5060140	5060960	Finally, a short question.
5060980	5069144	You've already mentioned Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once, and I was wondering if you could maybe get him over to the skyline to drop in for a quick chat.
5069537	5073682	His video reviews are a weekly highlight for me and I would love to see OLR chat with him for a while.
5073842	5074223	I doubt it.
5074263	5075084	He's in Australia.
5075304	5075544	Yeah.
5075764	5076225	And busy.
5076565	5076806	Yeah.
5077707	5081011	It says, Thanks and keep up the independent, informative, and very funny show.
5081071	5082633	And this is from MVH808.
5082653	5085756	Well, that was very nice.
5086237	5086577	Thank you.
5088119	5088660	Next email.
5089417	5091479	Hey folks at the OLR headquarters.
5091559	5092960	I've got two quick questions here.
5093000	5093820	First is for Loki.
5094421	5097844	I know this show doesn't condone shady topics, but bear with me.
5098224	5103027	I originally purchased a Wii key for my Wii because people in my home like to maul discs.
5103428	5106350	And I'd rather have backup copies lying around than $50 discs.
5107031	5109753	So what is your thoughts on this mod chip?
5110113	5116518	Which Wii mod chip do you use and how hard is it to install one of these because I have not the slightest experience in soldering?
5117444	5122087	Also, how many Subway sandwiches with white bread would I have to bribe you with to install mine?
5122347	5123567	You can have ham and cheese.
5126269	5127930	No, I have a CycloWiz.
5128730	5131311	I think it's CycloWiz V2.
5131451	5131792	I don't know.
5132452	5133392	Whatever the second series.
5133753	5135573	V version 2, I think, is what it was.
5136774	5138455	They're really freaking tiny.
5139415	5141777	And it was kind of scary trying to solder it.
5142117	5144018	But the thing about the soldering, though, is...
5145043	5153967	It actually, the one I have, it has a thing called quick solder and basically there's two points on the board that you fill up these holes with solder.
5154627	5158609	Of course, you have to put flux on the board because the solder didn't want to stick to it at first.
5159249	5172735	And then once you've got that on there, the chip is basically on there and what you can do is you tin two wires and solder them onto three really, really, really tiny points on the board and connect it to the chip.
5173817	5175138	It wasn't easy at all.
5175338	5179420	And I got lucky, I guess, that it worked just fine.
5180961	5182582	Just be careful, I guess.
5183283	5185204	And don't electrocute yourself.
5185644	5186865	You're not going to electrocute yourself.
5187785	5189246	And remember, you're going to void your warranty.
5189861	5194143	Yeah, you will avoid your warranty, but to be honest, I wouldn't worry too much.
5194223	5197784	Just worry about bridging stuff that you shouldn't.
5198804	5207908	Those three points on the board that you would be soldering wires to are really close together, so if you put too much solder on there, they will bridge each other, and it just won't work.
5208448	5213129	But you can always take the solder off there and also make sure you don't lift any of the...
5216238	5220241	Traces on there as well by putting too much heat on there.
5221583	5223024	Just, you know, be careful.
5223324	5225306	Use really, really, really small gauge wire.
5225806	5229049	Like, I think I used 30 gauge wire, I think.
5229709	5230089	Can't remember.
5230730	5231911	Really, really tiny stuff.
5232271	5235254	NYR fan in chat confessed, I electrocuted myself once.
5235934	5236334	Be careful.
5236555	5238156	Just, yeah, be careful with that stuff.
5238756	5239857	I love the Cyclo Wiz.
5240138	5243080	I mean, they're the only ones that were running, you know, at
5243598	5244839	We know about Nintendo and having especially...
5273757	5276999	Assembled Stuff Yep, they love the tri-wing.
5277459	5277959	I don't know why.
5295071	5299415	I mean, one person wouldn't always be relied on to be there and you'd always have a fresh perspective from someone.
5299855	5303678	I just thought it was a really cool idea and figured I would pitch it over there to sit on.
5304599	5315849	Well, we do have guests fairly regularly, but... Okay, my mic's been totally off that whole time.
5315869	5319052	You've probably been able to hear me a little bit.
5319132	5319892	Shit, where was I?
5320093	5322775	Oh, yes, I was saying, I think the door is already kind of open.
5323157	5323899	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5334232	5334933	DarkSakura.com
5356891	5358212	But the door's always open to our guests.
5358372	5364236	And I remember back in the day, there were some people that it seemed like they were here every week for a while.
5364436	5364736	Yeah.
5365176	5367978	I want to say like DDR Angel was here at least every other week for a while.
5368659	5370860	And when he was here, Shane was here every week.
5371000	5375443	You know, just depends on what's going on that week.
5376904	5379545	It's more or less the, do I have anything else going on?
5379605	5380426	Let's go to OLR.
5381072	5383153	Olive Garden, Home of the NeverEnding Salads, and Breadsticks
5412133	5412393	Nice.
5412713	5413294	Shall I move on?
5413954	5414195	Sure.
5415395	5416596	Hello, Rob, Jamie, and Loki.
5417097	5422340	Just thought I would chime in with my thoughts about the game you played last week, one versus the chat room.
5423041	5424182	That was the week you weren't here, Jamie.
5424982	5425823	I understand that.
5427804	5428745	Just thought I'd fill that in.
5429045	5429286	Okay.
5429826	5432368	It was badass and officially my favorite game of the show.
5432995	5436236	It allows all the live listeners a chance to play and win, not just the caller.
5436616	5439717	For podcast people, it's fun, too, just because trivia gets you thinking.
5440198	5443219	By the way, I agree with that person who said there should be a Bimani edition.
5443839	5445059	Also, three random thoughts.
5445340	5447260	One, I laugh so hard at Ranma's little loop.
5447380	5451962	Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video remix.
5453042	5453262	Okay.
5454443	5460165	Two, every time you guys spot a fly in the studio, you should all give a girly squeal on the count of three just for shits and giggles.
5460717	5462038	It has been that bad lately, actually.
5462158	5462839	This one's for me.
5463359	5469525	It says you should call your mom and talk about the Wii with her on the show just because Rob's talk with his mom a while back was hilarious.
5470206	5471347	All right, enough with this email.
5471407	5472287	I'll be live soon.
5472608	5473328	That's from Osfer.
5473849	5479654	Well, I would say we should call my mama, but it's a quarter to ten right now in Alabama.
5481275	5484218	Well, actually, I think my mom would be awake, but she would be winding down.
5484258	5485059	I'll save it for Mother's Day.
5485891	5487852	Ooh, yeah, let's call my mom on Mother's Day.
5488412	5489452	Hi, Mom!
5489832	5490552	I'm in jail!
5490712	5491012	Wait.
5491872	5493553	I'm in Rob's garage.
5493753	5494713	Which is kind of like jail.
5495873	5498654	Only more comfy, with better insulation and computers.
5499014	5501735	Even Gold Banjo in chat says, I missed that one versus the chatroom game.
5501755	5502595	I hope you guys do it again.
5502695	5503395	It will come back.
5503535	5505016	The reception was very, very positive.
5505056	5505936	We will do that game again.
5506976	5507596	Next email!
5507616	5508697	With more music, of course.
5508797	5510577	Yes, with more variety of music next time.
5511457	5511957	Next email?
5512218	5512398	Yes.
5513098	5513998	Hey, OLR Croop.
5514451	5514951	Thank you for watching!
5544120	5553982	I'm at least going to read the email and then I'll kick you so you can brace for it.
5554502	5555902	Because this is GS68, by the way.
5556962	5557882	Unless you want to do the honors.
5558482	5559083	Sure, I'll kick him.
5560283	5566544	Finally, I would just like to give a shout out to Orange Lounge chat room for being the best friends I've ever met.
5567084	5572985	I mean, yeah, you guys get crazy sometimes, but it's that craziness that keeps me distracted from whatever is depressing me.
5573556	5576377	and if the depression is too big, it's nice to have an outlet for that.
5576837	5581938	Hell, even when there's no show, I lurk in the chatroom just to see who's inside and join in whatever's getting discussed.
5581998	5588820	I just want to say that you guys, and girls, are a great bunch and make up a good 60-70% of the fun during the live show and that I love you all.
5589201	5590081	Aww, that's sweet.
5590101	5591541	Aww, that's nice.
5591581	5592962	Violin music, violin music.
5593562	5598083	You guys are what set the difference between listening to this show live and listening to it via podcast.
5598563	5600924	Here's to many more episodes of Hilarious Chatroom Moments.
5601903	5604705	And then it says, takes a shot of water, I guess.
5604785	5606385	I'm running out of non-alcoholic drink ideas.
5607766	5609487	Anyway, great show, OLR and DMN.
5609527	5613929	And thank you, Pound Orange Lounge, for keeping me sane through this Sunday and Wednesday nights.
5613989	5614510	Love, GS68.
5614610	5616931	That was a very sweet email.
5616971	5627777	You know, comments like that and the little groupies we have in Orange Lounge, our chat room and everything, just, you know, keep us going and let us know we're not wasting our time here, that we really are...
5629008	5631310	You know, letting people have a good time on Sunday nights.
5631470	5632271	It's just about having fun.
5632791	5633171	It's awesome.
5634112	5634392	Okay.
5635473	5636614	Well, next email?
5637255	5637575	Sure.
5638316	5642039	Hi, Sky, DarkSakura, and last but definitely least, Loki.
5642479	5643320	Sorry I had to say that.
5643360	5643860	I love you, too.
5645962	5656951	I live in Australia, and I don't know if you've noticed over there, but I've become very irritated at the fact that the Japanese gaming companies such as Square Enix see fit-to-release games like Kingdom Hearts and a few...
5658482	5666609	and a few months later think to themselves, hey, I know how we can rip off some people and piss off foreigners and then release something like Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.
5668011	5676378	I don't know if they realize it, but not only are they missing out on an incredibly large fan base, but they're leaving a great big gaping hole in plots for us.
5676859	5679781	I understand that they may be busy, but really, think of the children.
5680282	5681583	That was in bold text, by the way.
5682848	5693077	Also, I'd like to point out that I'm trying to spread the word to every online community I'm in so that we can reach our goal with eye of judgment, or as it's more commonly known, that piece of trash would rather burn.
5694558	5706908	Thank you all for something to keep me laughing on the best in the morning with numerous strange looks, and as I'm listening to the podcast on my PSP, I shall try to get on the chat room one morning and join in on the fun.
5707248	5708569	You're sincerely, One Winged Angel.
5711272	5711632	All righty.
5712130	5715091	I'm glad to hear we're making the wheels on the bus go round and round.
5715271	5715832	We have more.
5716172	5716392	Okay.
5717312	5721514	But this one's actually a poem.
5722755	5724075	Oh, yay, poetic emails.
5724095	5725216	By Strip Mahjong.
5726417	5727217	I love that name.
5727257	5727777	That's great.
5728958	5734300	This is called The Lay of OLR, or Damn It, I Wish I Had Remembered to Upload Some Extra Podcasts Last Night.
5736241	5740523	I sit and stare at my computer screen and eat my workday lunch of fine cuisine.
5741127	5745011	I browse through my podcast list, which grows thin, wondering where my OLR has been.
5745992	5747034	Is it Thursday already?
5747134	5752580	Far too long since last I heard that OLR theme song or the classic Game of the Week segment.
5752640	5753481	No FUs either.
5754642	5755843	At traffic, none vent.
5756484	5759748	I direct my browser to the website and reminded of why I'm in this plight.
5759768	5761570	The OLR crew could not meet Sunday.
5762950	5764751	for that real life thing had to get in their way.
5765211	5777599	I sit back in my chair and give a sigh longing for this show on which I rely to help ease the pain of a boring job and yet no anger I can feel at Rob, DarkSakura, or Loki since these three give us so much entertainment for free.
5778780	5784664	And so to next week's show I now look toward but for the moment damn I'm freaking bored.
5786025	5786165	Aww.
5787066	5787706	Well here we are.
5788286	5788727	We're back.
5788887	5789147	Hi.
5789207	5789847	Heart, heart, heart.
5790508	5792309	And then someone wants us to put a song in rotation.
5793393	5793913	What song's that?
5795214	5799877	The Elder School's 4 intro song.
5800817	5801298	Guess what?
5801378	5802318	It's already there.
5802638	5803779	It's already in rotation.
5803839	5806641	It's just that you're probably not listening quite long enough to actually hear it.
5807861	5808902	So it's actually there.
5810043	5817287	But does that mean they want to hear it on the show, or they want to hear it in the 24-hour rotation that's on the station when we're not here?
5817307	5822830	I'm thinking in the rotation, because, I mean, just suggesting a song to put in is what it looked like.
5823400	5826022	And the mailbox just went down, so that's the last one I'm going to read.
5826102	5827383	Well, here, I'll give you a little taste.
5829225	5833348	There you go, that's all you get.
5833908	5835530	All right, wonderful.
5835590	5838132	Yeah, it sounds like the Wi-Fi might be down in studio again.
5838232	5838772	It just came back.
5838832	5840193	That's a perfect time for that to happen.
5840994	5841214	All right.
5842529	5847593	Luckily, the computer that broadcasts out the signal for Live 365 and all that stuff is wired.
5847954	5854599	We actually have a ginormous wire that runs all the way out here into the garage just for this computer so that we don't have those types of problems on here.
5856167	5859369	Anyhow, one more story for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line.
5859809	5862131	And that has to do with Guitar Hero 3.
5863231	5867013	Activision is going to be offering refunds for the Wii version of Guitar Hero 3.
5867293	5869755	Yes, all over that whole sound issue.
5869835	5872296	Remember about how the sound was a mess?
5872356	5874398	It wasn't actually the surround sound or whatever.
5874418	5876519	It was all mono sound or what have you.
5877860	5880161	Activision is offering refunds for that.
5880221	5883483	So if you do not want to actually replace your disc...
5884443	5886285	You can actually replace the disc with money.
5886445	5887185	You can get a refund.
5888046	5892510	So, if that's something that interests you, check Activision's site for more details.
5893511	5896093	Although, seriously, just stick with the game.
5896614	5897274	The game's fine.
5899036	5899616	But I understand.
5899656	5901858	Some of y'all have those big sound systems and things like that.
5902519	5906402	You don't want to cut back on all that.
5906892	5910533	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for your telephone calls.
5910653	5916935	The number to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
5916976	5918616	The phones are open now.
5918676	5919696	I just turned them on.
5920317	5922918	So go ahead and give us a call, and we will talk to you.
5922938	5930840	We're going to take a couple calls tonight, not a whole lot of them, but I'm sure some of our listeners have some things to say about things like DJ Hero, maybe the XNA.
5930940	5932761	I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about that.
5933174	5937777	Meanwhile, while we wait for the buffer and for folks to get the phone number and call in, do we have any last-minute stories?
5938097	5938337	Yes.
5939458	5944721	Magic the Gathering is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox Live Arcade.
5945381	5949504	So suck it, I have judgment.
5950164	5954166	Microsoft, of course, and Epic announced Gears of War 2 coming November 2008.
5955607	5961911	No word on the details of what's going to be in that, but of course the Unreal 3 engine has been enhanced and all fun stuff like that.
5962705	5963565	Alright, let's go to a call.
5963605	5964606	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
5964626	5964966	Who's this?
5966287	5968108	Hello, this is Rostio UT.
5968288	5969528	Well, hello, Rostio UT.
5969548	5970209	What is on your mind?
5971769	5973050	Not much, not much.
5973150	5974771	You know, just a few things.
5974851	5977632	First off, yes, I was going to mention the whole EA deal.
5978212	5987337	I was incredibly relieved to hear that they rejected EA's offer.
5988417	5990458	I mean, I think we all know that it's...
5991002	6001290	that it's basically they're trying to get rid of the NBA 2K franchise because the NBA has so far been resistant towards exclusivity talks and this is pretty much all they have left.
6002851	6003351	I agree.
6003871	6005973	What better way to get rid of your competition than buy them out?
6007574	6017121	Yeah, but it's good to see that Take-Two realizes that sticking around and keeping their company is going to make them more money in the long run.
6017141	6018682	They already had a hit with Bioshock
6020520	6022562	They're going to have an enormous hit with GTA 4.
6023683	6026426	And NBA 2K is doing amazingly well.
6026846	6029769	So there's really no reason to jump ship just yet.
6033012	6034634	I'm just worried that... I'm sorry?
6034654	6039138	I was just going to say, I just think EA, it just creates such a monopoly out there in the marketplace.
6039178	6039819	You know what I mean?
6040239	6044504	I mean, we're starting to get to this point where you've got EA, Activision, Nintendo...
6045433	6050475	Sega, Namco, Konami There's less than 10 at this point, you know what I mean?
6050935	6074362	It seems like back in the day there were a million It hasn't gotten that bad yet, but that is sort of the direction we're going and it is sort of sad because you see that happen and pretty much innovative game ideas would be impossible under that environment We all saw what EA did to Origin, Bullfrog and Westwood
6075612	6078914	Well, people just have to remember that they also don't have to buy Madden every single year.
6081255	6085638	Well, the thing is, I don't think it's gamers who buy Madden.
6085658	6086918	It's just sports fans.
6086938	6088139	They probably don't buy anything else.
6089019	6091301	You know, which is why EA doesn't really have to try.
6092661	6093682	I think you're absolutely right.
6093722	6098044	I think that's the whole reason an Xbox 360 Core Edition exists is for those people.
6098324	6101086	There are people that bought an Xbox 360 for Madden and that's it.
6101826	6102447	You know what I mean?
6102467	6102807	You're right.
6103228	6107652	and that's it and that's not going to be a market for third parties and I think most third parties realize that.
6110314	6112335	Because that's probably what, two million people?
6112695	6115858	That's what Madden sells every year, like a million and a half, two million every year?
6117565	6122326	I don't think the only people that buy Madden are those type of people.
6122386	6124327	It's probably a certain percentage.
6124747	6135630	Probably there's a percentage of that million that buy nothing but Madden and maybe the other occasional sports game like the basketball game or the street or underground editions and racing games here and there.
6135670	6136030	That's it.
6136750	6144732	That's clearly not the majority of the gaming audience and I would really hate to see the entire industry screwed up by that.
6145768	6147910	Although I do see a silver lining.
6147930	6154796	We all saw what happens when the actual talent leaves and they rebrand.
6155837	6161161	If I remember correctly, Molyneux was part of Origin originally, if I remember correctly, and then he went on to form Lionhead.
6161862	6162783	I think you are correct.
6164244	6170129	So I think we're going to see that eventually, especially with a lot of the studios like Bioware.
6170149	6171130	They don't do a lot of...
6172173	6172773	A lot of sequels.
6172813	6175715	They might just stick around to complete Mass Effect and then be out.
6176195	6177436	You know, just pack up and rebrand.
6177476	6178837	You see that a lot in this industry.
6179237	6179977	That's very true.
6180037	6185120	You do see a lot of guys getting up and leaving.
6185841	6187461	Anything else you wanted to comment on on tonight's show?
6189302	6192544	Just a personal note about the show itself.
6192844	6195606	I do enjoy the show, but I do have to say this.
6196346	6200909	You know, I do... I do wonder why...
6202659	6206581	You know, we get so much into the mod talk, like the letter segment.
6206641	6208422	You know, that guy was making a flimsy excuse.
6208482	6210123	We all know he wants to see a Wii Games.
6210703	6216167	You know, I don't see why you guys have to serve, basically, thieves.
6217807	6218108	You know?
6219488	6225892	That always troubled me, and that always, you know, as much as I like the show, that always sort of tugged at me a little bit, you know?
6226400	6236042	Well, you know, I think from our perspective, this show is kind of about the gaming community and all the things that are going on in the community, the good stuff and the stuff kind of behind closed doors.
6236482	6239703	So whether that guy was being honest or not, you know, I suppose we'll never know.
6240083	6247085	But I think it is important sometimes to talk about what goes on in the whole, you know, dark side and gaming and all that stuff.
6247472	6252333	to kind of see how the companies respond to that or how they don't.
6252673	6261275	You know, like, for instance, I find this whole thing back and forth with Sony and the people that hack the PSP back and forth, I find that whole thing hilarious, honestly.
6261335	6267756	In a way, I shouldn't say, like, hilarious, but I find it fascinating how constantly Sony patches it and somebody breaks it.
6267796	6270697	Like, it's just that whole... It's so interesting to me.
6271237	6275298	But certainly... I can certainly see where someone would find it interesting.
6275358	6277058	I just find it disgusting because...
6278041	6279002	You see the turnaround.
6279042	6284126	PSP software doesn't sell as well as it should, at least until recently.
6284146	6286348	There are good PSP games, and they don't do well.
6287028	6293233	And now you see the same thing is going to start happening with the DS as the R4 gets more popular.
6296536	6300359	Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, you know?
6301300	6306404	Well, I think at the same time, though, us not talking about it is not going to make it go away, so...
6307123	6314285	Oh, it's not going to make it go away, but the last thing anyone needs to be doing is giving tips of all things.
6315345	6317726	At that point, you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
6318286	6318626	All right.
6318786	6321746	Well, we've heard your opinion, and hopefully you've heard ours.
6322027	6323467	So thanks so much for the call, as always.
6324827	6325047	All right.
6325087	6325727	Have a good night, buddy.
6325767	6326908	All right.
6326928	6327228	Bye-bye.
6327308	6327588	Take care.
6328528	6328868	All right.
6329288	6333889	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
6334329	6335150	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6335170	6335470	Who's this?
6336070	6336210	Gear68.
6337008	6337608	Hey, what's on your mind?
6339330	6343793	About DJ Hero, I'm pretty... Yes, about DJ Hero.
6344813	6346314	I have a feeling it's going to succeed pretty well.
6346414	6350877	I mean, Guitar Hero took off pretty well.
6351078	6354040	The drum part of Rock Band is getting a bit of attention.
6355521	6357722	And I'm pretty sure it's going to go for DJ Hero.
6358643	6360144	Is there potential there?
6360424	6361705	Yes, I would say.
6361805	6364747	But I'm waiting to see the official E3 announcement.
6365014	6365415	You know what I mean?
6365435	6365776	Yeah, of course.
6366397	6369924	Assuming that it's going to be the Beatmania spinoff that we're all thinking it is.
6370645	6371367	Which it may not be.
6373960	6377082	There is a distinct possibility this is not the Beatmania clone people think it is.
6377762	6381825	It could be more along the lines of Kraken DJ, which if you've played that game is drastically different.
6382085	6386147	I mean, I realize both games involve turntables, but the play between them is so, so different.
6386307	6386748	And who knows?
6387128	6389569	Maybe there is no controller that comes with this game.
6389869	6391310	This is a lot of speculation.
6391350	6398074	A lot of people are thinking, oh, well, they stole, quote unquote, I'm using that term loosely, they stole Guitar Freaks, so they're going to steal Beatmania now.
6398114	6398995	We don't know for sure.
6399015	6402977	I mean, we have a damn good reason to believe that to be true, but we don't know for sure.
6405237	6407738	But at the same time, there's a chance that it might flop.
6407758	6409418	Tell me, look at Beat Media US.
6409518	6410499	That failed horribly.
6411379	6412079	You know what's funny?
6413360	6414320	It actually didn't.
6414580	6418482	I know a lot of folks say that, you know, Beat Media, oh, they saw it on the clearance shelves and all that stuff.
6418502	6422504	But I can tell you, it met Konami's expectations of what the game was going to sell.
6422604	6424825	Why they didn't make a sequel, your guess is as good as mine.
6425745	6433228	I actually thought for a while there, from what I, you know, just observe at different things, I thought Konami was planning a sequel here in the US for whatever reason they chose not to do it.
6435578	6442821	Yeah, too bad the original came in limited releases, so now we can't find an American Beatmania controller.
6444102	6454427	Because I tried one over at E3, I mean, Final Mate, sorry, and the controller was like light years ahead of the Japanese one.
6455307	6458569	Well, they made improvements on it on its way over, so, and, you know, for a lot of the...
6458882	6467768	and hardcore Bomani community fans, the whole reason to buy Beatmania US was it was sort of a greatest hits with a better controller for a decent price.
6470711	6479597	But yeah, it's kind of a bummer they never did release a sequel here in the US, but at the same time, I would hope maybe they have bigger and better things planned, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
6481398	6482579	Go ahead.
6483760	6487943	Maybe that guitar revolution pattern that they came up with last year or the year before.
6490731	6494135	I mean, if they follow a patent, then there's got to be some use for it.
6494835	6495896	Where there's smoke, there's fire?
6495996	6496377	Who knows?
6496897	6497178	Who knows?
6498499	6505606	I kind of hope that Konami's going to surprise us, but I've said this to Konami indirectly on this show before, and I'll say it again.
6505726	6510571	If you're not going to do it, someone else will, and I think this whole trademark thing just kind of goes to show that.
6510812	6512033	I think Konami should be...
6513148	6524098	I can't believe there's people that go, oh, this wouldn't do well in the U.S., and then it's going to do well because they didn't innovate it for the U.S., I guess is what I'm saying.
6524818	6525079	I don't know.
6525099	6529142	I feel like I've had this conversation a million times on the program, so that's all.
6529442	6531925	All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, GS68?
6531945	6533666	Yeah, I finally got Apollo Justice this week.
6534187	6534587	What did you think?
6535811	6536792	It's pretty good so far.
6536812	6550561	I like the perceived system, which is basically where you, during a witness's testimony, you look at their, you look at their, you find nervous habits during their testimony and point them out.
6551201	6554603	I mean, because, you know, when they lie, they make those kind of habits and such.
6556444	6560887	I've heard a lot of good things about Apollo Justice, but right now I'm too busy with Lost Odyssey, but I will check it out at some point.
6561328	6563289	I've read the, like, the...
6564278	6565919	The cases aren't written very well.
6566019	6579748	I mean, case two wasn't... I thought, though I kind of disagree, the first case was pretty good, and the third one too, and I'm partway through the fourth one, but second case, eh.
6579888	6584510	But then again, every Ace Attorney game has its crappy cases.
6584651	6585471	Yeah, so it's hit and miss.
6585811	6586252	It's hit and miss.
6586352	6586732	It's all right.
6587092	6589153	As long as overall you have fun, that's what it's all about.
6589494	6593016	All right, GS6TO, we've got to let you go to get to a couple other calls, but thanks so much for calling.
6593036	6593416	Have a good one.
6594090	6594370	You too.
6594490	6594830	Bye-bye.
6595931	6596271	All right.
6596311	6598372	We'll take one more call if anybody wants to call in.
6598412	6600033	Orange Launch Radio on Skype or our username.
6600433	6604215	That is our username on Skype or our phone number.
6604235	6605495	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6606736	6607576	Oh, we got one more call.
6608437	6609217	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6609237	6609537	Who's this?
6610558	6612419	Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt.
6612619	6613859	What is on your mind, my friend?
6615820	6617241	Actually, I want to call about two things.
6617521	6620303	One, I want to talk about the XNA Club.
6620683	6621263	Yeah, what's up?
6623055	6624835	I think it's a great idea.
6626436	6636078	I'm really happy that these big companies are starting to go all toward user-created content and all that.
6636718	6641719	I think that's what's going to change the gaming industry pretty soon.
6641919	6642319	I agree.
6642379	6643499	I think this is something big.
6645960	6650741	To tell a personal story, I have a friend who's currently working on an XNA game.
6652438	6655159	He's doing it in his spare time.
6655279	6658440	He has his own job.
6658480	6662622	He's a computer engineer, and he kind of wants to get into the business.
6662722	6667883	So I think doing this is going to kind of get him into the business.
6668064	6669804	That is absolutely a way to get noticed.
6670084	6672205	There's going to be some great talent discovered from this.
6672245	6675566	That's why I think this is the beginning of a new chapter in gaming.
6675786	6678607	I hate to keep talking this up, but I think this really is that big.
6679007	6679548	It really is.
6679808	6680768	It will play out that big.
6681601	6683882	I mean, it's just like independent movies.
6685022	6688583	The greatest things are not necessarily the most known things.
6689043	6691424	Very true.
6692264	6700186	And to say that all user-created content is garbage, I cannot agree any less with that.
6702607	6706608	And the last topic I wanted to bring up was, I'm not sure if you guys saw this, but...
6708266	6711929	ESPN has signed a deal with Major League Gaming.
6712609	6714210	Somebody linked me to that earlier.
6714290	6715611	Yeah, tell us a little more about that.
6717953	6720455	I just took a quick glance at it.
6720555	6722096	Dark Knight sent me the link.
6722136	6724278	I just glanced at it.
6725839	6726159	I don't know.
6726199	6728201	I think it's just getting a little ridiculous.
6729561	6737167	I mean, this will bring up the whole debate about whether or not gaming is an actual sport and all that, but
6737904	6740586	It's all about in the way it's portrayed, I think.
6740806	6743368	It's all about the way it's kind of handled and the way it's done.
6743568	6746970	If it's a little bit too sensationalistic, then it's going to be crap.
6747351	6751533	But if they take it somewhat seriously, I think it'll be kind of cool.
6752154	6752454	We'll see.
6752574	6761861	Yeah, I mean, I've always kind of, I don't want to say this, I feel embarrassed to say, but I always kind of saw DDR was, in a sense, a sport.
6761881	6762281	I don't know.
6763269	6770094	I remember a long time ago that they were talking about bringing DDR to the X Games, but nothing came of that.
6772095	6772395	I don't know.
6772455	6774136	I just think it's a little ridiculous.
6774517	6788486	And as a sports fan, I'm kind of annoyed that we're going to be able to see kids talk trash with Halo, and meanwhile we can't see hockey games on ESPN.
6788726	6789847	But that's...
6790948	6792729	Only, that's, it's only with me.
6792749	6794790	Maybe this will be delegated to the Ocho.
6795130	6795510	Who knows?
6796610	6796931	Maybe.
6797711	6797991	All right.
6798771	6800392	SSJ100, Matt, thanks so much for your call.
6800592	6802413	We got to wrap it up, so have a good one, okay?
6802433	6803833	Yeah, what?
6804374	6805054	I said have a good one.
6806054	6806414	You too.
6806554	6807175	All right, bye-bye.
6807815	6808155	I'll try.
6809156	6813117	Yeah, I'm definitely starting to feel the weight of the show carrying down.
6813157	6815798	So it's time to start to wrap up so I can take more drugs.
6815878	6818139	Yay, drugs, los drogas.
6818739	6819840	All legal ones, of course.
6820814	6821334	Dayquil.
6821915	6823956	Don't be thinking I'm into that shady stuff.
6824277	6825598	Loki, any other last minute stories?
6825758	6827039	Yes, Ninja Gaiden 2.
6827559	6830842	That's scheduled now for June 3rd in the US.
6830982	6843411	It will also have a cool new feature where you can do basically record your action or killing of things so you can play them back and I'm assuming upload them to friends and that kind of thing.
6843591	6845432	So that's kind of cool.
6846413	6850116	This is a neat little feature that they're adding into this game
6851156	6853939	Boom Blocks, that's that first game by Spielberg.
6855100	6869332	They're going to have a head tracking option in there where you can use the second Wii Remote to basically track your head movements much like that demonstration that we saw online.
6869372	6871254	That's what I was thinking, that YouTube thing that guy did.
6871274	6871835	Yeah, yeah.
6872075	6872195	Hmm.
6872611	6881094	But you'll need to have, of course, some sort of visor with two infrared lights on it or a wireless sensor bar or something that you use in that sense.
6881514	6884755	That you have to build yourself, but it will support it, though.
6885215	6887236	So that's kind of a nifty little Easter egg.
6888197	6893198	A game that really wants me to get back into playing MMOs.
6894099	6897960	Real Time World showed off a game during GDC called All Points Bulletin.
6899093	6900213	Just fucking awesome.
6900513	6904015	It looks like Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row, the MMO.
6904655	6906295	But it's kind of weird, though.
6906575	6908756	There's no leveling or anything in the game.
6908936	6916539	You either, of course, play on the side of the law or the criminal side, and you have to do organized crime.
6917379	6920800	And, of course, you start off the game wearing normal clothes and stuff.
6920820	6927042	And they had a pretty cool game that they made up, the Geek Squad or whatever, with Miyamoto in there, and that was kind of funny.
6928414	6932436	But it has a really cool character creator and that kind of stuff.
6932676	6936138	I really want to play this game, but I don't like it very much.
6936578	6936998	So we'll see.
6938679	6940760	This is kind of a little bit of controversy here.
6941100	6947303	British Magazine is unveiling Xbox Live's GoldenEye info this week.
6947543	6951785	I heard that was debunked, that it was a concept thing that they were going to be showing.
6951885	6953986	Yeah, it wasn't the real deal.
6954066	6957067	It came out later that it was bogus.
6958106	6959147	It looks cool either way.
6959467	6960888	Yeah, sure.
6961468	6965831	Definitely fueling the fanboy flames of our GoldenEye desires on 360.
6967733	6968273	No surprises.
6969654	6970114	Let's see.
6970214	6973597	This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're getting Triggerheart Accelia.
6975498	6980081	One of those bullet hell games that should be coming out for 800 Microsoft points.
6980441	6981302	That's pretty exciting.
6982237	6989303	Also on Rock Band, we're getting a Nine Inch Nails three-pack, including March of the Pigs, The Collector, and The Perfect Drug.
6989723	6992905	Which, if you'll remember, that was actually one of the packs that was supposed to be coming in March.
6993486	6995347	So, I don't know.
6995367	6996768	Dates get moved around sometimes.
6996808	6996989	Yep.
6997649	7010659	And then finally, some weird company, Shenzhen Nodging Technology Company Limited, made a Famicom cart for Final Fantasy VII.
7013046	7021389	I guess it's fully playable and they've got all sorts of stuff from the game and of course done in the Final Fantasy looks like two or three graphics.
7021929	7023750	Has this been ROMed yet?
7024870	7026330	I don't know.
7026671	7029491	It's probably like those Tekken on the NES cartridges.
7029571	7033053	It looks like Final Fantasy, like one of the older Final Fantasy games.
7034133	7034673	Interesting.
7035873	7036614	What a waste of time.
7037494	7037994	Sorry.
7039294	7040875	Is there really that big of a market for more
7041385	7042225	Games on the NES.
7042285	7051909	I mean, I guess those consoles still exist in some households, but most people, at least in these parts, are still having to... This is specifically Advent Children, isn't it?
7053250	7055130	I don't know if it's Advent Children, but yeah.
7056591	7057071	It'd be cool.
7057691	7058191	Interesting.
7059072	7059472	You know what?
7059492	7061673	Somebody probably just stole the logo off the wrong thing.
7062133	7063694	Without bothering to Photoshop it.
7064414	7064774	Who knows?
7065454	7065834	That's it.
7066475	7067295	Alright, um...
7067751	7071394	Well, if DarkSakura doesn't have any last-minute stories, I don't have any either.
7071894	7075477	But there is one more thing we just could not finish the show if we did not do.
7075497	7076798	I have a last-minute story.
7076818	7077219	Oh, you do?
7077579	7078380	Oh, well, then let's take it.
7078400	7079060	I want a milkshake.
7079861	7080581	That's not a story.
7081302	7081942	It's news to me.
7082223	7082463	All right.
7082523	7092351	Well, anyway, we just could not end the show if we did not have an opportunity to respect our elders by paying tribute to a classic game, as we do every week here on the program.
7092851	7096294	It's time for DarkSakura to bring in her classic game of the week.
7102759	7107002	The classic game of the week is one that I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on.
7108543	7114527	Definitely one of the top games in the side-scrolling shooter genre.
7115047	7118289	And that is none other but R-Type.
7120351	7121051	R-Type is great.
7124013	7130077	In fact, I'd have to say that R-Type is probably my favorite shooter, even though I'm not all that great at it.
7132816	7134297	This music's like the best ever.
7135158	7137360	The first level music is so much my favorite in the game.
7140703	7143165	So what sets this shooter apart from other games, DarkSakura?
7143425	7146888	This particular shooter has a very unique weapon system.
7147309	7154695	You get this item called the Force, which is, since you're watching the clip, you see that ball that's right in front of it?
7155532	7163863	You can pick up different power-ups for ones that make it grow based on different types of energy power-ups you pick up.
7165005	7168309	And you have a red one that's a counter-air laser.
7168369	7173216	That's the one that's on right now, the blue and red sort of spiraled-looking laser.
7174493	7182999	You also get a rebound laser that shoots these thin beams that bounce off the walls, which is actually, certain weapons are better for certain stages.
7183800	7195348	You also get the counter-ground laser, which is basically like a flamethrower that goes out on the ceiling and on the ground, which is a very, very, very good thing to have for the third boss.
7195989	7199211	Well, actually for the third level, because the entire level is the boss battle.
7199231	7200492	Okay.
7201441	7212887	The other various things that you can get are these little spheres that will float above and below your ship that will shoot missiles for you.
7213648	7218590	The other cool thing about the Force attachment is that you can move it around.
7219931	7223373	And by the way, the ship one is, I think, the third level.
7223717	7231139	But anyway, you can fire it off and have it sort of hang in midair, although it will try to reattach itself.
7231779	7237900	But you can have it attached to the back of your ship and fire the weapon from the back, and you can have it attached to the front.
7238480	7239800	And have it, of course, fire to the front.
7240360	7246702	In fact, a lot of the bosses are supposed to be really hard, but they all have a trick to them.
7246742	7247562	Like the first one...
7249291	7274580	there's one place where nothing will hit you and you just fire off the force thing and it will just kill the thing for you one of the stages is you fight this heart of this creature and there's a place where you can nestle your ship in and fire off the force thing by the place where the little heart of it pops up and you don't get hit you kill off all the tentacles and you
7275450	7276331	And that is hardcore.
7276351	7276431	Wow.
7298567	7302929	And on top of that, I've seen someone beat it in the arcade on an actual single quarter.
7303229	7306711	I notice our chatroom is in a little bit of a Gradius versus R-Type debate.
7307491	7308132	Care to comment?
7308232	7311173	I mean, is there room for both games, or is one better than the other?
7315595	7321458	It's all a matter of what you prefer, because Gradius is a different style of shooter, I think.
7322098	7327741	Honestly, and this is, again, just my opinion, I think it takes a more skilled player to play through R-Type.
7328260	7334304	I really think it takes a lot more skilled and patient of a player to play R-Type.
7335185	7337026	And of course, we've had many sequels since then.
7338387	7357561	We've had, if I'm correct in order, after this came, we had R-Type 2, and then, god, there was some other game, let's see, Super R-Type came out, R-Type Leo, R-Type 3, R-Type Delta, R-Type Final, and there's recently been an R-Type Tactics game, which
7358086	7358426	R-Type Command
7386903	7388684	That you'll get to the arcade version.
7388764	7391025	In Japan, though, it came out on two HuCards.
7391925	7399529	And a little bit of trivia is that when on the Japanese Virtual Console, you actually still have to download R-Type in both parts.
7400749	7401630	As opposed to one.
7401950	7413155	And they came out with an R-Type Complete or something that was a PC Engine Duo combination that had the entire thing uncut.
7414555	7415916	Also, other games, though, that were...
7417168	7421630	Rumored to have been spawned by R-Type, though, were Polestar.
7422710	7430754	Although Polestar actually dates back to the very early 80s, but a lot of the gameplay in Polestar is a lot like R-Type.
7431294	7435055	Also a game called Resonant that came out in 91, very similar.
7435075	7443799	A Magic Series core, the game called Magic Dragon that was supposed to be almost everything exactly like R-Type with redone sprites.
7444179	7445840	Like we haven't seen that before in Super Mario 2.
7448907	7458091	Also, for the game Turrican 2, you actually can see the force in a hangar, and the third level of that game is based on R-Type.
7458692	7465155	And another game, and this is actually, and I almost picked this as my classic game, but it's a little on the obscure side.
7465175	7470417	It's a game called, if I'm pronouncing it right, Zexys, which is just spelled X-E-X-E-X.
7471198	7473139	We got it in America as Oreus.
7473179	7473839	It's a Konami game.
7474961	7477923	and it's also that same type of shooter game.
7478584	7481125	So, very, very classic.
7481485	7482086	Very good game.
7483147	7483487	All right.
7484567	7489130	I have my love for Gradius, especially Gradius 2, don't get me wrong, but R-Type.
7489671	7490071	There you have it.
7490091	7496275	Your classic game of the week is R-Type, which you can check out a version of that on the virtual console if you are so inclined.
7497076	7498897	And I believe that's available in all the different regions.
7499477	7500078	I do believe so.
7500138	7502879	Just remember, if you were in Japan, you have to pay for two of them.
7503560	7503760	All right.
7504403	7508565	Well, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for tonight's short show, although it wasn't much of a short show.
7508685	7511907	We've been here for over two hours, so it was almost like just doing one long show and no break.
7512307	7515829	So you can't say you got ripped off this week, but I am definitely spent.
7515930	7516650	I am done.
7516710	7517650	I'm ready to go rest.
7518291	7520992	So we're going to wrap it up and go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7521513	7522553	Loki, your final thought tonight?
7523354	7529417	I'm going home and hopefully going to be able to play some Lost Odyssey since everything tonight reruns, except for the Food Network.
7529437	7530318	They have new stuff on there.
7531158	7532439	My final thought is...
7533274	7535576	Medication, menthol, cough drops.
7535856	7536277	Hooray.
7537097	7538098	DarkSakura, your final thought.
7538498	7540500	Let's have tea will kill me if I don't say it.
7541100	7542582	So reject false icons.
7543462	7544083	There you have it.
