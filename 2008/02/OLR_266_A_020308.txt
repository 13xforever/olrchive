Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that podcast on DARE internet
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always
Say hello to the one and only
Cuddly DarkSakura
Hi
She's not like her internet persona in real life
She's actually very sweet, right?
If you add lots of sugar
Alright, and how are you doing Ms. Sakura?
I'm frustrated with the mailbag
I'm sorry to hear that, what did the mailbag do to you?
It's being a bitch
I'm sorry to hear that
Alright, also joining us tonight
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
Hello
Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion
Hey, aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?
Nope
You can lick it off
That's right, you can lick it off, alright
Exactly
Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show
And I gotta say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world
Cause she has no idea who the eff we are
And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying
Hey, you're pretty cool, you should come be on our program
But she's a real good sport, she's here tonight
Give it up for Mo
Hello interweb, why am I waving?
Huh?
Why am I waving?
Why are you waving?
Cause we do have an internet cam over there on Justin TV
We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you
So we make sure you get picked up on there
But how are you?
I'm nervous but super
Yeah?
Why are you nervous?
There's nothing to be nervous about
We don't bite much
I don't trust her
She only doesn't trust dark soccer, right?
You've heard stories
I'm nice
Oh, see, you're gonna fit right in
What does she do when she pisses off dark soccer?
She goes hearts and it makes it better
She already knows
That's exactly what I do
She knows
She knows this gig already
Alright, and the cowboy hat
And by the way, Mo
Uber famous on YouTube
Uber famous?
Okay, I don't know about Uber famous
Closai famous
Closai famous
She's like an e-list celebrity on the internet
Yes
So she's here tonight
She's actually gonna play for us a cover
From the game portal
Of Jonathan Coulton's Still Alive
And she's very brave to be doing that live here on the radio
So we're gonna give her a big OLR hug, right chat room?
Chat at orangeontotototototot.com
Also joining us tonight
Someone who's also new to the program
But doesn't seem to be quite as intimidated
You know why?
Cause he's too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl
Which we have in the house
We'll talk about that a little bit
Say hello to Jake
Hello interwebs
How are you Jake?
Getting thrashed by Snake
Alright, awesome
And we're not gonna be able to use this mic to talk to Jake
Or I might smash over poor Mo's guitar
And that wouldn't be good
And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Brothers Brawl
In the house
Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Brothers Brawl
Yes
So this is something that we, you know, picked up
That anybody really can right now if they have the ability to play import games
And it's actually, I kind of got lucky on eBay
Cause, you know, it's been going for over $150 on there
Just for an import copy
Luckily though, I did find one
And I had to do a double take on it
That was $49.99 and like $8 shipping
So I was like, I'm jumping on that
Wow, nice
So I bought it
And sure enough, it was legit
So, you know, that's awesome
Very cool
I don't know why anyone else didn't see this auction
Seeing it as a buy it now for $49.99
I'm like, that's even cheaper than getting it on Playasia
So, you know, I'm definitely, this game I think is worth buying twice
So I will be playing the Japanese copy until the US one comes out
Alright, we'll talk about your thoughts a little more on the game
When we get into How Was Your Gaming Week
But for right now, we're gonna move on over into that segment
How Was Your Gaming Week
But you know us ladies first
So we're gonna let DarkSakura kick it off with
How Was Your Gaming Week
My gaming week was actually very not
Because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok
Because it's just, you know, point and click
That type of thing
So, yeah
I didn't even play any pinball
No pinball?
No pinball
Oh my gosh
Same reason
Wow, well sorry to hear about that
We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff
I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise though
Very cool, what did you think of what you saw?
I thought that I really really really really really really like crashes
And I like the super jumps
Very cool
Like the really long ones where you get the different angles
And I'm like Dukes of Hazzard go
It was cool
Good times
Alright
Well hopefully you'll be back up and running soon
Your middle finger will be back in commission
And you can flip people off and all that good stuff
It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night
I wake up in the morning all double horns
So it's not all bad
She rolls out of bed ready to rock
Yep
And you know if it were more fingers it would be too much metal for one hand
Awesome
Alright
Loki we'll go over to you, how was your gaming week?
Put down the controller
My gaming week was fine
You are not trying to do this and play at the same time
You are not
You can leave it alone for five seconds
Hey I'm not playing it
I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat
Alright you know so we were fixing it
Fine
I thought you said that wasn't cheating
It's not cheating it's exploiting the game
Exactly
Oh you said cheat not cheat
Yeah
So my gaming week I've been playing Burnout Paradise
Which is awesome because I have this vendetta against Dan
Unfortunately Gunstar Hero
Because he keeps beating my times or my show time amounts
The Road Rules ones
Yeah the Road Rules ones
Yeah he keeps beating my crashing ones
So I go through and specifically go and beat his
He's not actually doing it on purpose
I know
We talked about it
I know
Well the whole reason he did the Road Rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs and that was it
And he wanted the car
Yeah well I understand that but I have to beat everybody on my friends list
So that's why I've been going through and doing that
Well if you tell him it's a competition he will compete
It was fun
I love the game it's great just crashing everything
Which kind of gets me to my other topic here
I had another 360 die
Three rings
I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times
Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?
No I had to overheat it quite a few times
Sounds hot
This next time though it's not going to be pretty
I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about 1000 degrees
It will work or it will melt
One of the two
And then let's see what else did I get
Oh actually I imported another game
It's a game called
God I don't remember what it's called now
I was going to say while you're thinking about that for your Xbox 360
You know Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard
Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week
It's like popping randomly in the left speaker
So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed
It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker
But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral
So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360
We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home
Put it in a little floaty boat
Set it on fire
I'm not ready to give up on it yet
Because I've gotten it to work for half an hour at a time
It's just so weird because it will work perfectly
And I think oh great it's fixed
And then I'll turn it on three hours later and it will be three rings again
I'll play through a game and it will be completely normal
It can play it for about an hour or so
And I'm like okay I'm confident this is working
And then sure enough it stops working
So whatever
I give up
Anyways I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was
Other things I played other than that of course
Smash Brothers Brawl
Just started playing a bit of that
To be honest I'm not very good at it
But it's cool
It's a really cool game
Like I said it's probably worth buying twice
So definitely check it out if you can
As soon as you can
We've actually unlocked quite a few players
Because other than playing through space and emissary mode
You can actually just play the versus mode
And one of the cheat things you can do is you can set up a special brawl
Where the players have set hit points
And then you drop the computers down the one
You put this thing on where the hit points drop gradually
So immediately the computer dies
So that's kind of fun I guess
It's like watching paint dry but it unlocks characters so that's good
Let's see what else they play
Res HD
Oh my god is that awesome
Playing that on a surround sound system
Oh yeah
That is some good stuff there
Absolutely love that game
Let's see
Oh now this is the game I imported for the Game Boy Advance
Dot Stream is the name of it
It's one of the bit generation titles
Erase Lines
And it's actually pretty fun
Cheap little titles like 20 bucks
But I'll have to show you Rob some of it a little bit later
And that's pretty much it
Awesome
Well it sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week
I try
Well I want to go to our guest Moe
And see what Moe's been playing this week
Now Moe you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs
You do actually play video games
You work in video games
You're a gamer girl right
Yes I am
You sure are so don't doubt it
So what kind of games have you been playing this week
I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful
And there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things
I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV
Which is very depressing because it looks awesome so far
But I'm a really crappy shot
And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game
Awesome
Very cool
So you've been very busy
Yeah I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC
Since somebody's borrowing my 360 copies still
My bad
He's better on PC
No actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC
I don't know if I mentioned it before
Was that I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game
The actual 3D model because I want to make one
Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle
But I haven't gotten around to that yet
Now Moe are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360
I'm a PC player
Why is that you just prefer that you think it's more of a keyboard mouse type game
Or are you like Xbox sucks or what
I have a 360 I love my 360
But I cannot do shooters on console at all
I'm a terrible shot I cannot play Halo for the life of me
Gotcha
So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people
Alright
Oh I forgot I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again
Because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it
Because god damn commander whoever's stuck
You know holding his arms out with a gun in his hand
They won't trigger the last scene
I really hate that game at the end at least
The rest of the game is awesome it's just the end fucking sucks
Seriously
Alright
Well I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week
And then Jake do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week
As soon as I'm done here
He's gonna be a pouty face
Let's see
My gaming week was pretty much Res HD all freaking week
I agree with Loki Res HD is a beautiful game and it's time for Res to make a little bit of a comeback
You know it was a little bit fuzzy on the Playstation 2 and the Dreamcast
Not that it was bad but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful beautiful HD
And the sound system and everything it's just gorgeous
And it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever
For real I just love Res and it's a beautiful game and the graphics are great
I mean it's only like 10 bucks so it's a great deal I think it's probably the best
Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet honestly
I'm totally in love with Res HD
That's really it otherwise I've been playing Warcraft still because I'm a big nerd
SassyPants my level 70 character who's awesome
And she now has a sister named SassyLama who is a shaman I just made that so
And if you don't know what that means you gotta check Urban Dictionary
So there you go
Anyway we gotta, Loki you gotta give Jake your mic
Jake now you're new to the program right?
But you're a gamer too right?
Well I'm not a gamer
Yeah you've just been attached to Smash Bros. Brawl all night
What kind of games do you play? What have you been playing this week?
I was in Baltimore all week so I've been playing Rock Band
And lots of Rock Band
And more Rock Band up until like midnight on Wednesday
What do you love so much about Rock Band?
Character creation, the party aspect
You get four people in a room just rocking out it doesn't compare to anything else
Barbie mode is awesome in Rock Band seriously I love Barbie mode
Hey dress up mode
Yes you get to dress up my characters and take them shopping it's awesome
You play a lot of MMOs though?
Too many
Like not just Warcraft what other kind of MMOs have you been playing?
I slowly got addicted to EverQuest 2 unfortunately
Sucker
So people actually play EverQuest 2?
Quite a handful there's like 10-15 servers and a couple are actually full now and then
What makes EverQuest 2 so dang popular?
It's less easy mode it's a little more it's like wow only more difficult as far as I can tell
Deeper craft system lots more race to choose from
You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2 correct?
And a frog and a rat
That's pretty awesome
And the head of the dragons
Cool
What else what else what other MMOs you been playing?
Well aside from wow Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta
Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa is all about because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me which wasn't a whole lot so
Essentially it's a third person shooter MMO
You go around you blast aliens instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and what not
Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there or is there something you can compare it to or?
There's not much you can compare it to aside from like a tactical shooter because you can actually use cover effectively and
Alright
It's hard to describe though as far as that goes
Gotcha
Alright
So you recommend all these games do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs they should?
Definitely
Now wait a minute you play three different MMOs but you do have a day job right?
I think so
And you do go outdoors once in a while?
I'm here
So you break the stereotype?
Yes
Alright excellent I'm glad to hear you have a healthy balanced lifestyle that's great
Doubtful
Alright
Also chat orange launch radio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight. We'd love to hear what you guys have to say
A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl which is going on right now during our program
Although I would think you know either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that or you came over here watch this
Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway so most people for most people Super Bowl is long passed over
Son of Dad says Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target so I guess Tabula Rasa is not selling too well
I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation
Hitstun praising Res HD Hitstun says Res HD is awesome and have a 360 and don't already have Res you'd be stupid not to pick this up
I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on Res HD because they didn't they didn't have or they already had a previous copy of Res on Playstation 2 or Dreamcast
Tigerclaw says Skye I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Res HD not quite but I had to do the trans vibrator mode
I almost picked up three different controllers for that but I didn't have three different controllers at my house so I tried just the controller I was playing with and that was just kind of eh
Eh it's regular well I have the controller I was playing with and then my wireless so I put the wireless on my back cause that's what you know Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do is you should put one towards your lower back and it's actually kind of freaky
But it's like a free back massage while you play video games so it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music it's certainly an experience I'll say that
So let's see Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Brothers Brawl in house he says turn it off it's rude to play games that we non importers don't have yet
I'm sorry dude I don't know what to tell you we really want to play dude blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release that's what I say
It's alright they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways
Alright that's right cause they're having problems aren't they
They're a little short yeah
Well actually no seriously it is just a little short because they they only fulfill I forget how much of it not much like 20% of the preorders but the rest are coming next week so
So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out
Yeah it's not that bad I mean and every major like Nintendo title has been short anyways with Mario Galaxy was like that Zelda I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here
Mario Kart and the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels it'll be something stupid and arbitrary that's you know holding the whole thing up I don't know
So Nintendo seems to be having production issues just left and right at first you can't crank out enough Wii's and they can't crank out
A little random factoid though this is the first dual layer disc that's on the Wii
Well I imagine with all the shit they have in this game it's got to be a pretty full disc
Yeah you have to run an update once you get it so
Wow
Thank you Nintendo now I have two news channels and two weather channels both of which I still don't use so that's awesome
Weather channel's awesome
Do you actually use the weather channel Mo?
When I feel like seeing what the temperature is in Johannesburg Africa
Or is it just for spinning the plane?
I like to listen to the music and spin the globe because I'm stupid
Yeah sometimes that's fun
Especially if I've been drinking a little bit
Sometimes you're curious about how cold it is in Russia at the time or you know how nice and warm it is in Puerto Rico
Or how cold does it get at the South Pole that kind of stuff fascinates me
It's fascinating
How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole? These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world
Alright let's see Portal Combat in our chat room says I want Portal Song now
So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient
Hey how does it feel to want?
You've got to wait
Patience is a virtue
And also because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and you know is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program
You know we could have like hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard she didn't know
So she's very brave to come here
So once we get past part A and the musical performance we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment
So once the song is performed there will be cake
From the chat room
Globe Band just says you want song 2 do you know any blur?
I don't know maybe I can do it I can wing it
Now you actually do other songs besides just video game stuff right?
Portal was just a whim one of my friends was like hey you should try doing the Still Alive song
And then I looked up the chords and like tapped it out and I was like wow this is really easy
And I had a digital camera and I'm like hey I can put my YouTube account to use
And now it has like 31,000 views
Isn't it crazy how the internet works?
I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments
Nice well congratulations that's pretty awesome to see you know somebody literally out of their bedroom
I mean that's I think that's why we wanted to reach out and like get you in
My room is such a mess
No because literally where did this show start out of our you know my spare bedroom
And Loki and I lived together for a little while we were doing the show out of our living room
So you know it's just with I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing
People can see my like drums from rock band behind me and then like the mess on my floor
They can see my posters
Well next time you need to cl- and somebody here in the Justin TV chat
Somebody was I don't know being a troll and said something about who decorated this place
An 11 year old girl so you know people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on
So because I'm so sure an 11 year old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket
I would have when I was 11
Oh maybe
When I was 11 I think I had gremlins
Alright let's I think I had Legos
Alright let's get to the gaming news and then we can I promise we will get to the portal song
But we got it we got to tease it a little bit and get to get some news out of the way first
Also just want to give some quick plugs if you don't know already we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge
We have a MySpace MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and a Facebook community is there too
If you search for the OL army is our Facebook community too so social networking whores that's us
So check us out on those different websites
That's that let's get to the gaming news Loki
Alright well as we talked about last week there's rumors going around that the 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 system is being phased out
And of course we know that's true with Best Buy and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB
Well now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system
SKU that's going to have a 120 to 160 gigabyte hard drive
And it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller
All for the same price point of $499
And if you think about it that makes perfect sense seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways
Right around the corner
And you know it's kind of funny how we laughed before like you know back when Kuteragi was talking about
Oh yeah it's going to be like a PC we're going to upgrade it you know all the time you know it's going to be constantly changing
And we're like ah that's stupid you're an idiot and sure enough they keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing
So like you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3
Hey
That uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their chips to the hard drive
They're future proofing it okay someday there will be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something
When home finally comes out it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run
That's right
You're going to need room for all that SingStar
In 2010 when home finally comes out you're going to need that you know 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then
Yeah who's going to say
For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes
I can't
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
It's Studio 54 all over again
Have you not done your homework Loki the internet is for porn
And for piracy
Well you can piracy
Pirate porn
Pirate porn
Hey
There is a porn called pirates
There is a porn called pirates it was the highest produced like most expensive porn ever made
One of our lesbians has it
Hold on hold on
I've seen it it's actually pretty well produced
Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity but she's a connoisseur of porn
Apparently as well
Hope to god my mom isn't watching this
I know I was like your mom's not watching tonight right
Hi mom
Just kidding
We're wacky internet people
Alright we tell jokes
Anyhow
Anything else you want to say about the Playstation
About the Playstation 3
Stop making new skews it's confusing
And all you're going to just convince people is well if I wait longer it'll be better
You know that's
What are they going to get stuck doing
Seriously
And how much you want to bet this new skew is just not going to have backwards compatibility what so ever on it
Just like the 40
Yep just like the 40
They're just going to screw everybody
Oh well
They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game too
Probably layer since it doesn't sell
That would make sense
Awesome
Hooray
Let's see and son of dad says in chat.orangelschatter.com
Playstation 3 one year five skews no fucking games
Hey there's Uncharted
Orko says porn is greater than cake
I don't know cake is pretty good
Of course that brings Isu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie
Well actually it was funny while I was half asleep this morning
Cause I was supposed to be awake for breakfast but I wasn't
Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing burnout paradise
About the difference between going online on the xbox 360
As opposed to going online on the Playstation 3
How with xbox 360 it's just part of the experience
It's there everybody is there
But with he was talking about going online with SOCOM
And saying how it was like you know filing your taxes
You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it
So if you're going to be an online player then having a PS3 isn't worth it
You know sometimes friend codes don't look so bad
When you put all that in comparison
I mean it's like you know I don't know
One thing that the Playstation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for
Is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
Of course you remember that whole controversy
With you know there was OMG Sex was unlockable
Speaking of porn was unlockable within the game
And you know it was a whole hot coffee mess
Well if you may remember when we last left off
There was a settlement that was going to happen
Where you could actually replace your game
And you could get some sort of you know severance
For you know the horrific images that were displayed in your home unknowingly
Because you didn't have to hack the fucking game to get them or whatever
But anyhow if you want to know some details
Take-Two has recently released the details on their website
Now here's the thing
The settlement will offer different levels of compensation
Depending on your proof that a violated you know buyer may have to offer
So if you have an original copy of the game
You can get of course the replacement disc
If you have the receipt with it
You can get a $35 cash payment
As part of the settlement
And if you have a credit card statement or check
You get $17.50
If you get a disc, no receipt, $10
If you have no receipt and no game
You can earn $5
Sweet
So here you go
If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two
All you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury
I'll do it
That you purchased the game and you played the offending game
And you know it hurt you
It raped your fragile mind
I don't know
You got to just swear that the game you know did things to your mind
You were not prepared for
Some people enjoy that
I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5
I mean I don't know if it's worth it
That is lunch at McDonald's for a day
$5 will totally get me a teriyaki
Exactly
Lunch on Take-Two everybody
Lunch on Take-Two this week
Enjoy
And hopefully
That would totally buy me some hot coffee
You know
You know that $5 that you can get from
You know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
Because it warped your freaking mind
That's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto IV
When it comes out
Exactly
It pays for your pre-order
Exactly
Exactly
Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store
To try and stake your claim to this
Because you know once you get the $5
You're going to say
You need to pre-order the new game
Right
No I'm just kidding
Alright
Let's move on with some more gaming
Because hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal
No it won't be
Never
So in Gran Turismo
There's a hot coffee
No
But speaking of Gran Turismo
There's a fun little bit that's out though for $40
Like I wouldn't pay for that
But
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue
Has an April 17th release date
And it will have 60 cars
And you will get like
Nissan
And Ferraris
And Audis
Like you'd want an Audi
And different levels
I believe there's 5 tracks
And you can either download it
Or pay for the disc
And with the disc you get a special video
Awesome
You know what that means
That means that you can buy a half done game
For $30 or $40
And then guess what
You can wait for the full game to come out
And then pay another $60
Because you're a whore
But wait wait wait
You get a half done game now
And then you get a 90% done game later
And then they'll put out like special edition
That's completely finished
They'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue the sequel
Which will be like almost done
We're swear we're almost done with the game
This is 60% done now
Loki you put it so eloquently
You just have a way with words
You know that right
I know
I was going to say
This is a lot of crap
For a game that's not really done
But
It's not that great anyways
Wait wait
Even if people are going to do it
They're going to be like
Oh my god I have to have it
I'm a consumer whore
And get it
Or just wait for the full game to come out
People don't know how to be patient
Yeah I guess I can't really talk about patience
No mister
Do you have any wheeze now
No
More news please
Yes please
I agree
We need to get to the Portal song
Sooner round later
Because that means less talking from us
Sorry
And I actually meant
Okay now this story
I meant to get something
To actually test this out on the show
But I was too lazy to stop by
Anyways
Firmware 3.9 has come out
Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl
Too lazy
So I was basically
Because that's going to stop at GameStop
And get a headset for my PSP
So I can talk on Skype
So we can test it during the show
And I figured
No that'd be dumb
And I don't want to waste $20 on a headset
I'll never use Skype
I apologize for ever asking about the story
It's really hard to find that
Anyways
So
Firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP
And it does feature Skype
If you have the PSP Slim
And two days later it was cracked
And is now available for everybody else like me
So hooray
Way to go Sony
Keeping up with that security
Now does the crack still work off some type of exploit
Or how exactly does that work
They basically decrypt the
The whole firmware
And then they just modify it so you can
Install it on your PSP
With homebrew support and other stuff like that
So one more time just to recap
The new PSP firmware came out this week
And was promptly cracked two days later
Alright
I always feel like every time
We have a story about the firmware getting cracked
You know Sony comes out and says
Nobody's ever going to crack this
This is the full proof firmware
We've closed the loophole
No one's ever going to crack it
And then two days later
It gets even better
And I don't think this made the show roll
But they're finding a way now to
Inject the 1.5 firmware
Homebrew capability into the slim PSPs now
Inject the 1.5 firmware
You make it sound so hot
Well because you can't run
There are certain parts of 1.5
That won't run on a slim PSP
But now they're figuring out how to do that
It'll never work
There's never going to be a point where
They're super secure
Alright
Well if you're looking for more things
To use your PSP for
Pretty soon FLOW
Is going to be coming out on the PSP
You might know this game as the screensaver that you play
This originally came out on the PlayStation Network of course
And it will soon be coming out to the PSP
This is according to computer and video games
The PSP version probably won't be changed much
From the original PlayStation 3 version
I'm trying to think
How exactly do you mess with FLOW
Do you give the game a plot?
Or like an objective?
Eat stuff, become bigger, evolve
That's right I forgot
The instructions that the game gives you
Eat stuff
There you go
Alrighty
Well let's see what else is coming out soon

And then Puppy Palace on DS
Because there's just not enough puppy raising sims my god
And what other fun stuff here
I'm sorry I had to read
Merv Griffin's Crosswords on the PC
Wow that's
Isn't that like a game show now or something?
I guess
Right
Why do they have them hosting anything that's just weird
Well Merv Griffin is kind of dead so he can't host much right now
Grrr strong words
Zombie Cross word
Well I don't know they can be like a computer reanimation
Because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden
Wow I don't think Merv Griffin died that long this might be in the To Soon category
So we need to be careful
There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing
Okay
Okay
okay sure exactly
Dick Clark should be dead and worse is justice
can't you tell his contract with the devil already ran war out?
you know I think no here's what it is

finest in video game chat
I'm done that's it that's all that's coming out this week
alright let's move over then to the

and then we will have ourselves a performance what about news
anyways
I have news related news
it's very special because EA is obviously very special in special by
ending short best
EA is going to be splitting the components
of the orange box dunder done so
there will be a PC and xbox 360 released in October
a ps3 release afterwards that will be just a separate half-life
episode to you and portal and a separate team fortress
and and they've already been there for download for a while but there's going
to be individual box copies on the way
and I hope they're cheap because I mean if you can buy
you know the orange box new for 60 bucks and it's
all this stuff they should make these like no more than 1520 bucks apiece
probably 20 and no one will buy like
episode to everyone else but portal
yeah portal and team fortress to yeah I don't know see
when and we got my copy and see all I cared about was portal at the time that
Dan really really got into
half-life and to episode to you he was all over that
hi
good I'm sorry I had to run out for a minute I'm okay in the
he had a major we that's right ahead I had a major we brew and I had a
cuz I didn't wanna miss our performance I ran out during the last story there
so now that you share that with the entire internet can we move on with
the
another gaming story please we are not over there I know this is gonna come as a
big surprise everybody but Val's talking about
making more portal games way
that's so surprising I'm
yeah apparently portal was kinda successful so they
decided hey let's make some more but they don't want just turn out more
levels and I think actually wanna have a
story to go along with it so they're working on it but
anytime soon just make more downloadable levels that be fun
so let's see a highly successful critically loved game is going to be
getting a sequel
I know and this is news how shot stop presses
shocking on alright I'm anyway speaking a portal obviously our
I've guest here tonight is mo who's with us and mo
is somewhat famous on the internet's for her you tube which is had what 30,000
plus views
31,000 views for portal so what made you decide to do a cover of still alive
of all things oh we finished the portal game in a bunch my friends and heard the
ending sign on my
this is pretty easy and I like you should learn it and
I did are any of your friends listening tonight know that my home so
I if they aren't I'll be really bitter
alright that's alright whether we have the podcast you can you know is
always a share it with your friends on pimping it to them all weekend if they
don't listen I'm gonna be better
alright I'm sure that if you're in chat say hello or something so we cannot pass
on now your well wishes to mo
and I so I'm
so you just you just you heard the song your friends kinda dared you to do it
effectively
yes and I then you're on YouTube and now you're here Jake to the one only take
actually
how did you find her yes did you find me her
just
can we can we get on the mic real quick sorry Jake I can't talk on the mic we
can hear you
think someone links to another portal video and then years came up in the
results and I clicked on it was like hey
that's awesome and then I showed you as I and then you were over here for the
new year's party and I don't somehow I know somehow portal came up just randomly
are watching
you tubes are I don't know and and you said that hey there's a girl who's
local
that's got one and so we watched it we sent her an email and here she is
here she is so are you about ready for this I gotta I'm gonna have to situate a
little differently cuz we're ghetto we don't have a lot of hookups there so I'm
just gonna kinda sit by you here
and now while you do this so and I'm gonna ask you guys to turn your mics off
so we don't get a lot of background noise in here
but this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig
our first musical guest rage but it's gonna be awesome
right it's gonna be only slightly I hope it'll be above average we know that
no it's gonna be great be better than it's gonna be better by listening to us
saying that's for sure alright
so alright so enough chatter let's take
let's have a mo take it away here here she is live on now orange lounge radio
with Jonathan Colton's still alive
this was a triumph
I'm making a no-tear huge success
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
we do what we must because we can
for the good in all of us except the ones who are dead
but there's no sense crying over every mistake
you just keep on trying till you run out of cake
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun
for the people who are still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
even though you broke my heart and killed me
and tore me to pieces
and threw every piece into a fire
as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
now these points of data make a beautiful line
and we're out of beta we're releasing on time
so I'm glad I got burned think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive
go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
maybe you'll find someone else to help you
maybe Black Mesa
that was a joke, haha, fat chance
anyway this cake is great it's so delicious and moist
look at me still talking when there's science to do
when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you
I've experiments to run there is research to be done
on the people who are still alive
and believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
while you're dying I'll be still alive
and when you're dead I will be still alive
still alive
and there will be cake and it's not alive
we have some clapping in the chat room
Hitstun says it would win a cage match
our little musical thing we do after the show
or they pick good songs so very nice
so now you're going to have to learn something else and come back
again sometime
yes I happen to watch another one of her YouTubes
which I laughed at because
she did Rick Ashley's Never Gonna Give You Up
everyone's calling it a chick role that's the best part
they're calling it a chick role
it was awesome
awesome
you found it through the chick role?
alright
so lots and lots of clapping there in chat
and thank you very much for being a guinea pig
being our very first musical guest that went pretty well
except for the fact I kind of had to hold that
and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part
I kept smacking the mic and I'm like oh gosh
no but it came out really good so very exciting
alright we'll stop talking about the technical fuck ups now
and get back to the gaming news
yes anyways
oh wait no it's my turn isn't it sorry
yeah Rob
well if you want to be a guitar hero in the comfort of your own home
apparently four more guitar hero games are making their way this year
now that's not real guitar like the kind that Moe plays
but that's you know a fake five button guitar
but it might still get you you know boyfriends, girlfriends
and you know hot dates and all that good stuff
guitar hero Aaron the Ellen show
yeah it could get you on the Ellen show
guitar hero Aerosmith is supposedly going to be coming out in July
and of course guitar hero four in October
guitar hero on tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS
that's going to make its way in June
and supposedly there is a fourth title being planned
it's an action packed guitar hero experience like no other
so apparently it's some other type of guitar hero game
in other words it's basically taking a lovely, well established, loved franchise
and pooping on it with this game
well if there's four games in one year that's already pooping on it I think
I mean seriously
by the way those rumors are coming from surfer girl via gonintendo.com
and surfer girl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff so
not surprised
I'm not surprised about the three of them
and that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July
since that's when Rock the 80s came out this last year
oh, Rock the 80s
and I don't know they need to do something like remember Fret and Ice
they could do something like that action packed guitar game
you know just where you actually do a side scrolling game
but I think this is going to suck whatever it is I'm sure
I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them
it sucked
that's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer
I'm sorry but if you release four games
like okay
DDR for example
when you have three different games coming out in the same year
they just don't get the same amount of focus on each one
it's just
I don't know release one really good game except four really mediocre games
have you ever heard of the saying too much of a good thing
yeah exactly
Gerardimo asks in chat is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now
because the whole Activision Blizzard thing
you know rock out to your torn shaman and all that stuff
do we get hoochie dancing night elves and head banging undead
you might see some of that stuff
but here's the thing
I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version
I'm sure you'll see something like that in there
because they like doing weird crossover things
you never know
look if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3
anything is possible
I'm very disappointed I've not seen anything like that for Rock Band
I want some free songs I understand the three songs a week
or Journey
or Journey
they need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords the Underworld
just isn't enough
there needs to be more gag music in there
we need more lols in our Rock Band
we need Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend on there
I would own on that
like chocolate rain the heavy metal mix or something like that
yes
hey they managed to put freeze pop
drop it at me
well you know what Mo maybe should write them and get Still Alive in there
we need more stuff from the kind of long haired band
see now Still Alive
Spinal Tap
Spinal Tap
I was going to say Still Alive could make it into Rock Band
since EA publishes both games
so maybe
interesting EA are you listening
I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song
although I mean there's maps and something
they've got plenty of mellow stuff in there
well part of my iron lung is mellow
we need more Radiohead
and the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain Loki
so here you go a little kick
Chocolate Rain is great
it's amazing
that guy's voice is just intense
intense is a good way to describe it
let's move on with some more news
well
for our Sega fans there is a
PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege
that is an action RPG with different types of gameplay
we have a robotic partner that you can customize
and you have online co-op
up to four people
but they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release too
excuse me
they're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release
they are considering it as an option
and I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that it's actually going to be
they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself
that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible
so
the PC releases in September
so wait it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years hopefully?
I hope so
Sega needs to really redeem themselves
or they need to bring out Planet Harrier
we don't have very good hopes for this actually
if I remember correctly Space Siege is actually
a new series in the Dungeon Siege
so basically you know like a dungeon crawler but now it's a space crawler I guess
and
you know
no offense I mean I'm sure Dungeon Siege is awesome
it's just we will ruin that for me
I'm sorry
I think of that and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO
because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King and he'll be in space
and that's you know have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever
you know what I've had this very strange urge to play this week Dark Sakura?
what?
Fastestar universe
no
I don't know why
Ethan Waber's calling to you
yes that's what it is I missed the two handed thing
guy with the swords was awesome
you know my friend Julie
cost me 19
got it
and she's like oh my god every time she's always on PSU
and see we were actually having a discussion on this the other day
and she's saying that they're bringing in the old PSO maps
and everything
and I was like that could almost get me to play
I still have my copy
that could almost get me to play except I still hate how they do forces
that will get me to play I think
that's kind of cool
she says that all of, in fact some of the areas are already available
but they're also bringing back all the old enemies too
wow
so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem was with the universe itself
as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled
I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played
she said they brought back mags
that's hot I love mags
I miss my Master System mag
alright we got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show
so I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice challenge that was on the Xbox 360
I think last year
where you could earn such wonderful games as Contra and
oh guess what?
Fusion Frenzy 2
which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment
punishment
anyways
so you can win some new stuff this time
although it's a little bit different this time around
instead of actually competing just against a set number
you're competing against your friends
and you can win such things as say
a $20 Best Buy gift card
an Xbox 360 HD DVD player
since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of win in there
and some other stuff
maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again who knows
but
yeah so if you're interested in that they've actually got some more information on
360voice.com
slash challenges
you can check it out
a bunch of different things you can win
I don't know
I just have a
I really don't care
I'm kind of done with the whole like EP and achievement points thing
it's kind of done
you know I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so
sadly high it's just never
you're never going to catch up so I don't know
I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing
it's a little old to me
I mean I guess they're still interesting in a way
I guess like virtual trophies or whatever
but I don't know about these contests
unless they start putting some cold hard cash on the line
yeah it doesn't look like they are
I mean you can basically pick one of these different contests they're going on
you pick one you want to enter in
and then you basically compete and see how fast you can
you know grow your gamer score I guess
and they've got you know a bunch of different weird things
like you can win you know 1600 point cards
50 of our best buy cards
Big Mac challenge
I don't know maybe you win some Big Macs or something
clearance copies of Sneak King I don't know
anyhow
some games may be coming out very soon
for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more
because Lord knows you achievement point whores love
more arcade games to inflate your score
but these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all
apparently Microsoft's press FTP site
was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there
because they've released these screenshots of
Conquer Live and Reloaded
and Jade Empire
those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site
it indicates that the games could be coming to
Xbox Live Marketplace very soon
so there you have it there
now of course they're going to be added to the Xbox original line up
so come to think of it
I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points
because you can't use the original games for that
I'm not interested until they put like Jet Set Radio Future on there or something like that
so if it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live originals
1200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games
but I hear
or buy it used for probably even cheaper than that
I hear especially with Jade Empire
those games are ones that people love
so there you have it
looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for
what's that
to the big game
oh what game
the Puppy Bowl corgi one
oh yes
go team corgi
good job
seriously okay all these DS pet raising sims and no Puppy Bowl games
I mean come on
they totally need the Puppy Bowl
which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season
once again sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house
but apparently
corgis are great and they're smart
alright forget it
with their little mutated feet
I love their little feet
I've been telling my husband I want a corgi
and he's like no you have a cat
see proof that inbreeding can be awesome
well they have cats out yet too
no but they're so horrible
they feel so bad for them
do you love video games
hey
listen to Orange Lounge Radio
we talk about video games non-stop
you know who should have won Puppy Bowl
this is the Puppy and Kitty tangent
hey guess what Rob more Xbox Live
what
ceiling cat is watching you deviate from the video game stories
haha
uh
uh yeah
anyway
um game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations
as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases
is Poker Smash
which is um like I guess Tetris with poker things
Poker Smash
I don't know it makes me kind of think of columns
columns
columns
columns gave me an aneurysm
Poker Smash
kind of makes me think of I'm not buying it
haha
you know you're gonna get it for Nellie
no I'm not
you know Nellie's gonna get it behind your back
for points
she won't buy that game she's like I don't care
haha
I was teasing
no if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360
Nellie's gonna come in and go Xbox Smash
that's ok he'll rebuild it
yeah
it actually looks kind of cool
I'll make it work better
and if it doesn't work better that means I need more
it'll be the bionic 360
haha
it actually looks kind of cool
but honestly I just will play Puyo Puyo
see she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in
she doesn't know how to play poker and that's
I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever
but that will stop her from playing that game
ok
alright moving on
so there's actually been a little issues with
you know Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
you know and you might think at first it's because the name's too long
but you'd be wrong
it's actually because the game's too big
and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade
well of course you know those 1080p visuals are you know really big
and so they're having trouble you know fitting it in such a small size constraint there
oh darn
you know what it doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo
and slightly better
there may just not be enough room for Cammie's ass
they might just have to cut it out
I'm sorry to say
that would be Chinle's thighs
or how about I don't know let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway
since most everyone has a hard drive
and if you don't have a hard drive you don't get to play fucking arcade games
there you go
or how about just get rid of Balrog
I mean did anyone actually play Balrog?
anybody?
actually?
Tyson played Balrog
I don't think anyone did
I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it
so I have to think about who you're talking about
M. Bison, the boxer
yeah
actually he was pretty cool but I like Dudley better in 3
alright anyhow
guess what time it is folks
you know the party is almost over
and we're going to get to the classic game of the week
but we haven't done this in a little while
there hasn't been a story that has really coaxed us in this way
to give out another one of these
let me think of this last week
we're giving out a stupid award tonight
no last week we talked about this guy
but now the trial is going on
and so this is why this guy is going to win
a stupid award tonight
it's Tyrone Spellman is his name
and apparently he killed a baby
and what cost him to kill a baby?
well video games of course
if Aaliyah Truman
the assistant district attorney
is to be believed
he said that
Spellman's entire life and daily routine
is about playing Ghost Recon
what do you think someone with that kind of obsession
is going to do when it gets knocked over?
what do you think is going to happen?
the skull fractures on that baby or what happened?
so in other words
I know that's horrible first off
I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation
but what I think is so stupid about this
is that
yeah video games cost him to do it
no I think severe mental instability
of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it
like obviously he was not playing
with a full set of chips in his head
so
that's why we're giving out a stupid award
not only to the assistant district attorney
who's trying to jump to this conclusion
but the guy for killing a baby in the first place
I mean that's kind of stupid
like don't kill babies
I mean isn't it like
it doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up
like if he had a six pack in his head
it'd actually be empty except for one flat half drunk bottle
like do you even really need to be taught that growing up?
like do your parents really need to teach you like
hey don't kill babies
ever
I don't think so
I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in
you know what I mean?
problem is he wasn't playing mad
shut up
alright
anyhow before we go to the break
it's time to respect our elders a little bit
by paying tribute to the classic game of the week
Dark Sakura what is the classic video game of the week this week
that all the boys and girls should be playing out there
it's pure and utter awesomeness
it's Outrun
I love Outrun
Outrun is a game where you just drive a car
you make it sound so thrilling
well you've got a convertible and it's the guy and his blonde lady
just driving along and passing other drivers
but you get different forks in the path
different ways that you can take
and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen
or a 1971 Corvette
a 1985 Porsche 911
or a 1985 BMW
which I thought was pretty cool
but the whole I think fun part about it was that
it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car
and it had great music in it
I mean like what you're hearing right now
is the one I picked was Magical Sound Shower
which is like the best music in the game ever
I also named one of my horses a derby owner's club after it
it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier
and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D
where at the time 3D was just sort of like
what? we can do that? because they couldn't yet
so this I think is actually one of the games that opened up
a lot of the market for the
you know like we had our mode 7 games on the Super Nintendo
but I mean this was actually
I had this on Master System
wow that's pretty hardcore
yeah it's a pretty good game
were you able to actually play this on Master System?
yeah it's on Master System
interesting
it was very weird on Master System
and I do believe if I'm right there was
you know we got Afterburner and Space Harrier on the 32X
but in Japan there was a 32X release of this
that was pretty much arcade
I mean with this and Afterburner and Space Harrier
these were the arcade releases on the 32X
in fact you could even change some of them into arcade mode
but I think the other big part of this was just that
with the combination of
you know getting your choice of paths
or getting the music that you got
because you could actually change your music channel
and a lot of racing games now have that sort of option
for the music that you listen to as you play
and for the Genesis version
I actually had an extra bit of music in it too
but one that I liked
we had the arcade that I used to work at in Alabama
is Outrunners which was the two player Outrun
and it had a few differences to it
also for anyone else who is a big fan of Sega titles
Outrun has shown up in a bunch of other games
we've seen it in Shenmue 2
you can play it on Dreamcast in Shenmue 2
there's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance
the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation
it's actually in Outrun 2 as well
I don't know if anyone has actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out
but it was included in Arizona with updated versions of the original tracks
that were in it too
so I thought it was pretty cool
Outrun is one of those classics
I think that it should be the first
I'd have to say first racing game I think I've mentioned in the classic games
also it had an appearance in one of my favorite movies
What's that?
Donnie Darko
Nice
Some of the chat room folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision
Black Lab says Lucky and Wild greater than Outrun
I do not like that game
Orko says Lucky and Wild how I heart think
I have a bias against Lucky and Wild
What's that?
Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those
and I had to clean that sucker
Did people do nasty things in Lucky and Wild?
It was the drive and gun game
and people would break the gun controller
or leave their crap all in the thing
and no, it sucked
In another game I have a bias against the Suzuka 8-hour
because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom
when we had inspection
I do like hard driving though because I took a nap in one once
Anything else you want to say about Outrun, Jamie?
Outrun is great
