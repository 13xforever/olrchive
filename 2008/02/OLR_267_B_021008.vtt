Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome back everybody, here to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 10th of 2008.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
We're going to get back into the gaming news in just a moment, but we're really looking forward here in Part B tonight

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
to trying out a brand new game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
We're very excited to test out a new game. We're going to be playing that a little bit later.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Yes, I'm keeping it a secret what it is, but don't be worried if you weren't picked to play in tonight's game

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
because everybody in chat has a chance to play and win tonight.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's amazing!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
But here's the thing, if you were listening right at the end of Part A, even the podcast folks,

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
we asked a trivia question, and the trivia question was which one of these games is this music from?

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
And the three answers you could pick from was A, Nightmare on Elm Street, B, Halloween, or C, Friday the 13th.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
So we'll give you a little hint, we're not going to tell you who won just yet, but we will tell you the correct answer was C, Friday the 13th.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
So if you didn't guess Friday the 13th, sorry, you're not going to be picked tonight,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
but you will get a chance to play in the chat room, so all hope is not lost.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
You may still win either a copy of Res HD or if you don't have an Xbox, one of our other prizes from our new prize table,

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I'll talk about a little more later, but if you did say Friday the 13th, you might want to stay by your phone.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Alright, but in the meantime, we're going to get back into some gaming news, right, Loki?

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
Yes, Fooling at Home, it's been available on PCs for a long time and just not really that recently, but on the PS3 as well.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
Now they have hit one million users actually, at least on the PlayStation 3, so that's pretty awesome.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
One million consoles contributing to a cure for cancer or God knows what else they're doing.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
Calculating votes for the 2008 primaries or who knows.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Making a better caffeine molecule.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Better caffeine molecule.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That is something they need to work on actually.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Finishing Duke Nukem Forever.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
That is also something they need to get to working on.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
Also mentioning the PlayStation 3, which Fooling at Home appears on, there's a brand new Japanese PlayStation 3 that's going to be coming out very soon.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
It's going to come with a 40GB hard drive and a 6-axis wireless controller.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It is the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It comes out on March 6th.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
It will cost you 39,980 yen.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
If you want to translate that into U.S. dollars, that's 376 U.S. dollars.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
So it's the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
So that should be interesting, I guess, if you like different colors.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Of course, everybody in Japan loves different colors.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I guess.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
People were hoping that it was going to be coming out with the DualShock 3 in there as well, but nope, Sony's smarter than that.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
They're like, hahaha, no, you have to buy that controller, bitch.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Alright, well that's really all there is.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
PlayStation 3 in a new color.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
How this is news, I don't know, but it is.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
So there you have it.

03:24.000 --> 03:35.000
According to EGM's Quarterman rumor column, in their March issue they talk about how that God of War Chain of Olympus, or Chains of Olympus,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
will be heading to PlayStation 2.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
Of course, this is a rumor, but seeing their trend so far with, I don't know, Twisted Metal Head On, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, stuff like that,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
it's not going to be too surprising if they port the PSP game to the PlayStation 2.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
And hell, it will sell a lot of copies, so not so surprising.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, and Silent Hill Origins, that was another one that was ported from PSP.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
In other Sony news, Flow will be making its way to the PlayStation Portable,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
and it comes out on March 6th.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
The game is coming out from Super Villain Studios,

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
and yeah, I don't know why, though, you would want to get this when it's probably going to cost you more than it did on PlayStation 3.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
How much is it?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I don't know, it doesn't have a price yet, but...

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Oh no, you're going to get it through the PlayStation Store, so I guess it is the same.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, it might be the same price.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh, then never mind.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
But what a pain in the ass to buy something on the store and then transfer and all that stuff, you know?

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I haven't actually touched the PlayStation Portable store yet.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I haven't even looked at that, because I know now they're starting to re-release...

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It's where they're starting to put full PlayStation Portable games on there now.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Huh.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Like, they had Wipeout, Pure you can download, and a bunch of other stuff, you know.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, because they figured that everyone else is already downloading stuff.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah, everyone else is already downloading it.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
So let's join the party and charge for it, and no one will still buy it.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't know, it's a cool idea to have original games on there, but you know...

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
What they need is a link to actually be able to view that store from the PSP.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Because, I mean, as far as I'm aware, now they don't.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And I don't remember the URL for it, so...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I ain't buying anything from it.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And there's a bee in here.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Ah, that's scary.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I think.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Is that a bee?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No, it's just a fly.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You sure?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, it is.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
That's pretty big for a fly.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I'll take a look at it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Are you scared?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah, I'm just saying, you know.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh my god, there's a bee.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, Loki, you do news.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'll take care of the bee.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.360
Anyways, another game that's going to be coming out here for the PlayStation 3 also is going

05:37.360 --> 05:38.360
to have...

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
It's a fly, Loki.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
Don't be scared.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.360
Oh, well, you've grown big here.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.920
Yes, we do.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.800
Just like Devil May Cry 4 that had a mandatory install, or not really mandatory, I guess

05:47.800 --> 05:50.360
that one was more of an optional install.

05:50.360 --> 05:59.680
Hot Shots Golf 5 in Japan right now has a 5GB, that's kind of ironic, install before

05:59.680 --> 06:00.680
you can play the game.

06:00.680 --> 06:07.120
And, of course, this is probably going to be on the US version, the Hot Shots Golf on

06:07.120 --> 06:09.520
Tour, is what it's called, or Out of Bounds.

06:09.520 --> 06:15.640
And that kind of sucks that this trend of now these games having to be installed, I

06:15.640 --> 06:20.600
guess that's why you need your 80GB system, or 40GB, or whatever, to install these damn

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
games.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
That actually makes a lot of sense.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.400
But, you know, well, again, to play Devil's Advocate, I suppose a little bit, if the PlayStation

06:26.400 --> 06:31.440
3 is supposed to be more like a computer, then we shouldn't be surprised, right?

06:31.440 --> 06:36.240
Yeah, but I'm still kind of a little frustrated at the fact that, you know, consoles like

06:36.240 --> 06:38.960
the Xbox 360, you don't install games like this.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
I mean, they have...

06:39.960 --> 06:43.560
The only game I know that you install stuff to it, actually there's two.

06:43.560 --> 06:48.600
I think there's a Football Manager game in the UK, and then there's also Final Fantasy

06:48.600 --> 06:54.160
XI, but, you know, you have to install it on every console, so that's not a big deal.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.000
But it's just all because of that Blu-ray drive being slow, so that kind of sucks.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.520
Alright, well, you know, on a smaller scale, Sony is doing these preload things as well.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.480
It's a brand new Monster Hunter game.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.480
It's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is coming out, and what this has in common with the

07:12.480 --> 07:18.300
last story is that you actually have the option to copy what's on the UMD to your memory card

07:18.300 --> 07:21.840
on the PSP, and that will decrease load times.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.240
So it's kind of the same concept, however, we should emphasize it's optional here and

07:25.240 --> 07:28.600
not required, which makes sense, because there's PSPs out there, you know, where your memory

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
card might be very small.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.280
Like mine, I only have like a 32 megabyte memory card, because I bought mine a long

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
time ago.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.760
I bought the PSP a long time ago before they started, like, coming with a gigabyte memory

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
stick.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
Yeah, it's...

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
I don't know.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.640
I think it's funny, though, that you can install it to the PSP memory stick, and yet all this

07:45.640 --> 07:49.320
time we've been trying to stop people from installing it to their memory stick.

07:49.320 --> 07:56.120
Oh, how they're so ironic.

07:56.120 --> 08:00.160
Another thing that's ironic is a PSP exploding in your pocket.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.600
Is that a PSP in your pocket, or are you just really happy?

08:03.600 --> 08:09.960
Apparently, a student was hospitalized after suffering leg burns from a PSP.

08:09.960 --> 08:15.480
He had a third-party battery in his PSP and apparently charged it up, and the battery

08:15.480 --> 08:16.480
exploded.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
It's also...

08:17.480 --> 08:21.600
I kind of feel bad for the guy, I mean, it doesn't sound like he did anything wrong.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
It does suck.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
It does suck.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.440
At least it wasn't a Sony battery, because that would be bad.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.800
Or did he do anything, maybe?

08:29.800 --> 08:30.800
I don't know.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.200
No, he had the system turned off, and it was in his pocket, and he was in the middle of

08:34.200 --> 08:38.760
band practice when all of a sudden it melted through his jeaned pocket, sending him to

08:38.760 --> 08:40.880
the hospital with second-degree burns on his leg.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.880
That sucks.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.880
Yeah.

08:42.880 --> 08:53.280
So, I don't know, luckily my PSPs aren't bursting into flames there.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.280
Wow.

08:55.280 --> 09:03.300
Well, it's time to move on into another segment here we like to do on this show pretty regularly.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.680
Every week we like to hear from you guys and your emails that you send us at mailbag at

09:06.680 --> 09:10.880
orangeloungeradio.com, and we open them up and read through the emails in a little segment

09:10.880 --> 09:19.720
that we call The Mailbag.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.160
Going to chat real quick though, I got to say this, we've got to read these comments

09:22.160 --> 09:23.160
here.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.160
SHJ100Matt says, I smell lawsuit.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
Do you think so?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
Do you think?

09:26.160 --> 09:29.880
Maybe from the battery company, but I hope it's not, you know, they don't try to sue

09:29.880 --> 09:30.880
Sony.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.880
It's not their fault.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
It's the fault of the battery manufacturers.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.880
Oh, there you go.

09:33.880 --> 09:38.560
All right, well, let's dig into the mailbag here and see what folks have to say tonight.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.720
Again, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.920
We'll read this one first.

09:42.920 --> 09:51.440
This comes to us from, we'll call him Nathaniel P, I guess is the name based on the signature

09:51.440 --> 09:52.440
there.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.480
Dear cynical and acromonious cast of, I totally mispronounced that word, of Orange Lounge

09:56.480 --> 10:01.600
Radio, acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm a varied gamer when it comes to my playlist

10:01.600 --> 10:04.160
and currently I've been playing Guitar Hero 3.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.460
Though I am also varied when it comes to my music, I listen more to classical orchestrated

10:07.460 --> 10:08.760
symphony type music.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.760
One of the few rock bands I find enjoyable are the fine gents of Rhapsody or Rhapsody

10:12.760 --> 10:13.760
of Fire.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.760
I was hoping if you knew whether any of the band's numerous songs would ever appear in

10:16.760 --> 10:20.900
any Guitar Hero 3 downloadable content packs.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.560
I don't think we've heard anything like that.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.640
I don't know if you're going to see much more independent music come out in these packs.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.840
Usually that's something that kind of happens towards the end of the cycle than so much

10:31.840 --> 10:32.840
in the beginning.

10:32.840 --> 10:37.160
Personally, I would expect a rock band to have more of a chance for content like that

10:37.160 --> 10:39.960
since they actually release stuff on a regular basis.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.200
Now here's what the band should do is they should look out for chances.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.920
I don't know if you know these guys personally and trying to get them a plug on the show

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
or whatever.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.280
If so, good job.

10:49.280 --> 10:52.720
One thing these guys could do is maybe try to contact the folks in Guitar Hero 4 because

10:52.720 --> 10:55.600
I want to say I saw a story earlier this week that I don't think made in our show world

10:55.600 --> 10:59.520
tonight, but some indie band out there spilled the beans that they were going to be in Guitar

10:59.520 --> 11:03.840
Hero 4 and posted this entire probable song list from the game.

11:03.840 --> 11:08.160
I think it kind of made a lot of people go, I don't know about that, a little apprehensive

11:08.160 --> 11:15.280
to call it actual news, but certainly Guitar Hero always has like 20, 30 independent songs

11:15.280 --> 11:16.360
in there.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.640
I would say go for Guitar Hero 4.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.460
The band will get out there more that way.

11:21.460 --> 11:31.960
This email comes to us from PKJunior92 and sends us this, Hey, I have just two questions

11:31.960 --> 11:32.960
or comments.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.260
First is directed to Loki and it's about the Eye of Judgment bet.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.240
It's just not possible considering the caliber of the game, and I don't think ratings are

11:40.240 --> 11:43.180
in negative numbers, to reach one million ever.

11:43.180 --> 11:47.440
If you want to make it more reasonable, make it 500,000 copies sold, even though it probably

11:47.440 --> 11:50.080
won't sell more than 350,000.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.520
Loki is too safe and I think he knows it.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.560
Anyways, here's my second question.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.200
Well, before we get to his second question, I think that was the whole point behind Loki

11:58.200 --> 12:00.320
taking the bet in the first place.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.180
As much as you chatters want it, Loki does not want to come here and dress in a tingle

12:05.180 --> 12:08.760
outfit and set the Eye of Judgment on fire or whatever we talk about here.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.760
Right, Loki?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
You don't really want to do that.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.760
No.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.040
Yeah, because you know people will take screen caps on Justin.tv and it will be all over

12:14.040 --> 12:15.580
the internet the next day, right?

12:15.580 --> 12:20.060
That's fine, but I mean, and I understand, I don't think it's going to hit 500,000 either,

12:20.060 --> 12:24.960
but you know, I've already reduced it so many times, you know, lifetime of, you know, ever.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.560
The bet was a million, and that was to Loki prove a point that the game will never sell

12:29.560 --> 12:33.720
at all, and he was going to pick something completely, you know, obscure that he would,

12:33.720 --> 12:37.120
you know, something completely insane, I don't even know where that bet came from, to do

12:37.120 --> 12:39.620
if it actually did that, so.

12:39.620 --> 12:43.920
It's kind of one of those, like, when pigs fly, the game will sell a million copies,

12:43.920 --> 12:48.300
so when Loki puts on a tingle suit, the game will sell a million copies.

12:48.300 --> 12:55.040
Here's the second question from pkjr92, um, sure, anyway, here's my second question, why

12:55.040 --> 12:58.440
all the hate towards the Playstation 3 with the exception of Loki?

12:58.440 --> 13:01.600
Sure there is almost no support from Sony, but if you have a high def TV, the games look

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
amazing.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.900
Now I realize that not everyone has a nice TV, but the games still have the ability to

13:05.900 --> 13:10.100
be more in-depth than Xbox 360 games, and the Playstation Network is free!

13:10.100 --> 13:11.100
How about that?

13:11.100 --> 13:14.600
Yeah, but you get what you pay for with the Playstation Network, unfortunately.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.500
I think you kind of said it yourself in the wording, you said, but the games still have

13:18.500 --> 13:21.520
the ability to be more in-depth than Xbox 360.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
But aren't.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
But aren't.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
That's the part you didn't say.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.520
But aren't.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.520
Yet.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.320
I mean, sure, the Playstation 3 is capable of a lot.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.600
Let's see it!

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
Let's see it!

13:30.600 --> 13:33.560
You know, home, little big planet, that kind of stuff gets us excited, you know?

13:33.560 --> 13:39.440
I'd be pissed if I had to pay for Playstation Network, because it's seriously not worth

13:39.440 --> 13:40.640
my time, I would say.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.200
I try really hard to not bag on Sony.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.400
I think I've given the PSP a lot of slack, and you know what, it's really come a long

13:47.400 --> 13:48.900
way, I think, since the release.

13:48.900 --> 13:53.440
But the Playstation 3, you know, it really needed to be... it wasn't first out there,

13:53.440 --> 13:57.300
it really needed to be something great on day one, and it just wasn't.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.400
So that's that.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.800
He also wants to say, by the way, thanks for broadcasting on Super Bowl Sunday, considering

14:02.800 --> 14:04.760
not everyone is in love with football.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.480
However, the Stanley Cup Finals are a totally different thing, pretty much all of Canada

14:08.480 --> 14:09.480
watches.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.480
Well, sorry for going on and on.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.760
You know a lot of Americans watch the Super Bowl, though, we are in the minority of not

14:15.760 --> 14:16.760
watching it.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.760
In fact, I believe this year's Super Bowl was the second highest rated American television

14:21.760 --> 14:25.120
thing ever, behind the final episode of MASH.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.960
But keep in mind, the final episode of MASH aired before there was cable and stuff.

14:29.960 --> 14:34.400
So no broadcast network thing is ever going to do that well again.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.440
Anyway, you want to say something, puppy?

14:37.440 --> 14:42.640
I was just thinking that we don't broadcast from Canada, so...

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
That is true.

14:43.640 --> 14:47.960
I don't even know when the hockey season ends or starts, so...

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
Hockey's pretty fun, though.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.400
One of these days I'm going to get Melody to take me to a Sharks game in San Jose, well

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
let's see.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.120
She gets season passes and all that stuff.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.360
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.520
Let's go to another email.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.400
This one comes to us from Sakura Max.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.680
Hi, OLR, you people have influenced me to make an OLR Dragon Force movie contest.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.520
We thread on OLR website, and that would be at www.orangehonchord.com.

15:10.520 --> 15:15.040
You record footage of you playing your favorite games and play Dragon Force in your video.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.000
It was influenced by the Yaris video and your mentioning of Dragon Force, hope it goes well.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.760
For those who might be new to our program, we said that you can make a bad game even

15:22.760 --> 15:26.840
better most of the time by putting Dragon Force music to it, because Dragon Force is

15:26.840 --> 15:28.320
just that awesome.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.680
And so some of our listeners have taken it upon themselves to do this, and now Sakura

15:31.680 --> 15:34.160
Max wants to make a little contest out of it.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.560
I say go for it.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.560
It's pretty awesome.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.360
I don't know what we can contribute for prizes.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.000
Maybe we're trying to reserve some things on the prize table for something else, but

15:41.000 --> 15:42.480
maybe we can dig up something.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.480
So participate.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.200
And a complete side note, Dragon Force sucks ass live.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.200
Really?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.200
Yes, they do.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.200
When did you see them live?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.640
I didn't, but I know they are.

15:52.640 --> 15:57.740
I heard on the radio that they were going to be playing live at some event coming up

15:57.740 --> 16:00.920
in like two months from now in Sacramento.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.840
So I just decided, oh, hey, I'll see what they sound like live, and went to YouTube,

16:04.840 --> 16:08.360
and was terribly disappointed.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.400
All right.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.000
Well here comes the next email, one of two remaining emails we're going to read this

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
week.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.720
Sorry if we didn't get to your email, but we got a few this week.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.360
This comes to us from J-Rod.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.200
I think this is a Loki hate mail.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.080
Oh crap, oh crap.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
Good times.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
Let me back away.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
I love these emails.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.080
All right, here we go.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.480
I just wanted to write in, nah, it's not really a hate mail.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.040
I just wanted to write in and completely put over Loki.

16:32.040 --> 16:36.520
There's anger and cynicism on the show not only make for hilarious radio, but most of

16:36.520 --> 16:37.720
the time echo my own thoughts.

16:37.720 --> 16:38.720
All right, I was lying.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.720
It's not a hate mail.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.440
Quite a few times though it seems like he's very out of place, because Rob and Jamie are

16:43.440 --> 16:48.520
pretty optimistic people, and it's usually silent after one of Loki's rants.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.500
Not one of those let him have the stage silent moments, but an uncomfortable what's this

16:52.500 --> 16:54.200
guy's deal silent moments.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.680
I was surprised to hear that Loki and Sky used to room together.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.000
I was just so interested in the relationship between all you guys, because you seem so

17:00.000 --> 17:01.200
radically different.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.800
But say you.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.680
So are you just an angry person who rants all the time?

17:06.680 --> 17:07.680
I'm not an angry person.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.680
Yeah.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.480
No, something you guys should know, in the time that I lived with Loki, it's not like

17:11.480 --> 17:16.080
he goes around in his personal life and goes, oh my God, what the hell?

17:16.080 --> 17:17.080
Very much.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.480
I mean, he does once in a while, but only when super bacon baking goes wrong.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.920
I don't bake super bacon anymore.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
You did back in the day.

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
I do back in the day.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.920
You know it.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.000
Well, the way, obviously, I think I've told a story on the show before, but to go back,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.680
remember Orange Lounge Radio History, when we started this show, the first few years

17:34.680 --> 17:37.880
that we were doing it, it was all about DDR and music-based video games.

17:37.880 --> 17:43.120
That's because Loki, myself, and Dark Sakura all met at an arcade playing DDR in the local

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
Sacramento scene.

17:44.120 --> 17:49.440
We used to play together with some other folks and go out to dinner afterwards, to this restaurant

17:49.440 --> 17:51.080
that was right across the street from Golf Land.

17:51.080 --> 17:55.720
And so we wanted to kind of create a show that had that feel of going to dinner and

17:55.720 --> 17:59.120
talking smack about games and talking about the community or what have you.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.960
It's kind of, I guess you could say it's a spin-off of another show I used to be on,

18:02.960 --> 18:05.320
Understation Live, which is a very similar kind of vibe.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.720
So that's why we're here.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.400
And Loki and I used to be roommates because there was just a point where Loki was looking

18:10.400 --> 18:13.300
to move out the same time I was, and it just made sense.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.960
So there you have it.

18:15.960 --> 18:20.880
As far as us being silent when he does rants and things, you know, sometimes there's just

18:20.880 --> 18:23.520
no way to respond.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
There's no way to respond.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.360
Also, I have to be honest, I'll let you in on a little secret, we have to multitask like

18:28.360 --> 18:30.000
crazy to make this show happen.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.040
I mean, keep in mind, relatively on this show for a live radio program, there's not a lot

18:36.040 --> 18:37.920
of dead air.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.540
And keep in mind that when Jamie, myself, and Loki are all here, we're juggling from

18:41.540 --> 18:45.400
story to story, trying to kind of glance at the parts of the story we actually want to

18:45.400 --> 18:46.800
read on the air.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.440
We're trying to read the chat room.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.720
We're trying to, you know, bring up everything.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.920
So sometimes we can't totally focus on what's being said.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.280
So sometimes I kind of get in that mode where when Loki rants, I just let him rant.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.240
I go, okay, Loki's ranting, you know, just kind of let him do his thing.

18:59.240 --> 19:04.120
Because it is insanely funny to listen to and the listeners love it, so why not, right?

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
Sure.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.120
Everyone loves Loki.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.320
And in terms of multitasking, Loki's still doing that now.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.040
Yeah, he's playing his fucking game while I try to do the mailbag.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.320
I am contributing to the show, okay?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.440
I am talking.

19:16.440 --> 19:21.280
It's just, it's been the black circles, only two keys, and I can do that with one hand.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.120
Alright, one more thing in J-Rod's email that I think is great, unfortunately Jamie's not

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
here to see it.

19:26.120 --> 19:30.600
She said, also, I attached a picture I took before I went to see Rambo that you guys might

19:30.600 --> 19:31.600
like.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.080
Awesome show and keep on rocking.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.740
And J-Rod's signature as always.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.520
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.220
And here's the email in front of the Olive Garden.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.240
There is who I assume to be J-Rod wearing a Silent Hill shirt.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.520
I actually own that exact same Silent Hill shirt.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
That's awesome.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.680
And I hope Pyramid Head was going to go in there and cut up some pasta for you guys to

19:51.680 --> 19:52.680
have.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.480
By the way, F-you to the Olive Garden for getting rid of the dish I like there, the

19:56.480 --> 19:57.800
Tuscan chicken dish.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.800
Oh, oh no.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.800
Ah, they got rid of it.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.280
They have a new thing that's pretty good though.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.760
And I don't want to hear from the listeners that go, Olive Garden isn't real Italian food.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.840
I know.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
It's not.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
You win.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
It's not real Italian food.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
But you know what?

20:09.840 --> 20:13.840
Some days you feel like, like some days you feel like a gourmet burger, right?

20:13.840 --> 20:15.740
You want to go to Black Angus, right?

20:15.740 --> 20:18.160
Some days you feel like McDonald's.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.440
I say the same thing with Italian food, okay?

20:21.440 --> 20:27.200
And unless you have Italian parents, you're not going to get real Italian food.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.200
Probably not.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.880
Or an Italian grandmother, honestly.

20:29.880 --> 20:34.840
Yeah, I came from that kind of a family, so I know what Italian food is.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.840
You had a nana?

20:36.840 --> 20:40.880
Oh yeah, my grandma, she spoiled me and my brother.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
Alright.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
Not just with food.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
Alright.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
Oh, buying you video games and stuff?

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
Oh, of course, yes.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
Alright.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.400
One last email here, and it comes to us from Gray Fox.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.360
Hey, OLR gang, first of all, I would just like to say that it's cool that Rob and I

20:53.360 --> 20:55.680
are now officially friends on Facebook.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.280
Now I can look at all of his sexy pictures without him even knowing.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
Hey now.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.280
Whoa, did I say that out loud?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.280
Haha, just kidding.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
I'm not that creepy.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.280
I think you are a little bit.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.280
Actually, no, I'm kidding.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.280
Anyways.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.080
Oh my god, I'm as bad as Loki.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.740
I was wondering if it was possible to listen to some of the first episodes you guys recorded.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.920
The podcast feed only lets me go back to listen to October 2005.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.280
Actually, it does.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.000
I didn't even think the podcast feed went that far back, unless you've been listening

21:22.000 --> 21:25.800
that long, because usually the podcast feed only keeps like 20 shows.

21:25.800 --> 21:26.800
That's it.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.640
Also, I really like Dark Sakura's classic Game of the Week segment in the show.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.520
I think that it is good to pay respect to our elders, as Rob puts it.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.200
I loved Batman for the NES back in the day, but I'm not sure if it would have quite the

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
same appeal now.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
Batman was a pretty awesome game.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.560
It was one of the better movie to video game games.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.720
Recently I stumbled upon the Lego Star Wars series for PlayStation 2, and I can't believe

21:45.720 --> 21:47.040
how much fun it is.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.320
Really good party game that is really easy and even hilarious at some points.

21:50.320 --> 21:54.280
I highly recommend it for anyone that just wants to have some good old fashioned fun.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.840
Last comment, I'm thinking about purchasing a PSP, but was wondering if Loki knew if it

21:57.840 --> 22:02.680
was worth installing custom firmware on it, or if I can run homebrew on it without it.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.240
You have to put a custom firmware to run homebrew on it.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.480
Thanks and keep up the great work, Gray Fox.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
P.S.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.480
I hope another fly lands in Rob's coffee, because that was friggin' hilarious.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.640
Oh, and say no to exploding babies.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.000
Thankfully, the fly problem in here seems relatively taken care of, except for the one.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
There was the one.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
There was the one.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.880
He was flying around here earlier, and he flew in front of my face.

22:23.880 --> 22:28.160
He's not being too annoying as his brothers and sisters were a few weeks ago.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.880
Relatively the fly problem's been in check here in the studio, and I think that's as

22:30.880 --> 22:32.860
it's been getting warmer outside.

22:32.860 --> 22:33.920
So there you have it.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.280
The other question was about the old episodes of the show.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.760
You know, at this time we don't have any of the really old shows posted.

22:38.760 --> 22:43.600
I'm going to be honest, most, some of them are lost and will probably never be heard

22:43.600 --> 22:47.640
again unless some of our old listeners who used to record happen to have them.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.480
I know one for sure is gone.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
It's really old.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.440
It's like episode 80-something, I think.

22:53.440 --> 22:59.360
But a lot of the old shows we do kind of have, but our problem with distributing the old

22:59.360 --> 23:00.600
shows is this.

23:00.600 --> 23:05.020
We used to play music during the breaks on the old shows, and so for us to like sell

23:05.020 --> 23:10.720
DVDs or whatever is kind of difficult because we had the music during the breaks, plus the

23:10.720 --> 23:13.760
show really wasn't like what it is now.

23:13.760 --> 23:18.120
I mean, if you think we get off topic now, you should hear the old show.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.760
I mean, my God, it was a mess.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.760
In a good way.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.880
It was a fun mess, you know, but it was much different.

23:23.880 --> 23:28.160
So if, I think it's kind of one of those things where I want to let true, and I'm sure

23:28.160 --> 23:31.080
Loki and Darkseid were, we want to let true fans of Orange Lawns Radio who like our band

23:31.080 --> 23:34.000
and stuff, we want to let them hear it, but we don't want to put it out there so much

23:34.000 --> 23:38.200
that people are going to hear that thinking that is Orange Lawns Radio today because they

23:38.200 --> 23:40.180
would be like really off.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.920
So does that make sense?

23:42.920 --> 23:48.720
And back when the studio was like a six by six foot square box.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.240
Drunami says in the chat room, the old OLR was a great clusterfuck.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.720
Yes it was.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.920
I don't know, maybe like in the forums or on the LJ community or something, I'll

23:56.920 --> 24:01.760
put an old episode, or Facebook for you obviously, I'll put an old episode up there so you

24:01.760 --> 24:03.280
can kind of taste what it's like.

24:03.280 --> 24:08.040
And I know like Misty and DDR Angel when she was around, she hasn't been around a lot

24:08.040 --> 24:11.600
lately, but I know both of them really keep a lot of archives, so I'll try to put up

24:11.600 --> 24:17.200
an episode that even Misty doesn't have and everybody will like that, at least those

24:17.200 --> 24:18.480
that want to hear it.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.280
So there you have it, our mailbag.

24:20.280 --> 24:26.920
If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelownsradio.com.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.680
So if you're a member of Steam, you have a lot of other friends that are going to

24:31.680 --> 24:38.200
be on there of course, because Steam has hit 15 million accounts.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.000
That's quite a lot, and of course lots of good content that they have on there and they

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
keep adding more stuff.

24:45.000 --> 24:53.160
So apparently Valve had a lot to do with it, their Steam-based sales have jumped 158% over

24:53.160 --> 24:59.240
the holiday season compared to the previous ones, so that's pretty awesome.

24:59.240 --> 25:03.200
Definitely a viable source for gaming.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.680
I still have yet to even check out Steam.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.280
Have you ever used Steam?

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
Right.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.280
I don't know.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.280
Like I buy games.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.280
Oh, stop.

25:11.280 --> 25:17.560
Yeah, and you're going to get in trouble for that someday, but you know, what about its

25:17.560 --> 25:18.560
other elements?

25:18.560 --> 25:21.720
Like doesn't it have like the XFire thing built into it too where you can message across

25:21.720 --> 25:22.720
games and stuff?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.160
Like I like XFire, it's pretty cool.

25:25.160 --> 25:29.280
The NYR fam loves Steam in chat, he says Steam is the best, it kicks games for Windows apps.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.240
I'm not saying I have pirate games on the PC, I haven't bought games on PC in a long

25:33.240 --> 25:37.400
time because up until recently I haven't had a PC that can run games.

25:37.400 --> 25:44.880
The last game I bought on PC was Final Fantasy XI, so it's been a while, I mean I guess crisis

25:44.880 --> 25:50.280
since that came out, well that came with my graphics card though, but it's still, I'm

25:50.280 --> 25:54.200
looking forward to some stuff coming out like Spore and stuff, I'll buy that.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.920
Alright, well let's go over to the Nintendo Wii because we haven't been showing Nintendo

25:57.920 --> 26:02.320
a lot of love tonight and I want to talk about some stuff that's coming on the Wii soon and

26:02.320 --> 26:05.240
that is everyone's Nintendo channel.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.960
You might remember this came out in Japan a little while ago and it was kind of like

26:07.960 --> 26:09.280
a preview channel.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.200
You could check out some new games that are coming out, now not that you really download

26:12.200 --> 26:17.060
full demos and stuff, but you get interviews, basically it's one giant infomercial of a

26:17.060 --> 26:20.720
channel, but the big thing was the DS downloads, that you could get, you could get DS demos

26:20.720 --> 26:24.680
beamed to your DS, and the question was, when in the hell is it coming to the US?

26:24.680 --> 26:28.400
Well the answer is, about next month.

26:28.400 --> 26:32.040
That is coming from an insider source reporting to Kotaku, who ran the story earlier this

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
week.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.040
I'm not surprised.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.480
The channel will be home to some of the same sort of video game videos that you see on

26:37.480 --> 26:40.120
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.960
Convention videos might actually start popping up on the channel once it goes live in the

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
States.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.680
I'm assuming because like Penny Arcade Expo is up in that same area where Nintendo of

26:48.680 --> 26:51.040
America is, maybe that's one you can expect to see?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
I don't know.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
Maybe.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.320
I wouldn't be surprised because I want to say March is also the estimated time for when

26:56.320 --> 26:59.960
the WiiWare channel is going to launch, and I bet all of this is going to be documented

26:59.960 --> 27:04.840
when they, I don't know if they have a keynote at, I want to say at the Game Developers Conference,

27:04.840 --> 27:08.360
which is, God I think that's next week or the week after.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.360
It is.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.360
Sadly I'm not going.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.960
I don't think any of us are.

27:12.960 --> 27:17.320
And I know talking to some buddies over All Games or at least listening to their shows,

27:17.320 --> 27:22.880
All Games Interactive, our friends over there, only Jessica is going, and Bobby B's not going

27:22.880 --> 27:23.880
this year.

27:23.880 --> 27:24.880
Yeah.

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
Which is kind of too bad.

27:25.880 --> 27:26.880
It's, you know, I would love to go, but.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.740
Well, it's not really a media event.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.260
You know, it's not E3, and I think a lot of people get that confused and they expect the

27:32.260 --> 27:34.600
big announcements at Game Developers Conference.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.160
It's not really for you, it's for developers.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.840
But you may, but sometimes because of that you get new engines, like we talked about

27:40.840 --> 27:44.240
last week, the Crysis 2 engines that we showed you.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.520
You get to get little peaks from a developer angle, but that's really it.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.880
And also you get to see stuff like you might not normally see.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.600
Like I'm expecting them to talk about WiiWare since that makes sense from a developer's

27:54.600 --> 27:57.560
standpoint that they would want to address that stuff.

27:57.560 --> 28:01.720
Also there's rumors that, you know, that Microsoft is going to have something similar to like,

28:01.720 --> 28:06.640
you know, a YouTube of gaming type thing that they may discuss too.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.760
You'll see announcements like that, you know, talking about their network upgrades and crap

28:10.760 --> 28:11.760
like that.

28:11.760 --> 28:16.560
So that's what I'm kind of excited for, and god damn seriously Sony, I mean, the PlayStation

28:16.560 --> 28:20.760
Eye have seen a lot of those cool things that they're showing off in their blogs and stuff.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.080
Start implementing some of this stuff.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.760
I mean, they have really good ideas, but they're just kind of like, look what we can do with

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
this!

28:26.760 --> 28:30.960
But we're never going to use it, so fuck it, you know, come on!

28:30.960 --> 28:33.400
All right.

28:33.400 --> 28:38.160
I want to say really quickly before we get to the next story, TigerClaw is in chat and

28:38.160 --> 28:40.000
he's a big listener over at AGI.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.720
In fact, I think he came to our show because of all games and our syndication there.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.640
He says Jessica's bringing the Justin cam with her, he thinks.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.960
So that's kind of cool, if she's taking that cam with her.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.280
Justin TV is a great way to get that.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.700
I wish we were able to go more mobile with Justin TV.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.860
I think we can, because we have a laptop and camera, it's just difficult.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.860
You know, it's not easy.

28:57.860 --> 28:58.860
Because they're not together.

28:58.860 --> 29:00.640
Well, you know, you can get the cameras loose.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.980
Well, most people put the camera in the backpack, or I mean, put the laptop in the backpack

29:03.980 --> 29:07.160
and have the wire sticking out and put the, I mean, you can do it with that eyesight because

29:07.160 --> 29:10.440
that eyesight pops right out of the base, so you could just strap it to a helmet.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.400
We could do it, but it's just, it's hard.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.740
And it wouldn't run for very long on that laptop's battery either, because the laptop

29:15.740 --> 29:16.740
doesn't function when it's closed.

29:16.740 --> 29:19.780
I don't know if that's a setting I can change on there, but oh well.

29:19.780 --> 29:20.780
It's not worth it.

29:20.780 --> 29:22.400
Do you really want to see us out and about in public?

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
I don't think so.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.400
Let's have our privacy.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
Maybe.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.840
Mine works with the thing closed.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.400
Ah, don't, don't, don't give my ideas.

29:30.400 --> 29:35.160
I'm just saying, all right.

29:35.160 --> 29:39.880
A game I wasn't too hot on, but a lot of other people were, Drawn to Life.

29:39.880 --> 29:44.240
THQ has announced that it's going to be coming to the Wii, which is cool.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.560
I mean, it was a neat game, I guess.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.880
I just probably need to play it a little bit more, but it's a game where you can draw your

29:50.880 --> 29:51.880
own character.

29:51.880 --> 29:57.200
Fortunately, it's not a magic pen gel or graffiti kingdom, because, oh god, I love those games.

29:57.200 --> 30:04.480
Those games are endless possibilities, endless possibilities, especially when you're drunk.

30:04.480 --> 30:11.760
It's just like, oh god, and you can have Red Blob versus Blue Blob, Penis versus 2DX controller,

30:11.760 --> 30:12.760
you know?

30:12.760 --> 30:13.760
It's hilarious.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.760
Good times.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.760
Good times.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.760
All right.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.360
Before we get into our next news story, we're going to be getting into tonight's new game

30:19.360 --> 30:20.640
very soon.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.160
And as I mentioned, the entire chat room has the possibility to participate, but you have

30:25.160 --> 30:27.920
to participate through private message.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.920
During tonight's game, the chat room will be locked, and you will be unable to speak

30:31.920 --> 30:33.180
in the chat room during the game.

30:33.180 --> 30:36.100
This is to prevent cheating from you guys for helping each other out.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.560
So you have to play this game through private message.

30:38.560 --> 30:43.360
So if you are interested in playing tonight's game, you have to send me, and just in TV

30:43.360 --> 30:44.400
chat will not work.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.780
You need to be in chat.orangeandraday.com.

30:46.780 --> 30:51.060
If you are interested in playing tonight's game and possibly winning the prize tonight,

30:51.060 --> 30:56.640
which is Res HD or something else if you don't have an Xbox 360, just send me a private message.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.160
I'm Skye in the chat room.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
That's S-K-I-E.

30:59.160 --> 31:03.240
Send me a private message that just says, me, or I want to play.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.240
Me.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.240
Okay?

31:05.240 --> 31:08.040
Send me a private message if you want to play, and we'll let you know the next part very

31:08.040 --> 31:11.320
soon when we reveal what we're going to be playing tonight and the contestant who's going

31:11.320 --> 31:12.920
to be coming in over the phone.

31:12.920 --> 31:18.800
So while you guys send that in, I've got one more story for you guys.

31:18.800 --> 31:28.260
Nintendo has apparently revealed that they have sold 10 million virtual console games.

31:28.260 --> 31:32.920
So even if you think that, okay, so 10 million, the lowest price somebody's paying for those

31:32.920 --> 31:38.440
is five bucks, that's $50 million they've earned on the virtual console games, considering

31:38.440 --> 31:44.260
most of the stuff was written off, gone, we're never going to profit off of this stuff again.

31:44.260 --> 31:51.840
So there it went in free money, basically, from the virtual console, and Satoru Iwata,

31:51.840 --> 31:55.400
who's of course the president of Nintendo, talked about that this is proof of the value

31:55.400 --> 32:00.400
of digital distribution, however, not totally discounting the retail channel, saying that

32:00.400 --> 32:06.840
the retail channel is still important, but also admits that retail is not quite as profitable.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.240
It's low profit margins on the box titles.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.440
So could Nintendo be stepping more and more into digital distribution?

32:12.440 --> 32:13.720
Who knows?

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
Possibly quite soon.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.800
Yeah, not any time soon, because they're freaking slow.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.120
Where are they going to put all those digital downloads on the box?

32:21.120 --> 32:27.160
You can't digitally download a Wii remote or a balance board and all that crap you got

32:27.160 --> 32:28.160
to buy.

32:28.160 --> 32:31.840
Before you get to your story, Loki, I want to say, for those in chat, if you try to do

32:31.840 --> 32:35.740
a private message conversation via DCC, it will not work.

32:35.740 --> 32:39.420
The DCC client that's built into MIRC, you need to do it another way.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.640
Look at Dark Tetsuya's post in chat.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.840
He shows you guys how to do it.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.240
So please get to doing that.

32:46.240 --> 32:51.120
Tomitsu Magazine had some details on the brand new Mario Kart Wii.

32:51.120 --> 32:57.560
It's going to sport 32 courses, mid-air tricks, and of course, Mii integration, which sounds

32:57.560 --> 32:58.560
pretty awesome.

32:58.560 --> 33:03.500
They're going to be remaking, I know, some of the tracks that were in Mario Kart DS,

33:03.500 --> 33:08.120
as well as pretty much all the Mario games.

33:08.120 --> 33:13.800
Of course, they are saying that 16 of the tracks that are going to be from other games

33:13.800 --> 33:18.400
and the other 16 are brand new, although I wish there were more brand new tracks and

33:18.400 --> 33:22.040
less of the repeated tracks, but whatever.

33:22.040 --> 33:27.380
12-player online matches will also be available, and you'll be able to play 4-player split

33:27.380 --> 33:32.280
screen, and I think you can play 2-player over online, too, so you can do 2 people per

33:32.280 --> 33:33.960
console as well.

33:33.960 --> 33:40.320
Ghost downloads, time trials will also be available, and you can also, of course, choose

33:40.320 --> 33:42.440
a bike or a kart.

33:42.440 --> 33:49.920
I wonder which version of Rainbow Road they would use, because there's quite a few.

33:49.920 --> 33:56.280
And you know if they don't do Rainbow Road just right, people are going to be pissed,

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
so we'll see.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.120
All right, you ready to get to tonight's game?

34:00.120 --> 34:01.120
Yay!

34:01.120 --> 34:02.660
All right, well let's get to tonight's game.

34:02.660 --> 34:06.640
By the way, you only have about 15 more seconds to send me a private message or you are out.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.880
You cannot join the game midway through.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.160
You are out if you don't send me a private message, okay?

34:11.160 --> 34:12.640
Time is almost up.

34:12.640 --> 34:18.080
However, we need to get one contestant on the phone, so hopefully if you answered Friday

34:18.080 --> 34:21.520
the 13th in our thing earlier, you might want to stand by the phone, because it could be

34:21.520 --> 34:23.200
ringing right now.

34:23.200 --> 34:29.240
Let's put in the number of our contestant.

34:29.240 --> 34:33.080
Live radio folks, sorry for any delays or dead area here.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.880
Here it goes, it's ringing.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.160
Hello, is this Tiger Claw?

34:37.160 --> 34:38.400
Yo, what's up?

34:38.400 --> 34:40.000
Hey, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.360
Guess what?

34:41.360 --> 34:43.480
Yeah, I think I know.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.480
You think you know?

34:44.480 --> 34:47.360
That's right, you're going to be playing a game with us tonight.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.560
Tiger Claw, it's a brand new game.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.560
What do you think about that?

34:50.560 --> 34:51.560
Oh, exciting.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.080
I know, it's very exciting.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.760
How would you say your knowledge of video game trivia is?

34:57.760 --> 35:06.400
Well, I would guess so and so, considering that I've been around since it was invented.

35:06.400 --> 35:12.960
Do you think that, were you playing Pong back in the day?

35:12.960 --> 35:17.640
Yeah, my first video game was Pong, and after that was the Power 2600.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.800
Awesome, well then maybe you have an advantage.

35:19.800 --> 35:24.260
Do you think you know enough about video game trivia that you could beat the entire chat

35:24.260 --> 35:26.680
room at video game trivia?

35:26.680 --> 35:32.200
Maybe, I don't know, I didn't play every single video game that's out there.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.720
That's not a game show answer.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.680
That's not a game show answer, you're supposed to say, fuck yeah, I can beat them.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.480
I could see what I possibly know, man.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.480
I know.

35:42.480 --> 35:43.480
He sucks.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.760
Well, you know what, Tiger Claw, I hope you can do it, because tonight we are going to

35:46.760 --> 35:58.760
be playing a new game called One vs. the Chat Room.

35:58.760 --> 36:05.520
That's right, it's a take of another popular show that you might be hearing on the television.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.320
One vs. the Chat Room, so here it is.

36:09.320 --> 36:15.480
You're playing tonight, Tiger Claw, to win a possible copy of Res HD on the Xbox 360.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.520
Do you own an Xbox 360?

36:17.520 --> 36:18.520
Of course.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.520
Alright, do you have Res HD?

36:19.520 --> 36:20.520
Nope.

36:20.520 --> 36:24.900
Oh, then you know you'd be perfect for winning this code, but here's the thing, Tiger Claw,

36:24.900 --> 36:28.320
if at any point during the game, we're going to ask you some questions, if at any point

36:28.320 --> 36:35.800
during the game, the Chat Room beats you, we're going to give it to one of them.

36:35.800 --> 36:40.880
By the way, chatters, if you don't have an Xbox 360, or you already have Res HD, we're

36:40.880 --> 36:45.400
going to offer you something off of our brand new prize table, and tonight, since I know

36:45.400 --> 36:50.920
you guys all have PCs, we're going to be giving away, if you don't have Res HD, we're going

36:50.920 --> 36:56.160
to give you a brand new PC game from our buddies at PopCap, who sent us some PC games earlier

36:56.160 --> 36:59.920
this week, so everybody has a chance to win something tonight, even if you don't have

36:59.920 --> 37:01.360
an Xbox 360.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.400
Let me explain how the game works.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.800
Everybody that's in chat, pretty soon, the chat is going to go into lockdown, you will

37:07.800 --> 37:11.680
not be able to speak publicly within the room, it's going to get very quiet in there, you

37:11.680 --> 37:14.240
will only be able to play this game through private message.

37:14.240 --> 37:20.280
I'm going to be asking Tiger Claw multiple choice questions with three possible answers.

37:20.280 --> 37:25.440
You will have about 30 seconds to send your answer to me via private message, then Tiger

37:25.440 --> 37:27.480
Claw will answer the question.

37:27.480 --> 37:33.920
If he gets it right, anybody in chat who gets it wrong will be eliminated and will not be

37:33.920 --> 37:36.680
able to proceed any further in the game.

37:36.680 --> 37:40.540
Anybody who gets it right along with Tiger Claw will go to the next question.

37:40.540 --> 37:45.560
If Tiger Claw gets through five questions without the chatroom beating him, then he

37:45.560 --> 37:46.640
will win the game.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.320
If, however, at any point, and it could be on the very first question, if at any point,

37:50.320 --> 37:54.560
even on the very first question, if he loses, those that got the right answer will be eligible

37:54.560 --> 37:59.400
to win the prize we will pick one of the chat chatters randomly to win the prize

37:59.400 --> 38:02.820
so we'll kind of explain that a little more as we move through it let's see how

38:02.820 --> 38:05.680
many chatters are actually playing tonight want to see how many chatters we

38:05.680 --> 38:11.600
have and who you're playing against? Tigerclaw? Probably the entire chat room. Just about I

38:11.600 --> 38:14.200
hate to say it we have just about the entire damn chat room we're playing

38:14.200 --> 38:18.200
against tonight let's see we got Rama that's one, Frisbee two, RosteelUT three,

38:18.200 --> 38:25.400
GS 191 four, GS 68 five, Junami six, PK Runo seven, Amaze Atsuma eight, SJ 100

38:25.400 --> 38:31.720

38:31.720 --> 38:39.320
Act F fourteen, Trishlicious fifteen, Kevin DDR sixteen, Son of

38:39.320 --> 38:48.600
Dad seventeen, Zeni eighteen, Seed Store nineteen, Raven's Dolphin twenty, and AJ Mix twenty one. So it's

38:48.600 --> 38:53.120
you versus twenty one people think you can do it? Well I'll give it a try. All

38:53.120 --> 38:56.120
right you got to do your best that's all we ask so everybody in chat wish each

38:56.120 --> 39:03.360
other luck we'll give them just a minute to do that okay and here we go the chat

39:03.360 --> 39:07.760
room is now locked nobody will be able to tell type in chat and help each

39:07.760 --> 39:11.960
other out let's get to the very first question an ops you have the power to

39:11.960 --> 39:14.800
override that but I asked for your silence during this time because the ops

39:14.800 --> 39:17.840
in our chat have the power to override that like Rama and them but I asked for

39:17.840 --> 39:21.880
their silence again you will only have a little bit of time to send your answer

39:21.880 --> 39:26.480

42:12.160 --> 42:17.200
here's some answers from the chat room Rama has said that the answer is blades

42:17.200 --> 42:23.740
of steel frisbee has said that the answer is double dribble one of those is

42:23.740 --> 42:29.960

48:45.240 --> 48:48.760
give the chat a chance to think

48:48.760 --> 48:59.800
I need I need the full soundtrack to this show I think yeah there's a

48:59.800 --> 49:05.640
different song for when they were doing the well I only have the one so shoot me

49:05.640 --> 49:15.080
we just started off by saying what versus fine one versus six here it is so

49:15.080 --> 49:17.680
somebody's walking away with the prize one of these seven people is gonna win

49:17.680 --> 49:21.800
the prize Tiger claw it's time in which Final Fantasy game was there a character

49:21.800 --> 49:27.920
named Ferris was it a Final Fantasy 4 B Final Fantasy 5 or C Final Fantasy 9 I'm

49:27.920 --> 49:34.160
gonna have to say Final Fantasy 9 all right let's see if that's the correct

49:34.160 --> 49:40.760
answer the Final Fantasy game that had a character named Ferris was Final Fantasy

49:40.760 --> 49:49.960
5 I'm sorry Tiger Claw you have lost to the mob in the chat room this is where

49:49.960 --> 49:54.480
the mob cheers I'm sorry Tiger Claw you did very very well though this is a very

49:54.480 --> 49:57.520
hard game for the person in the hot seat to win I think you should be very proud

49:57.520 --> 50:02.600
of yourself okay hey no problem not too familiar with Final Fantasy that's why I

50:02.600 --> 50:07.560

50:42.880 --> 50:47.740
chatters are wondering which one of us is gonna win it alright so here we go

50:47.740 --> 50:52.560
let's see who is gonna be knocked out we have that person moves on that person

50:52.560 --> 50:57.400
moves on that person moves on that person moves on that person all six of

50:57.400 --> 51:00.400
them got it right in chat I think we should narrow the field a

51:00.400 --> 51:03.040
little bit you want to narrow the feel a little bit while one more question I

51:03.040 --> 51:04.880
I think so, all right, fine then.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.040
We'll narrow the field a little bit with one more question.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.000
All right, in order to do that,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.080
we gotta put this in moderated mode again

51:10.080 --> 51:11.060
so they can't cheat.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.260
So some poor people were just trying to chat.

51:14.260 --> 51:15.100
Here we go.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.700
Here is the fifth question.

51:17.900 --> 51:22.040
All right, the fifth question is in the category

51:22.040 --> 51:25.400
games Rob hates.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.320
And I didn't have the question fully typed out.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.520
Hold on, somebody fill time for just a moment here.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.040
What games do you hate, Logie?

51:31.040 --> 51:36.040
I'm hating this level of spin black circle.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.120
But...

51:37.120 --> 51:39.360
You've been going at this one level for like 15 minutes.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.840
I got close to the end too, it's pissing me off.

51:42.960 --> 51:46.680
I hate, oh gosh, I think,

51:48.320 --> 51:50.620
I don't know, anything Barbie.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.400
You need to be more that Velociraptor.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.240
Here we go.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.060
I know.

51:57.060 --> 51:59.000
Here we go, we're gonna eliminate a few more people here

51:59.000 --> 52:01.440
on this question for games Rob hates.

52:01.440 --> 52:06.440
Okay, in the game Bubsy, have you ever played Bubsy?

52:07.360 --> 52:09.280
Unfortunately, yes, and Bubsy 3.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.520
Oh, I'm sorry for you, okay.

52:11.520 --> 52:12.360
Here it is.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.020
In the game Bubsy, which of the following

52:15.020 --> 52:16.900
did you collect for points?

52:16.900 --> 52:21.900
Was it A, cheese pieces, B, yarn balls, or C, leaves?

52:23.160 --> 52:24.600
I actually put one, two, three in chat,

52:24.600 --> 52:25.600
but it shouldn't be that big a deal.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.240
Okay, was it cheese pieces, yarn balls, or leaves?

52:28.240 --> 52:29.360
I remember this one.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.620
See if we can get it right.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.240
God, I wasn't part of the mob, if you think you're that.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.400
You could be a, maybe an accent,

52:38.400 --> 52:41.360
you could be a special guest celebrity on the mob.

52:42.960 --> 52:47.080
Bob's that, could you do the special and you're not sure.

52:47.080 --> 52:48.840
All right, all the chatters are in, cut off the theme.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.840
All right, thank God.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.700
All right, let's see, let's go through one at a time

52:52.700 --> 52:55.120
to see who got it right and who didn't get it right.

52:55.120 --> 53:00.120
Let's see, all right, wow.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.040
All right, the correct answer in the game,

53:02.040 --> 53:04.560
Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?

53:04.560 --> 53:07.160
It was not cheese pieces, it was not leaves,

53:07.160 --> 53:09.560
it was yarn balls, is the correct answer.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.600
He's a cat.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.220
And how many of the chatters do you think we eliminated?

53:13.220 --> 53:14.060
None.

53:14.060 --> 53:14.880
None.

53:14.880 --> 53:15.720
Damn.

53:15.720 --> 53:16.560
None of them, it's all six.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.080
So, Puppy, I need you to pick a number, one through six.

53:20.520 --> 53:23.960
I'm gonna do, oh, I should've brought out my dice.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.080
Oh, you're gonna roll a dice.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.840
Yes, because I hate picking random numbers.

53:26.840 --> 53:30.040
It's between Ryoma, Dark Tetsuya, SSJ 100 Matt,

53:30.040 --> 53:32.040
Drew Nami, Raw Steel, UT, and Rama,

53:32.040 --> 53:33.520
is what's remaining in our chat.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.360
All right, here it goes.

53:34.360 --> 53:35.180
All right, here it goes.

53:35.180 --> 53:36.020
What's it gonna be?

53:36.020 --> 53:37.040
What did it hit?

53:37.040 --> 53:37.860
Four.

53:37.860 --> 53:38.700
Four.

53:38.700 --> 53:40.200
Our winner tonight, boys and girls,

53:40.200 --> 53:44.480
of one versus the chat room, SSJ 100 Matt, give it up.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.320
Woo!

53:49.740 --> 53:52.320
A winner of trivia and luck.

53:52.320 --> 53:53.680
Exactly.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.480
So, I'm asking SSJ 100 Matt if he's gonna take

53:55.480 --> 53:56.440
the ResHD code.

53:56.440 --> 53:59.000
I seem to recall last week he didn't want it.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.380
Okay, he wants the other prize.

54:00.380 --> 54:02.560
So, SSJ 100 Matt, coming to you very soon,

54:02.560 --> 54:04.920
you're gonna be getting a copy courtesy of our friends

54:04.920 --> 54:09.560
at PopCap Game, Bejeweled 2, the hit sequel to Bejeweled.

54:09.560 --> 54:10.860
Now, this is the full version.

54:10.860 --> 54:13.800
This is not the crap, oh, I shouldn't say the crap version,

54:13.800 --> 54:16.360
but the reduced version that you play online.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.520
This is the full version of the game,

54:18.520 --> 54:19.560
and if you're kinda thinking,

54:19.560 --> 54:20.680
well, I don't really want Bejeweled 2,

54:20.680 --> 54:23.360
this will make an awesome Valentine's Day gift

54:23.360 --> 54:24.200
for somebody as well.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.040
My wife loves some Bejeweled 2.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.600
Exactly, the ladies love Bejeweled.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.920
So, Bejeweled comes to us from our friends at PopCap.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.860
Four different modes of play in this version.

54:33.860 --> 54:35.980
It'll keep you going for hours and hours.

54:35.980 --> 54:39.060
Classic mode, action mode, puzzle mode, endless mode.

54:39.060 --> 54:40.640
Enjoy, there you have it.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.920
So, there you go, SSJ 100 Matt wins Bejeweled 2

54:45.920 --> 54:47.360
courtesy of PopCap Games.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.580
What'd you guys think, chat room,

54:48.580 --> 54:49.920
did you guys like that prize,

54:49.920 --> 54:51.320
or did you guys like that game?

54:51.320 --> 54:53.760
Was that fun?

54:53.760 --> 54:55.560
I hope so, did you guys think the game went well?

54:55.560 --> 54:56.400
I think it was cool.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.240
It was fun?

54:57.240 --> 54:58.560
Yeah, our first run it went pretty well.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.160
I don't know how much it's gonna translate

55:01.160 --> 55:03.520
to the podcast where people can't play,

55:03.520 --> 55:05.600
but I think for the live listeners, that was a lot of fun.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.440
For the folks on the podcast.

55:06.440 --> 55:08.280
Well, it's just as much fun as watching a game show on TV.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.680
Yeah, I'm hoping for the podcast listeners

55:10.680 --> 55:11.640
and the folks listening to all games,

55:11.640 --> 55:13.120
they could kinda like think in their mind

55:13.120 --> 55:14.480
like how they would've done.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.880
Like maybe they could've had the chance

55:15.880 --> 55:17.160
if they were here live on Sunday night.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.840
You know everybody that watches the game show

55:18.840 --> 55:21.160
thinks they can do better than the person on TV.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.120
That's always the way it is.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.320
All right, Peter Uno says,

55:25.320 --> 55:27.400
I didn't know any of the answers.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.360
He did pretty well, he says it was fun though.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.760
Dark Knight says it should make it its own show.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.720
Peter Uno says, make a Bimani edition.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.280
Who knows, Son of Dad says

55:36.280 --> 55:38.480
more fighting game questions needed.

55:38.480 --> 55:39.560
Ryoma says, more trivia.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.280
All right, well, I'm sure that segment

55:41.280 --> 55:42.920
will make a comeback in a future edition

55:42.920 --> 55:44.140
of Orange Lounge Radio.

55:45.380 --> 55:47.720
I hope you guys enjoyed that.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.000
All right, that's it.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
We're gonna go to the Skype line very soon,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.540
but quickly, another couple stories for us.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.640
Well, Bandai Namco is definitely taking

55:58.640 --> 56:00.760
a different approach for games.

56:00.760 --> 56:04.760
For the DS, they're releasing a game called 99 Tears.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.760
It is basically 99 different stories

56:07.760 --> 56:09.340
that you'll read that are very depressing

56:09.340 --> 56:11.240
that are supposed to make you cry.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.320
Because apparently they think

56:12.320 --> 56:14.780
that it's very therapeutic to cry.

56:14.780 --> 56:16.440
And that gamers have emotions.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.200
It's providing with sad graphic novel

56:19.200 --> 56:22.280
to read for 15 minutes at the end of each day

56:22.280 --> 56:24.760
with a brief questionnaire following shortly after.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.660
The result will help you move closer to the story,

56:27.660 --> 56:30.720
which will make it more effectively tug at your heartstrings

56:30.720 --> 56:33.280
and further from respect of your brothers

56:33.280 --> 56:35.820
on the wrestling squad, as Joystick likes to put it.

56:36.760 --> 56:39.200
I wanna play this game and I'm never gonna cry.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.480
Maybe that should be a challenge,

56:41.480 --> 56:43.680
like make Loki cry.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.720
Oh, it'll never happen, this is gonna be crap.

56:45.720 --> 56:46.880
When was the last time you cried?

56:46.880 --> 56:48.480
Do you cry, are you a crier?

56:48.480 --> 56:51.480
Real men cry, you can cry, it's okay.

56:51.480 --> 56:52.320
I don't remember.

56:52.320 --> 56:53.560
Oh, okay.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.360
I don't wanna ruffle the personal life feathers,

56:55.360 --> 56:56.720
but I'm just curious.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.800
All right, me, I cry at every sad movie.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.020
Hell, I think I watched an episode of Wife Swap

57:02.020 --> 57:02.860
the other day I cried at it, okay?

57:02.860 --> 57:04.000
It doesn't take much.

57:09.000 --> 57:09.820
All right.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.120
Lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line,

57:14.120 --> 57:16.820
the Sega is going to be bringing a brand new game

57:16.820 --> 57:20.760
to the Nintendo DS and it's very similar to one of their old cult classics, The Typing

57:20.760 --> 57:25.760
of the Dead. However, the new game they are bringing out, The English of the Dead.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.000
The English of the Dead.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.140
First word you will learn, brains.

57:32.140 --> 57:34.200
The British of the Dead.

57:34.200 --> 57:38.500
The interesting thing though, it's House of the Dead 2, but ported to the DS. And what

57:38.500 --> 57:42.300
you have to do, you have to translate words into English from Japanese or the zombies

57:42.300 --> 57:47.900
will eat you. Sometimes the zombies speak out loud and you have to translate what they

57:47.900 --> 57:51.580
are saying. So that's going to be all kinds of things. I'd like to see how that plays

57:51.580 --> 57:56.580
out. Do you have to write it out? Because sometimes those handwriting recognitions suck.

57:56.580 --> 57:58.780
I said blue!

57:58.780 --> 58:04.480
Exactly. I wish this game would come out the other way around. Japanese of the Dead. Maybe

58:04.480 --> 58:06.620
learn some Japanese or some other languages.

58:06.620 --> 58:11.180
English of the Dead.

58:11.180 --> 58:14.400
English of the Dead.

58:14.400 --> 58:18.560
Grammar of the Dead. I bet Jamie would love that if she was here. She suggests a proper

58:18.560 --> 58:23.620
grammar game or something. Which actually was not proper grammar in me saying that.

58:23.620 --> 58:27.060
Oh well, who cares? Maybe I need to play it.

58:27.060 --> 58:29.980
Sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming out. We're going to open up the Skype line for

58:29.980 --> 58:36.100
your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Quickly though,

58:36.100 --> 58:37.820
any last minute stories from Loki?

58:37.820 --> 58:42.220
I have a few actually. Already it's confirmed that there's going to be a Professor Layton

58:42.220 --> 58:48.100
sequel because the game manual says there's going to be a sequel and it will have a code

58:48.100 --> 58:50.140
in it that you use in the first game or something.

58:50.140 --> 58:54.780
Shane has been talking to me about how wonderful Professor Layton is all week long.

58:54.780 --> 58:55.780
What the hell is it?

58:55.780 --> 58:56.780
It's like an adventure game.

58:56.780 --> 58:57.780
It's a logic puzzle game for the DS.

58:57.780 --> 59:00.700
Yeah, it's like an adventure game with logic puzzles and stuff like that.

59:00.700 --> 59:05.900
Apparently there's going to be no Nazis in the Lego Indiana Jones game. You have no Nazis

59:05.900 --> 59:06.900
in Star Wars either.

59:06.900 --> 59:08.540
Your faces are going to melt then.

59:08.540 --> 59:12.500
Well they're going to have some unnamed bad guys.

59:12.500 --> 59:15.700
I want some melting Legos in my Indiana Jones game.

59:15.700 --> 59:20.420
They've replaced them with anonymous genocidal occultist trench coat wearing master race.

59:20.420 --> 59:23.820
Well I want the anonymous genocidal occult trench coat wearing bastards to have their

59:23.820 --> 59:24.820
faces melt.

59:24.820 --> 59:28.140
Let's go to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

59:28.140 --> 59:29.140
GS68.

59:29.140 --> 59:31.740
Hello GS68. What's on your mind my friend?

59:31.740 --> 59:36.660
I have some good news and bad news regarding 2D exit Sunnyvale Golf Land.

59:36.660 --> 59:41.980
2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land, one of our local arcades. Got some attention lately. Somebody

59:41.980 --> 59:45.260
wrote an article about classic arcades or something.

59:45.260 --> 59:46.580
You know who that guy was too.

59:46.580 --> 59:52.540
Yeah, I can't believe I'm plugging it here on the show. But I will point out how convenient

59:52.540 --> 59:57.380
that the person used the arcade they used to go to all the time in that article. I'm

59:57.380 --> 01:00:05.180
sure it was a real challenge to write it. But anyhow, GS68, what's on your mind regarding

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.300
BeatMania Golf Land?

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:12.940
Good news, we have 2DX DJ Troopers as of this week.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.620
Nice. Maybe I'll have to go play. But what's the bad news?

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.340
Is it broken?

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.580
The machine is unlocked well ahead of what it's supposed to be in Japan and that means

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.820
you're planning on going in or between now and most likely May. You can't take pictures

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.900
of the machine.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.900
You can't take pictures? How are they policing that?

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:35.860
Good question. I'm not sure.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.660
You can't. You don't usually see that in arcades where you're completely banned.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660
That's just challenging.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.380
Wait, is it a location test?

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.140
For real. Okay, here's how you're going to do it. GS68, I will tell you how to get around

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:52.260
this right now. I even have this on my cell phone. You get one of those phones that records

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.260
video.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.260
Let me get the camera phone.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:01.140
Yeah, you get a camera phone and what you do is you kind of stand next to the machine

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.700
and you hit the record button and then you pretend you're talking on your phone while

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:10.060
you're recording the screen right there. That's how you do it. Easy as pie.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:15.380
And then it'll be up on YouTube and somebody will get shit in their pants.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:20.660
Well, I just sent you a link via a private message and that explains why we can't take

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.660
pictures.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:26.700
Here's the thing. Usually it's the new songs people want to know and stuff. Are people

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.420
not allowed to write the songs down and then post them on the internet?

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:40.820
I think it'd be like the fact that the machine is unlocked well ahead of schedule.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:46.300
Yeah. Let's see. I'm looking at the post here on our friends at Bimani Style. The distributor

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.540
has asked that no pictures or videos be taken yet due to the fact the machine will be fully

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.380
unlocked with all hidden feature songs per my request and as a present to all the players

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.920
at Sunnyvale Golfland. This is about three months ahead of Japan and we cannot have secret

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.660
stuff leak on the internets so please people assist me with the small task of not allowing

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.420
pictures or videos to be taken yet. Do they have a big sign hanging by the machine or

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.780
anything? I don't know if you've been.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:10.620
No. Like, I went this Saturday and I pulled out my camera and then one of the players

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.020
told me not to take pictures.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.020
Interesting.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.220
And so they're self-policing it?

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.500
Most likely. Maybe. I mean, I wonder if I can talk to them about like having them put

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:30.420
a sign in, like maybe set up a security camera. Like, in a sense, they're breaking their

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.420
own rule.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.540
I don't know. For me, this sounds like a challenge.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.780
Well, I mean like facing away from the screen.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:41.520
Hmm. Interesting. Well, I mean, I know you didn't write the policy GS68. I'll stop grilling

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.580
you about it. I think it's very interesting so thank you for bringing it to our attention.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.980
I'm kind of curious. I'm curious to see how long they can actually keep it a secret because

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.620
in a way, that's a challenge to some people.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.940
Yeah. Plus, I can imagine like some guy going to the, some guy who's never played a single

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.660
Bomani game, going to the arcade and they're like, hey, this machine looks really cool.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.940
And then they snap a picture and post on the internet and then the offline gets in trouble.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.940
So it says no pictures, but can you just go and write down all the stuff on a pad and

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940
paper?

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.940
I know. That's what I don't know.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.260
Or you could just walk over to it, walk out to your car, write stuff down, walk back up,

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.480
walk out to your car. I mean, this is stupid.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.420
Loki and I view this as a challenge. It is a challenge. I mean, when somebody says don't,

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.820
you want to do, although I understand, you know, I, in the community maybe just doesn't

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.420
want to spoil or whatever, you know, we should probably shouldn't be spoiled sports. Honestly,

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.220
I'm not going to get to Sunnyvale Golf Line anytime soon anyway, but I do kind of want

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.580
to check it out. I haven't played a arcade Beatmania game since E3 when they had the

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.420
machine there that one year randomly. That's the last time I played it. So.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:48.460
I don't remember the last time I played Beatmania. SSJ 100 Matt in chat has a good point. Most

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.460
people on the forums will say Pics or GTFO.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:58.340
Alright, fine. We'll get Pics. I'm not opposed to getting Pics.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.340
Alright.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.300
With the ban me from SVGL. Oh no.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.300
Who knows?

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:09.740
What's ironic about this is that, like, even if we, this game's not supposed to be in the

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:15.100
U.S., so we're not allowed to take, so we're supposed to not allowed to be taking Pics

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.100
to begin with.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.420
You mean it's not even supposed to be in the U.S. to begin with. I guess that's true.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.380
I mean, well, we had the U.S. location test, but that failed.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.340
Alright, well, I'm waiting for the next story where somebody gets beaten up in the parking

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.660
lot over taking a picture of this game.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.300
GS68, we got to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your call.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300
Take care, buddy.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.300
You too.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.460
It's just, boy, it's just something else. And by the way, speaking, because we were

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.780
talking about the article here, I'll help our little friend, my bestest friend in the

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.500
whole wide world who writes these articles.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.060
If you ever want to do one on Roosevelt Golf Land, here's what you just have to write.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060
It stinks.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060
There you go.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.580
It's a perfectly, wait, would you, would you agree with that review?

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.580
Yeah, I think that's accurate.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.580
Wholeheartedly concur.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.580
Hi.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.580
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.580
Who is this?

01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580
Hey there.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.980
This is Let's Have Tea.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.200
Let's Have Tea.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.900
Let's have some tea and chat a little bit.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.080
What is up, my friend?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:14.220
I just wanted to plug the game Psychonauts to anybody who hasn't checked this game out

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.220
yet.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:19.840
I know it's kind of old, but I finally got a chance to play through it, and it's well

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.140
worth the $15 on the marketplace.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:26.300
I was going to say Psychonauts is available to a whole new audience thanks to its backwards

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:32.340
compatibility on Xbox 360, and I believe it's in GameTap's library, so some people playing

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.660
it that way as well.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:38.500
So you could, don't tell me you can't play Psychonauts due to lack of availability.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.380
It's out there, right?

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380
Right.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.260
It's definitely out there.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:47.640
What makes Psychonauts so great?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:55.020
I'm a big adventure games fan, and it's pretty much the first, like, adventure game that's

01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:01.160
really got my attention since, like, Mario 64 or Banjo-The-Zooie.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.840
Is it, I hear a lot about the sense of humor in this game.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.980
Is it the sense of humor that draws you in?

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:12.360
Yeah, the game is seriously, just ridiculously twisted.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.900
You infiltrate the minds of a lot of really interesting characters, and a lot of them

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.860
are in, like, a loony bin, so there's a lot of weird stuff going on.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:28.860
I didn't see a lot of this game, so maybe I need to take your advice and go check it

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860
out.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.860
It was actually played by somebody else, but it was, I didn't see a lot of the story, I

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.420
just saw the actual game, and to me it was kind of like, oh, I think I've kind of seen

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:40.580
this game before, but you're saying, no, it's worth a second look, it really stands out,

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.580
right?

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.180
It's definitely worth it.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.940
Let's say they make a Psychonauts 2 someday, which with all the cult following you never

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.940
know.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.340
What do you think, what would you most like to see in Psychonauts 2?

01:06:52.340 --> 01:07:03.060
Well, in the story of it, they totally opened it up so that there's a possibility, but really

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:10.420
just the way that Psychonauts 1 worked out with the sense of humor and the way that they

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:18.860
were able to develop the different abilities throughout the game, usually in sequels they

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.820
aren't able to rebuild abilities like that.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:34.180
Like if you take Banjo-Tooie from Banjo-Kazooie, it's hard to add even more to the game when

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:40.340
the original game limits what you do by the moves that you have.

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.340
That make sense?

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.300
Yeah, no, it does.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:47.020
I'm just reading some comments from chat as well, because there are lots of people passionate

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.180
about Psychonauts as well.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:52.460
Hikaru Uno, he's one of our listeners who lives in Japan currently, he says, I want

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:56.060
Psychonauts but I can't get it because I'm in fucking Japan, making reference to the

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.460
fact that the region is different and you can't get it on the backwards compatibility

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.460
there.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:05.700
Son of Dad says, I bought Psychonauts at Blockbuster for $6.99, suck it Xbox Live Arcade!

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.000
So yeah, if you can find the old Xbox disc, you can play it with backwards compatibility

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.540
as well, so either works.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.340
Yeah, it's also a PS2 and PC game.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.340
It's everywhere.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.340
No excuses for not playing this game.

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.340
It's all over the place.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.420
Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thank you very much for what we'll call the not quite classic

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:28.180
game of the week, because it's not a classic yet, but it probably will be in a few more

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.180
years.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.180
Not yet.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.980
Let's Have Tea, I have one more question for you before we let you go.

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.820
Do you really like to drink tea?

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.340
Absolutely not.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.220
I knew it!

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.740
Maybe it's Mr. Tea.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.460
Are you more of a coffee drinker?

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:50.420
I'm not really into any of that, I just thought it was a clever name and thought it was funny.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.420
Well you win.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.420
It is pretty funny.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.080
Especially when you consider you don't like tea.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.580
Even I like a little tea here and there.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.220
Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thanks so much for reminding us about the greatness of Psychonauts.

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.220
Have a great one, okay?

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220
Yep, have a good one.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220
Later.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.900
Alright, we can do a couple more calls, I suppose.

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900
Oh!

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.500
Skype wants us to rate the quality of that call.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.500
How was the call quality?

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.540
Would you say five?

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.540
Very good?

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.540
Four good?

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.540
Four or five?

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.820
I'll give it a four, because I've had issues on other calls.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.700
I'm like, does he want us to...

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.420
I'm not sending the whole thing, Jesus.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.220
I know, it's like, now answer thirty more questions.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.980
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Ma.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.220
Actually, this call is a two.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.220
I like that it...

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.460
Darth Tetsuya says, rate the callers.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.460
Maybe one night.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:40.820
Like, we ought to give an incentive for the really good calls one night, like, one night

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.940
we'll do nothing but phone calls, like, the really good phone call we'll give something

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.180
from the price table, or something even better, I don't know.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.220
Alright, Ron Ma, what's on your mind tonight?

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:55.480
Not too much, but to comment on GS68's call, if they don't want people to be taking pictures

01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.020
of what's coming out, when you put out these press releases, set it up in a way that you're

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:04.400
not really revealing much of anything, but still, when you say not to, people are going

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.400
to do it anyway.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.400
So, hey.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400
Well, wait a minute, though.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.100
The press release doesn't have really anything to do with this.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.940
The distributor turned on some type of cheat in the game that's not supposed to be on.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.940
But my thinking is, is that, what's to stop anyone from Japan doing the same thing this

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.940
distributor did?

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940
Am I right?

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.940
You're right.

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.940
Hmm.

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.940
I don't know.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.940
Maybe there's something about it I'm not getting.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.540
Maybe it's through the whole EMUs thing or something, so I'm sure somebody's going to

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.380
say something nasty to me about it, because I'm uninformed.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.120
It's just, they have all the songs unlocked, and Japan doesn't have them all yet, and normally

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.220
Japan's the one saying, hey, look at my song, it's unlocked, and everyone's like, oh, which

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.220
is over here?

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.220
It's like a play, too.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.220
But, yeah.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.220
Well, isn't it true that-

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.220
So, you know what?

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.220
It's our turn.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220
That's what I want.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.220
I want you to get the first dibs on everything.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:52.380
Well, isn't it true that American versions can't get EMUs because they're not in Japan?

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.380
That would seem likely, because the IP address-

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.180
Things that would have to be unlocked by EMUs wouldn't normally be available here, so they

01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.180
just have to open it up.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.280
So if they can unlock everything here, and we don't get EMUs, that just means that they're

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.580
plain assholes for not unlocking it at all.

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.580
All right.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.820
Well, Konami does have a record.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:13.580
Kevin DDR in chat says, no one knows how.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.700
Somebody does, obviously, because this machine's added done to it, but I get what you're saying.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.380
I bet it's up, up, down, down, left, left.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.820
Nobody who can spread the word knows how, I guess.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.140
Rama, what else is on your mind?

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:25.140
Anything else?

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.140
Not much.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:31.740
Like Irene said earlier, I went to a Ren Faire this weekend, and out of all my costumes,

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.020
I found one that would be perfect to blend right in.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.420
Okay, but I just have to give a little background, because the Ren Faire thing came up during

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.380
our bonus segment, which the podcast people don't hear.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.580
So podcasters just know we were talking about the Ren Faire earlier in the show.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.540
It's not completely out of place, this comment, because that would probably be very random

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.620
if you were listening to this with Not Life.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.820
But Rama, so you're saying you found the perfect Ren Faire outfit that's, what, a good blend

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.220
with video games, a blend with this show, or what?

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.940
Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.120
This call is a one all of a sudden.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.620
What the fuck was that?

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.380
Rama, your call went into the, he went into the loop.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.580
What the hell was that?

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.580
I think you got sucked into Tron.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.620
I don't like it.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:17.020
That was like a, it was a Rama remix.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:18.340
Do not adjust your iPod, we heard the same thing.

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.900
Alright, that's for our candidacy to put into the second mix then.

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.900
I guess so.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.340
DMN, make a song out of that.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.580
God, no, no.

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:33.380
Rama, I'm sorry, let's say, a good fit with our show or video games or what?

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.700
A blend with video games.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.140
Now, what is it?

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.140
Black Mage.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.140
Nice.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:42.900
Did you wear your Black Mage, you have a Black Mage outfit, did you wear it?

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.900
Yes I did.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900
Awesome.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.380
Did you get a lot of people coming up to you wanting to take the old picture?

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.100
Yes, yes I did.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.140
Did you take pictures with large-breasted women in corsets?

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.820
I decided to keep those pictures to myself, okay, at those Ren Faires, you know, the Las

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.340
Vegas rules apply.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.580
What happens at Ren Faire stays at Ren Faire?

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.580
Damn right.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.460
That's right, you're not allowed to take pictures of the women in corsets and put them up on

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:12.660
the internet or the SVGL management will get very mad at you.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.380
But some people actually thought I was Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.740
Well, because Vivi does look like a Black Mage, I can see that.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.860
And here's the best thing, someone walked up to me and said, you're Orko from He-Man,

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.140
aren't you?

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.580
That's awesome.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.500
Black Mage does look like Orko, what can you do?

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.820
After hearing that five, six times, I said, the next Ren Faire I'm going to do a Jedi

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.980
and I'll do Orko, see what happens.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.980
Nice.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.020
Well, Rama, glad to hear you had fun at Ren Faire.

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.640
Maybe next time you and Callie will take Irene to one together, okay?

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.700
Or maybe you should take her.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.740
I probably will.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.900
I think she sent me a private message with one that she wants to go to now, but I've

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.900
been too busy doing the show.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.140
Let me look actually real quick while we're on the subject of Ren Faire.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.100
Oh no, I accidentally closed it during the game because I needed to keep my private message

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.100
window clean during the game.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.260
Did you like the game tonight, Rama?

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.660
You came very close to winning.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.660
That was great.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.660
I loved that.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.660
All right, good.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:03.660
I'm glad you like it.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:04.660
We'll have to do it again sometime.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.940
All right, Rama, we got to let you go.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.940
Have a good one.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.940
All right.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:09.940
You too.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.940
Bye-bye.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.940
One more call.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:12.940
Sure.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.020
Hopefully the game doesn't get caught in the loop.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.900
The crazy...

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.900
Sucked into a black hole.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.620
No, what the hell was that?

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.380
It's not ringing off the hook, so Loki, you have any last minute stories you want to do?

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.380
Okay.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.220
1UP is going to be changing their scoring policies, apparently, how they rate games,

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.220
which is quite funny.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:34.660
Now, instead of the point system, they're going to be changing it to letters, like grading

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.460
system from A plus to F. I want you to bet there's 10 different letters in between there

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.900
and nothing's changing.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.600
You know, because they're admitting that...

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600
You know what they are?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600
They're admitting...

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600
Well, I guess it's not really admitting.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.180
AGM is going to do the same thing.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.180
It's all going to start in March.

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:55.060
Because, well, I'm saying like, I don't know, A through F has a different kind of connotation

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.060
to it than 1 through 10.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.620
Like F is failing.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.620
It's a miserable game.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.220
Whereas, I think in the 1 through 10 world, 6 is seen as failing.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.540
I think.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.900
So I guess that's the point I was trying to make that I didn't do very well.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.900
But who cares?

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.380
Well, technically enough, it's a 60%.

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.380
Who cares?

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.140
It's one review site on the entire internet.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.340
I realize it's a big one, but you know, come on.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.660
It's also a magazine, AGM and Games for Windows.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.860
We live in a world where there's demos readily available.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.860
Make your own decision.

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.900
Now, I read reviews once in a while, but I haven't found a game reviewer I really 100%

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.620
trust and like yet.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.620
Maybe the guy from Zero Punctuation.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.620
I don't know.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.620
No, he's too negative.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.620
Funny, but negative.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:35.620
But he's funny.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.620
Funny, but negative.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.860
Let's go to the phones and take one last call.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860
Who's this?

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.100
Hello, this is Ross Deal, UT.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.800
Ross Deal, UT.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800
What is up, my friend?

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800
Oh, nothing.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800
Just shooting shit.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.900
You know how that goes.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.740
That's what we do here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.740
What's up?

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.740
Hell yeah.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.820
Anyway, I got a few things on my mind.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:55.820
Not too many, but a few.

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.820
All right.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:04.020
First off, there's this, I don't know, there was somebody linking that already on the chat,

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.860
this Marine who went missing.

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.500
Basically what happened is that the family thinks that maybe he was playing Call of Duty

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.740
and he just had a flashback or something.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.620
Yeah, I read about that just before the show started.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.740
That's crazy.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:25.140
I guess it gets into the whole, are games too realistic in this day and age?

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.140
I don't know.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.180
Well, I think part of it is because he was in Iraq and if he was playing Call of Duty

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:38.940
4, that there's a lot of stuff in Call of Duty 4 in the story that it's pretty hefty

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:39.940
material.

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:47.820
I mean, I don't want to give away any of the plot line, but you invade a Middle Eastern

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.900
country and a nuclear device goes off.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.460
Oh, wow.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:58.380
Yeah, it's a very gritty game.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.820
I could definitely see where somebody who's been to Iraq, who's maybe having problems

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:11.620
with post-traumatic, might play that game and get a bad reaction from it.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:19.700
They're saying that he might be actually trying not to be found, so it sounded pretty bad.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.700
Very unfortunate.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:25.380
This is not a game he should have been playing in the first place, so the question is, do

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:30.060
they have it out there enough for this guy to know maybe he shouldn't play this game

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:37.540
as he's very sensitive on these type of topics or suffering from this post-war syndrome?

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:41.620
Is it the responsibility of the makers of this game to put some type of disclaimer on

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620
the game?

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620
No.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.820
No, I think this game might be too real for some people.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:48.820
That's stupid.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:54.940
You know, with post-traumatic stress disorder, that sort of thing, it could be any number

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.760
of things that trigger it.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:06.660
Any number of things could remind somebody or give someone a bad flashback.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.300
It's very unpredictable.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:17.420
Like a lot of mental disorders, it's going to affect people in different ways.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.340
Not only that, but modern warfare, you know they're going to at least deal with the Arab

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.660
angle somewhat.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:33.740
I was just going to say, very unfortunate news no matter where it kind of falls.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.460
Maybe this was the type of game he should have played with other people.

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.860
I think that's kind of the thing, too.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:40.260
I know exactly what it is.

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.740
It's not Call of Duty 4.

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:42.740
What?

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:43.740
It was Yars.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:46.820
He played Yars, and he's like, oh my God, I have to run.

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.740
Well, that's a different kind of drama.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.380
There's a place in hell waiting for you, Loki.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.500
Okay, RustyLUT, we don't have too much time.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.900
What else did you want to say real quick tonight?

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.780
There was this industry blog.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:09.860
One of these industry analyst people was talking about how there's a problem where the industry

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:19.940
has no real room for anything between the tiny budget casual games and the tens of millions

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.940
of dollars blockbusters.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.220
Let me put up a link right now.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.420
As far as the American market, I can certainly agree with that.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:38.860
We either see the huge budget Call of Duty and Gears of War, or we see PopCap.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:51.540
It's not as diverse a market as, say, Japan, where there's stuff all over the budget spectrum.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.820
This is an opinion piece I didn't read before tonight's show, so it's a little harder for

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.380
me to comment on it.

01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.380
What do you think?

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:03.220
Do we have enough variety in our styles of games that we have out there right now?

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:12.460
Not so much styles, but we need a real be-real, because if you look at the American market,

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:19.860
it's PopCap games type of deal, and then there's Gears of War, Call of Duty, really big budget

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.460
games, and there's not a lot of stuff in between.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:28.020
If you compare that to Japan, where you see stuff like Chulipa no Ne-chan Bada, people

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:34.300
just throwing crap out there, hell, even Puzzle Quest, which managed to become a hit.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.620
What this guy's talking about is you can't really experiment when you're dealing with

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:46.580
a budget of $20 million, $30 million, because there's too much risk involved, but at the

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:52.500
same time, there's really only so much you can do in a little budget 2D game.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:21:00.140
Another extreme, you're not really having a lot of room for new ideas.

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:03.500
Isn't there a similarity with movies, though, because it seems like most movies are either

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:10.740
the art house cheap ones, or the explosion Michael Bay, burning money live on screen

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.980
type of movies.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.620
There's not a whole lot in between there, either.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:23.700
There's also the fact that there's not a whole lot for what people want in that middle market

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:29.460
because the American market's a lot different than the Japanese ones.

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:32.940
There's a lot more people in Japan that play games, for one, but there's either you've

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:37.820
got the hardcore gamers that have been doing it for years, or the people that are just

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:43.220
the casual gamer market, and there really is no target audience for something in between.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.420
That's the thing, though.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:50.820
You'd think that the hardcore would be the most receptive of something like, well, you

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:59.180
look at Puzzle Quest, or Chulip, or maybe not so much Chulip, or an Ejambada, just an

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:06.780
idea being thrown out there with maybe a $2 or $3 million budget, and yes, you should

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.500
pick up Puzzle Quest GS68.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:16.940
Let me make this comparison real quick.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:23.140
A lot of the hardcore gamers won't play a game like Bejeweled because it's not hardcore

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.020
enough, and a lot of the people who play stuff like Bejeweled get turned off by Gears of

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:34.300
War and stuff because there's too many buttons to hit, whereas with movies, anyone can watch

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.900
anything, depending on the hype.

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:45.540
It's true, and perhaps this is just a spot where video games just have a hard time, but

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:52.020
there has to be some place where you can actually do meaningful experimentation, because you

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:59.500
can't do it in the casual space, there's just too many limits.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.380
I suppose it would be hard to convince your wife that going to see Rambo would be a good

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.980
Valentine's Day present, right?

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.780
I think that's also part of it.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:15.060
We have an industry that's confined to the idea of hardcore and casual.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:18.340
You don't hear about hardcore moviegoers, casual moviegoers.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.620
You hear people who like action, romance.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:28.380
There's very particular crowds for types of movies, and of course the B-movie alien weirdness

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.680
has its own following.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:37.140
You need to have that sort of market, for lack of a better term, market segregation,

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:42.980
demographic scanning, because casual, hardcore is perhaps a little too general.

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.980
Wow.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:49.300
Well, Ross, some great topics, some very deep topics you're bringing up tonight, but unfortunately

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.300
we are running out of time.

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:54.460
We've got to wrap things up, but thanks for your call and provoking some good discussion.

01:23:54.460 --> 01:24:03.420
Before I go, I'd like to do a plug, you know, I've started a YouTube channel, and that would

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:12.300
be youtube.com slash user slash RossDLUT, put up a link in the chat right now.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.620
And what will we find on said YouTube channel?

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:22.980
Right now it's mostly music videos that I've compiled up, but I have a few vlogs as well,

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.940
and I'm just kind of looking at some of the things that are in this, so you kind of make

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.420
your own anime music videos and stuff?

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.420
Gaming music videos.

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.100
Gaming, oh not anime, GMVs, not AMVs, GMVs, I see.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:43.540
And I guess that I also have a couple of vlogs using the PlayStation Eye actually, which

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:50.140
is quite an effort, but I'll go into that next time, and I'll see you later.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.900
Well best of luck with vlogging.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.900
Good luck.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.340
Have a nice one, bye bye.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.700
RossDLUT, he's always kind of the devil's advocate in chat, but then when he calls in

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:04.920
he's the nicest guy, and brings up great topics every time.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.780
So thank you very much for calling in, we appreciate it.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.420
That's going to do it for phone calls tonight, because that's going to do it for the show

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.420
tonight.

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.420
Holy crap, that's late.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.860
I know it's kind of late when you consider that Dark Soccer wasn't even here tonight,

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.300
we managed to do a three hour show, I think the game took a long time.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.300
Yeah, that took a big time.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.300
That's alright.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300
It was fun.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.300
It was fun, right?

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.300
It was worth it?

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.300
Whee!

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.540
Alright, let's go ahead and wrap things up here tonight.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.220
Actually first, any other last minute stories I didn't let you get to, Loki?

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:33.460
There's going to be car surfing in Saints Row 2, and that's awesome.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.220
I can't wait for Saints Row 2.

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:36.420
Ghost Ride the Whip.

01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:43.220
Yes, and apparently they have a picture where you have crashed a biplane into a building,

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:49.100
or driven it through a mall, which is even better, so I'm all about a game that allows

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:54.220
you to drive a plane through a mall.

01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.620
We all know what's waiting to happen later on.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.580
That's a feature they should have had in Dead Rising, right?

01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.580
Hell yeah.

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.580
Alright.

01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.900
Puppy, thank you so much for being here tonight, and participating in the show.

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.940
Talking head number three for the night.

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.940
Hooray!

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.180
Well, you'll have to come back again soon, and it's probably kind of nice not getting

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.860
talked over tonight, because there's a lot far less people in house.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.140
Yes, and I had my own microphone the entire time.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.140
There you go.

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.900
Alright, well thanks for coming, and stay away from the gunshots in your neighborhood.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.900
I will certainly try to.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:26.540
Alright, we don't want to see Puppy get put down, that would not be fun.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.940
Do you have any final thoughts, though, Puppy, real quick?

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.940
I was looking on your prize table here, and saw these applications for passports.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.260
The passport applications are not prizes, they're just out there.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.260
I was just making sure.

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.720
No, we're not giving out Rob's passport application as a prize, it's just something I'm working

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.620
on for a trip I want to take in June.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.980
Which by the way, you know how they say it takes forever to get a passport right now?

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:48.980
It doesn't.

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.220
My roommate went in, and did his, like, he got it in a week.

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:53.220
A week.

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.220
He's new.

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.220
Not a renewal.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.220
New.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.140
Well, my brother managed to get one when he went to Italy, and it took him like a week

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.140
and a half to get his when he went to Italy earlier this year.

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.140
Not bad.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:07.380
But thankfully I'm not going out of the country, I'm just going to Texas to meet with, for

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.300
a puzzle pirates party.

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.300
Nerd.

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.660
I'm trying to get William to take me back to Canada, because I really want to go to

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.660
Canada.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.260
I'm just trying to decide right now if it's going to be Vancouver, which I've already

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:22.380
been to and I love, or Toronto, which I've never been to, but I really want to go to.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.220
Toronto's winning in my mind right now, but we'll see.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:32.980
I went to Canada once, I went to Victoria, and I got stuck having to go to those botanical

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980
gardens.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:38.340
Hey, I love the Bouchard Gardens, don't you go knocking them, unless you go in like fall,

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.660
then there's not a lot to see.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:45.300
I think William told me he went to the Bouchard Gardens once in October, and I'm like, dude,

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:47.300
you went at the wrong time.

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.740
Anyway, enough travel chat.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.900
Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:57.620
This spin the black circle thing is pretty addicting, except I'm on this one level.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.260
He's been playing it all fucking night.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.620
Hey, I have been participating, okay?

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.460
This does not take that much participation.

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:08.860
Hey, if he had been playing the Velociraptor Safari game, you wouldn't have heard a peep

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.620
out of him, unless it was maniacal laughter.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:18.540
All right, my final thought is next week's show, I'm actually going to be out of town

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:24.180
because it's holiday slash anniversary weekend, so I'm going out of town.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:29.500
We may have a late start to the show because of it, more information to come later throughout

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500
the week.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.200
I'm not sure exactly what the plan is yet, so there you have it.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.340
But we are looking forward to being back here next week.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.900
Frisbee suggests, I vote because of Valentine's Day this week.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.900
We need to have William, Nellie, and Dan as guests on the show next week.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:43.900
Not going to happen.

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.500
I don't think that'll happen either.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.500
It's a good thought.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.860
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:55.540
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.060
You know we can't do this without you guys.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.940
Remember, if you like Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you hear, please tell two

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:03.260
friends about our show because that's the only way we get to spread the word.

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:06.000
We don't have any big magazines or websites that back us.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.860
We are literally an independent operation run out of somebody's garage and it's your

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.420
voice and talking and word of mouth that helps spread the word.

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.140
Another reason to support us, we are not changing our review system to letters.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.140
That's right, we're not.

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:23.460
We're going to stick with the whole vague reviews that we've always done here on the

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460
program.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.340
Until next time, I'm Rob, that's Loki.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.540
She will be Dark Sakura back with us next week.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.500
We'll see you then here on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:38.580
