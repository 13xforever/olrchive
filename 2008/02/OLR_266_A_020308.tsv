48000	50000	Cuddly DarkSakura
50000	51000	Hi
51000	54000	She's not like her internet persona in real life
54000	56000	She's actually very sweet, right?
56000	58000	If you add lots of sugar
58000	60000	Alright, and how are you doing Ms. Sakura?
60000	62000	I'm frustrated with the mailbag
62000	64000	I'm sorry to hear that, what did the mailbag do to you?
64000	65000	It's being a bitch
65000	66000	I'm sorry to hear that
66000	68000	Alright, also joining us tonight
68000	70000	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
70000	71000	Hello
71000	74000	Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion
74000	77000	Hey, aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?
77000	78000	Nope
78000	79000	You can lick it off
79000	81000	That's right, you can lick it off, alright
81000	82000	Exactly
82000	85000	Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show
85000	88000	And I gotta say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world
88000	91000	Cause she has no idea who the eff we are
91000	94000	And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying
94000	97000	Hey, you're pretty cool, you should come be on our program
97000	99000	But she's a real good sport, she's here tonight
99000	101000	Give it up for Mo
101000	103000	Hello interweb, why am I waving?
103000	104000	Huh?
104000	105000	Why am I waving?
105000	106000	Why are you waving?
106000	108000	Cause we do have an internet cam over there on Justin TV
108000	110000	We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you
110000	112000	So we make sure you get picked up on there
112000	113000	But how are you?
113000	115000	I'm nervous but super
115000	116000	Yeah?
116000	117000	Why are you nervous?
117000	118000	There's nothing to be nervous about
118000	119000	We don't bite much
119000	120000	I don't trust her
120000	122000	She only doesn't trust dark soccer, right?
122000	123000	You've heard stories
123000	124000	I'm nice
124000	127000	Oh, see, you're gonna fit right in
127000	129000	What does she do when she pisses off dark soccer?
129000	131000	She goes hearts and it makes it better
131000	132000	She already knows
132000	133000	That's exactly what I do
133000	134000	She knows
134000	135000	She knows this gig already
135000	136000	Alright, and the cowboy hat
136000	138000	And by the way, Mo
138000	140000	Uber famous on YouTube
140000	141000	Uber famous?
141000	142000	Okay, I don't know about Uber famous
142000	143000	Closai famous
143000	144000	Closai famous
144000	145000	She's like an e-list celebrity on the internet
145000	146000	Yes
146000	147000	So she's here tonight
147000	149000	She's actually gonna play for us a cover
149000	151000	From the game portal
151000	153000	Of Jonathan Coulton's Still Alive
153000	156000	And she's very brave to be doing that live here on the radio
156000	158000	So we're gonna give her a big OLR hug, right chat room?
158000	160000	Chat at orangeontotototototot.com
160000	161000	Also joining us tonight
161000	163000	Someone who's also new to the program
163000	165000	But doesn't seem to be quite as intimidated
165000	166000	You know why?
166000	167000	Cause he's too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl
167000	168000	Which we have in the house
168000	170000	We'll talk about that a little bit
170000	171000	Say hello to Jake
171000	173000	Hello interwebs
173000	174000	How are you Jake?
174000	176000	Getting thrashed by Snake
176000	177000	Alright, awesome
177000	179000	And we're not gonna be able to use this mic to talk to Jake
179000	182000	Or I might smash over poor Mo's guitar
182000	183000	And that wouldn't be good
183000	187000	And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Brothers Brawl
187000	188000	In the house
188000	190000	Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Brothers Brawl
190000	191000	Yes
191000	194000	So this is something that we, you know, picked up
194000	198000	That anybody really can right now if they have the ability to play import games
198000	201000	And it's actually, I kind of got lucky on eBay
201000	205000	Cause, you know, it's been going for over $150 on there
205000	206000	Just for an import copy
206000	208000	Luckily though, I did find one
208000	210000	And I had to do a double take on it
210000	214000	That was $49.99 and like $8 shipping
214000	216000	So I was like, I'm jumping on that
216000	217000	Wow, nice
217000	218000	So I bought it
218000	221000	And sure enough, it was legit
221000	223000	So, you know, that's awesome
223000	224000	Very cool
224000	227000	I don't know why anyone else didn't see this auction
227000	229000	Seeing it as a buy it now for $49.99
229000	232000	I'm like, that's even cheaper than getting it on Playasia
232000	237000	So, you know, I'm definitely, this game I think is worth buying twice
237000	241000	So I will be playing the Japanese copy until the US one comes out
241000	244000	Alright, we'll talk about your thoughts a little more on the game
244000	245000	When we get into How Was Your Gaming Week
245000	248000	But for right now, we're gonna move on over into that segment
248000	249000	How Was Your Gaming Week
249000	250000	But you know us ladies first
250000	252000	So we're gonna let DarkSakura kick it off with
252000	254000	How Was Your Gaming Week
254000	257000	My gaming week was actually very not
257000	261000	Because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok
261000	263000	Because it's just, you know, point and click
263000	265000	That type of thing
265000	267000	So, yeah
267000	269000	I didn't even play any pinball
270000	271000	No pinball?
271000	272000	No pinball
272000	273000	Oh my gosh
273000	274000	Same reason
274000	275000	Wow, well sorry to hear about that
275000	278000	We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff
278000	281000	I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise though
281000	283000	Very cool, what did you think of what you saw?
283000	288000	I thought that I really really really really really really like crashes
288000	291000	And I like the super jumps
291000	292000	Very cool
292000	296000	Like the really long ones where you get the different angles
296000	298000	And I'm like Dukes of Hazzard go
298000	299000	It was cool
299000	300000	Good times
300000	301000	Alright
301000	303000	Well hopefully you'll be back up and running soon
303000	305000	Your middle finger will be back in commission
305000	307000	And you can flip people off and all that good stuff
307000	309000	It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night
309000	311000	I wake up in the morning all double horns
311000	313000	So it's not all bad
314000	316000	She rolls out of bed ready to rock
316000	317000	Yep
317000	321000	And you know if it were more fingers it would be too much metal for one hand
321000	322000	Awesome
323000	324000	Alright
324000	326000	Loki we'll go over to you, how was your gaming week?
326000	327000	Put down the controller
327000	328000	My gaming week was fine
328000	330000	You are not trying to do this and play at the same time
330000	331000	You are not
332000	333000	You can leave it alone for five seconds
333000	334000	Hey I'm not playing it
334000	337000	I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat
337000	339000	Alright you know so we were fixing it
339000	340000	Fine
340000	342000	I thought you said that wasn't cheating
342000	344000	It's not cheating it's exploiting the game
344000	345000	Exactly
346000	347000	Oh you said cheat not cheat
347000	348000	Yeah
348000	352000	So my gaming week I've been playing Burnout Paradise
352000	355000	Which is awesome because I have this vendetta against Dan
355000	357000	Unfortunately Gunstar Hero
357000	365000	Because he keeps beating my times or my show time amounts
365000	366000	The Road Rules ones
366000	367000	Yeah the Road Rules ones
367000	369000	Yeah he keeps beating my crashing ones
369000	372000	So I go through and specifically go and beat his
372000	374000	He's not actually doing it on purpose
374000	375000	I know
375000	376000	We talked about it
376000	377000	I know
377000	379000	Well the whole reason he did the Road Rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs and that was it
379000	380000	And he wanted the car
380000	384000	Yeah well I understand that but I have to beat everybody on my friends list
384000	386000	So that's why I've been going through and doing that
386000	389000	Well if you tell him it's a competition he will compete
389000	390000	It was fun
390000	393000	I love the game it's great just crashing everything
393000	396000	Which kind of gets me to my other topic here
396000	398000	I had another 360 die
398000	400000	Three rings
400000	403000	I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times
403000	405000	Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?
405000	407000	No I had to overheat it quite a few times
407000	408000	Sounds hot
408000	411000	This next time though it's not going to be pretty
411000	415000	I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about 1000 degrees
415000	418000	It will work or it will melt
418000	420000	One of the two
420000	423000	And then let's see what else did I get
423000	427000	Oh actually I imported another game
427000	429000	It's a game called
429000	431000	God I don't remember what it's called now
431000	434000	I was going to say while you're thinking about that for your Xbox 360
434000	437000	You know Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard
437000	439000	Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week
439000	441000	It's like popping randomly in the left speaker
441000	444000	So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed
444000	448000	It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker
448000	451000	But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral
451000	453000	So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360
453000	456000	We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home
456000	458000	Put it in a little floaty boat
458000	459000	Set it on fire
459000	461000	I'm not ready to give up on it yet
461000	465000	Because I've gotten it to work for half an hour at a time
465000	467000	It's just so weird because it will work perfectly
467000	469000	And I think oh great it's fixed
469000	473000	And then I'll turn it on three hours later and it will be three rings again
473000	476000	I'll play through a game and it will be completely normal
476000	478000	It can play it for about an hour or so
478000	481000	And I'm like okay I'm confident this is working
481000	483000	And then sure enough it stops working
483000	485000	So whatever
485000	486000	I give up
486000	490000	Anyways I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was
490000	493000	Other things I played other than that of course
493000	494000	Smash Brothers Brawl
494000	497000	Just started playing a bit of that
497000	499000	To be honest I'm not very good at it
499000	501000	But it's cool
501000	503000	It's a really cool game
503000	507000	Like I said it's probably worth buying twice
507000	510000	So definitely check it out if you can
510000	512000	As soon as you can
512000	516000	We've actually unlocked quite a few players
516000	519000	Because other than playing through space and emissary mode
519000	521000	You can actually just play the versus mode
521000	524000	And one of the cheat things you can do is you can set up a special brawl
524000	528000	Where the players have set hit points
528000	530000	And then you drop the computers down the one
530000	533000	You put this thing on where the hit points drop gradually
533000	537000	So immediately the computer dies
537000	539000	So that's kind of fun I guess
539000	544000	It's like watching paint dry but it unlocks characters so that's good
544000	546000	Let's see what else they play
546000	547000	Res HD
547000	550000	Oh my god is that awesome
550000	553000	Playing that on a surround sound system
553000	554000	Oh yeah
554000	557000	That is some good stuff there
557000	559000	Absolutely love that game
559000	560000	Let's see
560000	563000	Oh now this is the game I imported for the Game Boy Advance
563000	565000	Dot Stream is the name of it
565000	567000	It's one of the bit generation titles
567000	568000	Erase Lines
568000	570000	And it's actually pretty fun
570000	573000	Cheap little titles like 20 bucks
573000	576000	But I'll have to show you Rob some of it a little bit later
576000	579000	And that's pretty much it
579000	580000	Awesome
580000	583000	Well it sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week
583000	584000	I try
584000	585000	Well I want to go to our guest Moe
585000	587000	And see what Moe's been playing this week
587000	591000	Now Moe you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs
591000	593000	You do actually play video games
593000	594000	You work in video games
594000	596000	You're a gamer girl right
596000	597000	Yes I am
597000	598000	You sure are so don't doubt it
598000	600000	So what kind of games have you been playing this week
600000	603000	I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful
603000	606000	And there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things
606000	612000	I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV
612000	615000	Which is very depressing because it looks awesome so far
615000	617000	But I'm a really crappy shot
617000	622000	And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game
622000	623000	Awesome
623000	624000	Very cool
624000	625000	So you've been very busy
625000	628000	Yeah I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC
628000	631000	Since somebody's borrowing my 360 copies still
631000	632000	My bad
632000	634000	He's better on PC
634000	638000	No actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC
638000	640000	I don't know if I mentioned it before
640000	647000	Was that I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game
647000	650000	The actual 3D model because I want to make one
650000	653000	Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle
653000	657000	But I haven't gotten around to that yet
657000	661000	Now Moe are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360
661000	662000	I'm a PC player
662000	666000	Why is that you just prefer that you think it's more of a keyboard mouse type game
666000	669000	Or are you like Xbox sucks or what
669000	671000	I have a 360 I love my 360
671000	676000	But I cannot do shooters on console at all
676000	679000	I'm a terrible shot I cannot play Halo for the life of me
679000	680000	Gotcha
680000	684000	So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people
684000	685000	Alright
685000	689000	Oh I forgot I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again
689000	691000	Because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it
691000	696000	Because god damn commander whoever's stuck
696000	699000	You know holding his arms out with a gun in his hand
699000	701000	They won't trigger the last scene
701000	704000	I really hate that game at the end at least
704000	707000	The rest of the game is awesome it's just the end fucking sucks
707000	710000	Seriously
710000	711000	Alright
711000	713000	Well I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week
713000	716000	And then Jake do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week
716000	717000	As soon as I'm done here
717000	719000	He's gonna be a pouty face
719000	720000	Let's see
720000	723000	My gaming week was pretty much Res HD all freaking week
723000	728000	I agree with Loki Res HD is a beautiful game and it's time for Res to make a little bit of a comeback
728000	732000	You know it was a little bit fuzzy on the Playstation 2 and the Dreamcast
732000	737000	Not that it was bad but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful beautiful HD
737000	741000	And the sound system and everything it's just gorgeous
741000	745000	And it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever
745000	750000	For real I just love Res and it's a beautiful game and the graphics are great
750000	754000	I mean it's only like 10 bucks so it's a great deal I think it's probably the best
754000	757000	Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet honestly
757000	759000	I'm totally in love with Res HD
759000	763000	That's really it otherwise I've been playing Warcraft still because I'm a big nerd
763000	766000	SassyPants my level 70 character who's awesome
766000	772000	And she now has a sister named SassyLama who is a shaman I just made that so
772000	775000	And if you don't know what that means you gotta check Urban Dictionary
775000	777000	So there you go
777000	780000	Anyway we gotta, Loki you gotta give Jake your mic
780000	784000	Jake now you're new to the program right?
784000	787000	But you're a gamer too right?
787000	788000	Well I'm not a gamer
788000	790000	Yeah you've just been attached to Smash Bros. Brawl all night
790000	793000	What kind of games do you play? What have you been playing this week?
793000	797000	I was in Baltimore all week so I've been playing Rock Band
797000	799000	And lots of Rock Band
799000	802000	And more Rock Band up until like midnight on Wednesday
802000	806000	What do you love so much about Rock Band?
806000	809000	Character creation, the party aspect
809000	812000	You get four people in a room just rocking out it doesn't compare to anything else
812000	816000	Barbie mode is awesome in Rock Band seriously I love Barbie mode
816000	817000	Hey dress up mode
817000	820000	Yes you get to dress up my characters and take them shopping it's awesome
820000	822000	You play a lot of MMOs though?
822000	823000	Too many
823000	825000	Like not just Warcraft what other kind of MMOs have you been playing?
825000	828000	I slowly got addicted to EverQuest 2 unfortunately
828000	829000	Sucker
829000	830000	So people actually play EverQuest 2?
830000	834000	Quite a handful there's like 10-15 servers and a couple are actually full now and then
834000	836000	What makes EverQuest 2 so dang popular?
836000	841000	It's less easy mode it's a little more it's like wow only more difficult as far as I can tell
841000	844000	Deeper craft system lots more race to choose from
844000	846000	You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2 correct?
846000	847000	And a frog and a rat
847000	848000	That's pretty awesome
848000	850000	And the head of the dragons
850000	851000	Cool
851000	854000	What else what else what other MMOs you been playing?
854000	858000	Well aside from wow Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta
858000	865000	Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa is all about because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me which wasn't a whole lot so
865000	868000	Essentially it's a third person shooter MMO
868000	873000	You go around you blast aliens instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and what not
873000	878000	Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there or is there something you can compare it to or?
878000	883000	There's not much you can compare it to aside from like a tactical shooter because you can actually use cover effectively and
883000	885000	Alright
885000	887000	It's hard to describe though as far as that goes
887000	888000	Gotcha
888000	889000	Alright
889000	893000	So you recommend all these games do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs they should?
893000	894000	Definitely
894000	898000	Now wait a minute you play three different MMOs but you do have a day job right?
898000	899000	I think so
899000	901000	And you do go outdoors once in a while?
901000	902000	I'm here
902000	903000	So you break the stereotype?
903000	904000	Yes
904000	907000	Alright excellent I'm glad to hear you have a healthy balanced lifestyle that's great
907000	908000	Doubtful
908000	909000	Alright
909000	917000	Also chat orange launch radio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight. We'd love to hear what you guys have to say
917000	923000	A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl which is going on right now during our program
923000	929000	Although I would think you know either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that or you came over here watch this
929000	935000	Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway so most people for most people Super Bowl is long passed over
935000	942000	Son of Dad says Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target so I guess Tabula Rasa is not selling too well
942000	945000	I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation
945000	954000	Hitstun praising Res HD Hitstun says Res HD is awesome and have a 360 and don't already have Res you'd be stupid not to pick this up
954000	964000	I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on Res HD because they didn't they didn't have or they already had a previous copy of Res on Playstation 2 or Dreamcast
964000	972000	Tigerclaw says Skye I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Res HD not quite but I had to do the trans vibrator mode
972000	982000	I almost picked up three different controllers for that but I didn't have three different controllers at my house so I tried just the controller I was playing with and that was just kind of eh
982000	994000	Eh it's regular well I have the controller I was playing with and then my wireless so I put the wireless on my back cause that's what you know Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do is you should put one towards your lower back and it's actually kind of freaky
994000	1002000	But it's like a free back massage while you play video games so it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music it's certainly an experience I'll say that
1002000	1013000	So let's see Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Brothers Brawl in house he says turn it off it's rude to play games that we non importers don't have yet
1013000	1022000	I'm sorry dude I don't know what to tell you we really want to play dude blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release that's what I say
1022000	1025000	It's alright they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways
1025000	1029000	Alright that's right cause they're having problems aren't they
1029000	1032000	They're a little short yeah
1032000	1046000	Well actually no seriously it is just a little short because they they only fulfill I forget how much of it not much like 20% of the preorders but the rest are coming next week so
1046000	1048000	So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out
1048000	1060000	Yeah it's not that bad I mean and every major like Nintendo title has been short anyways with Mario Galaxy was like that Zelda I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here
1060000	1073000	Mario Kart and the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels it'll be something stupid and arbitrary that's you know holding the whole thing up I don't know
1073000	1078000	So Nintendo seems to be having production issues just left and right at first you can't crank out enough Wii's and they can't crank out
1078000	1083000	A little random factoid though this is the first dual layer disc that's on the Wii
1083000	1088000	Well I imagine with all the shit they have in this game it's got to be a pretty full disc
1088000	1090000	Yeah you have to run an update once you get it so
1090000	1091000	Wow
1091000	1098000	Thank you Nintendo now I have two news channels and two weather channels both of which I still don't use so that's awesome
1098000	1099000	Weather channel's awesome
1099000	1101000	Do you actually use the weather channel Mo?
1101000	1105000	When I feel like seeing what the temperature is in Johannesburg Africa
1105000	1107000	Or is it just for spinning the plane?
1107000	1109000	I like to listen to the music and spin the globe because I'm stupid
1109000	1111000	Yeah sometimes that's fun
1111000	1113000	Especially if I've been drinking a little bit
1113000	1119000	Sometimes you're curious about how cold it is in Russia at the time or you know how nice and warm it is in Puerto Rico
1119000	1123000	Or how cold does it get at the South Pole that kind of stuff fascinates me
1123000	1125000	It's fascinating
1125000	1131000	How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole? These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world
1131000	1137000	Alright let's see Portal Combat in our chat room says I want Portal Song now
1137000	1140000	So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient
1140000	1142000	Hey how does it feel to want?
1142000	1144000	You've got to wait
1144000	1146000	Patience is a virtue
1146000	1155000	And also because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and you know is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program
1155000	1159000	You know we could have like hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard she didn't know
1159000	1163000	So she's very brave to come here
1163000	1168000	So once we get past part A and the musical performance we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment
1168000	1172000	So once the song is performed there will be cake
1172000	1174000	From the chat room
1174000	1179000	Globe Band just says you want song 2 do you know any blur?
1179000	1182000	I don't know maybe I can do it I can wing it
1182000	1188000	Now you actually do other songs besides just video game stuff right?
1188000	1192000	Portal was just a whim one of my friends was like hey you should try doing the Still Alive song
1192000	1196000	And then I looked up the chords and like tapped it out and I was like wow this is really easy
1196000	1201000	And I had a digital camera and I'm like hey I can put my YouTube account to use
1201000	1203000	And now it has like 31,000 views
1203000	1206000	Isn't it crazy how the internet works?
1206000	1211000	I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments
1211000	1216000	Nice well congratulations that's pretty awesome to see you know somebody literally out of their bedroom
1216000	1220000	I mean that's I think that's why we wanted to reach out and like get you in
1220000	1221000	My room is such a mess
1221000	1225000	No because literally where did this show start out of our you know my spare bedroom
1225000	1228000	And Loki and I lived together for a little while we were doing the show out of our living room
1228000	1233000	So you know it's just with I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing
1233000	1238000	People can see my like drums from rock band behind me and then like the mess on my floor
1238000	1240000	They can see my posters
1240000	1245000	Well next time you need to cl- and somebody here in the Justin TV chat
1245000	1250000	Somebody was I don't know being a troll and said something about who decorated this place
1250000	1256000	An 11 year old girl so you know people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on
1256000	1261000	So because I'm so sure an 11 year old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket
1261000	1263000	I would have when I was 11
1263000	1264000	Oh maybe
1264000	1267000	When I was 11 I think I had gremlins
1267000	1269000	Alright let's I think I had Legos
1269000	1274000	Alright let's get to the gaming news and then we can I promise we will get to the portal song
1274000	1278000	But we got it we got to tease it a little bit and get to get some news out of the way first
1278000	1283000	Also just want to give some quick plugs if you don't know already we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge
1283000	1288000	We have a MySpace MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and a Facebook community is there too
1288000	1293000	If you search for the OL army is our Facebook community too so social networking whores that's us
1293000	1296000	So check us out on those different websites
1296000	1298000	That's that let's get to the gaming news Loki
1298000	1307000	Alright well as we talked about last week there's rumors going around that the 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3 system is being phased out
1307000	1314000	And of course we know that's true with Best Buy and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB
1314000	1320000	Well now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system
1320000	1326000	SKU that's going to have a 120 to 160 gigabyte hard drive
1326000	1329000	And it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller
1329000	1332000	All for the same price point of $499
1332000	1339000	And if you think about it that makes perfect sense seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways
1339000	1341000	Right around the corner
1341000	1350000	And you know it's kind of funny how we laughed before like you know back when Kuteragi was talking about
1350000	1358000	Oh yeah it's going to be like a PC we're going to upgrade it you know all the time you know it's going to be constantly changing
1358000	1365000	And we're like ah that's stupid you're an idiot and sure enough they keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing
1365000	1373000	So like you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3
1373000	1374000	Hey
1374000	1378000	That uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their chips to the hard drive
1378000	1384000	They're future proofing it okay someday there will be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something
1384000	1388000	When home finally comes out it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run
1388000	1389000	That's right
1389000	1390000	You're going to need room for all that SingStar
1390000	1396000	In 2010 when home finally comes out you're going to need that you know 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then
1396000	1398000	Yeah who's going to say
1398000	1400000	For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes
1400000	1402000	I can't
1402000	1403000	No
1403000	1404000	Yes
1404000	1405000	Yes
1405000	1406000	Yes
1406000	1409000	It's Studio 54 all over again
1409000	1414000	Have you not done your homework Loki the internet is for porn
1414000	1416000	And for piracy
1416000	1418000	Well you can piracy
1418000	1419000	Pirate porn
1419000	1420000	Pirate porn
1420000	1421000	Hey
1421000	1422000	There is a porn called pirates
1422000	1426000	There is a porn called pirates it was the highest produced like most expensive porn ever made
1426000	1427000	One of our lesbians has it
1427000	1428000	Hold on hold on
1428000	1430000	I've seen it it's actually pretty well produced
1430000	1435000	Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity but she's a connoisseur of porn
1435000	1437000	Apparently as well
1437000	1439000	Hope to god my mom isn't watching this
1439000	1441000	I know I was like your mom's not watching tonight right
1441000	1442000	Hi mom
1442000	1443000	Just kidding
1443000	1445000	We're wacky internet people
1445000	1447000	Alright we tell jokes
1447000	1448000	Anyhow
1448000	1450000	Anything else you want to say about the Playstation
1450000	1451000	About the Playstation 3
1451000	1454000	Stop making new skews it's confusing
1454000	1458000	And all you're going to just convince people is well if I wait longer it'll be better
1458000	1459000	You know that's
1459000	1461000	What are they going to get stuck doing
1461000	1462000	Seriously
1462000	1467000	And how much you want to bet this new skew is just not going to have backwards compatibility what so ever on it
1467000	1468000	Just like the 40
1468000	1469000	Yep just like the 40
1469000	1471000	They're just going to screw everybody
1471000	1472000	Oh well
1472000	1475000	They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game too
1475000	1477000	Probably layer since it doesn't sell
1477000	1479000	That would make sense
1479000	1480000	Awesome
1480000	1481000	Hooray
1481000	1486000	Let's see and son of dad says in chat.orangelschatter.com
1486000	1490000	Playstation 3 one year five skews no fucking games
1490000	1492000	Hey there's Uncharted
1492000	1496000	Orko says porn is greater than cake
1496000	1498000	I don't know cake is pretty good
1498000	1503000	Of course that brings Isu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie
1503000	1507000	Well actually it was funny while I was half asleep this morning
1507000	1510000	Cause I was supposed to be awake for breakfast but I wasn't
1510000	1513000	Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing burnout paradise
1513000	1517000	About the difference between going online on the xbox 360
1517000	1519000	As opposed to going online on the Playstation 3
1519000	1523000	How with xbox 360 it's just part of the experience
1523000	1525000	It's there everybody is there
1525000	1529000	But with he was talking about going online with SOCOM
1529000	1532000	And saying how it was like you know filing your taxes
1532000	1536000	You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it
1536000	1539000	So if you're going to be an online player then having a PS3 isn't worth it
1539000	1542000	You know sometimes friend codes don't look so bad
1542000	1544000	When you put all that in comparison
1544000	1546000	I mean it's like you know I don't know
1546000	1552000	One thing that the Playstation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for
1552000	1554000	Is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
1554000	1556000	Of course you remember that whole controversy
1556000	1560000	With you know there was OMG Sex was unlockable
1560000	1562000	Speaking of porn was unlockable within the game
1562000	1564000	And you know it was a whole hot coffee mess
1564000	1567000	Well if you may remember when we last left off
1567000	1569000	There was a settlement that was going to happen
1569000	1571000	Where you could actually replace your game
1571000	1574000	And you could get some sort of you know severance
1574000	1579000	For you know the horrific images that were displayed in your home unknowingly
1579000	1582000	Because you didn't have to hack the fucking game to get them or whatever
1582000	1584000	But anyhow if you want to know some details
1584000	1587000	Take-Two has recently released the details on their website
1587000	1589000	Now here's the thing
1589000	1594000	The settlement will offer different levels of compensation
1594000	1600000	Depending on your proof that a violated you know buyer may have to offer
1600000	1603000	So if you have an original copy of the game
1603000	1606000	You can get of course the replacement disc
1606000	1608000	If you have the receipt with it
1608000	1611000	You can get a $35 cash payment
1611000	1612000	As part of the settlement
1612000	1614000	And if you have a credit card statement or check
1614000	1616000	You get $17.50
1616000	1619000	If you get a disc, no receipt, $10
1619000	1622000	If you have no receipt and no game
1622000	1624000	You can earn $5
1624000	1626000	Sweet
1626000	1627000	So here you go
1627000	1629000	If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two
1629000	1633000	All you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury
1633000	1635000	I'll do it
1635000	1638000	That you purchased the game and you played the offending game
1638000	1640000	And you know it hurt you
1640000	1641000	It raped your fragile mind
1641000	1642000	I don't know
1642000	1645000	You got to just swear that the game you know did things to your mind
1645000	1646000	You were not prepared for
1646000	1648000	Some people enjoy that
1648000	1652000	I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5
1652000	1655000	I mean I don't know if it's worth it
1655000	1657000	That is lunch at McDonald's for a day
1657000	1661000	$5 will totally get me a teriyaki
1661000	1662000	Exactly
1662000	1664000	Lunch on Take-Two everybody
1664000	1666000	Lunch on Take-Two this week
1666000	1667000	Enjoy
1667000	1668000	And hopefully
1668000	1670000	That would totally buy me some hot coffee
1670000	1671000	You know
1671000	1674000	You know that $5 that you can get from
1674000	1676000	You know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
1676000	1679000	Because it warped your freaking mind
1679000	1682000	That's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto IV
1682000	1683000	When it comes out
1683000	1684000	Exactly
1684000	1685000	It pays for your pre-order
1685000	1686000	Exactly
1686000	1687000	Exactly
1687000	1692000	Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store
1692000	1693000	To try and stake your claim to this
1693000	1695000	Because you know once you get the $5
1695000	1696000	You're going to say
1696000	1697000	You need to pre-order the new game
1697000	1698000	Right
1698000	1699000	No I'm just kidding
1699000	1700000	Alright
1700000	1702000	Let's move on with some more gaming
1702000	1705000	Because hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal
1705000	1706000	No it won't be
1706000	1707000	Never
1707000	1708000	So in Gran Turismo
1708000	1709000	There's a hot coffee
1709000	1710000	No
1710000	1713000	But speaking of Gran Turismo
1713000	1718000	There's a fun little bit that's out though for $40
1718000	1719000	Like I wouldn't pay for that
1719000	1720000	But
1720000	1722000	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue
1722000	1724000	Has an April 17th release date
1724000	1726000	And it will have 60 cars
1726000	1727000	And you will get like
1727000	1728000	Nissan
1728000	1729000	And Ferraris
1729000	1730000	And Audis
1730000	1731000	Like you'd want an Audi
1731000	1733000	And different levels
1733000	1735000	I believe there's 5 tracks
1735000	1737000	And you can either download it
1737000	1738000	Or pay for the disc
1738000	1741000	And with the disc you get a special video
1741000	1742000	Awesome
1742000	1743000	You know what that means
1743000	1745000	That means that you can buy a half done game
1745000	1747000	For $30 or $40
1747000	1748000	And then guess what
1748000	1750000	You can wait for the full game to come out
1750000	1751000	And then pay another $60
1751000	1752000	Because you're a whore
1752000	1753000	But wait wait wait
1753000	1755000	You get a half done game now
1755000	1758000	And then you get a 90% done game later
1758000	1760000	And then they'll put out like special edition
1760000	1761000	That's completely finished
1761000	1763000	They'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue the sequel
1763000	1765000	Which will be like almost done
1765000	1767000	We're swear we're almost done with the game
1767000	1768000	This is 60% done now
1768000	1770000	Loki you put it so eloquently
1770000	1771000	You just have a way with words
1771000	1772000	You know that right
1772000	1773000	I know
1773000	1774000	I was going to say
1774000	1775000	This is a lot of crap
1775000	1776000	For a game that's not really done
1776000	1777000	But
1777000	1778000	It's not that great anyways
1778000	1779000	Wait wait
1779000	1780000	Even if people are going to do it
1780000	1781000	They're going to be like
1781000	1782000	Oh my god I have to have it
1782000	1783000	I'm a consumer whore
1783000	1784000	And get it
1784000	1786000	Or just wait for the full game to come out
1786000	1789000	People don't know how to be patient
1789000	1792000	Yeah I guess I can't really talk about patience
1792000	1793000	No mister
1793000	1796000	Do you have any wheeze now
1796000	1800000	No
1800000	1801000	More news please
1801000	1802000	Yes please
1802000	1803000	I agree
1803000	1804000	We need to get to the Portal song
1804000	1805000	Sooner round later
1805000	1806000	Because that means less talking from us
1806000	1807000	Sorry
1807000	1809000	And I actually meant
1809000	1810000	Okay now this story
1810000	1811000	I meant to get something
1811000	1812000	To actually test this out on the show
1812000	1814000	But I was too lazy to stop by
1814000	1815000	Anyways
1815000	1817000	Firmware 3.9 has come out
1817000	1819000	Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Brothers Brawl
1819000	1821000	Too lazy
1821000	1822000	So I was basically
1822000	1823000	Because that's going to stop at GameStop
1823000	1825000	And get a headset for my PSP
1825000	1827000	So I can talk on Skype
1827000	1829000	So we can test it during the show
1829000	1830000	And I figured
1830000	1831000	No that'd be dumb
1831000	1833000	And I don't want to waste $20 on a headset
1833000	1835000	I'll never use Skype
1835000	1837000	I apologize for ever asking about the story
1837000	1839000	It's really hard to find that
1839000	1840000	Anyways
1840000	1841000	So
1841000	1844000	Firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP
1844000	1846000	And it does feature Skype
1846000	1848000	If you have the PSP Slim
1848000	1851000	And two days later it was cracked
1851000	1857000	And is now available for everybody else like me
1857000	1859000	So hooray
1859000	1861000	Way to go Sony
1861000	1863000	Keeping up with that security
1863000	1868000	Now does the crack still work off some type of exploit
1868000	1870000	Or how exactly does that work
1870000	1872000	They basically decrypt the
1872000	1875000	The whole firmware
1875000	1877000	And then they just modify it so you can
1877000	1879000	Install it on your PSP
1879000	1882000	With homebrew support and other stuff like that
1882000	1884000	So one more time just to recap
1884000	1886000	The new PSP firmware came out this week
1886000	1888000	And was promptly cracked two days later
1888000	1890000	Alright
1890000	1894000	I always feel like every time
1894000	1897000	We have a story about the firmware getting cracked
1897000	1899000	You know Sony comes out and says
1899000	1901000	Nobody's ever going to crack this
1901000	1903000	This is the full proof firmware
1903000	1905000	We've closed the loophole
1905000	1906000	No one's ever going to crack it
1906000	1907000	And then two days later
1907000	1909000	It gets even better
1909000	1912000	And I don't think this made the show roll
1912000	1916000	But they're finding a way now to
1916000	1920000	Inject the 1.5 firmware
1920000	1923000	Homebrew capability into the slim PSPs now
1923000	1925000	Inject the 1.5 firmware
1925000	1927000	You make it sound so hot
1927000	1929000	Well because you can't run
1929000	1931000	There are certain parts of 1.5
1931000	1933000	That won't run on a slim PSP
1933000	1935000	But now they're figuring out how to do that
1935000	1938000	It'll never work
1938000	1940000	There's never going to be a point where
1940000	1942000	They're super secure
1942000	1943000	Alright
1943000	1945000	Well if you're looking for more things
1945000	1946000	To use your PSP for
1946000	1948000	Pretty soon FLOW
1948000	1950000	Is going to be coming out on the PSP
1950000	1952000	You might know this game as the screensaver that you play
1952000	1955000	This originally came out on the PlayStation Network of course
1955000	1959000	And it will soon be coming out to the PSP
1959000	1962000	This is according to computer and video games
1962000	1965000	The PSP version probably won't be changed much
1965000	1967000	From the original PlayStation 3 version
1967000	1970000	I'm trying to think
1970000	1972000	How exactly do you mess with FLOW
1972000	1974000	Do you give the game a plot?
1974000	1977000	Or like an objective?
1977000	1979000	Eat stuff, become bigger, evolve
1979000	1981000	That's right I forgot
1981000	1983000	The instructions that the game gives you
1983000	1984000	Eat stuff
1984000	1986000	There you go
1986000	1987000	Alrighty
1987000	1989000	Well let's see what else is coming out soon

2079000	2081000	Yeah Rob
2081000	2084000	Because when you see them about to take it you beat them with the clubs
2084000	2086000	I see
2086000	2088000	That's it
2088000	2089000	Alright

2122000	2125000	I played the Xbox 360 demo it's awesome
2125000	2127000	Wow that sounded like exciting

2130000	2135000	Twisted Metal Head On Extra Twisted Edition for PlayStation 2
2135000	2138000	Space Force Captains on PC
2138000	2144000	Downstream Panic on the PSP which is kind of like a rip off of LocoRoco when you look at it
2144000	2152000	Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore coming out on 360 Wii and PlayStation 2
2152000	2154000	Not touching that game
2154000	2156000	I thought it was awful
2156000	2161000	Nobunaga's Ambition Rise to Power on PlayStation 2
2161000	2167000	The Spider-Man Chronicles on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PC and the DS

2170000	2173000	Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS
2173000	2176000	My Horse and Me on the Wii and the DS

2192000	2195000	Finally confirmed to be coming out on the 10th now
2195000	2198000	Because you didn't know that three weeks ago
2198000	2200000	No you didn't know that three weeks ago
2200000	2205000	And to kind of go along with that Professor Layton and the Curious Village on the DS
2205000	2208000	Which is hot shit right now in Japan
2208000	2212000	But I don't know what the draw is but great
2212000	2214000	And then Puppy Palace on DS

2229000	2230000	Wow that's
2230000	2232000	Isn't that like a game show now or something?
2232000	2233000	I guess
2233000	2234000	Right
2234000	2236000	Why do they have them hosting anything that's just weird
2236000	2240000	Well Merv Griffin is kind of dead so he can't host much right now
2240000	2243000	Grrr strong words
2243000	2244000	Zombie Cross word
2244000	2248000	Well I don't know they can be like a computer reanimation
2248000	2250000	Because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden
2250000	2255000	Wow I don't think Merv Griffin died that long this might be in the To Soon category
2255000	2256000	So we need to be careful
2256000	2262000	There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing
2262000	2263000	Okay
2263000	2264000	Okay
2264000	2270000	okay sure exactly

2276400	2280440	you know I think no here's what it is
2280440	2284360	Dick Clark is seriously the inspiration for that movie Final Destination
2284360	2288720	he has dodged death so many times you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio the
2288720	2290360	finest in video game chat
2290360	2294480	I'm done that's it that's all that's coming out this week

2531480	2532440	ending short best

2561640	2564760	you know the orange box new for 60 bucks and it's
2564760	2569840	all this stuff they should make these like no more than 1520 bucks apiece

2722360	2722840	can hear you
2722840	2727160	think someone links to another portal video and then years came up in the
2727160	2729160	results and I clicked on it was like hey
2729160	2733320	that's awesome and then I showed you as I and then you were over here for the
2733320	2738120	new year's party and I don't somehow I know somehow portal came up just randomly
2738120	2738880	are watching
2738880	2741860	you tubes are I don't know and and you said that hey there's a girl who's
2741860	2742560	local
2742560	2746600	that's got one and so we watched it we sent her an email and here she is
2746600	2750840	here she is so are you about ready for this I gotta I'm gonna have to situate a
2750840	2753120	little differently cuz we're ghetto we don't have a lot of hookups there so I'm
2753120	2754680	just gonna kinda sit by you here
2754680	2759120	and now while you do this so and I'm gonna ask you guys to turn your mics off
2759120	2760840	so we don't get a lot of background noise in here
2760840	2763920	but this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig
2763920	2767160	our first musical guest rage but it's gonna be awesome
2767160	2771960	right it's gonna be only slightly I hope it'll be above average we know that
2771960	2775560	no it's gonna be great be better than it's gonna be better by listening to us
2775560	2777000	saying that's for sure alright
2777000	2780200	so alright so enough chatter let's take
2780200	2785360	let's have a mo take it away here here she is live on now orange lounge radio
2785360	2790360	with Jonathan Colton's still alive
2790360	2795360	this was a triumph
2795360	2801360	I'm making a no-tear huge success
2801360	2809360	it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
2809360	2813360	Aperture Science
2813360	2818360	we do what we must because we can
2818360	2824360	for the good in all of us except the ones who are dead
2824360	2829360	but there's no sense crying over every mistake
2829360	2833360	you just keep on trying till you run out of cake
2833360	2838360	and the science gets done and you make a neat gun
2838360	2844360	for the people who are still alive
2844360	2849360	I'm not even angry
2849360	2855360	I'm being so sincere right now
2855360	2863360	even though you broke my heart and killed me
2863360	2867360	and tore me to pieces
2867360	2873360	and threw every piece into a fire
2873360	2880360	as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
2880360	2884360	now these points of data make a beautiful line
2884360	2889360	and we're out of beta we're releasing on time
2889360	2893360	so I'm glad I got burned think of all the things we learned
2893360	2897360	for the people who are still alive
2897360	2906360	go ahead and leave me
2906360	2913360	I think I'd prefer to stay inside
2913360	2920360	maybe you'll find someone else to help you
2920360	2927360	maybe Black Mesa
2927360	2932360	that was a joke, haha, fat chance
2932360	2939360	anyway this cake is great it's so delicious and moist
2939360	2943360	look at me still talking when there's science to do
2943360	2948360	when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you
2948360	2952360	I've experiments to run there is research to be done
2952360	2957360	on the people who are still alive
2957360	2961360	and believe me I am still alive
2961360	2966360	I'm doing science and I'm still alive
2966360	2971360	I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
2971360	2975360	while you're dying I'll be still alive
2975360	2979360	and when you're dead I will be still alive
2979360	3007360	still alive
3007360	3010360	and there will be cake and it's not alive
3010360	3013360	we have some clapping in the chat room
3013360	3015360	Hitstun says it would win a cage match
3015360	3017360	our little musical thing we do after the show
3017360	3019360	or they pick good songs so very nice
3019360	3021360	so now you're going to have to learn something else and come back
3021360	3023360	again sometime
3023360	3027360	yes I happen to watch another one of her YouTubes
3027360	3030360	which I laughed at because
3030360	3033360	she did Rick Ashley's Never Gonna Give You Up
3033360	3036360	everyone's calling it a chick role that's the best part
3036360	3038360	they're calling it a chick role
3038360	3039360	it was awesome
3039360	3040360	awesome
3040360	3045360	you found it through the chick role?
3045360	3048360	alright
3048360	3050360	so lots and lots of clapping there in chat
3050360	3053360	and thank you very much for being a guinea pig
3053360	3055360	being our very first musical guest that went pretty well
3055360	3057360	except for the fact I kind of had to hold that
3057360	3059360	and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part
3059360	3061360	I kept smacking the mic and I'm like oh gosh
3061360	3063360	no but it came out really good so very exciting
3063360	3066360	alright we'll stop talking about the technical fuck ups now
3066360	3068360	and get back to the gaming news
3068360	3069360	yes anyways
3069360	3071360	oh wait no it's my turn isn't it sorry
3071360	3072360	yeah Rob
3072360	3075360	well if you want to be a guitar hero in the comfort of your own home
3075360	3079360	apparently four more guitar hero games are making their way this year
3079360	3082360	now that's not real guitar like the kind that Moe plays
3082360	3084360	but that's you know a fake five button guitar
3084360	3088360	but it might still get you you know boyfriends, girlfriends
3088360	3090360	and you know hot dates and all that good stuff
3090360	3092360	guitar hero Aaron the Ellen show
3092360	3094360	yeah it could get you on the Ellen show
3094360	3097360	guitar hero Aerosmith is supposedly going to be coming out in July
3097360	3101360	and of course guitar hero four in October
3101360	3105360	guitar hero on tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS
3105360	3106360	that's going to make its way in June
3106360	3110360	and supposedly there is a fourth title being planned
3110360	3115360	it's an action packed guitar hero experience like no other
3115360	3118360	so apparently it's some other type of guitar hero game
3118360	3124360	in other words it's basically taking a lovely, well established, loved franchise
3124360	3126360	and pooping on it with this game
3126360	3130360	well if there's four games in one year that's already pooping on it I think
3130360	3131360	I mean seriously
3131360	3137360	by the way those rumors are coming from surfer girl via gonintendo.com
3137360	3140360	and surfer girl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff so
3140360	3142360	not surprised
3142360	3144360	I'm not surprised about the three of them
3144360	3146360	and that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July
3146360	3150360	since that's when Rock the 80s came out this last year
3150360	3152360	oh, Rock the 80s
3152360	3157360	and I don't know they need to do something like remember Fret and Ice
3157360	3159360	they could do something like that action packed guitar game
3159360	3162360	you know just where you actually do a side scrolling game
3162360	3166360	but I think this is going to suck whatever it is I'm sure
3166360	3170360	I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them
3170360	3172360	it sucked
3172360	3174360	that's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer
3174360	3177360	I'm sorry but if you release four games
3177360	3179360	like okay
3179360	3181360	DDR for example
3181360	3184360	when you have three different games coming out in the same year
3184360	3187360	they just don't get the same amount of focus on each one
3187360	3189360	it's just
3189360	3193360	I don't know release one really good game except four really mediocre games
3193360	3195360	have you ever heard of the saying too much of a good thing
3195360	3197360	yeah exactly
3197360	3201360	Gerardimo asks in chat is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now
3201360	3203360	because the whole Activision Blizzard thing
3203360	3206360	you know rock out to your torn shaman and all that stuff
3206360	3210360	do we get hoochie dancing night elves and head banging undead
3210360	3212360	you might see some of that stuff
3212360	3214360	but here's the thing
3214360	3218360	I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version
3218360	3220360	I'm sure you'll see something like that in there
3220360	3223360	because they like doing weird crossover things
3223360	3224360	you never know
3224360	3228360	look if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3
3228360	3229360	anything is possible
3229360	3232360	I'm very disappointed I've not seen anything like that for Rock Band
3232360	3235360	I want some free songs I understand the three songs a week
3235360	3237360	or Journey
3237360	3238360	or Journey
3238360	3241360	they need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords the Underworld
3241360	3243360	just isn't enough
3243360	3245360	there needs to be more gag music in there
3245360	3247360	we need more lols in our Rock Band
3247360	3250360	we need Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend on there
3250360	3252360	I would own on that
3252360	3254360	like chocolate rain the heavy metal mix or something like that
3254360	3255360	yes
3255360	3257360	hey they managed to put freeze pop
3257360	3259360	drop it at me
3259360	3263360	well you know what Mo maybe should write them and get Still Alive in there
3263360	3266360	we need more stuff from the kind of long haired band
3266360	3269360	see now Still Alive
3269360	3270360	Spinal Tap
3270360	3271360	Spinal Tap
3271360	3275360	I was going to say Still Alive could make it into Rock Band
3275360	3277360	since EA publishes both games
3277360	3279360	so maybe
3279360	3281360	interesting EA are you listening
3281360	3284360	I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song
3284360	3286360	although I mean there's maps and something
3286360	3287360	they've got plenty of mellow stuff in there
3287360	3290360	well part of my iron lung is mellow
3290360	3292360	we need more Radiohead
3292360	3296360	and the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain Loki
3296360	3298360	so here you go a little kick
3298360	3300360	Chocolate Rain is great
3300360	3301360	it's amazing
3301360	3303360	that guy's voice is just intense
3303360	3307360	intense is a good way to describe it
3307360	3310360	let's move on with some more news
3310360	3312360	well
3312360	3314360	for our Sega fans there is a
3314360	3319360	PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege
3319360	3324360	that is an action RPG with different types of gameplay
3324360	3326360	we have a robotic partner that you can customize
3326360	3328360	and you have online co-op
3328360	3330360	up to four people
3330360	3335360	but they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release too
3335360	3337360	excuse me
3337360	3342360	they're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release
3342360	3346360	they are considering it as an option
3346360	3351360	and I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that it's actually going to be
3351360	3354360	they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself
3354360	3357360	that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible
3357360	3358360	so
3358360	3361360	the PC releases in September
3361360	3364360	so wait it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years hopefully?
3364360	3365360	I hope so
3365360	3367360	Sega needs to really redeem themselves
3367360	3369360	or they need to bring out Planet Harrier
3369360	3372360	we don't have very good hopes for this actually
3372360	3375360	if I remember correctly Space Siege is actually
3375360	3380360	a new series in the Dungeon Siege
3380360	3385360	so basically you know like a dungeon crawler but now it's a space crawler I guess
3385360	3387360	and
3387360	3389360	you know
3389360	3391360	no offense I mean I'm sure Dungeon Siege is awesome
3391360	3393360	it's just we will ruin that for me
3393360	3394360	I'm sorry
3394360	3398360	I think of that and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO
3398360	3401360	because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King and he'll be in space
3401360	3405360	and that's you know have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever
3405360	3410360	you know what I've had this very strange urge to play this week Dark Sakura?
3410360	3411360	what?
3411360	3412360	Fastestar universe
3412360	3413360	no
3413360	3414360	I don't know why
3414360	3415360	Ethan Waber's calling to you
3415360	3419360	yes that's what it is I missed the two handed thing
3419360	3421360	guy with the swords was awesome
3421360	3423360	you know my friend Julie
3423360	3424360	cost me 19
3424360	3425360	got it
3425360	3428360	and she's like oh my god every time she's always on PSU
3428360	3430360	and see we were actually having a discussion on this the other day
3430360	3433360	and she's saying that they're bringing in the old PSO maps
3433360	3434360	and everything
3434360	3437360	and I was like that could almost get me to play
3437360	3438360	I still have my copy
3438360	3441360	that could almost get me to play except I still hate how they do forces
3441360	3443360	that will get me to play I think
3443360	3444360	that's kind of cool
3444360	3448360	she says that all of, in fact some of the areas are already available
3448360	3451360	but they're also bringing back all the old enemies too
3451360	3452360	wow
3452360	3457360	so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem was with the universe itself
3457360	3461360	as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled
3461360	3465360	I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played
3465360	3467360	she said they brought back mags
3467360	3469360	that's hot I love mags
3469360	3471360	I miss my Master System mag
3471360	3475360	alright we got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show
3475360	3483360	so I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice challenge that was on the Xbox 360
3483360	3485360	I think last year
3485360	3490360	where you could earn such wonderful games as Contra and
3490360	3491360	oh guess what?
3491360	3493360	Fusion Frenzy 2
3493360	3497360	which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment
3497360	3498360	punishment
3498360	3499360	anyways
3499360	3502360	so you can win some new stuff this time
3502360	3505360	although it's a little bit different this time around
3505360	3507360	instead of actually competing just against a set number
3507360	3509360	you're competing against your friends
3509360	3512360	and you can win such things as say
3512360	3515360	a $20 Best Buy gift card
3515360	3517360	an Xbox 360 HD DVD player
3517360	3521360	since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of win in there
3521360	3523360	and some other stuff
3523360	3526360	maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again who knows
3526360	3527360	but
3527360	3532360	yeah so if you're interested in that they've actually got some more information on
3532360	3534360	360voice.com
3534360	3536360	slash challenges
3536360	3537360	you can check it out
3537360	3539360	a bunch of different things you can win
3539360	3541360	I don't know
3543360	3544360	I just have a
3544360	3546360	I really don't care
3546360	3549360	I'm kind of done with the whole like EP and achievement points thing
3549360	3550360	it's kind of done
3550360	3553360	you know I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so
3553360	3555360	sadly high it's just never
3555360	3557360	you're never going to catch up so I don't know
3557360	3560360	I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing
3560360	3561360	it's a little old to me
3561360	3564360	I mean I guess they're still interesting in a way
3564360	3566360	I guess like virtual trophies or whatever
3566360	3568360	but I don't know about these contests
3568360	3570360	unless they start putting some cold hard cash on the line
3570360	3572360	yeah it doesn't look like they are
3572360	3575360	I mean you can basically pick one of these different contests they're going on
3575360	3577360	you pick one you want to enter in
3577360	3581360	and then you basically compete and see how fast you can
3581360	3583360	you know grow your gamer score I guess
3583360	3586360	and they've got you know a bunch of different weird things
3586360	3588360	like you can win you know 1600 point cards
3588360	3590360	50 of our best buy cards
3590360	3592360	Big Mac challenge
3592360	3595360	I don't know maybe you win some Big Macs or something
3597360	3599360	clearance copies of Sneak King I don't know
3600360	3601360	anyhow
3601360	3603360	some games may be coming out very soon
3603360	3606360	for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more
3606360	3609360	because Lord knows you achievement point whores love
3609360	3611360	more arcade games to inflate your score
3611360	3614360	but these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all
3614360	3617360	apparently Microsoft's press FTP site
3617360	3620360	was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there
3620360	3622360	because they've released these screenshots of
3622360	3624360	Conquer Live and Reloaded
3624360	3625360	and Jade Empire
3625360	3629360	those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site
3629360	3632360	it indicates that the games could be coming to
3632360	3635360	Xbox Live Marketplace very soon
3635360	3637360	so there you have it there
3637360	3641360	now of course they're going to be added to the Xbox original line up
3641360	3643360	so come to think of it
3643360	3645360	I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points
3645360	3647360	because you can't use the original games for that
3647360	3651360	I'm not interested until they put like Jet Set Radio Future on there or something like that
3651360	3655360	so if it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live originals
3655360	3658360	1200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games
3658360	3659360	but I hear
3659360	3662360	or buy it used for probably even cheaper than that
3662360	3664360	I hear especially with Jade Empire
3664360	3667360	those games are ones that people love
3667360	3669360	so there you have it
3669360	3672360	looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for
3672360	3673360	what's that
3673360	3674360	to the big game
3674360	3675360	oh what game
3675360	3677360	the Puppy Bowl corgi one
3677360	3678360	oh yes
3678360	3679360	go team corgi
3679360	3680360	good job
3680360	3684360	seriously okay all these DS pet raising sims and no Puppy Bowl games
3684360	3686360	I mean come on
3686360	3687360	they totally need the Puppy Bowl
3687360	3691360	which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season
3691360	3694360	once again sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house
3694360	3695360	but apparently
3695360	3696360	corgis are great and they're smart
3696360	3697360	alright forget it
3697360	3698360	with their little mutated feet
3698360	3700360	I love their little feet
3700360	3702360	I've been telling my husband I want a corgi
3702360	3704360	and he's like no you have a cat
3704360	3706360	see proof that inbreeding can be awesome
3706360	3708360	well they have cats out yet too
3708360	3709360	no but they're so horrible
3709360	3710360	they feel so bad for them
3710360	3712360	do you love video games
3712360	3713360	hey
3713360	3714360	listen to Orange Lounge Radio
3714360	3716360	we talk about video games non-stop
3716360	3717360	you know who should have won Puppy Bowl
3717360	3720360	this is the Puppy and Kitty tangent
3720360	3722360	hey guess what Rob more Xbox Live
3722360	3723360	what
3723360	3726360	ceiling cat is watching you deviate from the video game stories
3726360	3727360	haha
3727360	3728360	uh
3728360	3729360	uh yeah
3729360	3730360	anyway
3730360	3735360	um game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations
3735360	3739360	as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases
3739360	3740360	is Poker Smash
3740360	3745360	which is um like I guess Tetris with poker things
3745360	3747360	Poker Smash
3747360	3749360	I don't know it makes me kind of think of columns
3749360	3751360	columns
3751360	3752360	columns
3752360	3753360	columns gave me an aneurysm
3753360	3755360	Poker Smash
3755360	3758360	kind of makes me think of I'm not buying it
3758360	3760360	haha
3760360	3762360	you know you're gonna get it for Nellie
3762360	3763360	no I'm not
3763360	3765360	you know Nellie's gonna get it behind your back
3765360	3766360	for points
3766360	3769360	she won't buy that game she's like I don't care
3769360	3770360	haha
3770360	3771360	I was teasing
3771360	3774360	no if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360
3774360	3778360	Nellie's gonna come in and go Xbox Smash
3778360	3780360	that's ok he'll rebuild it
3780360	3781360	yeah
3781360	3782360	it actually looks kind of cool
3782360	3784360	I'll make it work better
3784360	3786360	and if it doesn't work better that means I need more
3786360	3787360	it'll be the bionic 360
3787360	3788360	haha
3788360	3790360	it actually looks kind of cool
3790360	3793360	but honestly I just will play Puyo Puyo
3793360	3796360	see she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in
3796360	3797360	she doesn't know how to play poker and that's
3797360	3800360	I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever
3800360	3803360	but that will stop her from playing that game
3803360	3804360	ok
3804360	3807360	alright moving on
3807360	3810360	so there's actually been a little issues with
3810360	3814360	you know Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
3814360	3817360	you know and you might think at first it's because the name's too long
3817360	3818360	but you'd be wrong
3818360	3820360	it's actually because the game's too big
3820360	3826360	and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade
3826360	3831360	well of course you know those 1080p visuals are you know really big
3831360	3838360	and so they're having trouble you know fitting it in such a small size constraint there
3838360	3840360	oh darn
3840360	3844360	you know what it doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo
3844360	3846360	and slightly better
3846360	3848360	there may just not be enough room for Cammie's ass
3848360	3849360	they might just have to cut it out
3849360	3850360	I'm sorry to say
3850360	3852360	that would be Chinle's thighs
3852360	3855360	or how about I don't know let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway
3855360	3857360	since most everyone has a hard drive
3857360	3860360	and if you don't have a hard drive you don't get to play fucking arcade games
3860360	3861360	there you go
3861360	3862360	or how about just get rid of Balrog
3862360	3865360	I mean did anyone actually play Balrog?
3865360	3866360	anybody?
3866360	3868360	actually?
3868360	3870360	Tyson played Balrog
3870360	3872360	I don't think anyone did
3872360	3875360	I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it
3875360	3876360	so I have to think about who you're talking about
3876360	3878360	M. Bison, the boxer
3878360	3879360	yeah
3879360	3883360	actually he was pretty cool but I like Dudley better in 3
3883360	3885360	alright anyhow
3885360	3887360	guess what time it is folks
3887360	3891360	you know the party is almost over
3891360	3893360	and we're going to get to the classic game of the week
3893360	3895360	but we haven't done this in a little while
3895360	3899360	there hasn't been a story that has really coaxed us in this way
3899360	3901360	to give out another one of these
3901360	3902360	let me think of this last week
3905360	3907360	we're giving out a stupid award tonight
3909360	3911360	no last week we talked about this guy
3911360	3913360	but now the trial is going on
3913360	3916360	and so this is why this guy is going to win
3916360	3918360	a stupid award tonight
3920360	3922360	it's Tyrone Spellman is his name
3922360	3925360	and apparently he killed a baby
3925360	3928360	and what cost him to kill a baby?
3928360	3930360	well video games of course
3930360	3934360	if Aaliyah Truman
3934360	3936360	the assistant district attorney
3936360	3938360	is to be believed
3938360	3939360	he said that
3939360	3942360	Spellman's entire life and daily routine
3942360	3944360	is about playing Ghost Recon
3944360	3946360	what do you think someone with that kind of obsession
3946360	3948360	is going to do when it gets knocked over?
3948360	3950360	what do you think is going to happen?
3950360	3953360	the skull fractures on that baby or what happened?
3953360	3955360	so in other words
3955360	3957360	I know that's horrible first off
3957360	3959360	I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation
3959360	3961360	but what I think is so stupid about this
3961360	3962360	is that
3962360	3964360	yeah video games cost him to do it
3964360	3968360	no I think severe mental instability
3968360	3971360	of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it
3971360	3973360	like obviously he was not playing
3973360	3976360	with a full set of chips in his head
3976360	3977360	so
3977360	3979360	that's why we're giving out a stupid award
3979360	3981360	not only to the assistant district attorney
3981360	3983360	who's trying to jump to this conclusion
3983360	3985360	but the guy for killing a baby in the first place
3985360	3986360	I mean that's kind of stupid
3986360	3987360	like don't kill babies
3987360	3988360	I mean isn't it like
3988360	3990360	it doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up
3990360	3992360	like if he had a six pack in his head
3992360	3996360	it'd actually be empty except for one flat half drunk bottle
3996360	3999360	like do you even really need to be taught that growing up?
3999360	4001360	like do your parents really need to teach you like
4001360	4003360	hey don't kill babies
4003360	4004360	ever
4004360	4005360	I don't think so
4005360	4007360	I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in
4007360	4008360	you know what I mean?
4012360	4014360	problem is he wasn't playing mad
4015360	4016360	shut up
4016360	4017360	alright
4017360	4020360	anyhow before we go to the break
4020360	4022360	it's time to respect our elders a little bit
4022360	4026360	by paying tribute to the classic game of the week
4026360	4034360	Dark Sakura what is the classic video game of the week this week
4034360	4037360	that all the boys and girls should be playing out there
4037360	4039360	it's pure and utter awesomeness
4039360	4041360	it's Outrun
4041360	4044360	I love Outrun
4044360	4046360	Outrun is a game where you just drive a car
4046360	4049360	you make it sound so thrilling
4049360	4054360	well you've got a convertible and it's the guy and his blonde lady
4054360	4056360	just driving along and passing other drivers
4056360	4058360	but you get different forks in the path
4058360	4060360	different ways that you can take
4060360	4063360	and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen
4063360	4066360	or a 1971 Corvette
4066360	4068360	a 1985 Porsche 911
4068360	4071360	or a 1985 BMW
4071360	4074360	which I thought was pretty cool
4074360	4078360	but the whole I think fun part about it was that
4078360	4082360	it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car
4082360	4085360	and it had great music in it
4085360	4087360	I mean like what you're hearing right now
4087360	4089360	is the one I picked was Magical Sound Shower
4089360	4092360	which is like the best music in the game ever
4092360	4095360	I also named one of my horses a derby owner's club after it
4095360	4101360	it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier
4101360	4105360	and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D
4105360	4109360	where at the time 3D was just sort of like
4109360	4113360	what? we can do that? because they couldn't yet
4113360	4117360	so this I think is actually one of the games that opened up
4117360	4120360	a lot of the market for the
4120360	4123360	you know like we had our mode 7 games on the Super Nintendo
4123360	4124360	but I mean this was actually
4124360	4126360	I had this on Master System
4126360	4128360	wow that's pretty hardcore
4128360	4129360	yeah it's a pretty good game
4129360	4131360	were you able to actually play this on Master System?
4131360	4132360	yeah it's on Master System
4132360	4133360	interesting
4133360	4135360	it was very weird on Master System
4135360	4138360	and I do believe if I'm right there was
4138360	4141360	you know we got Afterburner and Space Harrier on the 32X
4141360	4144360	but in Japan there was a 32X release of this
4144360	4146360	that was pretty much arcade
4146360	4151360	I mean with this and Afterburner and Space Harrier
4151360	4154360	these were the arcade releases on the 32X
4154360	4158360	in fact you could even change some of them into arcade mode
4158360	4161360	but I think the other big part of this was just that
4161360	4163360	with the combination of
4163360	4165360	you know getting your choice of paths
4165360	4168360	or getting the music that you got
4168360	4171360	because you could actually change your music channel
4171360	4174360	and a lot of racing games now have that sort of option
4174360	4176360	for the music that you listen to as you play
4176360	4181360	and for the Genesis version
4181360	4186360	I actually had an extra bit of music in it too
4186360	4187360	but one that I liked
4187360	4190360	we had the arcade that I used to work at in Alabama
4190360	4196360	is Outrunners which was the two player Outrun
4196360	4199360	and it had a few differences to it
4199360	4203360	also for anyone else who is a big fan of Sega titles
4203360	4205360	Outrun has shown up in a bunch of other games
4205360	4209360	we've seen it in Shenmue 2
4209360	4212360	you can play it on Dreamcast in Shenmue 2
4212360	4216360	there's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance
4216360	4219360	the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation
4219360	4224360	it's actually in Outrun 2 as well
4224360	4230360	I don't know if anyone has actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out
4230360	4235360	but it was included in Arizona with updated versions of the original tracks
4235360	4236360	that were in it too
4236360	4238360	so I thought it was pretty cool
4238360	4241360	Outrun is one of those classics
4241360	4244360	I think that it should be the first
4244360	4249360	I'd have to say first racing game I think I've mentioned in the classic games
4249360	4253360	also it had an appearance in one of my favorite movies
4253360	4254360	What's that?
4254360	4255360	Donnie Darko
4255360	4256360	Nice
4256360	4260360	Some of the chat room folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision
4260360	4263360	Black Lab says Lucky and Wild greater than Outrun
4263360	4264360	I do not like that game
4264360	4267360	Orko says Lucky and Wild how I heart think
4267360	4269360	I have a bias against Lucky and Wild
4269360	4270360	What's that?
4270360	4272360	Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those
4272360	4274360	and I had to clean that sucker
4274360	4279360	Did people do nasty things in Lucky and Wild?
4279360	4281360	It was the drive and gun game
4281360	4285360	and people would break the gun controller
4285360	4288360	or leave their crap all in the thing
4288360	4290360	and no, it sucked
4290360	4293360	In another game I have a bias against the Suzuka 8-hour
4293360	4296360	because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom
4296360	4298360	when we had inspection
4298360	4301360	I do like hard driving though because I took a nap in one once
4301360	4304360	Anything else you want to say about Outrun, Jamie?
4304360	4305360	Outrun is great
4305360	4306360	Alright, check it out

4342360	4343360	I'm not dead in a ditch yet
4343360	4345360	It doesn't get much stranger than this
4345360	4347360	But if you lose match game, Mo
