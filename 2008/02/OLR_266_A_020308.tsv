13960	19046	Tonight, February 3rd, 2008, could the PlayStation 3 hard drive be getting even bigger?
19527	22970	New Animal Crossing and Kirby games are rumored for release this holiday.
23411	26094	And did Spore's release get pushed back yet again?
31465	36067	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36147	43929	We are that podcast on DARE Internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43949	45010	My name is Rob Roberts.
45050	49811	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Cuddly DarkSakura.
50471	50832	Hi.
51252	53632	She's not like her internet persona in real life.
53672	55013	She's actually very sweet, right?
56193	57494	If you add lots of sugar.
57754	58034	All right.
58726	60248	And how are you doing, Miss Sakura?
60288	61650	I'm frustrated with the mailbag.
61790	62551	I'm sorry to hear that.
62591	62751	Why?
62971	63872	What did the mailbag do to you?
64013	64894	It's being a bitch.
65054	65715	I'm sorry to hear that.
66275	66476	All right.
66516	69599	Also joining us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
70100	70400	Hello.
70741	73564	Eating McDonald's in traditional Loki fashion.
73644	76528	Hey, it's not for... Aren't you afraid of getting sweet and sour sauce on your laptop?
77249	77409	Nope.
77762	79223	You can lick it off.
79243	80484	That's right, you can lick it off.
80844	81424	Exactly.
81944	82945	I wouldn't do that.
82985	85566	Say hello as well to somebody brand new to our show.
85586	91049	And I've got to say, this is one of the bravest girls in the entire world because she has no idea who the F we are.
91189	95832	And she gets some email from us on YouTube saying, Hey, you're pretty cool.
95872	97373	You should come be on our program.
97693	99014	But she's a real good sport.
99054	99674	She's here tonight.
99734	100674	Give it up for Mo.
101415	102435	Hello, Interweb.
102596	103336	Why am I waving?
104326	105126	Why am I waving?
105227	105927	Why are you waving?
105947	108488	Because we do have an internet cam over there on JustinTV.
108748	112189	We might just want to get that mic a little closer to you so we make sure you get picked up on there.
112489	112949	But how are you?
113629	115110	I'm nervous, but super.
115450	115670	Yeah?
116010	116851	Why are you nervous?
116891	117991	There's nothing to be nervous about.
118331	118811	We don't bite.
119171	119371	Much.
119892	120452	I don't trust her.
120712	122272	You don't even trust our Sakura?
122452	123593	You've heard stories?
125282	126303	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
149468	150209	Hello, Interwebs.
150229	150569	How are you, Jake?
150589	151310	Getting thrashed by Snake.
176479	177180	All right, awesome.
177320	182906	And we're not going to be able to use this mic to talk to Jake, or I might smash over poor Moe's guitar, and that wouldn't be good.
183987	186509	And yes, we are taking a look at Smash Bros.
186610	188071	Brawl in Z-House.
188171	190293	Now, Loki, you imported a copy of Smash Bros.
190313	190594	Brawl.
190714	190914	Yes.
191214	194598	So this is something that we picked up.
195356	196356	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
224738	225518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
254477	263621	My gaming week was actually very not because the only thing that I could play without hurting myself was Ragnarok because it's just, you know, point and click, that type of thing.
265302	266623	So, yeah.
267243	268343	I didn't even play any pinball.
270684	271445	No pinball?
271685	272185	No pinball.
272265	272825	Oh, my gosh.
273306	273786	Same reason.
274046	274306	Wow.
274386	275447	Well, sorry to hear about that.
275507	278588	We hope you feel better soon and you're back into gaming and all that good stuff.
278688	280969	I did watch a lot of Burnout Paradise, though.
281269	281609	Very cool.
281629	282710	What did you think of what you saw?
283747	287449	I thought that I really, really, really, really, really, really like crashes.
288610	290931	And I like the super jumps.
291731	292211	Very cool.
292251	295893	Like the really long ones where you get the different angles.
295953	297434	And I'm like, Dukes of Hazzard, yo.
298635	299155	It was cool.
299355	299975	Good times.
300516	300836	All right.
301236	303277	Well, hopefully you'll be back up and running soon.
303297	307119	Your middle finger will be back in commission and you can flip people off and all that good stuff.
307139	311241	It's kind of funny because if I forget to wear my finger brace at night, I wake up in the morning all devil horns.
311762	312562	So it's not all bad.
314931	316412	She rolls out of bed ready to rock.
316973	318273	Yep.
318313	321135	And you know, if it were more fingers, it'd be too much metal for one hand.
322176	322556	Awesome.
323757	324097	All right.
324878	325838	Loki, we'll go over to you.
325878	326599	How was your gaming week?
326619	327399	Put down the controller.
327419	328460	My gaming week was fine.
328480	330801	You are not trying to do this and play at the same time.
330881	331442	You are not.
332402	333823	You can leave it alone for five seconds.
333943	334684	Hey, I'm not playing it.
334744	337225	I was setting up the game for me because it was set up to cheat.
338226	339067	So we were fixing it.
339287	339507	Fine.
340344	340744	The Red Bulls ones?
366485	372169	Yeah, he keeps beating my crashing ones, so I go through and specifically go and beat his.
372750	374091	He's not actually doing it on purpose.
374151	374351	I know.
374391	375111	We talked about it.
375372	375572	I know.
375892	380155	Well, the whole reason he did the road rules thing is because he wanted the gold signs, and that was it, and he wanted the car.
380776	386560	Yeah, well, I understand that, but I have to beat everybody on my friends list, so that's why I've been going through and doing that.
386620	388721	Well, if you tell him it's a competition, he will compete.
389562	390122	It was fun.
390943	391463	I love the game.
391503	394806	It's great, just crashing everything, which kind of gives me...
395419	398440	To my other topic here, I had another 360 die.
400000	400461	Three rings.
400741	403602	I brought it back to life four times and it's died four times.
403622	404822	Did you have to give it mouth to mouth?
405402	407763	No, I had to overheat it quite a few times.
407823	408303	Sounds hot.
409844	411744	This next time, though, it's not going to be pretty.
412324	415685	I'm going to be taking a heat gun to it about a thousand degrees.
417386	418606	It will work or it will melt.
419226	419807	One of the two.
419827	420927	Okay.
422071	423573	And then, let's see, what else did I get?
424114	427298	Oh, actually, I imported another game.
427939	430762	It's a game called... God, I don't remember what it's called now.
432065	437407	I was going to say, while you're thinking about that, for your Xbox 360, you know, Jake had a really good idea before the show for our soundboard.
437447	439948	Our soundboard's been giving us a little bit of problems this week.
439988	441709	It's like popping randomly in the left speaker.
442049	444570	So I apologize if some of that's coming across on the podcast feed.
444610	448771	It shouldn't be because our talking should overrule the popping in the left speaker.
449051	451492	But Jake has suggested that we give the soundboard a Viking funeral.
451812	453913	So perhaps we should do that to your Xbox 360.
454433	459375	We'll go to my neighbor's pool when she's not home, put it in a little floaty boat, set it on fire.
459775	461416	I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
461957	463278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
487529	490471	Anyways, I'm trying to remember what the hell that name of the game was.
491232	493894	Other things I've played other than that, of course, Smash Bros.
493954	494274	Brawl.
494935	496736	Just started playing a bit of that.
496756	499459	To be honest, I'm not very good at it.
500800	501540	But it's cool.
501901	502901	It's a really cool game.
504543	506744	Like I said, it's probably worth buying twice.
506885	511408	So definitely check it out if you can as soon as you can.
513870	516112	We've actually unlocked quite a few players.
516397	517258	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
544281	544841	Let's see.
545341	546001	What else did they play?
546021	546901	Rez HD.
547642	548942	Oh my god, is that awesome.
549982	552242	Playing that on a surround sound system?
553723	554083	Oh yeah.
554563	556263	That is some good stuff there.
557523	558443	Absolutely love that game.
559724	560064	Let's see.
560224	560344	Oh!
560844	563424	Now this is the game that I imported for the Game Boy Advance.
564044	565465	DotStream is the name of it.
565485	566905	It's one of the bit generation titles.
566945	567805	You race lines.
568345	569325	And it's actually pretty fun.
570186	571526	Cheap little titles like 20 bucks.
573784	575788	I'll have to show you, Rob, some of it a little bit later.
577130	579133	And that's pretty much it.
580074	580455	Awesome.
580715	582618	Well, sounds like you've had a very busy gaming week.
583399	583660	I try.
584059	587021	All right, well, I want to go to our guest, Mo, and see what Mo's been playing this week.
587262	591185	Now, Mo, you don't just do this YouTube thing and cover video game songs.
591205	592466	You do actually play video games.
592906	594127	You work in video games.
594467	595608	You're a gamer girl, right?
595628	596729	Yes, I am.
596749	598150	You sure are, so don't doubt it.
598190	599551	So what kind of games have you been playing this week?
600692	605576	I played a lot of Burnout because it's beautiful and there's nothing more entertaining than slamming into things.
606737	611321	I was playing Mass Effect until I realized that I can't read the subtitles on my crappy old TV.
612819	616480	which was very depressing because it looks awesome so far but I'm a really crappy shot.
619041	621701	And Team Fortress 2 because I live on that game.
622321	622601	Awesome.
623442	623922	Very cool.
624162	625042	So you've been very busy.
625262	631143	Yeah, I ended up having to install Orange Box onto my PC since somebody's borrowing my 360 copy still.
631263	631644	My bad.
632244	633464	He's better on PC.
635004	641786	No, actually the whole reason I installed Orange Box on my PC I don't know if I mentioned it before was that
642375	649264	I'm trying to extract the Sentry bot out of the game, the actual 3D model, because I want to make one.
650726	652928	Because I think that would be funny to have in my cubicle.
654010	656533	But I haven't gotten around to that yet.
657068	661169	Now, Mo, are you an Orange Box player on PC or Xbox 360?
661509	662509	I am a PC player.
662729	663429	Why is that?
663469	664630	You just prefer that?
664650	668831	You think it's more of a keyboard and mouse type game, or are you like, Xbox sucks, or what?
669171	669451	I have a 360.
669771	675712	I love my 360, but I cannot do shooters on console at all.
676732	677672	I'm a terrible shot.
677832	679433	I cannot play Halo for the life of me.
679693	680033	Gotcha.
680053	683674	So I have to boost my ego by going back to Team Fortress and destroying people.
683894	684254	All right.
684914	684994	Oh.
685919	700550	I forgot, I also played Crysis trying to beat the last level again because it's still glitching out on me and I can't beat it because goddamn commander or whoever stuck, you know, holding his arms out with a gun in his hand and won't trigger the last scene.
701611	703593	I really hate that game, at the end at least.
704113	706615	The rest of the game is awesome, it's just the end fucking sucks.
709932	710253	Seriously.
710494	710755	Alright.
711156	716773	Well, I'll talk a little bit about my gaming week and then Jake, do you think you can put down Smash Brothers for a minute to talk about your gaming week as soon as I'm done here?
717463	718404	He's giving me a pouty face.
719044	719405	Let's see.
720325	723328	My gaming week was pretty much Rez HD all freaking week.
723408	724128	I agree with Loki.
724168	728432	Rez HD is a beautiful game, and it's time for Rez to make a little bit of a comeback.
728992	731914	It was a little bit fuzzy on the PlayStation 2 and the Dreamcast.
731955	739881	Not that it was bad, but just to take it to that next level where you can play it in beautiful, beautiful HD and the sound system and everything.
739901	744985	It's just gorgeous, and it's probably the greatest rail shooter game like ever.
745820	750002	For real, I just love Rez, and it's a beautiful game, and the graphics are great.
750023	752544	I mean, it's only like 10 bucks, so it's a great deal.
752664	756926	I think it's probably the best Xbox Live Arcade game they've put out yet, honestly.
757387	758707	I'm totally in love with Rez HD.
758967	759708	That's really it.
759788	762329	Otherwise, I've been playing Warcraft still, because I'm a big nerd.
763050	771194	Sassy Pants, my level 70 character, who's awesome, and she now has a sister named Sassy Llama, who is a shaman.
771234	772255	I just made that, so...
772927	775508	If you don't know what that means, check Urban Dictionary.
775768	776288	So there you go.
778049	779770	Anyway, Loki, you've got to give Jake your mic.
779930	783551	Jake, now you're new to the program, right?
784251	786232	But you're a gamer too, right?
786252	787453	No, I'm not a gamer.
787473	790574	Yeah, you've just been attached to Smash Brothers for all night.
790954	791674	What kind of games do you play?
791694	792515	What have you been playing this week?
793335	795676	I was in Baltimore all week, so I've been playing Rock Band.
797397	798517	And lots of Rock Band.
799022	802390	and more Rock Band up until midnight on Wednesday.
802631	804174	What do you love so much about Rock Band?
806480	808604	Character creation, the party aspect.
809571	810592	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
836433	837374	It's less easy mode.
837414	840596	It's a little more... It's like WoW, only more difficult, as far as I can tell.
841216	843217	Deeper craft system, lots more race to choose from.
844078	845939	You can be a fairy in EverQuest 2, correct?
846259	847379	And a frog, and a rat.
847540	848200	That's pretty awesome.
848260	849241	And they added the dragons.
850661	850921	Cool.
851482	851862	What else?
851982	853603	What other MMOs have you been playing?
853871	857152	No, aside from WoW, Tabula Rasa I've been digging into since the beta.
857412	858373	Mm-hmm.
858753	868116	Describe for our listeners what Tabula Rasa's all about, because I'm not too familiar with this game outside of what you showed me, which wasn't a whole lot, so... Essentially, it's a third-person shooter MMO.
869117	873638	You go around, you blast aliens, instead of grinding on goblins and orcs and whatnot.
873979	883222	Would you say it's really unlike any other MMO out there, or is there something you can compare it to, or... There's not much you can compare it to, aside from, like, a tactical shooter, because you can actually use cover effectively, and... Mm-hmm.
885214	886915	It's hard to describe, though, as far as that goes.
887255	887675	Gotcha.
888216	888476	All right.
889236	890497	So you recommend all these games?
890537	893458	Do you think if somebody actually has the time to juggle three different MMOs, they should?
893859	894339	Definitely.
894419	894939	Now, wait a minute.
895219	898101	You play three different MMOs, but you do have a day job, right?
898821	899501	I think so.
899641	901022	And you do go outdoors once in a while?
901743	902143	I'm here.
902283	903383	So you break the stereotype?
903724	903964	Yes.
904184	904464	All right.
904584	904924	Excellent.
905224	906985	I'm glad to hear you have a healthy, balanced lifestyle.
907025	907405	That's great.
907605	907966	Doubtful.
908226	908466	All right.
909482	914884	Also, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to participate in the program tonight.
915144	917305	We'd love to hear what you guys have to say.
918045	923346	A lot of folks in chat talking about the Super Bowl, which is going on right now during our program.
924087	928948	Although I would think either you're probably watching the Super Bowl and all into that, or you came over here and watched this.
928968	934590	Although most of our listeners listen on the podcast anyway, so for most people, the Super Bowl is long past over.
935407	939248	SonOfDad says, Tabula Rasa already went clearance at my target.
939628	941849	So I guess Tabula Rasa's not selling too well.
942689	945210	I guess not a lot of people picked up on the innovation.
946390	953773	HitStun, praising RezHD, HitStun says, RezHD is awesome, and have a 360 and don't already have Rez, you'd be stupid not to pick this up.
954113	965016	I heard a lot of people were kind of passing on RezHD because they didn't have, or they already had a previous copy of Rez on PlayStation 2 or Dreamcast or whatever.
965754	969655	TigerClaw says, Sky, I bet you were dancing and pulling out your glow sticks while playing Rez HD.
970136	972637	Not quite, but I had to do the Transvibrator mode.
972937	982180	I almost looked up three different controllers for that, but I didn't have three different controllers at my house, so I tried just the controller I was playing with, and I was just kind of, eh.
982340	983040	Yeah, it's regular.
983240	992504	Well, I have the controller I was playing with, and then my wireless, so I put the wireless on my back, because that's what, you know, Tetsu Mizuguchi says to do, is you should put one towards your lower back, and it's actually kind of freaky.
994195	996336	But it's like a free back massage while you play video games.
996356	998277	So it was kind of cool and it's in time with the music.
998357	1000518	It's certainly an experience.
1001158	1001719	I'll say that.
1004720	1005220	Let's see.
1005941	1008742	Frisbee is not excited that there's Smash Bros.
1008782	1009703	Brawl in house.
1009723	1010523	He says, turn it off.
1010563	1013264	It's rude to play games that we non-importers don't have yet.
1014625	1015085	Sorry, dude.
1015165	1016106	I don't know what to tell you.
1017467	1018727	We really want to play, dude.
1019508	1021589	Blame Nintendo for not doing a worldwide release.
1021629	1022229	That's what I say.
1022898	1025439	It's alright, they wouldn't have had enough units to do it anyways.
1026119	1026359	Alright.
1026859	1028860	That's right, because they're having problems, aren't they?
1029400	1030180	They're a little short.
1030860	1031120	A little?
1033161	1048545	Well, actually, no, seriously, it is just a little short, because they only fulfill, I forget how much of it, not much, let me put like 20% of the pre-orders, but the rest are coming next week, so... So it's not as bad as when Zelda came out?
1048685	1049706	Yeah, it's not that bad.
1050386	1050586	I mean...
1051488	1054309	Every major Nintendo title has been short anyways.
1055490	1057111	Mario Galaxy was like that.
1057211	1057671	Zelda.
1058211	1060192	I'm sure Wii Fit when that comes over here.
1061693	1062313	Mario Kart.
1063814	1067656	And the only reason Mario Kart is going to be short is because it can't produce enough of those stupid steering wheels.
1067676	1072799	It would be something stupid and arbitrary that's holding the whole thing up.
1072979	1073279	I don't know.
1073689	1074450	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1100254	1100755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1120524	1122766	or how cold does it get at the South Pole?
1122826	1124067	That kind of stuff fascinates me.
1124147	1124868	It's fascinating.
1125428	1127029	How's Santa Claus doing at the North Pole?
1127090	1128391	You want to check on these things.
1128411	1131133	These are things that America wants to know as well as the rest of the world.
1131773	1132114	All right.
1133355	1133675	Let's see.
1133755	1136998	Portal Combat in our chat room says, I want Portal song now.
1137538	1140120	So apparently some of our chatters are getting impatient.
1140140	1141361	Hey, how does it feel to want?
1143043	1144124	You've got to wait.
1144604	1145605	Patience is a virtue.
1145625	1145805	All right.
1146098	1156444	And also, because we know Mo's a little bit nervous and, you know, is very brave of her to come to a complete stranger's house to be on his internet program, you know, we could have, like...
1156860	1158861	Hit her over the head with a shovel and buried her in the backyard.
1158901	1159421	She didn't know.
1160581	1161762	That's what I was afraid of.
1162242	1163122	She's very brave to come here.
1163382	1168564	So once we get past part A and the musical performance, we're going to celebrate a little bit during tonight's bonus segment.
1168965	1171706	So once the song is performed, there will be cake.
1171966	1176347	From the chat room, from the chat room, Glowbanja says, me want song two.
1176427	1177008	Do you know any blur?
1177028	1179749	I don't know.
1179769	1180549	Maybe I can do it.
1180669	1181189	I can wing it.
1182149	1182650	You actually do.
1183110	1186131	Now, you actually do other songs besides just...
1186830	1189651	I had to make a specific filter in my email just for all my YouTube comments.
1189691	1189792	Nice.
1211983	1212764	Congratulations.
1212804	1215626	That's pretty awesome to see somebody literally out of their bedroom.
1215986	1218749	I think that's why we wanted to reach out.
1218949	1220350	My room is such a mess.
1221331	1223313	No, because literally, where did this show start?
1223393	1226515	Out of my spare bedroom, and Loki and I lived together for a little while.
1226535	1228137	We were doing the show out of our living room.
1229998	1233301	I think we have a lot of respect for people who create something out of nothing.
1233421	1238706	People can see my drums from Rock Band behind me, and then the mess on my floor.
1238766	1240107	They can see my posters.
1241095	1251100	Well, next time you need to... Somebody here in the Justin TV chat, somebody was, I don't know, being a troll and said something about who decorated this place, an 11-year-old girl.
1251540	1256522	So, you know, people are critical of whatever decorations you got going on.
1257483	1261424	Because I'm so sure an 11-year-old girl would have the Cartman doll and a rainbow blanket.
1261885	1262945	I would have when I was 11.
1264166	1264506	Oh, maybe.
1265046	1267067	When I was 11, I think I had gremlins.
1267467	1267707	All right.
1267827	1269348	I think I had Legos.
1269721	1274845	All right, let's get to the gaming news, and then we can, I promise, we will get to the Portal song.
1274865	1278107	But we got to tease it a little bit and get some news out of the way first.
1278427	1279908	Also, just want to give some quick plugs.
1280489	1283851	If you don't know already, we have a live journal community at Orange Lounge.
1283871	1286033	We have a MySpace, myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1286473	1289815	And a Facebook community is there, too, if you search for the OL Army.
1290276	1291537	It is our Facebook community, too.
1291617	1293598	So social networking whores, that's us.
1294138	1296140	So check us out on those different websites.
1297000	1297520	That's that.
1297560	1298760	Let's get to the gaming news, Loki.
1299061	1307503	Alright, well, as we talked about last week, there's rumors going around that the 80GB PlayStation 3 system is being phased out.
1307983	1313804	And of course we know that's true with Best Buy, and it's also supposedly true with GameStop and EB.
1314324	1323506	Well, now there's another rumor to kind of go along with that rumor, and that is that there's going to be a new PlayStation 3 system, SKU, that's going to have a 120 to 160GB hard drive.
1327092	1331956	and it's going to come with a DualShock 3 controller, all for the same price point of $4.99.
1333898	1340884	And if you think about it, that makes perfect sense, seeing as the DualShock 3 controller is supposed to be over here in March anyways, right around the corner.
1342625	1353995	And, you know, it's kind of funny how we laughed before, like, you know, back when Kutaragi was talking about, oh yeah, we're going to, it's going to be like a PC, we're going to upgrade it, you know,
1355484	1357909	All the time, you know, it's going to be constantly changing.
1358290	1360895	And we're like, ah, that's stupid, you're an idiot.
1360995	1362258	And sure enough...
1362791	1365613	They keep upgrading it and it gets even more confusing.
1365674	1378084	So, like, you just get these bigger and bigger hard drives that you can put nothing on because there is nothing on the PlayStation 3 that uses that hard drive except a couple of games will install all their ships with the hard drive.
1378104	1378985	They're future-proofing it, okay?
1379105	1384089	Someday there'll be something on there and someday you'll need to fill the hard drive with that something.
1384109	1388052	When home finally comes out, it'll take up 90 gigs on your hard drive just to run.
1388213	1388533	That's right.
1388553	1389914	You're going to need room for all that SingStar.
1390094	1396398	In 2010, when Home finally comes out, you're going to need that 500 gig hard drive that will be out by then.
1396698	1397858	Yeah, who's going to say it?
1397878	1400160	For all the porn that people are going to be playing in their homes.
1402301	1402701	No.
1403782	1404042	Yes.
1404462	1404722	Yes.
1405323	1405683	Yes.
1407164	1409165	It's Studio 54 all over again.
1409585	1411826	Have you not done your homework, Loki?
1411906	1413807	The internet is for porn.
1415668	1416469	And for piracy.
1417489	1418370	Well, you can piracy your...
1418683	1419324	Pirate porn.
1419344	1419944	Pirate porn.
1419984	1420484	Hey.
1420605	1421445	There is a porn called Pirates.
1421465	1422106	There is a one called Pirates.
1422126	1423086	There is a porn called Pirates.
1423106	1425889	It was the highest produced, like, most expensive porn ever made.
1426149	1427210	One of our lesbians has it.
1427290	1428431	Hold on, hold on.
1428471	1428871	I've seen it.
1428911	1430272	It's actually pretty well produced.
1430833	1434976	Mo is apparently not only a YouTube celebrity, but she's a connoisseur of porn.
1434996	1436757	Apparently as well.
1437818	1439139	I hope to God my mom isn't watching this.
1439159	1440740	I know, I was like, your mom's not watching tonight, right?
1442061	1442602	Hi, mom.
1442642	1443242	Just kidding.
1444103	1445324	We're wacky internet people.
1445504	1447005	All right, we tell jokes.
1447626	1447846	Anyhow.
1448638	1449979	Anything else you want to say about the PlayStation?
1450379	1451099	About the PlayStation 3?
1452140	1453561	Stop making new SKUs!
1453621	1454521	It's confusing!
1454841	1458363	And all you're going to do is convince people, well, if I wait longer, it'll be better.
1458884	1461505	That's what they're going to get stuck doing.
1461525	1461845	Seriously.
1462105	1466968	How much do you want to bet this new SKU is just not going to have backwards compatibility whatsoever on it?
1467468	1467869	Just like the 40?
1468129	1469089	Yep, just like the 40.
1469650	1470930	They're just going to screw everybody.
1472691	1475413	They're also talking about an 80 gig with a different game, too.
1476133	1477574	Probably Lair, since it doesn't sell.
1478379	1479460	That would make sense.
1479520	1481321	Hooray!
1482302	1490288	Let's see, and SonOfDad says in chat.orange.com PlayStation 3, one year, five SKUs, no fucking games.
1491409	1492470	Hey, there's Uncharted.
1493891	1495992	Orko says porn is greater than cake.
1496793	1498614	I don't know, cake is pretty good.
1498915	1503438	Of course that brings Aisu and SakuraMax in unison to say the porn is a lie.
1505367	1509830	Actually, it was funny while I was half asleep this morning because I was supposed to be waiting for breakfast, but I wasn't.
1510650	1519075	Dan was talking to one of his buddies while playing Burnout Paradise about the difference between going online on the Xbox 360 as opposed to going online on the PlayStation 3.
1519775	1523437	How with Xbox 360, it's just part of the experience.
1524278	1524718	It's there.
1524898	1525638	Everybody's there.
1526499	1532462	He was talking about going online with SOCOM and saying how it was like filing your taxes.
1534205	1536408	You have to go through all these steps just to be able to do it.
1536529	1539693	So if you're going to be an online player, then having a PS3 isn't worth it.
1540634	1544820	You know, sometimes friend codes don't look so bad when you put all that in comparison.
1544880	1546763	I mean, it's like, you know, I don't know.
1548274	1554038	One thing that the PlayStation 2 will probably infamously be remembered for is Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
1554078	1560002	Of course, you remember that whole controversy with, you know, there was OMG sex was unlockable.
1560022	1564025	Speaking of porn, was unlockable within the game and, you know, it was a whole hot coffee mess.
1564785	1565526	Ugly sex.
1565646	1573932	If you may remember when we last left off, there was a settlement that was going to happen where you could actually replace your game and you could get some sort of, you know, severance.
1574619	1575120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1589938	1600146	The settlement will offer different levels of compensation depending on your proof that a violated buyer may have to offer.
1601186	1606110	So if you have an original copy of the game, you can get, of course, the replacement disc.
1606610	1611995	If you have the receipt with it, you can get a $35 cash payment as part of the settlement.
1612315	1614556	And if you have a credit card statement or check, you get $17.50.
1614596	1615377	If you get a disc, no receipt, $10.00.
1619759	1622901	If you have no receipt and no game, you can earn $5.
1623722	1625604	Sweet!
1626384	1626985	So here you go.
1627025	1641375	If you want to get a free $5 from Take-Two, all you have to do is promise under penalty of perjury that you purchased the game and you played the offending game and it raped your fragile mind.
1641435	1641796	I don't know.
1641836	1646199	You've got to just swear that the game did things to your mind you were not prepared for.
1646339	1647360	Some people enjoy that.
1648681	1651925	I'm looking forward to seeing how many people will do that just to get $5.
1652225	1654707	I mean, I don't know if it's worth it.
1655468	1656890	That is lunch at McDonald's for a day.
1656910	1661334	$5 will totally get me teriyaki.
1661895	1662376	Exactly.
1662656	1664037	Lunch on take two, everybody.
1664318	1665519	Lunch on take two this week.
1665999	1666380	Enjoy.
1668542	1670104	That would totally buy me some hot coffee.
1670164	1670464	You know.
1671690	1682853	You know, that $5 that you can get from, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it, you know, warped your freaking mind, that's $5 that you can put down on a new copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 when it comes out.
1683113	1683913	Exactly.
1684393	1685334	Pays for your pre-order.
1685874	1686654	Exactly.
1688834	1696977	Yeah, I wouldn't walk into your favorite game retail store to try and stake your claim to this because, you know, once you get the $5, you're going to say, you need to pre-order the new game, right?
1697017	1698497	No, I'm just kidding.
1700074	1702455	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.
1702475	1705016	Hopefully this is the last we will ever hear of the hot coffee scandal.
1705496	1706176	No, it won't be.
1706656	1711198	So in Gran Turismo, there's a hot coffee... No, I'm just kidding.
1711238	1717440	But speaking of Gran Turismo, there's a fun little bit that's out, though, for $40.
1717940	1719000	Like, I wouldn't pay for that.
1719080	1723702	But Gran Turismo 5 Prologue has an April 17th release date.
1724338	1733143	and it will have 60 cars and you will get like Nissan and Ferraris and Audis like you'd want an Audi and different levels.
1733263	1740448	I believe there's five tracks and you can either download it or pay for the disc and with the disc you get a special video.
1741568	1741948	Awesome.
1741968	1742829	You know what that means?
1742909	1747792	That means that you can buy a half done game for 30 bucks or 40 bucks and then guess what?
1748490	1751832	You can wait for the full game to come out, and then pay another $60, because you're a whore.
1751992	1753353	But wait, wait, wait.
1753633	1757775	You get a half-done game now, and then you get a 90% done game later.
1758315	1760736	And then they'll put out, like, special edition that's completely finished.
1760756	1764738	You'll have Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the sequel, which will be, like, almost done.
1764998	1766699	We swear, we're almost done with the game.
1766739	1768000	This is 60% done now.
1768020	1769501	Loki, you put it so eloquently.
1769541	1771342	You just have a way with words.
1771382	1772022	You know that, right?
1772282	1772542	I know.
1772562	1775624	I was going to say, this is a lot of crap for a game that's not really done.
1775724	1775924	But...
1776224	1777545	It's not that great anyways.
1778145	1779066	People are going to do it.
1779406	1781607	They're going to be like, oh my god, I have to have it.
1781787	1783168	I'm a consumer whore.
1783208	1785769	Or just wait for the full game to come out.
1786110	1788291	Because people don't know how to be patient.
1789391	1791112	Yeah, I guess I can't really talk about patience.
1792973	1794594	Do you have any weeds now?
1795855	1796215	No.
1800258	1800978	More news, please.
1802218	1805965	I agree, we need to get to the Portal song sooner rather than later because that means less talking from us.
1806646	1807107	Sorry.
1807779	1814581	And I actually meant, okay, now this story, I meant to get something to actually test this out on the show, but I was too lazy to stop by anyways.
1815161	1816421	Firmware 3.9 has come out.
1816461	1818762	Too lazy or too busy playing Smash Bros.
1818822	1819102	Brawl?
1819182	1819642	Too lazy.
1820842	1834886	So I was basically, because I was going to stop at GameStop and get a headset for my PSP so I can talk on Skype so we can test it during the show, but I figured, no, that'd be dumb, and I don't want to waste $20 on a headset when I will never, I'll never use Skype.
1834906	1836106	I apologize for ever asking about the story.
1836126	1836886	Is there anywhere to find the headsets?
1837401	1839422	It's really hard to find that.
1839502	1856313	Anyway, so, firmware 3.9 has come out for the PSP, and it does feature Skype if you have the PSP Slim, and two days later it was cracked, and is now available for everybody else like me.
1856973	1858954	So, hooray!
1860355	1861136	Way to go, Sony.
1861656	1863057	Keeping up with that security thing.
1865107	1869650	Now, does the crack still work off some type of exploit, or how exactly does that work?
1870491	1881698	They basically decrypt the whole firmware, and then they just modify it so you can install it on your PSP with homebrew support and other stuff like that.
1881718	1882238	All right.
1882638	1886941	So one more time, just to recap, the new PSP firmware came out this week.
1886981	1888842	It was promptly cracked two days later.
1889362	1890483	All right.
1893024	1916964	I always feel like every time we have a story about the firmware getting cracked, Sony comes out and says, nobody's ever going to crack this, this is the foolproof firmware, we've closed the loophole, no one's ever going to crack it, and then two days later... It gets even better, and I don't think this made the show roll, but they're finding a way now to inject the 1.5 firmware...
1920805	1921406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1942515	1942775	All right.
1943196	1949660	Well, if you're looking for more things to use your PSP for, pretty soon Flow is going to be coming out on the PSP.
1949700	1951901	You might know this game as the screensaver that you play.
1952702	1959066	This originally came out on the PlayStation Network, of course, and it will soon be coming out to the PSP.
1959146	1961748	This is according to Computer and Video Games.
1962408	1967311	The PSP version probably won't be changed much from the original PlayStation 3 version.
1968211	1972013	I'm trying to think, you know, how exactly do you mess with flow?
1972053	1976756	Do you give the game a plot or like an objective?
1977016	1977576	Eat stuff.
1977636	1978357	Become bigger.
1978737	1979197	Evolve.
1979997	1980438	That's right.
1980478	1982699	I forgot the instructions that the game gives you.
1982879	1983399	Eat stuff.
1984520	1984940	There you go.
1985988	1989890	Alright, well let's see what else is coming out soon from around the world.
1989910	1993551	We're going to take a minute to travel the globe and check out some release dates.
1994932	1995752	We'll start off with Jamie.
1996592	1997193	Yeah, me.
1997733	2002055	Well we have a few, actually quite a number of releases coming out in the UK.
2002195	2008097	On the 6th is Poker Smash on Xbox 360, which we will be discussing later.
2008995	2010735	On the 8th is where a bunch of stuff is coming out.
2010755	2037200	We have Agatha Christie and Then There Were None, An Arctic Tale, Art of Fighting Anthology, Cars Matter National, Conflict Denied Ops, Devil May Cry 4 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Final Fantasy 1 Anniversary Edition, Final Fantasy 2 Anniversary Edition, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Imagination Invades, Iridium Runners, Life Science Hospital Affairs, Mario and Sonic at the
2038331	2062298	Medal of Honor, Heroes 2, NFL Tour, Nitro Bike, PDC World Darts Championship 2008, oh fun, Pick Pick on DS, Professor Kageyama's Math Training, Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords, Showtime Championship Boxing, Speedball 2 Tournament, SpongeBob Atlanta SquarePants, okay, SquarePanta, sorry,
2063897	2066898	I just can't, I'm sorry.
2067199	2068519	I know, I was like, whatever.
2069519	2074121	The Club, which is on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
2074841	2075642	We have Turok.
2076302	2078603	Is that so people don't steal your 360, or what?
2079743	2080244	Yeah, Rob.
2080964	2083765	Because when you see them about to take it, you beat them with the club.
2084745	2085025	I see.
2087426	2087806	That's it.
2088267	2088647	Alright.
2089427	2092028	The US, there's quite a bit coming out as well.
2092920	2098386	The highlights for this week, of course, Devil May Cry 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2099407	2103130	Turok, that's on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
2103491	2107675	Although, if you're smart, you know that it's already out now, so you can pick it up anyways.
2108996	2111759	Assassin's Creed, Altair's Chronicles on the DS.
2112679	2114822	Sins of a Solar Empire on the PC.
2115942	2118424	Caldicep Saga on Xbox 360.
2118544	2119964	I'm actually excited about this game.
2120025	2122406	I'm one of those cultist Caldicep fans for some reason.
2122426	2123807	I played the Xbox 360 demo.
2123847	2124367	It's awesome.
2125148	2127729	Wow, that sounds like exciting.
2127749	2129390	Yeah, my phone was even excited.
2129430	2130071	It just went off.
2130611	2134593	Twisted Metal Head-On Extra Twisted Edition for PlayStation 2.
2135614	2137875	Space Force Captains on PC.
2138836	2143759	Downstream Panic on the PSP, which is kind of like a ripoff of LocoRoco when you look at it.
2145073	2151259	Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore coming out on 360, Wii, and PlayStation 2.
2152240	2153361	Not touching that game.
2154663	2155524	I thought it was awful.
2157425	2160449	Nobunaga's Ambition Rise to Power on PlayStation 2.
2160529	2166435	The Spider Chronicles on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PC, and the DS.
2167276	2169397	I think that's also coming out in the Wii at the same time, too.
2170257	2172598	Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS.
2173218	2175779	My Horse and Me on the Wii and the DS.
2175919	2176559	Hooray!
2177540	2181461	And, let's see, Medieval 2 Total War, the Gold Pack.
2182181	2194786	And one other thing, the, well, we weren't sure if it was coming out, but, you know, that Cobalt Blue and Black DS finally confirmed to be coming out on the 10th now.
2195721	2197863	Because you didn't know that three weeks ago.
2198003	2199504	No, you didn't know that three weeks ago.
2199805	2212075	And to kind of go along with that, Professor Layton and the Curious Village on the DS, which is hot shit right now in Japan, but I don't know what the draw is, but great.
2212535	2218620	And then Puppy Palace on DS, because there's just not enough puppy-raising sims, my god.
2219501	2222864	And what other fun stuff here?
2224815	2228616	I'm sorry, I had to read Merv Griffin's crosswords on the PC.
2229876	2230296	Wow.
2230577	2232137	Isn't that like a game show now or something?
2232577	2233157	I guess.
2234158	2235798	Why do they have him hosting anything?
2235818	2236498	That's just weird.
2237158	2243600	Well, Merv Griffin's kind of dead, so he can't host much right now unless it's... Crosswords.
2243640	2244860	Zombie crosswords, yes.
2245881	2246341	I don't know.
2246421	2250742	He could be like a computer reanimation, because that's sort of what I think happened to John Madden.
2251420	2256404	I don't think Merv Griffin died that long ago, so this might be in the too soon category, so we need to be careful.
2257785	2262108	There might be some listeners out there who are still traumatized by the whole thing.
2262388	2262768	Okay.
2264930	2265450	Okay.
2267231	2267692	Sure.
2269193	2269833	Exactly.
2270494	2273636	Dick Clark should be dead and worse is justice.
2273696	2276278	Can't you tell his contract with the devil already ran wore out?
2278753	2279714	It happened very quickly.
2279754	2280354	Here's what it is.
2280654	2284237	Dick Clark is seriously the inspiration for that movie Final Destination.
2284517	2286538	He has dodged death so many times.
2287179	2290300	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game chat.
2292102	2292562	I'm done.
2292602	2293002	That's it.
2293062	2294443	That's all that's coming out this week.
2295384	2297085	All right, let's move over then to the...
2298187	2300948	Xbox 360 Japanese release dates.
2301028	2304608	Our friends in Japan will be playing Battle Stations Midway when it comes out on February 7, 2008.
2305048	2307309	Or not, because they may not buy it.
2307369	2307669	I don't know.
2308389	2313350	Also on the PlayStation 3 coming out, Transformers The Game finally makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
2313370	2314050	We're all sorry.
2314310	2316891	And Loki gives that its highest recommendation, by the way.
2317851	2326853	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, I don't know, Major Nelson might have some competition because the Wii's getting a game called Major Wii, Najiro Gyro Ball.
2327629	2330631	So... Major we.
2332572	2333533	Major we.
2334754	2336235	If you want to get your major we on.
2336255	2337175	Oh my god, we.
2337335	2337916	How old are we?
2338116	2339557	Usually after I watch a movie.
2340253	2340953	Thanks for watching!
2360600	2363241	and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword killing zombies.
2363301	2364082	What more do you need?
2364782	2365182	I'm sold.
2365562	2367403	This sounds like it could be the greatest game ever made.
2368104	2369564	How have we not heard more about this?
2369684	2370705	This was supposed to be on the 360.
2371125	2373826	This was like the other game that they made other than Earth Defense Force 2017.
2373866	2375627	Can you get your waggle on with that?
2375787	2376288	Oh, yeah.
2377028	2377928	I will be getting this game.
2377968	2378369	Don't worry.
2378449	2380029	Are you going to get that and a major Wii?
2380790	2381410	And a major Wii.
2381490	2381790	All right.
2382150	2383391	I'll get a major Wii for everybody.
2390246	2391508	How does that say?
2391548	2394713	You know, if I were you, I would have almost been hoping for the shovel at this point.
2396196	2398640	I think this is still better than being dead in a dish somewhere.
2398680	2399561	That's probably true.
2399862	2401484	Well, hey, wait, Loki, don't go anywhere.
2401845	2405070	Coming out on the PlayStation 2 in Japan this week.
2405720	2409701	Now, I know you've imported Smash Brothers, so you might be getting this too.
2410441	2413882	It's the fifth entry in a long-running series on the PlayStation 2.
2414282	2415762	That's right, Loki's favorite.
2416202	2420243	Princess Maker 5 makes its way to Japan this week.
2422183	2423164	That's not my favorite.
2423184	2425184	I have Princess Maker 2 on PC.
2425204	2427825	Unless it's a pornographic game, in which case I may like it.
2428625	2430065	Loki will make a princess out of you yet.
2430784	2431185	You know what?
2431245	2431545	That's it.
2431565	2434948	I'm going to get Princess Maker 2 again, and I'm going to make Orange Lounge Radio the RPG.
2435308	2435829	That'll be fun.
2436629	2437270	It'll be very fun.
2438131	2440973	For those of you guys that are fans of Pachinko, hey.
2441314	2442314	Oh, okay.
2443395	2444937	There's some fun Pachinko now.
2444957	2446858	They have Parodius Pachinko, and it's awesome.
2446919	2450482	Sanyo Pachinko Paradise 13 is getting a price reduction.
2450522	2450842	It's only $20.
2450942	2452243	Well, thank God.
2452283	2453504	I was waiting for that.
2456087	2457528	On the Nintendo DS.
2458235	2462819	L, the prologue to Death Note comes out on the DS this week.
2462979	2463560	Do what?
2464240	2472447	Also coming out, Pato Tokyuru Indosukagu Drill comes out as well on the DS, and I have no idea what that is.
2472487	2475070	It sounds like Mr. Driller's bastard cousin.
2475090	2476291	I'm not sure what that is.
2477692	2480414	Oh, it's like a quiz, that kind of drill.
2481335	2482356	It's another brain training game.
2483417	2483737	Never mind.
2484440	2488002	So it's not the bastard cousin of Dig Dug and Mr. Driller, their love child.
2488903	2491845	Let's see real quickly if there's anything coming out on the PSP you might care about.
2491905	2495607	Hey, Coded Soul comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.
2495847	2501550	And Mobile Suit Gundam Giren no Yabu comes out this week from Bandai.
2502211	2503311	So check that out.
2503512	2509835	I remember back in the day when the thought of a new Gundam game was exciting.
2509895	2512297	Now it's just like, I have to stop.
2515310	2518771	Alright, let's get back into some news, and then we will have ourselves a performance.
2518971	2519791	What about news?
2522492	2524452	Anyways... Well, I have some news.
2525092	2526293	I have related news.
2527033	2532354	It's very special, because EA is obviously very special, and special by any short bus.
2533795	2537216	EA is going to be splitting the components of the Orange Box.
2538076	2538736	Dun-dun-dun.
2539640	2551507	So there will be a PC and Xbox 360 release in October, and a PS3 release afterwards, but it'll be just a separate Half-Life, Episode 2 portal, and a separate Team Fortress.
2552428	2557811	And they've already been there for download for a while, but there's going to be individual box copies on the way.
2558151	2567297	And I hope they're cheap, because, I mean, if you can buy, you know, the Orange Box New for $60, and it's all this stuff, they should make these, like...
2567842	2569602	No more than 15, 20 bucks a piece.
2569702	2570223	That'll probably be 20.
2571383	2577744	And... No one will buy, like, Episode 2 or... Everyone will just buy Portal.
2578004	2579604	Yeah, Portal and Team Fortress 2.
2580045	2580305	Yeah.
2580785	2589527	I don't know, see, when we got my copy, see, all I cared about was Portal at the time, but Dan really, really got into Half-Life 2, Episode 2.
2590587	2591507	He was all over that.
2596201	2596601	Hi!
2597362	2598463	Sorry, I had to run out for a minute.
2598863	2600244	I'm okay.
2600465	2601385	He had a major wee.
2601465	2601866	That's right.
2602086	2604728	I had a major wee brewing.
2604768	2608251	Because I didn't want to miss our performance, so I ran out during the last story there.
2609792	2613635	Now that you've shared that with the entire internet, can we move on with another gaming story, please?
2613676	2614776	We are not afraid to go there.
2615237	2621122	I know this is going to come as a big surprise to everybody, but Val's talking about making more Portal games.
2621302	2622563	Yay!
2622643	2624845	That's so surprising.
2625678	2626739	Shock and Awe!
2653399	2655761	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2683244	2684225	I hope so.
2685827	2687348	If they aren't, I'll be really bitter.
2687768	2688048	All right.
2688589	2688949	That's all right.
2689209	2690110	We have the podcast.
2690130	2692252	You can always share it with your friends.
2692272	2693673	I've been pimping it to them all weekend.
2693693	2694934	If they don't listen, I'm going to be bitter.
2695154	2695375	All right.
2695395	2699678	Well, I'm sure that if you're in chat, say hello or something so we can pass on your well wishes to Mo.
2703098	2707862	Um, so you just, you just, you heard the song, your friends kind of dared you to do it effectively.
2708042	2708223	Yes.
2708423	2710304	And, uh, then you're on YouTube and now you're here.
2710324	2712887	Jake, the one and only Jake, actually, how did you find her?
2712927	2714288	Yeah, how did you find me?
2714308	2715549	I don't remember.
2716249	2719072	I think I was looking, I think someone went.
2719432	2720793	Can we, can we get him on the mic real quick?
2720953	2722775	Sorry, Jake, you gotta talk on the mic or we can't hear you.
2724475	2725135	Thanks for watching!
2747305	2747926	Here she is.
2748266	2749727	Are you about ready for this?
2749747	2752990	We're going to have to situate a little differently because we're ghetto and we don't have a lot of hookups there.
2753010	2757393	So I'm just going to kind of sit by you here while you do this.
2757573	2760656	I'm going to ask you guys to turn your mics off so we don't get a lot of background noise in here.
2761316	2765240	But this is a first for us and she's kind of a guinea pig, our first musical guest.
2765940	2767802	But it's going to be awesome, right?
2768302	2769263	It's going to be slightly...
2769690	2770391	This was a triumph
2795959	2811586	I'm making a no-tier huge success It's hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture science
2814321	2842061	We do what we must because we can For the good in all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you run out of cake And the science gets done And you make a neat gun For the people who are still alive
2844758	2871830	I'm not even angry I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire
2874433	2897322	As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you Now these points of data make a beautiful line And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned For the people who are still alive
2909099	2931344	I think I'd prefer to stay inside Maybe I'll find someone else to help you Maybe Black Mesa That was a joke, haha, fat chance
2935250	2961138	This cake is great, it's so delicious and moist Look at me still talking when there's science to do When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you I've experiments to run, there is research to be done On the people who are still alive And believe me I am still alive
2962138	2986968	I'm doing science and I'm still alive I feel fantastic and I'm still alive While you're dying I'll be still alive And when you're dead I will be still alive Still alive, still alive Give it up everybody for Vo!
2988061	2989942	Also known as Amixi on YouTube with her cover.
2990222	2992503	I was looking in the chat room and everyone's totally into it.
2992523	2993784	It was great.
2994585	2996566	We've had virtual lighters.
2996726	2997246	You know what?
2997306	2998667	What does it say about mistakes?
3000108	3001949	Take a chance on mistakes, whatever that is.
3002769	3003129	Who cares?
3003630	3004130	It was beautiful.
3004250	3006091	You just keep on trying until you run out of cake.
3006511	3006932	That's right.
3007852	3009514	And there will be cake, and it's not alive.
3009574	3010195	So very nice.
3010455	3018302	And we have some clapping in the chat room, and HitStun says it would win a cage match, our little musical thing we do after the show where they pick good songs.
3018342	3019103	So very nice.
3019523	3023306	So now you're going to have to learn something else and come back again sometime.
3023707	3032915	Yes, I happened to watch another one of her YouTubes, actually, which I laughed at because she said Rick Ashley is never going to give you up.
3034045	3034265	All right.
3048567	3054731	So lots and lots of clapping there in chat, and thank you very much for being a guinea pig and being our very first musical guest.
3054751	3058793	That went pretty well, except for the fact I kind of had to hold that, and I think I accidentally bumped her hand in one part.
3058853	3061374	I kept smacking the mic, and I'm like, shit.
3061455	3063436	No, but it came out really good, so very exciting.
3063596	3063856	All right.
3064478	3065139	On the Ellen Show.
3093680	3095184	Guitar Hero Aerosmith Guitar Hero 4
3100805	3101505	in October.
3102725	3105326	Guitar Hero On Tour is supposed to be coming to Nintendo DS.
3105346	3106746	That's going to make its way in June.
3107126	3110687	And supposedly, there is a fourth title being planned.
3111447	3115448	It's an action-packed Guitar Hero experience like no other.
3115848	3118429	So apparently it's some other type of Guitar Hero game.
3118849	3126731	In other words, it's basically taking a lovely, well-established, loved franchise and pooping on it with this game.
3127111	3130994	Well, if there's four games in one year, that's already pooping on it, I think.
3131074	3131795	I mean, seriously.
3132616	3137460	By the way, those rumors are coming from SurferGirl via GoNintendo.com.
3137540	3140042	And SurferGirl is usually pretty accurate with a lot of this stuff.
3142364	3143004	Not surprised.
3143084	3144225	I'm not surprised about the three of them.
3144445	3147027	And that makes sense with the Aerosmith one coming out in July.
3147408	3150970	Since that's when Rock the 80s came out last year.
3150991	3152171	Rock the 80s.
3152191	3152252	And...
3154850	3157372	I don't know, they need to do something like, remember Fret and Ice?
3157712	3162374	They could do something like that, action-packed guitar game, you know, where you actually do a side-scrolling game.
3163495	3166157	But I think this is going to suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.
3167878	3170459	I love when Loki reviews games without actually playing them.
3172080	3172520	It sucked.
3172861	3174862	That's like reviewing a movie based on the trailer.
3174922	3181126	I'm sorry, but if you release four games, like, okay, DDR, for example...
3182136	3182617	Thanks for watching!
3189560	3193383	I don't know, at least one really good game set, four really mediocre games.
3193623	3195565	Have you ever heard of the saying, too much of a good thing?
3196006	3197046	Yeah, exactly.
3197687	3201390	Gerardimo asks in chat, is it finally Guitar Hero with WoW characters now?
3201430	3206674	Because the whole Activision Blizzard thing, you know, rock out to your, you know, torn shaman and all that stuff.
3206695	3210538	Do we get hoochie dancing night elves and headbanging in bed?
3210818	3212740	You might see some of that stuff, but here's the thing...
3214045	3218408	I don't know how much music in WoW you can actually turn into a rock version.
3218428	3222970	I'm sure you'll see something like that in there because they like doing weird crossover things.
3223471	3224071	You never know.
3224371	3229434	Look, if the Halo 3 song came up as a download for Guitar Hero 3, anything is possible.
3229454	3232136	I'm very disappointed that I've not seen anything like that for rock bands.
3232256	3233517	I want some free songs, okay?
3233857	3235858	I understand the three songs a week that have to pay for.
3235878	3236379	Or Journey.
3237619	3238320	Or Journey.
3238360	3241982	They need more gag songs because just Timmy and Lords of the Underworld just isn't enough.
3242600	3244941	There needs to be more gag music in there.
3244961	3247001	We need more lols in our rock band.
3247101	3249342	We need Avril Lavigne's girlfriend on there.
3250943	3251783	I would own on that.
3251823	3254584	Like Chocolate Rain, the heavy metal mix or something like that.
3254644	3254724	Yes!
3255224	3256924	Hey, they managed to put Freeze Pop in there.
3256964	3258765	Chocolate Rain!
3259985	3260865	Well, you know what?
3260885	3263066	Moe maybe should write them and get still alive in there.
3263906	3265767	We need more stuff from the kinda long-haired band.
3267763	3270346	See, now, Still Alive... Spinal Tap?
3270387	3271167	Spinal Tap.
3271187	3278697	I was going to say, Still Alive could make it into Rock Band since EA publishes both games, so maybe.
3280160	3280580	Interesting.
3280681	3281301	EA, you listening?
3281321	3284123	I don't know if they're going to because it's kind of more of a mellow song.
3284444	3285865	Although, I mean, there's maps and stuff.
3285885	3287586	They've got plenty of mellow stuff in there.
3287747	3290028	Well, part of my iron lung is mellow.
3291169	3292631	No, we need more Radiohead.
3292791	3296514	And the chat room would like me to kick you for bringing up Chocolate Rain, Loki.
3296594	3297715	So here you go, a little kick.
3297875	3298075	Kick!
3298556	3299877	Chocolate Rain is great.
3299937	3300697	It's amazing.
3301738	3303440	That guy's voice is just intense.
3305612	3309095	Intense is a good way to describe it.
3309255	3310736	Let's move on with some more news.
3311637	3319023	Well, for our Sega fans, there is a PC game due out in the fall that's called Space Siege.
3319984	3324467	That is an action RPG with different types of gameplay.
3324547	3330112	We have a robotic partner that you can customize, and you have online co-op, up to four people.
3331013	3335036	But they're actually talking about a rumor that it's going to have a console release, too.
3338244	3342305	They're actually saying that they are not going to rule out a console release.
3342965	3345106	They are considering it as an option.
3348067	3356410	I think they're also saying it's pretty cool that they're mentioning that as far as the gameplay of it itself, that it's actually going to be something that isn't impossible.
3358690	3360491	The PC releases in September.
3361192	3364374	So wait, it'll be a good Sega game in the past few years, hopefully?
3364834	3365454	I hope so.
3365474	3367135	Sega needs to really redeem themselves.
3367455	3368896	Or they need to bring out Planet Harrier.
3369136	3372458	I don't have very good hopes for this, actually.
3372698	3381422	If I remember correctly, Space Siege is actually a new series in the Dungeon Siege games.
3381562	3385624	So basically, you know, like a dungeon crawler, but now it's a space crawler, I guess.
3386525	3388526	And, you know...
3389341	3392883	No offense, I'm sure Dungeon Seed is awesome, it's just, we bull-ruined that for me.
3393444	3393904	I'm sorry.
3395045	3398567	I think of that, and I'm actually having flashbacks to PSO.
3398647	3401589	Because he'll do a sequel to In the Name of the King, and it'll be in space.
3401929	3405391	And it'll have the same damn characters and make no sense whatsoever.
3405871	3406511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3429924	3430565	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3452057	3461205	and so that would almost get me to play except my whole problem wasn't with the universe itself as much as it was with how they changed the way the classes handled.
3462025	3465348	I'm almost going to log in just to see if it's any better than when I first played it.
3465388	3467350	She said they brought back Mags.
3467650	3468110	That's hot.
3468150	3468731	I love Mags.
3469491	3471073	I miss my Master System Mag.
3471773	3472734	And my Opa Opa.
3472874	3474856	We've got to keep it moving or we're never going to end this show.
3476057	3476157	Ah.
3476787	3488267	So, I don't know if anyone remembers the Old Spice Challenge that was on the Xbox 360, I think last year, where you could, you know, earn, you know,
3489033	3492035	Such wonderful games as Contra and, oh, guess what?
3492215	3497519	Fusion Frenzy 2, which I don't know if it's more of a reward or punishment.
3498080	3498560	Punishment.
3499401	3505445	Anyways, so you can win some new stuff this time, although it's a little bit different this time around.
3505465	3511990	Instead of actually competing just against a set number, you're competing against your friends, and you can win such things as, say...
3513444	3521131	$20 Best Buy gift card, an Xbox 360 HD DVD player since now they're probably going to clear those things out since Blu-rays kind of went in there.
3521871	3525414	And some other stuff, you know, maybe Fusion Frenzy 2 all over again.
3525494	3525834	Who knows?
3526495	3536503	But, yeah, so if you're interested in that, they've actually got some more information on 360voice.com slash challenges.
3536643	3537504	You can check it out.
3538024	3539365	A bunch of different things you can win.
3539385	3540746	I don't know.
3543840	3545681	I just have a... I really don't care.
3545701	3549943	I'm kind of done with the whole EP and achievement points thing.
3549983	3550724	It's kind of done.
3550984	3557047	I realize there's many people out there that have scores that are so sadly high, it's just never... you're never going to catch up.
3557107	3557527	So I don't know.
3557547	3560309	I'm kind of done with the whole achievement point competition thing.
3560769	3561589	It's a little old to me.
3561749	3562570	I mean, I guess there's still...
3563343	3564384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3591451	3592612	Big Mac Challenge.
3593493	3593993	I don't know.
3594113	3595634	Maybe you win some Big Macs or something.
3597916	3599557	Clearance copies of Sneak King.
3599617	3599957	I don't know.
3601414	3611141	Anyhow, some games may be coming out very soon for you to help inflate your gamer score a little more, because Lord knows you Achievement Point whores love more arcade games to inflate your score.
3611481	3614103	But these might be ones you are not going to mind playing at all.
3614723	3625631	Apparently, Microsoft's PressFTP site was logged into by someone who apparently should not have been in there, because they've released these screenshots of Conker Live and Reloaded and Jade Empire.
3625931	3629654	Those screenshots are apparently lurking on Microsoft's press FTP site.
3630034	3634738	It indicates that the games could be coming to Xbox Live Marketplace very soon.
3635839	3636799	So there you have it there.
3637280	3641403	Now, of course, they're going to be added to the Xbox original lineup.
3642143	3646987	So come to think of it, I guess you really won't be able to use them for achievement points because you can't use the original games.
3647067	3650850	I'm not interested until they put a Jet Set Radio feature on there or something like that.
3652470	3658753	If it's anything like the other games that are in the Xbox Live Originals, 1,200 MS points or 15 bucks to play these games.
3659214	3661975	Or go buy it used for probably even cheaper than that.
3662495	3667338	I hear especially with Jade Empire, those games are ones that people love.
3668922	3669382	There you have it.
3669743	3672204	Looks like we have the results everyone was waiting for.
3672744	3673085	What's that?
3673405	3674305	To the big game.
3674746	3675226	Oh, what game?
3675867	3677047	The Puppy Bowl, Corgi one.
3677468	3677608	Oh.
3678028	3678468	Yes.
3678648	3679409	Go team Corgi.
3679629	3680449	Good job.
3680550	3684532	Okay, all these DS, pet raising sims, and no Puppy Bowl games.
3684712	3686033	I mean, come on.
3686093	3687654	They totally need the Puppy Bowl.
3687794	3692237	Which I'm sorry to say that the Shih Tzu was denied a perfect season once again.
3692397	3694679	Sorry to all the Shih Tzu fans out there in the house.
3694999	3696720	Corgis are great and they're smart.
3697000	3697560	All right, forget it.
3697600	3698661	With their little mutated feet.
3698721	3699861	I love their little feet.
3701022	3704223	I've been telling my husband I want a corgi, and he's like, no, you have a cat.
3704523	3706344	See, proof that inbreeding can be awesome.
3706884	3708224	Well, they have cats out yet, too.
3708244	3708625	Midget cats.
3708645	3709605	No, but they're so horrible.
3709625	3710765	It feels so bad for them.
3710965	3712206	Do you love video games?
3712346	3712726	Hey!
3712966	3714267	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
3714307	3715967	We talk about video games nonstop.
3716167	3717488	You know who should have won Puppy Bowl?
3717508	3719389	This is the puppy and kitty tangent.
3720669	3721449	Hey, guess what, Rob?
3721489	3722190	More Xbox Live.
3722330	3722650	What?
3723337	3726219	CeilingCat is watching you deviate from the video game stories.
3729300	3745509	Anyway, game coming out for Xbox Live Arcade next week by Void Star Creations, as I've mentioned previously when doing the UK releases, is Poker Smash, which is like, I guess, Tetris with poker things?
3745769	3746769	Poker Smash!
3747630	3749771	I don't know, it makes me kind of think of Columns.
3751232	3751692	Columns.
3752062	3753603	Columns gave me an aneurysm.
3753623	3754584	Columns smash!
3755464	3757766	Kind of makes me think of, I'm not buying it.
3760728	3762169	You know you're going to get it for Nelly.
3762510	3763290	No, I'm not.
3763670	3765251	You know Nelly's going to get it behind your back.
3765271	3766552	For points.
3766773	3767653	She won't buy that game.
3767693	3768694	She's like, I don't care.
3770195	3771476	I don't either.
3771516	3776840	No, if Loki keeps spending too much money on the Xbox 360, Nelly's going to come in and go, Xbox smash!
3778941	3780142	That's okay, he'll rebuild it.
3781003	3781203	Yeah.
3781812	3783993	I'll make it work better.
3784693	3787275	If it doesn't work better, that means I need more heat.
3788555	3793278	It actually looks kind of cool, but honestly, I just will play Puyo Puyo.
3793698	3796339	See, she wouldn't touch this game because it has poker involved in it.
3796359	3797460	She doesn't know how to play poker.
3798020	3802762	I know that has probably no bearing on the game whatsoever, but that will stop her from playing that game.
3803563	3803903	Okay.
3804883	3805724	Alright, moving on.
3807874	3813836	So, there's actually been a little issues with, you know, Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
3814756	3818377	You know, and you might think at first it's because the name's too long, but you'd be wrong.
3818737	3826080	It's actually because the game's too big, and apparently it's having trouble fitting into the 150 megabyte download limit that's on Live Arcade.
3827000	3836683	Well, of course, you know, those 1080p visuals are, you know, really big, and so they're having trouble, you know, fitting it in such a small size, uh,
3837332	3837973	Constraint there.
3839736	3840297	Oh, darn.
3840857	3841258	You know what?
3841278	3844463	It doesn't really matter because the game's just going to be Street Fighter 2 Turbo.
3846506	3848629	There may just not be enough room for Cammy's ass.
3848689	3849791	They might just have to cut it out.
3850152	3850773	I'm sorry to say.
3850973	3852075	That would be Chin-Li's thighs.
3852947	3860690	or how about, I don't know, let's just get rid of this stupid limit anyway since most everyone has a hard drive and if you don't have a hard drive, you don't get to play fucking arcade games.
3860710	3861090	There you go.
3861130	3862830	Or how about just get rid of Balrog?
3862991	3865751	I mean, did anyone actually play Balrog?
3865932	3866272	Anybody?
3867292	3867652	Actually?
3869793	3870833	Tyson played Balrog.
3870853	3871934	I don't think anyone did.
3872574	3876995	I get confused because we have a lot of import versions of it so I have to think about who you're talking about.
3877015	3878336	M. Bison, the boxer.
3878476	3878696	Yeah.
3880337	3882618	Actually, he was pretty cool, but I liked Dudley better in 3.
3882698	3885379	We're giving out a stupid award tonight.
3909272	3913919	No, last week we talked about this guy, but now the trial's going on.
3914479	3918745	And so this is why this guy is going to win a stupid award tonight.
3920728	3925134	It's Tyrone Spellman is his name, and apparently he killed a baby.
3925795	3925935	And...
3927054	3928495	What caused him to kill a baby?
3928875	3930257	Well, video games, of course.
3930537	3938263	If the, uh, Aaliyah Truman, or Tourman, the assistant district attorney, is to be believed.
3938863	3944047	He said that Spellman's entire life and daily routine is about playing Ghost Recon.
3944607	3948591	What do you think someone with that kind of obsession is going to do when it gets knocked over?
3948951	3950072	What do you think is going to happen?
3950512	3952994	The skull fractures on that baby, or what happened?
3954463	3957044	So, in other words, I know that's horrible, first off.
3957084	3959525	I mean, I'm not trying to make light of this horrific situation.
3959845	3964626	But what I think is so stupid about this is that, yeah, video games caused him to do it.
3965867	3971669	No, I think severe mental instability of the highest caliber is what caused this guy to do it.
3971749	3976651	Like, obviously he was not playing with a full set of chips in his head.
3977211	3979972	So, that's why we're giving out a stupid award.
3980032	3983813	Not only to the assistant district attorney who's trying to jump to this conclusion...
3984552	3987134	But the guy for killing a baby in the first place, I mean, that's kind of stupid.
3987194	3988054	Like, don't kill babies.
3988115	3991337	I mean, isn't it, like... It doesn't just sound like he was a little messed up.
3991377	3996780	Like, if he had a six-pack in his head, it'd actually be empty except for one flat half-drunk bottle.
3997100	3999782	Like, do you even really need to be taught that growing up?
3999842	4003444	Like, do your parents really need to teach you, like, hey, don't kill babies.
4003925	4004145	Ever.
4004565	4005406	I don't think so.
4005446	4008187	I think most of us kind of fundamentally have that programmed in.
4008267	4008788	You know what I mean?
4010609	4013771	So... The problem is he wasn't playing Madden.
4015501	4017802	It's pure and utter awesomeness.
4017822	4018202	It's Outrun!
4018342	4019122	I love Outrun.
4045111	4046812	Outrun is a game where you just drive a car.
4048334	4049554	You make it sound so thrilling.
4049995	4064766	Well, you've got a convertible, and it's the guy and his blonde lady just driving along and passing other drivers, but you get different forks in the path, different ways that you can take, and you can drive either a 1972 Volkswagen or a 1971 Corvette, a 1985 Porsche 911, or a 1985 BMW, which I thought was pretty cool.
4075282	4082704	But the whole, I think, fun part about it was that it had this nice custom cabinet that looked like the car.
4083464	4085125	And it had great music in it.
4085945	4087306	I mean, like we're hearing right now.
4088146	4092227	The one I picked was Magical Sound Shower, which is like the best music in the game ever.
4092627	4096128	I also named one of my horses in Derby Owner's Club after it.
4097369	4104471	But this is, it was in that family with Afterburner and Space Harrier and Power Drift that had the scaling 2D
4105792	4107713	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
4128669	4129810	Yeah, it's a pretty good game.
4129830	4131731	Were you able to actually play this on Master System?
4131812	4132792	Yeah, it's on Master System.
4133313	4133633	Interesting.
4159190	4169153	But I think the other big part of this was just that with the combination of getting your choice of paths or getting the music that you got.
4169173	4171934	Because you could actually change your music channel.
4172334	4176335	And a lot of racing games now have that sort of option for the music that you listen to as you play.
4178495	4183737	And for the Genesis version, it actually had an extra...
4185339	4186040	Outrun, Shenmue 2
4210925	4212446	You can play it on the Dreamcast and Shenmue too.
4213527	4219251	There's actually a version on the Game Boy Advance in the Sega Arcade Gallery compilation.
4221572	4223834	It's actually in Outrun 2 as well.
4225575	4236462	I don't know if anyone's actually played that Outrun 2006 that came out, but it was included in Arizona's with updated versions of the original tracks that were in it too.
4237022	4237863	So I thought it was pretty cool.
4239176	4239797	Donnie Darko
4256979	4259981	Some of the chatroom folks are slightly disagreeing with your decision.
4260241	4263082	Black Lab says, Lucky and Wild, greater than Outrun.
4263463	4264563	I do not like that game.
4264583	4266784	Orko says, ah, Lucky and Wild, how I heart they.
4266884	4268965	I have a bias against Lucky and Wild.
4269226	4269766	What's that?
4269826	4273308	Because I worked in another arcade that had one of those, and I had to clean that sucker.
4275068	4275889	Did people like...
4277681	4279063	Do nasty things in the Lucky Wild Machine.
4279083	4281325	Because it was the drive and gun game.
4281705	4287311	And people would, like, break the gun controller or leave their crap all in the thing.
4288172	4289553	And, no, it sucked.
4289974	4293397	And another game I have a bias against is Suzuka 8-Hour.
4293817	4297041	Because I've had to clean one of those bikes from top to bottom when we got inspection.
4298602	4298902	Alright.
4299163	4301265	I do like hard driving, though, because I took a nap in one once.
4301937	4304578	Alright, anything else you want to say about OutRun, Jamie?
4304838	4305578	OutRun is great.
4305858	4306838	Alright, check it out.
4306878	4309399	Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, is OutRun.
4309819	4314620	Available on the arcades, just about every Sega system ever made as well.
4315020	4315540	So check it out.
4316220	4319481	And probably the PC as well, and hell, some Nintendo systems too.
4319621	4320842	OutRun 2006 was PC.
4321162	4321602	There you go.
4322082	4322602	So check it out.
4323502	4330604	That's going to do it here for Orange Lounge Radio Part A, but we'll be back in just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B. And tonight, boys and girls...
4331357	4333859	It's been a little while, but we're going to have the match game tonight.
4333920	4334720	That's right, it's been a little while.
4334740	4336942	We're going to play some match game tonight as long as we have some guests here.
4336962	4338584	Mo, you're going to stay with us for Part B, right?
4338644	4339105	Sure.
4339225	4341527	Why not hang out with the strangers from the internet a little more?
4341567	4342047	It'll be fun.
4342067	4343008	I'm not dead in a ditch yet.
4343169	4345191	It doesn't get much stranger than this.
4345211	4347793	But if you lose match game, Mo, that's it.
4347813	4348093	I might be.
4348294	4348674	That's it.
4350416	4352698	And Jake, you're going to play some match game with us too as well, right?
4353467	4355828	But the stakes in tonight's match game are very high.
4355848	4356388	You know why?
4356989	4362151	Because, and it's not for us here in studio, but for the listeners that will be playing, we're going to give away something.
4362171	4362431	That's right.
4362451	4368174	We're giving away a code for Rez HD on the Xbox 360 as the prize tonight in the match game.
4368454	4375377	And that comes to you courtesy of an OLR listener out of the kindness of their heart is donating this prize tonight for the match game.
4375397	4382240	I'll tell you more about it when we come back for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. In the meantime, we're going to take a little break and we'll see you in a little while.
4382880	4387846	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4388307	4392632	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
