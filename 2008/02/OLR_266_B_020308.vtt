00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 3rd of 2008.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
The Super Bowl and the Puppy Bowl have just finished up and so we're getting more and more live listeners coming on.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Which is a good thing because tonight we're going to play a little round of the Match Game.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
That's right, it's your chance to match the stars here in the OLR studio for fabulous prizes.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
And when I say fabulous prizes I mean a copy of Res HD is what we're giving away tonight.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
That's right, one of our listeners, ActDeft, one of our friends from Mexico, actually listens to the program and he won a code.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
But the problem was he already bought the game so he has no use for the code.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
So we're going to pay it forward tonight.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
One of our OLR listeners is going to pass on the code to our winner tonight of the Match Game.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
So thank you ActDeft, everybody say it with me.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you ActDeft.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Alright, so we're going to be giving that away a little later in the show.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
But before we do that, we have got to get back into some gaming news and Loki's going to kick it off tonight.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
Alright, anyways, there's two big games that they announced on Nintendo's reports for 2008.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
Not a huge surprise though, that Animal Crossing and the new Kirby gamer will be coming to the Wii in 2008.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Most likely though, it's only the Japanese Wii in 2008.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Maybe shortly after in 2009 we'll see Animal Crossing here.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Hopefully though, I would hope it's this year as well.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
But no word on exactly what the new Animal Crossing game is going to be like.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
But at least there's a listing for it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Some other games that were also listed on there.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
Wii Music, Disaster Day of Crisis, Super Mario Stadium, Baseball, and everyone's common knowledge television.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Which I'm assuming is not coming over here.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
And it also shows Mario Kart Wii still expected for Spring in North America and Quarter 2 for Europe.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
So do we know anything more about that Animal Crossing on the Wii?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Is it actually going to be an MMO or anything?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
No idea.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So all we just kind of know is it's coming soon.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes, and I would imagine keep your expectations low.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Because if you're expecting an MMO from Nintendo, I mean come on, they'll embrace online really.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Good point, good point.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
But you know, I do love my Animal Crossing, so I'm hopeful.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Let's just leave it that way, I'm hopeful.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Alright, well if Animal Crossing and Kirby don't do it for...

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Actually, let me backtrack a little bit because I know Dark Soccer, you're a big Animal Crossing fan.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
If Nintendo happens to be listening right now, what do you hope that they implement in the next Animal Crossing game on the Wii?

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I would actually like to see...

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
And maybe this is a little bit odd, but I'd like to see a character be able to be the mayor, I think, of the town.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Instead of having, you know, everything be the Tom Nook conglomerate,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I would like to see you be able to control development of the town.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
You know, new shops, new things, you know, sort of expand the whole thing that makes a town work.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So like a promotion.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
A way to promote, get a job and promote up so you're just not Tom Nook's bitch the whole time.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Kind of?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, I guess so, you know...

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
I want the ability to put Tom Nook out of work and put him on the street.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Make him do bitch work for me.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Make him sleep with the fishes.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yes.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Are you a big fan of Animal Crossing, Mo?

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
I actually have issues with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon. They're too boring.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
How about Kirby? Are you a fan of Kirby?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I do like Kirby.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
What do you hope they put in the next Kirby game?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, if it's going on the Wii, they should do something like Canvas Curse.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Because Canvas Curse was so awesome.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Canvas Curse was pretty fun.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
That would be a good thing to have on the Wii.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, it's funny because the Wii is like a bunch of DS games, kind of.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
You have, what, Trauma Center, Cookin' Mama.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Some of those games should have stayed on the DS, like Cookin' Mama.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Cookin' Mama was pretty bad on the Wii.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It was pretty bad on the Wii.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
All right, anyhow, if none of those games are for you, perhaps this will be a game that you will like.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Because it's coming from the creators of Parappa the Rappa.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And yeah, it's another music-based game on the Wii.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It's not Wii music, it's something else.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's called Major Minor's Majestic March.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
That's right, it's Major Minor Majestic March.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
It's coming from designer Masuyama Tsura and artist Rodney Greenblatt.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
And what you're going to be doing in the game, you use the Wii Remote to keep tempo.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It's a marching band game.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So what you do, you get new band members.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
That's high school.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
You get valuable items.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You go to eight different locations.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
You get up to 15 instruments, and it will have 25 popular marching band songs in it.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So that's going to be pretty awesome.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I know I was a band geek in high school, so this kind of tickles the nerve for me.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
What about you, Dark Soccer? Are you excited about this?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I was never the band major, the drum major.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I see, but it would still be fun.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
It's from the guys who did Parappa.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I would say that since it's the...

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I honestly don't think that they could do anything wrong.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, I don't know. We did get the baby level of Unjamma Lamy.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I love the baby level in Unjamma Lamy.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I miss the hell level.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
You didn't get hell.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Son of Dad in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrady.com, says,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I wanted Unjamma Lamy 2 on the Wii.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Amen to that.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Amen to that. I agree.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Dude, imagine Unjamma Lamy using the...

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, you remember the arcade version?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Very, very... I know I played it once, and the machine was made for little girls,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
so I had to get on my knees to play the game.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Get your minds out of the gutter, kids.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
But they should have something that works with the Guitar Hero set up

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
and do an Unjamma Lamy.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Maybe.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
How about... Were you a band nerd, Mo?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I wasn't a band nerd. I was a theater geek.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You were a theater geek? Oh, okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I was the AV nerd and the theater geek.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Do you think this game might still appeal to you?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
It'd be fun.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It'd be fun.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I could wave my hands around like a tard again.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Most Wii games, it'll be fun for an hour and then sell it back.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Probably.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Probably.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
How about you, Loki? Are you excited about Major Minors?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
No.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I have no interest in this game.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Then let's go to the next story.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, for our soccer fans...

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Actually, well, I'm sure there's plenty of soccer fans in the UK.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
As in real football.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I have my own bias.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Electronic Arts, though, is saying that they are not releasing

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
UEFA Euro 2008 on Wii NDS in Europe.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
At all.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So, I mean, they pretty much have the market, I think,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
because they had FIFA 08 last year,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
but they're not bringing out the other one.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm like, okay, why?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
If they've already brought out one game, why do you need the other?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
There's a big difference between them, so...

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
But I guess it'd be people who'd be disappointed that it's not coming out over there.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Really sad.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Especially since it's, you know, Euro 2008.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I know, I was gonna say, I find it ironic that a game called Euro 2008

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
is not coming out in Europe.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, am I the only one that sees the humor in that?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, they're just not bringing down the Wii NDS.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It's not...

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Of the two soccer games that EA puts out, it's the lesser of the two.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I know it doesn't sell very well over here, that's for sure.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Well, fine, Debbie Downer.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, I'm sorry, no one likes obscure soccer games, apparently.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
They'll just play FIFA if they, you know, want to play FIFA, and then...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't know, it's just like...

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
EA tries to put all these weird ones out there, like arena football, or rugby, and stuff like that.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Hey, don't knock the rugby game.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Hey, I'm sure in their respective areas, they're good, but...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
No one buys them.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Or at least not that many people buy them.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
All right.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Well, maybe one of these new games will prove you wrong, but we'll see.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Maybe. Maybe this game will prove us wrong.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Eternity's Child.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
It's a game that was originally designed to come out on the Xbox 360,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
as part of the XNA program,

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
but now they've been ported over to the WiiWare service that's still not out yet.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
But it is scheduled sometime Q2 2008.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
It will set you back 500 Wii points,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
so it's nice to see that there will be some more inexpensive games on the WiiWare service.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Actually, it looks pretty cool.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
It's all hand-drawn by cartoonist Luke Bernard,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
and a pretty cool-looking platform game.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Hopefully, we'll hear more about the WiiWare service in a couple weeks during Game Developers Conference.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm guessing that's when they're going to drop the bomb on that.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I was going to say, WiiWare should have been out pretty...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
We thought it was going to come out late last year.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Didn't happen.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
So, it should be coming out sooner rather than later, right?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I would think so.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I hope so.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, perhaps they're just too busy putting out all these other games

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
that they apparently keep missing production for and all this stuff,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
but the demand's just out there,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and if you don't believe me, listen to this.

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
Japan apparently sold a half-million copies of Smash Bros. Brawl in one day.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Those numbers coming from a Japanese blog, amiibo.jp,

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
apparently has reported that Brawl is the fastest-selling Wii title.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
It sold through 80% of its initial stock, and that was 500,000 copies.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
And now everybody's wondering, is it going to match that in the U.S.?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I think so.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Mo, I know you work in game shops, so you take pre-orders for this stuff.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Does it look like it's going to smash records left and right?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Jesus Christ, yes.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Honesty, I like it.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Japan has a smaller market than the U.S. does anyways,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
and that's not even counting Europe, too.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
They'll easily sell 500,000 copies in one day.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
I wouldn't be surprised if it sells a million copies in the first day.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, how many people in America actually own Wiis, though?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
It could be done.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
That would be about one in eight.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
It's still more and more selling as this date approaches in March, too.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Do you think you could top Halo?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
No.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Day one, probably not, but overall I think so.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Overall, maybe, yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I think it might top Halo 3, but not Halo 2.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't know. Halo 3 was pretty huge.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
We'll see.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, I mean, in the long run.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
In the long run.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
It doesn't matter.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Every game's going to be Grand Theft Auto Force, bitch, anyway.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Doesn't matter.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Whatever.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
They can have their Smash Bros. Brawl.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's all about Grand Theft Auto IV around the PlayStation 3 and 3.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Good point.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
What do you think, Dark Saga, is every game going to be Grand Theft Auto's bitch?

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Honestly, yeah, because you know the whole drama that came up over the whole hot coffee thing,

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
I think that was, you know, they said there's no such thing as bad press.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, how many copies of, you know, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sold just because of the drama over that, do you think?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
A lot.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
You know, how many people now do you think are going to be, oh, what's this one going to do?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
What's going to be the new thing?

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, I think that honestly it is going to sort of overplay.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't know.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I hope not, but I'm pretty sure it will.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, look how amazing Grand Theft Auto 3 was when it came out.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It was just absolutely awesome.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
I took a day off of work to play that game, by the way, as I will with 4.

11:49.000 --> 11:59.000
But it was just completely blew everyone away just because it was so, I don't know, unlike anything that they've seen before.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Of course, you know, moving from 2 to 3, that was a huge step.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
It's like, you know, Final Fantasy VI to VII, so I don't know.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
They'll be big.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I took off a week of school to play Final Fantasy VI.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Final Fantasy VI is pretty epic.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
You would need like a whole week off of work, though, when that game first came out.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
I pretended I had the flu.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news and things we might call in sick for in the future.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know that I'd be calling in sick for this if I can.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
There we go.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Stupid Firefox.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
Nintendo has registered a patent for a casing for Wii Remote.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
And it is quoted as saying, a video game controller for video game and receptor assembly.

12:44.000 --> 12:52.000
A receptor having a shape substantially similar to a component appearing in the video game.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
The receptor may be a gun-shaped subunit, is what it also says.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
But there's a drawing that was included with it.

12:59.000 --> 13:07.000
And they're actually, in fact, I'm pulling up the drawing right now.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
God, I hate this thing.

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, some of the drawings that they had were like the original Zapper prototype that we had seen, you know, E3.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And then a lot of them were just ridiculous.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, they were included in that, a tennis racket, a baseball bat, and a fishing rod.

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
But there's also a bicycle, a helmet, and a chair, and a teddy bear, and a headset.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
A teddy bear?

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, I'm pulling up the drawings now just to see everything else that was on there.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Unfortunately, Acrobat is slow.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
There we go.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah, DarkTits2U in our chatroom at chat.org.com exclaims what some of us are saying.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Are they really considering doing some of those?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I mean, a teddy bear?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Some of those are just, what the fuck?

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
I think it's kind of stupid for them to even try to patent, you know, putting, you know, like a tennis racket or fishing rod controller.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
They've already got them out there for the Wii.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
They're a little late to the game, just like they were with the whole Zapper attachment and stuff for the, you know, the Wii,

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
and also the Wii Wheel that's going to be coming out with Mario Kart, which is completely retarded, but whatever.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I guess people want that crap.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
It doesn't make a game any better.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
They have to go really into detail as far as these patents go, I guess.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Immediately throw away that wheel when it comes with Mario Kart.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Out the window it will go.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
Okay, there's the one on here for the wheel, and the one that looks like the Zapper, which is sort of cool, but the helmet one?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I'm sorry, we've had virtual reality helmets for Nintendo before.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
They're trying to give us all migraines again.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
You know, I still haven't forgiven them for the Virtual Boy.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
The chair is kind of cool, but they have one also that looks like it's trying to remake the Power Glove.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Cool!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Oh dear God.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's so bad.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
There is, the racket one makes sense to me.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
There's a skateboard one on here too.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
But the bike is like, what are they going to do, bring us Prop Cycle?

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
Interesting thought from Alpha Canogram in chat says it's to prevent others from creating crap to ruin the Wii, but it didn't work.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
But they've already, that's the thing though.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
If this was to prevent other people from making this crap, they're a little late.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
They already have this stuff out there.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
You can't patent something after it's already been out.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
I guess maybe you can, but you know, it doesn't make any sense.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Alright, well let's move on.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
I know really they should be threatened by putting a Wiimote in a teddy bear.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Hey, I would do it.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It's dumb.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
What, is it for like some teddy bear hugging game?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
It's so I can hug them and squeeze them and love them?

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
It's the baby shaking game, you see, but they can't use a baby, so they have like a teddy bear.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I see.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You can shake the teddy bear all you want to.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Kill teddy rock spin the game.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
You know, they are, and I have to, this is coming out sometime soon, within the next few months.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
They are bringing the Build-a-Bear workshop to the Wii instead of just the DS.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
So you can create virtual bears.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
You can do it on the DS already.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Why didn't I pay 80 bucks a piece?

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
But do you still have to do the little dance with your hands in the air and the spinning and the...

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I didn't do that.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
At least I can do it in the privacy of my own home.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So here's another bright idea.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Apparently someone thought it was an awesome idea to bring out Saw the game.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
At least they're going to be bringing it out to consoles in 2009.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
Let's hope the series is still around in 2009 because the way it's going, I don't know.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
They'll be up to like Saw 12 by that point.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
If they still do, I don't know if the Rider Strike impacted them, but if they maintain one a year, they should be up to Saw 6.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Because there should be Saw 5 this year.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh my gosh.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
That's true.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
People write Saw.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I thought it was just monkeys at a typewriter.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Monkeys at a typewriter.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Someone just dropped a lot of acid and then wrote it all down and filled it up.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
This game is going to have some really unique features about it.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
First off, it's going to be using the Unreal 3 engine because no other game on the face of the earth ever uses the Unreal 3 engine.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Okay, I've got to ask right off the bat, is this like a rumor?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
No.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
That seems like fan service or something to me.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
No, this is...

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
Brash Entertainment has made an announcement that they're going to make an interactive Saw game.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Is it going to be like Manhunt and get banned everywhere?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And even worse than Manhunt somehow?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Where's he on the Wii? That's what I want to know.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
No, it's just going to be PlayStation 3 and 360.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
And here's the other thing though.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm thinking they're going to try to build off the controversy of Manhunt 2.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
Of course, 2009 people will forget about Manhunt 2, I think.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Alright, this game is so wrong on so many levels.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I did a story on Manhunt 2 last week and I've already forgotten about it.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
Because A, obviously people are totally...

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
They look at video games and movies in complete different ways when obviously they shouldn't.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I mean, the Saw franchise is just as gory as Manhunt 2 and all that.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
And this is just going to continue to give video games a bad name and fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courts.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
That's what we call...

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Rhymes with...

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
...Ompson.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That's what we call him as Lord Voldemort.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
He who shall not be named.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
This will just fuel Lord Voldemort's fire in the courtroom.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
This will just be more things for the politicians to get rah rah rah rambly about.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
So we are giving a preemptive F.U. to the creators of this game because this is just a bad idea.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
To make a bad video game out of a bad franchise.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And that means we have to bring in the F.U.'s of the week.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
The first of my F.U.'s of the week, because I have had a pretty crazy week.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Goes towards needles.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
And I'm not really afraid of needles because I don't know.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I'm just really not afraid of needles anymore.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
But this is a really big freaking needle.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I got a cortisone shot in my hand.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
And it actually wasn't that bad because my regular doctor is really cool and lets me watch.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
The other doctor wouldn't let me watch.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
He was mean.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But then my hand hurt for a couple of days and I couldn't play anything.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
And then I have to go to an orthopedist next week.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
And I'm a little bit antsy about surgery because I've only ever had surgery once in my life.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And that was wisdom teeth.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And you know how long I was messed up after that?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Four months.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
So, F.U. to my stupid tendons.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Alright, Loki, do you have any F.U.'s of the week you'd like to give out?

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, my F.U. of the week is Microsoft making the shoddy system of the Xbox 360.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I'm tired of having to fix this stupid three ring system.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
It's really pissing me off because what I have to do to fix it, in other words take a heat gun to it,

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
involves me pulling off the heat sink and then I heat it up and do all that stuff.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I have to put foil around it so it looks like I'm actually cooking the thing.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
And then after that works I have to put everything back together, reapply the thermal grease and that kind of stuff.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Only to have it not work after that.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Then I have to take it all apart again and do it.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I've been doing this at work, by the way.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
So, have all the parts strewn all across the conference room table.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
But this last time this better fucking work because I am getting really fed up with it.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
The other system I fixed works perfectly.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
This one is being a little bitch and won't fucking work.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
So, fuck Microsoft because there's no reason that I should have two systems die anyway.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
My F.U. of the week goes to Insomnia because I've had it most of the week and I think it was causing me to get sick.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
But I'd like to counteractively give a thank you of the week to Airborne because vitamin C is awesome and made me not get totally sick.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
So, that was great.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
But F.U. to lack of sleep and getting sick.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Mo, I don't know if you're familiar with this segment.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you have anything you'd like to just say F.U. to on the air?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The fact that I still suck at Halo 3.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Amen to that. I will never get first person shooters. I just never will.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Console, I can't do it. Give me a keyboard and a mouse, god damn it.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
Maybe just some people weren't built to play console shooters. I don't know what it is.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
I can get the running down and I can get the shooting down, but if you want me to point, I'm screwed.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Just use the caboose method. Let everyone else kill each other off.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
No, they all know that I'm the weaker player, so everyone picks me off in multiplayer.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Ah.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Don't.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
Jake, I know you're busy with Smash Brothers Brawl, but do you have anything you'd like to give an F.U. to? Anything that's making you angry?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Amazingly, no.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Well, aren't you F.U. to you for being so perky?

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
That's a cool thing about this game is you can actually pause it and then rotate around and take snapshots.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
By the way, for those who weren't listening to the bonus segment, we are playing Smash Brothers Brawl here in studio.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Jake's walking us through the game here and you can watch the action on our Justin.TV feed, which should be archived.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm sure somebody will make a highlight out of it. It's Justin.TV slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to check it out.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
But not for much longer. We're going to be pointing the camera back on the studio very soon.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Black Lab in chat says we need more studio view on cam and less Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
All right, soon. Soon, I promise. Maybe after a couple more matches.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
All right, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Let's get back into the gaming news.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
And this almost makes me want to bring on the F.U.s of the week again, because I'm so ready for this game.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You know Spore?

22:38.000 --> 22:51.000
Well apparently now, during an EA conference call, the CEO of EA, John Riccitello, told the audience that Spore will not be making fiscal 08.

22:51.000 --> 22:58.000
But will it be making calendar year 08 at all? Or will it be actually pushed back to 2009?

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And still within the 2009 fiscal year, but literally like a year from now.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
While the CEO was not going to give a specific date, it does seem confident that the game will be out before the holidays.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
But that could be like December 24th.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
In fact, actually it could be after Christmas because it could be like Kwanzaa he's talking about as the holidays.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
You just don't know.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
It could be Chinese New Year. That's right. It could be January. Who knows?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It could be July 4th. That's still a holiday.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
That's right. Of 2009.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
Who knows? But I don't like hearing that Spore keeps getting delayed because I'm so ready for this game to come out.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I think he celebrates sleep year as a holiday, so he's referring to next sleep year.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I agree.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Alright, well let's get back to some other gaming news.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Why do you have some happy in regards to nights?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Thank God, we need it.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I love you Sega.

23:49.000 --> 24:01.000
They're having different, I would have to say, celebrations that go on every month as far as different content in the game.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
In fact, they say that you use the Wii Weather Channel to change the weather.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
This is another bit of additional hidden content.

24:09.000 --> 24:19.000
So you basically raise your own A life and the hidden content will let you have different monthly celebrations since it's going by the Wii's time clock.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
So in January, they have of course the New Year with fireworks.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
In February, they have the Chinese New Year.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
So they have a big dragon hanging out and firecrackers and stuff.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
In March, it's carnivals and the people in the game will have masks on.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
In April is flamenco inspired roses.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
May is the boys festival, which is a Japanese holiday.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So that's May 5th.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
And there's a big carp streamer hanging in it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
June is weddings.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
July is the bull running festival.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
In August, all the residents in the game are going to be playing instruments.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
September has full moon paper fans.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
October is the Halloween theme with witches and pumpkin lanterns and stuff like that.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
November is autumn leaves falling and fruit.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000
And December is Santa and the Christmas tree and all kinds of Christmasy stuff.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Christmas nights.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Christmas nights, yeah I know.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I love Christmas nights.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I wonder if this is going to actually break my household tradition.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Because you've never said that on the show before that you love Christmas nights.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
I think every week Jamie finds a reason to bring up Christmas nights.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Hey, happy 4th of July everybody.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm going to play Christmas nights this December.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
Ever since I moved to California, every Christmas we break out the Saturn and we play Christmas nights.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
She's having to tell the story to Moe because she's like, oh, Moe maybe hasn't heard this before.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
You just like telling the story. It's okay.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
It's fun.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It is fun.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I like Christmas nights.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Traditions are good.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Traditions are good.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
I did have to borrow my French Japanese copy of Christmas nights.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
It's exactly the same.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It just gets a nice hard case and not a paper case.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh no.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I was curious.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
This sounds like a fun way to at least pop in the game once a month and kind of check it out.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
See what's going on.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Right?

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
I still think it's a cool thing but what if they have different things to happen over different years.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
You know something that could be updated in the game.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
You never know.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
You know remember like Animal Crossing had all the funny stuff that happened on holidays and it gave you a reason to turn on the game.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Like even New Year's Eve.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
I haven't played in six months.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Say it's New Year's.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
Or if you don't want to wait a year long just mess with your time clock and then you can see all these within like an hour.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
That's the spirit.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Whatever cheater.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
I'm not cheating.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm exploiting time.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
It's exploitation.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Never give this man a TARDIS.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
That would be awesome.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
All right.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Why don't you exploit some more news for us, Loki.

27:09.000 --> 27:18.000
Well the latest copy of the official Xbox Magazine has the content for Rock Band outlined for March.

27:18.000 --> 27:28.000
Which reminds me that I haven't bought the February issue of the official Xbox Magazine which had those three free tracks from on there with Freeze Pop and stuff.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Puppy has the CD.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
One of our frequent guests, Puppy.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And maybe I'll make him come to the show next week.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
So bring your Xbox.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Puppy come to the show next week.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
K thanks.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
All right.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Let's go to the Xbox Magazine.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Well some of the packs that they have outlined.

27:42.000 --> 27:55.000
March 4th we're getting the Thrash pack which is going to have At The Gates, Blinded By Fear, Evil, Thrashes, The Haunted, Shadow World.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I'm not familiar with any of those.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
But here At The Gates, Blinded By Fear is supposed to be pretty good.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.000
On March 11th they've got some individual songs including Bad Company with Shooting Star which is a cover.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Leonard Skynyrd with Simple Man and The Police with Message In A Bottle.

28:13.000 --> 28:22.000
March 18th they have the Nine Inch Nails pack including March of the Pigs, The Collector and The Perfect Drug.

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
And then finally March 25th has the Metal pack with Iron Maiden's Wraith Child which is a cover.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Black Sabbath's Supernaut which is a cover.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
And the one I'm really looking forward to, Metallica with Fuel.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Because that song I said should have been in Rock Band in the first place.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
So that's awesome.

28:42.000 --> 28:49.000
I'm assuming all of them are going to be 440 for the pack and 160 for each song individually.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Hooray!

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
No idea though what's coming out for February though.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Alright, well those of you guys on the Wii have been missing out on all this Rock Band goodness.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
But maybe not for much longer.

29:00.000 --> 29:08.000
Again, going back to the EA conversation, apparently it was confirmed that there is the coming launch of Rock Band for the Wii.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
He just referred to, the CEO John Riccatello referred to a coming launch of the Wii version of Rock Band.

29:15.000 --> 29:25.000
And IGN said, they just really wanted to seek out a firm confirmation and got him to admit that yes, the game will be making a Wii debut.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
But no release date given, nothing else given.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
But by the way, in a related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but some standalone microphones came out for Rock Band.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
And they say something on them about works on the Nintendo Wii, which is hilarious because there is no Rock Band on the Wii yet.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And they don't work anyway.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
So, EA had to put out a My Bad right now.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
So, that will be a retail nightmare when the Wii version does come out and people say,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I bought this microphone, it said it was going to work on the Wii.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
I don't understand why they don't work on the Wii, it's a fucking USB microphone.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I mean, those have got to be pretty standardized anyway.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Because the USB on Nintendo is retarded.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Yeah, like USB.5.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
It's actually slower than USB 1.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
That would be awesome.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
So, there you have it.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Alright, now it's time for us to get to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
It's a chance for you to talk to us a little bit with the mailbag.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Every week you send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads them on the air.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
So, DarkSakura, I want you to put your hand in the mailbag there and pull out a few emails.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Did we get a lot of emails this week?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh God, we did.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Awesome.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Well, I guess you can't read them all, but pick some of your favorites.

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
Well, there were a couple that were really long, including one from our friend who made us the offer from Disney World.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Disney must do.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Yes.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
And we're making jokes about the stalker thing.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
We know better.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Trust me.

30:56.000 --> 31:07.000
But this one I'm just going to use to go by the email name Lord Katakos because there's no signature on it.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
I am new to the podcast and I was wondering if you guys and girl ever talked about MapleStory.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
I enjoy this game a lot, a lot more than Ragnarok in my opinion.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Anyway, my undead mage could destroy any of your World of Warcraft accounts.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, you guys got the micro and stuff.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Keep giving out the spanks to the noobs.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
By the way, that is my priest pick.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
I think I'm on my PSP.

31:32.000 --> 31:43.000
And he sent a picture titled Ugly Mages, but the mailbag is got PMS.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
So it doesn't let me actually really get to take a look at the images.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
So sorry.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I can't see it.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Here we go.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I have never played MapleStory.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
I've heard about it.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
There's a lot of people that like it.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Have you played it, Mo?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I loved MapleStory.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Well, that's a cute little banner.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Tell us a little bit about MapleStory.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
It's like Ragnarok where it has the little Gaia avatars and everything.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It's just another RPG.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
It's a chibi good time.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yes, it's a chibi good time.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
They're supposed to be making one for DS and I'm waiting for that anxiously.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
I heard about that.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
It never happened though.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
It should be fun.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
All right.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Well, okay, so it looks like there are some MapleStory fans here.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
So you're in good company.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
This one actually is addressed to Loki from Azurune.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
I don't quite remember, but in a past episode of OLR, I remember you stating you were able to play games on your Wii.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Is this true?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Please answer back.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Thanks.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I think it means the imports, which we've obviously proven.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Yes, I can play games on my Wii.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
If you've been listening to tonight's show, obviously since we have Smash Brothers Brawl in the house and it's an import copy, yes, he can play import.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, because I have a mod chip in mind.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
This one comes from Oscar.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
It turns out my parents will finally be getting high speed Internet.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
And yes, believe it or not, I've had to suffer the pain and torture of dial up for years.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
So I resort to web browsing on my iPhone for now.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
iPhone.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
But in about a week, I'll be able to finally listen live and even work up the nerve to call in.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Talking to you guys would be like talking to celebrities.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
So, yeah, I'd be nervous, but I'm sure we talked about gaming.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
I'm sure talking about gaming would put me at ease.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Thanks, and I hope to be a live listener soon.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
P.S., how come I can't access your chat room on iPhone?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I've done it with other sites before.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Is it because it's Java?

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
Actually, yeah, the iPhone has problems with Java, but I think that, well, I don't know.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
I haven't updated my software on my iPhone yet, so maybe that will change.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
I know I can't watch any YouTube videos if they're embedded unless I actually just use the YouTube channel.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It's because it's the iPhone?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
No, iPhone's great.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
I didn't mean to sound like I was bashing our emailer when they said that talking to us would be like talking to celebrities.

34:03.000 --> 34:10.000
It's a compliment, it really is, but we're just nerds that are way too old to be doing this,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
just kind of kicking back, having fun on a Sunday night.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It's really nothing special to us.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
We invite strangers over to have a beer with us.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
It's a good time.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Next email.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Maybe we'll invite you to have a beer with us sometime if you're 21.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I didn't card Mo, but I'm just assuming.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I can pull out my wallet.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm 22.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
All right, good.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Good enough.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Actually, I want to really quickly, before I get to the next email, I'm so sorry,

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
but there was a very good question asked in chat that I think is a thing to address right now.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
Someone in chat, they didn't change their nickname, so I just know them as olarmyrecruit9348 says,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Someone please tell me how to find Mo on YouTube.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
It made me realize I'm so rude, I never let Mo plug her stuff.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Please, plug away.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
How can they find your performance from-

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
You can look up the username Amixia.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
I think you can actually go to YouTube.com slash Amixia.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
It's A-M-I-X-I-A, and it's me being a retard with my digital camera,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
and the color tends to change because it's a really bad video camera.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's awesome, but it's me being a retard.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
It's Amixia on YouTube.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
It's all right.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
They're listening to us being retards right now.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
It's all good.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
It works.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
It works.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
You're in good company.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Any other websites you work with?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I have a live journal.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
You can check all my YouTube stuff on there because I'll post those publicly.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
My username is Furious, spelled exactly like Furious.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Wow.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
I have the most awesome username ever.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
That's a pretty good username.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Congrats.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
I also have a website.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
It's prided.net, and I never updated.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I think the last video on there was never going to give you up,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
so I should probably fix that.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah, it's just like we have a PSP site that I never update.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
We don't update our websites either.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
It's fine.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah, prided.net has updates.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
We're supposed to have a new URL on our website like the first of the year.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
It didn't happen.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
It didn't happen.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Well, thank you.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So now there you go to our listener.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Sorry, you can get back to emails now, but that was something very important.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Indeed, Rita.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
It is very important.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
It is.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
So next one comes from Ali.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
On episode 264, I'm glad you're keeping track of episode numbers because I'm not.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Loki goes on an anti MacBook Air rant.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.240
As an Apple fanboy, I must say that the MacBook Air is a triumph of engineering and a beautiful

36:12.240 --> 36:16.120
machine, and I don't think it was intended to play video games on.

36:16.120 --> 36:22.680
As an Apple stockholder, I can say the MacBook Air blows chunks.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.400
Insert love the show drivel here.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.760
It's not that I have a problem with it not being able to play games.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.520
I really don't care, and I'm sure it can because it's got a Core Studio processor in it, but

36:31.520 --> 36:36.560
it's just that it doesn't have a CD-ROM drive or a DVD-ROM drive or anything like that.

36:36.560 --> 36:43.520
You have to basically hijack a drive off another computer, or you have to buy a $99 drive that

36:43.520 --> 36:47.480
plugs into the single USB port that's on the damn thing.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.960
It's just not very... Yay, it's thin, okay?

36:50.960 --> 36:56.000
Props for that, and I'm sure it has a nice battery life, but it's, once again, all aesthetics

36:56.000 --> 36:58.760
and no functionality.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.180
Orange Lounge Radio, the finest in video game radio.

37:01.180 --> 37:04.360
We never talk computers at all, just video games.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.240
Computers play games, therefore it works.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.840
Okay, we talk consoles.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.840
Consoles play games, too.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.000
Fine, fine, fine.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.920
Anyway... Can I keep going now?

37:15.920 --> 37:17.240
Okay.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.560
This comes from Ryoma.

37:18.560 --> 37:26.520
Hello, I was just listening to part B of EpiDeDe, episode 265 today, and as excited as I was

37:26.520 --> 37:30.680
to hear you talk about Smash Brawl, I have a little something to add to your discussion

37:30.680 --> 37:32.260
about the demos.

37:32.260 --> 37:37.560
On the Japan official Smash Brawl page, there are two more demos that seem to be exclusive

37:37.560 --> 37:42.720
to Japan, Mother 2, Earthbound, of course, and the original Fire Emblem, which is where

37:42.720 --> 37:43.960
Marth comes from.

37:43.960 --> 37:48.680
Obviously, I understand that those two games are out on the Japanese Virtual Console.

37:48.680 --> 37:53.280
However, I'm pretty irritated with the fact that Nintendo seems to love to torture us

37:53.280 --> 37:58.320
Americans, apologies to all overseas listeners, with the idea of having a new Mother game,

37:58.320 --> 38:01.680
having Earthbound ported to the GBA DSVC, what have you.

38:01.680 --> 38:07.680
I still love Nintendo to death, and the only next-gen system I have is a Wii, but their

38:07.680 --> 38:11.520
seeming lack of interest in what American gamers want is growing frustrating.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.800
Just my two cents, with much love from Chicago Ryoma.

38:13.800 --> 38:18.680
Well, I can understand why they're not bringing some of those games over, because Earthbound,

38:18.680 --> 38:22.740
I'm sure, has quite a bit of dialogue in there, and they have to localize it, where it's not

38:22.740 --> 38:26.640
just, I can throw a copy of the ROM onto the Virtual Console network.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.200
Now, I don't understand why they wouldn't put something that, say, localizes in the

38:30.200 --> 38:37.200
UK, and bring it over here, because, I don't know, that's just lazy.

38:37.200 --> 38:40.440
Next?

38:40.440 --> 38:41.440
I guess so.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.440
Okay.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.680
Hi, the doctor here.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.880
Just to ask, what happened to random talk about Battlestar Galactica?

38:46.880 --> 38:49.520
Uh, Shane moved away.

38:49.520 --> 38:52.480
Just wondering, because after a while, Dark Sakura just stopped.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.480
I never talked about Battlestar Galactica.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.560
You're getting confused with Rice Princess.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.560
Yeah.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.840
And, Rob, you still need to send me that MP3 file, please.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.440
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.320
I'm sorry, I will.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.760
Battlestar Galactica comes back in April.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.880
I'm sure you will hear random Battlestar Galactica chat come back in April.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.040
Because this show never gets derailed, ever.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.040
Ever.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.040
Rob.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.040
Rob.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.040
Rob.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.040
Rob.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.040
What?

39:18.040 --> 39:19.040
Hi.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.960
I've been busy playing Wild Arms in Castlevania Symphony of the Night on my PSP after I paid

39:22.960 --> 39:25.200
for them on the PlayStation Network.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.800
Some Call of Duty 4 are actually a lot.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
Oh, and Rez.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.880
Fuck yeah, Rez.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.880
Fuck yes, Rez.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.760
That is one addicting game.

39:32.760 --> 39:37.520
Listening to last week's show while writing this, they retracted their retraction.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.520
What the fuck?

39:38.520 --> 39:42.840
Sorry, it was literally a WTF, but I like saying what the fuck.

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
Oh, okay.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.480
And, Rob, I challenge you to some Undertow.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.840
Anyways, I was going to go now, so you guys can move on.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.840
Peace.

39:49.840 --> 39:50.960
I'm really bad at Undertow.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.080
I don't think you want to play me.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.160
Play me at something I'm like halfway decent at, like Puzzle Fighter or something.

39:55.160 --> 40:00.200
Well, we have one more e-mail that's really, really, really, really, really, freaking

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
long.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
Okay.

40:02.200 --> 40:06.280
Hello, Skyloki, DarkSakura, and guest host.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.600
Hi.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.120
Disclaimer.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.800
First let me apologize for my bad grammar, as I know you tend to be a stickler for proper

40:12.800 --> 40:17.160
grammar, and I tend to disregard proper grammar and spelling whenever I write anything.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.160
That's okay.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.160
I'm used to IMing, Rob.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.160
Burn.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.160
Jamie.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.160
Jamie.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.160
Jamie.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.160
Jamie.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.160
Bite me.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.160
Rob.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.160
What?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.160
Heart.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.160
I brought you cake.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.160
Be nice.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.160
That's true.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.160
You did buy me cake.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.160
It was delicious cake.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
E-mail.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
It was delicious and moist.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.160
E-mail.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
E-mail.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.160
E-mail.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.160
E-mail.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.600
Okay, Oscar.

40:42.600 --> 40:46.160
Regarding the Fox News report on Mass Effect, oh, Lord.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
Oh, God.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.320
And of e-mail.

40:49.320 --> 40:53.040
I feel it sadly shows the current state of our country's journalism.

40:53.040 --> 40:57.680
While Fox News is notorious for having a conservative agenda to their broadcast, the sad truth of

40:57.680 --> 41:01.280
the matter was that it was probably nothing more than a ploy for a ratings boost, and

41:01.280 --> 41:04.960
I'm sure if CNN had the chance, they would have done the same.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.800
Excuse me.

41:07.800 --> 41:13.240
Lately with news, it seems that the way to get a top story on the news is simply find

41:13.240 --> 41:16.800
something that has a soap opera or scandal written all over it.

41:16.800 --> 41:21.560
Scandals sell, and it also had to do with sex, which we know the old saying about that.

41:21.560 --> 41:30.500
And of course, children, since the stereotype to a lot of non-gamers is video games are

41:30.500 --> 41:32.040
kid stuff.

41:32.040 --> 41:36.040
Were I a news show producer or a news show host and saw something that implied there

41:36.040 --> 41:40.800
was a lesbian sex scene in Mass Effect, I would run with a trashy story like that because

41:40.800 --> 41:45.460
if it is true, that can mean big ratings hike for the show and possible raise slash promotion

41:45.460 --> 41:48.000
for yourself.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.140
Since video games are considered the current evil that is corrupting our youth much like

41:51.140 --> 41:56.000
rock and roll in the 50s and 60s, violent films in the 80s and 90s, and rock and roll

41:56.000 --> 42:00.120
again just before the focus shifted to video games, you know that was both Jack Thompson,

42:00.120 --> 42:02.480
I mean him too, sorry.

42:02.480 --> 42:06.080
I still remember journalists trying to pin the Columbine High School massacre on Marilyn

42:06.080 --> 42:07.240
Manson.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.720
It makes any scandalous video game story easy prey.

42:10.720 --> 42:16.820
With a chance that could get a casual gamer, concerned parents, and people who would act

42:16.820 --> 42:21.320
like sex in video games, I got to see what games they mention and start playing them,

42:21.320 --> 42:26.000
as well as your regular audience to tune in when they might not have.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.840
Also since few outside of gaming world would read or hear any follow up on the story on

42:29.840 --> 42:33.440
the net regarding the false statements of the report, it would be a quick and easy reading

42:33.440 --> 42:36.000
so not everyone would have heard the bad journalism backlash.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Disgusting?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.600
Yes, but it also means modern day journalism tactics as well.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.800
Okay, discuss so I can take a break.

42:42.800 --> 42:50.400
Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here, I do understand, you know, probably any network

42:50.400 --> 42:55.520
would have done it, but I don't know, there's something about the whole sensationalism of

42:55.520 --> 42:59.320
it and I don't know, I feel like Fox News in general has kind of done this stuff before,

42:59.320 --> 43:06.920
but I think you're right, CNN probably would do something like this too, I mean it just

43:06.920 --> 43:11.720
kind of depends on, but I don't know, I feel like there's actual news to be reported on

43:11.720 --> 43:16.820
out there, what with an election going on right now, and you know, things going on in

43:16.820 --> 43:25.920
other countries and things and whatever, I just, it's, I don't know, just shouldn't waste

43:25.920 --> 43:28.040
our time with that kind of crap.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.040
That's all.

43:29.040 --> 43:33.040
Well, and didn't they pull the statement like a couple days later when her book on Amazon

43:33.040 --> 43:35.060
started getting tanking reviews?

43:35.060 --> 43:39.200
She sort of said, I'm sorry- She was like, oh, okay, maybe Mass Effect

43:39.200 --> 43:40.200
wasn't that bad.

43:40.200 --> 43:45.640
It was kind of like a half-assed apology, though, she was like, I made a real bad judgment

43:45.640 --> 43:49.480
call or something like that, but she didn't really say, I'm sorry, gamers, or I'm sorry

43:49.480 --> 43:53.680
to the gaming community and to the mature gamers out there, she didn't really say anything

43:53.680 --> 43:56.160
like that, she just said, oh, I've done fucked up.

43:56.160 --> 44:02.640
Yeah, but don't make a statement on Fox News 1 and then like, once you realize that your

44:02.640 --> 44:08.480
review on Amazon is like dropping hugely, it like took a nose dive, she was like, okay,

44:08.480 --> 44:10.280
maybe Mass Effect wasn't that bad.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.280
No shit.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.440
Yeah, so there you have it.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
Anything else you want to read out of that email?

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
Oh, there's plenty more.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.440
All right.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.800
As for the, well, you know, really this is, I actually, I do have to say this is actually

44:21.800 --> 44:26.060
more of what we've discussed on the show as well, but I really do like this email and

44:26.060 --> 44:32.080
I'm going to post it on the forum if I remember to.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.440
I'm going to move on to the drinking game portion.

44:34.440 --> 44:35.440
Okay.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.440
Uh-oh.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.760
So this is, I know the game series is a bit touchy subject for you guys and already has

44:39.760 --> 44:45.000
great music, but how would a custom soundtrack of Dragon Force or Death Clock be for a Katamari

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
game?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Dude, yes.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Yes.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I love Metalocalypse.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.600
Anyway, I think it would really change my outlook on the franchise.

44:54.600 --> 44:58.320
I love its fun, cheesy quirkiness and I think Dragon Force soundtrack version of the game

44:58.320 --> 45:01.960
would make me love it even more for its mass chaos, death and destruction as I do love

45:01.960 --> 45:03.760
games with mass carnage.

45:03.760 --> 45:08.760
One last thing, sorta, the OLR drinking games got a big laugh at the chat room saying take

45:08.760 --> 45:13.800
a drink whenever Loki leads off the story with anyways since that first was the first

45:13.800 --> 45:15.520
thing that crossed my mind.

45:15.520 --> 45:19.400
I am very conscious of that now and I have been not saying that.

45:19.400 --> 45:23.160
No, it's okay because now it's part of the drinking game and you want people to drink.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.160
Well I don't want them to die.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.160
True.

45:26.160 --> 45:31.440
They already take a shot every time I say an off-color comment, so you know, people

45:31.440 --> 45:33.840
should be rushed to the hospital already, so.

45:33.840 --> 45:38.120
Alright, well he has some suggestions for us.

45:38.120 --> 45:43.360
Whenever the show goes off on a tangent about food, hey we've had cake all night, so.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.360
Mmm cake.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.360
Delicious cake.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.800
Moist.

45:46.800 --> 45:51.600
Whenever there is Sony bashing after some Sony news, the word addict is used after someone

45:51.600 --> 45:54.620
mentions playing an MMORPG.

45:54.620 --> 46:01.680
Anytime an EE uses the blanking expletive is used outside of the FUs of the week segment,

long time Loki brings up his dislike of the karaoke performances a refusal to do

47:28.380 --> 47:32.500
that anymore bashes Apple pretty much the same thing our emailer said the

47:32.500 --> 47:36.180
drinking game even extends to some of our weeknight shows such as the

47:36.180 --> 47:39.800
insanest hour and Travis Donovan live but there's some other miscellaneous

47:39.800 --> 47:44.940
things take a shot every time the Olive Garden gets mentioned there you go

47:44.940 --> 47:49.180

match game if you lose there that's okay you can always hammer the skype line

50:12.020 --> 50:17.860
which will be open very soon but first a couple more news stories for us yes a

50:17.860 --> 50:24.100
game I talked about earlier crisis they were having some well not so wonderful

50:24.100 --> 50:29.500
sales before but now they have finally hit 1 million copies sold that's good

50:29.500 --> 50:32.420
for them because it was a pretty good game except for that last level which

50:32.420 --> 50:39.140
really sucked of course to go along with that news they're gonna be showing off

50:39.140 --> 50:43.520
the cry engine to at least the console port of it at the game developers

50:43.520 --> 50:47.700
conference was just coming up actually in a couple weeks here so hopefully

50:47.700 --> 50:53.100
because of that we will see maybe crisis come to you know console system I

50:53.100 --> 50:58.500
remember some talks rumors at least of crisis coming through the ps3 so that'd

50:58.500 --> 51:04.500
be pretty cool to see happen but either way you know maybe give something else

51:04.500 --> 51:13.820
for game companies use others in the end real free engine hmm oh another engines

51:13.820 --> 51:18.220
fully optimized because if you play it on the PC if thing eats your PC I mean

51:18.220 --> 51:22.380
no matter what kind of hardware you have in there but uh I guess because it

51:22.380 --> 51:27.000
wasn't fully optimized thank you cry tech for putting out a wonderfully

51:27.000 --> 51:34.580
polished game not optimized one bit awesome okay well if crisis isn't your

51:34.580 --> 51:37.260
thing which I don't know I haven't really gotten into crisis but I don't

51:37.260 --> 51:40.860
know I could probably get into this game and it's coming to North America soon

51:40.860 --> 51:45.360
it's a game called arcana heart and it's coming to the PlayStation 2 now here's

51:45.360 --> 51:49.980
the thing about this game it's an all-girl fighter that's right all babes

51:49.980 --> 51:58.300
duking it out it's not quite dead or alive let's just put it that way they

51:58.300 --> 52:02.660
are fully clothed girls at least the ones here in this screenshot yes there

52:02.660 --> 52:05.420
is a severe lack of boobies or so important is but we do have a little bit

52:05.420 --> 52:12.860
of panties in that particular shots all right so anyhow I'm Atlas is said that

52:12.860 --> 52:16.220
the ps2 is still a viable platform there's no reason to abandon a veteran

52:16.220 --> 52:20.500
system just because it isn't the newest thing around so some of the Japanese

52:20.500 --> 52:23.900
titles that haven't made its way over here yet atlas plant plans are sorry

52:23.900 --> 52:28.660

has been confirmed it will be coming out on April 8th 11 different customizable

52:32.860 --> 52:40.780
girl fighters $29.99 is the price I'll get it so there you go we don't we

52:40.780 --> 52:45.820

private message there you go all right so I see 100 Matt you ready to do this

55:38.660 --> 55:42.820
let's see what I'm at you there I think everything's broken tonight all right

55:42.820 --> 55:46.380
let me remind you all how this works okay Jake you gotta pause the game okay

55:46.380 --> 55:48.860
let me remind everybody how this works what we're gonna do is we're gonna have

55:48.860 --> 55:52.140
three questions for you tonight and in the questions they all have a blank

55:52.140 --> 55:54.760
there's a blank somewhere in the answer you ever watch the match game in the

55:54.760 --> 55:58.860
70s the reruns on games network it's just like that boy game stuff okay so

55:58.860 --> 56:02.020
we're gonna ask three questions there will be a blank in it so our celebrities

56:02.020 --> 56:06.860
will think about their answer and write it down on a little piece of paper and

56:06.860 --> 56:14.740
five mad libs on my invisible keyboard and then our callers will try to match

56:14.740 --> 56:19.980
okay and if for every celebrity they match they get a point that's how it

56:19.980 --> 56:23.500
works so what you just have to Jake all I have to do think of something funny

56:23.500 --> 56:27.900
that goes in the blank or real doesn't matter okay so I have to do go for funny

56:27.900 --> 56:33.500
all right I have to hopefully one night stands got my is understanding what's

56:33.500 --> 56:36.020
going on because I just got a message that says sweet I don't know what I'm

56:36.020 --> 56:40.420
doing which means you're probably gonna win SSJ 100 Matt you're up some up

56:40.420 --> 56:45.100
against stiff competition tonight are you ready did cheeseburger come back

56:45.100 --> 56:49.900
cheeseburger came back and said what did I miss okay here we go here's what

56:49.900 --> 56:55.020
here's what we'll do since we have a code if if it ties zero zero tonight if

56:55.020 --> 56:58.940
nobody manages to get a point on the board then we'll get cheeseburger the

56:58.940 --> 57:03.100
code yes all right so cheeseburger is hoping that everybody that's fine with

57:03.100 --> 57:11.100
is broke all right somebody fill in time while I type out how to play this to one

57:11.100 --> 57:17.140
night stands we have a zero Sam it's on screen it was funny though because I

57:17.140 --> 57:20.740
think we have Kirby getting she has she has like her suit but there's like a

57:20.740 --> 57:25.780
thong built into the suit that's hot okay he understands now we're good all

57:25.780 --> 57:35.980

57:35.980 --> 57:38.620
and cheeseburger playing tonight it's our first three-way match game

57:38.620 --> 57:43.300
cheeseburger is simply hoping that no one matches anything all right here we

57:43.300 --> 57:49.420

59:21.700 --> 59:25.860
to Super Smash Brothers brawl however she likes to always look on the bright

59:25.860 --> 59:29.460
side she let all her friends know that she will actually be looking forward to

59:29.460 --> 59:37.420
jigglypuff in the game because she can kill her by blank and one night stands

59:37.420 --> 59:42.820
still trying to come up with an answer this is a tough question it is a hard

59:42.820 --> 59:49.500
question I'll give you that Rama that was me doing the laugh why don't you

59:49.500 --> 59:53.740
talk a little more about okay there we go we have an answer whew all right SSJ

59:53.740 --> 01:00:03.220
100 Matt she can kill her by what SSJ 100 having a jigglypuff having a not

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:09.340
having Kirby eater having Kirby eat her all right having Kirby eat her and one

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:16.380
night stands says she can kill her by flop smash flop smash all right let's

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.380
see if there's a match dark Sakura she can kill her by by repeatedly bashing

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.100
her in the head with mr. Saturn until she dies a bleeding horrible oozy death

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.740
well be a very difficult one to match but is a good answer but unfortunately

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.420
not a match ladies first mo she can kill her by I was gonna say pyramid head

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:43.980
pyramid head rape sweet rape all right oh gosh look at the time of rape o'clock

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:52.100
unfortunately not unfortunately not a match what time is it rape in time all

01:00:52.100 --> 01:01:04.140
right I kept it pretty simple she can kill her by fire fire not a man like

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:09.940
fire I like all these answers so far all right uh Jake she can kill her by I also

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.300
went with fire because fire always makes it better

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.900
Oh fire would have been a great answer unfortunately not a match and my answer

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.820
was she could kill her by in reference to last week condemned to explosive

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:29.220
babies unfortunately also not a match so cheeseburgers in the lead right now

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.140
because it's 0-0 meaning cheeseburger might win but that there's still two

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.940

here at orange launch radio this is how we roll all right do we have any more

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.100
stories yeah all right one more story and then we're gonna open up dare

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:56.700
skype line so not to be outdone by the Wii yet again

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:03.700
ps3 devs have put out a little video saying look at what we could do with the

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:11.540
I or the PlayStation I yeah we can do that VR shit too we're awesome but yeah

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:16.460
basically um in you know kind of impressed by what they've done using the

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:20.300
wiimote you know they kind of this very similar thing actually look like it uses

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:25.580
the exact same program and it's running on a ps3 dev kit to give that you know

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:31.220
head tracking so you know I'm pretty impressed by the PlayStation I'm not

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.340
gonna buy it yet but I'm impressed by what you can do with it like you know

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:40.580
the little tech demos and stuff but I would like some actual games that use

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.940
this technology instead of just look at what we can do oh but it'll never come

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:51.780
out but just look what we can do all right what do you think what will they

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.700
do do you think well they better do something like I like that one where is

01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:00.500
the combat type game you know like the old Atari combat but you you know you

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.500
can scan in your picture that you want to use as your tank you can just draw a

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.620
picture you can put an actual tank on there you know stuff like that that's

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:11.580
cool or like you know the lunar lander game where they make by drawing the

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.780
pictures and stuff I mean that's pretty cool that's what they should be doing

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:21.140
with the I instead of just I don't know games right to move a ball around by

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:27.620
waving my arm that's kind of dumb trials of Topac also a stupid name too for the

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:34.460
game she's been trials of Tupac that's that would have sold a lot better

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.980
alright on that note we're gonna open up our Skype line for you guys to give us a

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.980

hooray the ps3 is getting their own greatest hits including such wonderful

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:15.100
games as resistance fall man folk soul or you know folklore I think that's

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.060

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.380

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:29.580

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:35.100
who is there on the phone on the orange lounge radio Skype line hello

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:41.380
eating a bag of chips by the sound of it what's on your mind Legend of Zaku no

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.820
no nothing but nothing was just coming back from just you know you want to do

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:53.380
but just your Super Bowl shit and stuff um yeah was it was well I was wild crazy

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:58.380
when the Giants won yeah I mean it was it was dead it was kind of quiet when

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:03.620
the game started but then as we further went you know went through there was a

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.180
lot of people there and it was it was just man it's on the way you know I had

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:14.100
a time square did you get now did you actually watch the Super Bowl or did you

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.780
just play DDR all night no I bought actually you know I had my

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:24.620
Buffalo wings might be here and all that other stuff I actually avoided DDR today

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:29.140
hmm but besides that I mean I don't know if you want to bring up supernova too

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.740
since it was probably brought up by other folks anyways oh we haven't talked

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.500
a lot about DDR recently on the program but what are your thoughts on DDR

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:47.300
supernova 2 basically it's like this um I don't know it's just bits and bits and

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.460
holding us back they're holding us back the fact that we can't even unlock songs

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.540
right now we're being out and we're being forced against our will to

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:02.120
basically have to go as far as importing a game or basically just telling the

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.720
arcade owners that means and we have good relationships with better than bits

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.220
and to just avoid it it's not worth it without even news or a means of

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:14.420
unlocking their form just so you're pissed they didn't bring the Japanese

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.420
only EMU system over to America to try and add a little some of the game

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.700
tension but bits and being the half-assed American you know folks that

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.500
they are just basically say fuck it we're not gonna do it aren't we kind of

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:32.300
lucky to have we are still going in the arcades in the first place I mean huh I

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:39.500
mean think about it that was I remember and the way I might blame the Konami

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.100
because they're actually making a good effort in bringing it over here they try

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:47.060
it you know they tried it with this you know with this game they tried it with

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.660
guitar fish from Romania which is which hasn't seen at least a year but you know

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:57.820
it fits in this is trying to half-assed away into this the only thing I can see

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:03.680
is you know and I mean literally needs to shake it all right so she can the

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.700
biggest in this country what do you what do you think now I'm not playing this

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.200
game so giving us a little bet tonight here on the show that's fine but what

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.100
what can Betson do to make things right with DDR let's say there's a supernova

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.740
three what can they do to make things right well just do what Konami says I mean

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:27.740
that's that's pretty much what they had to do anyways since I know most likely

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:33.180
the way the way they were picked out anyways was you know a contract so you

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.820
know since Konami put the bid you know bid out you know the effects in the

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:44.540
contract to distribute games in America by not by basically you know a surfing

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:49.100
Konami's will you know that would that would be on the you know that'd be ground

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:55.060
for breach of contract all right you know Konami will sue if it got that bad

01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:00.020
if it was Konami will sue it was putting a damper on their sales all right we

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:07.420
got to wrap up any last-minute thoughts that go um I don't know Call of Duty 4

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:12.860
kicks Halo 3's ass there you have a Call of Duty 4 kicks Halo 3's ass it does

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.780
can say that because I am so is it gayer than you or gay as you know I'm just I'm

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:24.140
just kidding obvious I'm DDR is not gay DDR is just it's DDR totally does not

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:33.900
like to sleep with other DDR is the same gender I beg to differ no I'm kidding I

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:38.260
don't yeah I've said the DDR argument so many times I'm like blue in the face I

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.860
just I want to look at pretty Smash Brothers brawl more that's all I want is

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:49.580
that okay but um Rob what a few episodes back you said some about any I think you

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.620
would do to make DDR better you kind of glance over what would you do to make it

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:58.940
better I really have to hear what you would do I would scrap all the code they

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.540
have ever used to make DDR and build the game from the ground up it's gonna force

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.600
them to think of some new ideas on how to make the game original again and I

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.380
would bring over some of the people that helped on the Xbox version if they're

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:11.820
still with the company additionally I would think about how to make the game

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.340
more competitive than cooperative in nature because yes there was the dance

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.420
battle mode or whatever in supernova but I think a mode like that should be the

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:23.220
focus of the game next time and not an afterthought that's my thoughts

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:30.180
literally redesign I mean the game can still be single-player and have that's

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.020
modes and they can have some cooperative features in it but make it more of a

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:37.140
tournament game relaunch the game is dance dance tournament or something I

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:41.260
don't know so all right Rama we gotta let you go try and get some more calls

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:45.540
okay okay and one more thing yes I'm aware was not taking classic own for we

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:50.900
consoles what's that Nintendo world is only accepting plastic for we console

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.620
sales why is that I don't know that's the sign in the window when you walk in

01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:01.660
Wow no checks no cash nope safe it's Apple is doing with the iPhones plastic

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.420
