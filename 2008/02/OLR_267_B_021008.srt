00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome back everybody, here to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 10th of 2008.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're going to get back into the gaming news in just a moment, but we're really looking forward here in Part B tonight

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to trying out a brand new game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're very excited to test out a new game. We're going to be playing that a little bit later.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, I'm keeping it a secret what it is, but don't be worried if you weren't picked to play in tonight's game

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because everybody in chat has a chance to play and win tonight.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's amazing!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But here's the thing, if you were listening right at the end of Part A, even the podcast folks,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we asked a trivia question, and the trivia question was which one of these games is this music from?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And the three answers you could pick from was A, Nightmare on Elm Street, B, Halloween, or C, Friday the 13th.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we'll give you a little hint, we're not going to tell you who won just yet, but we will tell you the correct answer was C, Friday the 13th.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So if you didn't guess Friday the 13th, sorry, you're not going to be picked tonight,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but you will get a chance to play in the chat room, so all hope is not lost.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You may still win either a copy of Res HD or if you don't have an Xbox, one of our other prizes from our new prize table,

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll talk about a little more later, but if you did say Friday the 13th, you might want to stay by your phone.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, but in the meantime, we're going to get back into some gaming news, right, Loki?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, Fooling at Home, it's been available on PCs for a long time and just not really that recently, but on the PS3 as well.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now they have hit one million users actually, at least on the PlayStation 3, so that's pretty awesome.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
One million consoles contributing to a cure for cancer or God knows what else they're doing.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Calculating votes for the 2008 primaries or who knows.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Making a better caffeine molecule.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Better caffeine molecule.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That is something they need to work on actually.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Finishing Duke Nukem Forever.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That is also something they need to get to working on.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Also mentioning the PlayStation 3, which Fooling at Home appears on, there's a brand new Japanese PlayStation 3 that's going to be coming out very soon.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's going to come with a 40GB hard drive and a 6-axis wireless controller.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It is the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It comes out on March 6th.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It will cost you 39,980 yen.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you want to translate that into U.S. dollars, that's 376 U.S. dollars.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So it's the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that should be interesting, I guess, if you like different colors.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course, everybody in Japan loves different colors.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I guess.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
People were hoping that it was going to be coming out with the DualShock 3 in there as well, but nope, Sony's smarter than that.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They're like, hahaha, no, you have to buy that controller, bitch.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alright, well that's really all there is.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
PlayStation 3 in a new color.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How this is news, I don't know, but it is.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So there you have it.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:35,000
According to EGM's Quarterman rumor column, in their March issue they talk about how that God of War Chain of Olympus, or Chains of Olympus,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
will be heading to PlayStation 2.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of course, this is a rumor, but seeing their trend so far with, I don't know, Twisted Metal Head On, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, stuff like that,

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it's not going to be too surprising if they port the PSP game to the PlayStation 2.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And hell, it will sell a lot of copies, so not so surprising.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, and Silent Hill Origins, that was another one that was ported from PSP.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In other Sony news, Flow will be making its way to the PlayStation Portable,

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and it comes out on March 6th.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The game is coming out from Super Villain Studios,

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and yeah, I don't know why, though, you would want to get this when it's probably going to cost you more than it did on PlayStation 3.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How much is it?

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know, it doesn't have a price yet, but...

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh no, you're going to get it through the PlayStation Store, so I guess it is the same.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, it might be the same price.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, then never mind.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But what a pain in the ass to buy something on the store and then transfer and all that stuff, you know?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I haven't actually touched the PlayStation Portable store yet.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I haven't even looked at that, because I know now they're starting to re-release...

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's where they're starting to put full PlayStation Portable games on there now.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Huh.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Like, they had Wipeout, Pure you can download, and a bunch of other stuff, you know.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, because they figured that everyone else is already downloading stuff.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, everyone else is already downloading it.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So let's join the party and charge for it, and no one will still buy it.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know, it's a cool idea to have original games on there, but you know...

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What they need is a link to actually be able to view that store from the PSP.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because, I mean, as far as I'm aware, now they don't.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I don't remember the URL for it, so...

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I ain't buying anything from it.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And there's a bee in here.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ah, that's scary.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is that a bee?

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, it's just a fly.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You sure?

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, it is.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's pretty big for a fly.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll take a look at it.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you scared?

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, I'm just saying, you know.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh my god, there's a bee.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, Loki, you do news.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll take care of the bee.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Anyways, another game that's going to be coming out here for the PlayStation 3 also is going

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
to have...

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
It's a fly, Loki.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Don't be scared.

92
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Oh, well, you've grown big here.

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Yes, we do.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,800
Just like Devil May Cry 4 that had a mandatory install, or not really mandatory, I guess

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,360
that one was more of an optional install.

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Hot Shots Golf 5 in Japan right now has a 5GB, that's kind of ironic, install before

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
you can play the game.

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,120
And, of course, this is probably going to be on the US version, the Hot Shots Golf on

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Tour, is what it's called, or Out of Bounds.

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,640
And that kind of sucks that this trend of now these games having to be installed, I

101
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,600
guess that's why you need your 80GB system, or 40GB, or whatever, to install these damn

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
games.

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
That actually makes a lot of sense.

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,400
But, you know, well, again, to play Devil's Advocate, I suppose a little bit, if the PlayStation

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,440
3 is supposed to be more like a computer, then we shouldn't be surprised, right?

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah, but I'm still kind of a little frustrated at the fact that, you know, consoles like

107
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
the Xbox 360, you don't install games like this.

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I mean, they have...

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,560
The only game I know that you install stuff to it, actually there's two.

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,600
I think there's a Football Manager game in the UK, and then there's also Final Fantasy

111
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,160
XI, but, you know, you have to install it on every console, so that's not a big deal.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,000
But it's just all because of that Blu-ray drive being slow, so that kind of sucks.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Alright, well, you know, on a smaller scale, Sony is doing these preload things as well.

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,480
It's a brand new Monster Hunter game.

115
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
It's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is coming out, and what this has in common with the

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,300
last story is that you actually have the option to copy what's on the UMD to your memory card

117
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,840
on the PSP, and that will decrease load times.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,240
So it's kind of the same concept, however, we should emphasize it's optional here and

119
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,600
not required, which makes sense, because there's PSPs out there, you know, where your memory

120
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
card might be very small.

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Like mine, I only have like a 32 megabyte memory card, because I bought mine a long

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
time ago.

123
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,760
I bought the PSP a long time ago before they started, like, coming with a gigabyte memory

124
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
stick.

125
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Yeah, it's...

126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I don't know.

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,640
I think it's funny, though, that you can install it to the PSP memory stick, and yet all this

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,320
time we've been trying to stop people from installing it to their memory stick.

129
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Oh, how they're so ironic.

130
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Another thing that's ironic is a PSP exploding in your pocket.

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,600
Is that a PSP in your pocket, or are you just really happy?

132
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,960
Apparently, a student was hospitalized after suffering leg burns from a PSP.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,480
He had a third-party battery in his PSP and apparently charged it up, and the battery

134
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
exploded.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
It's also...

136
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,600
I kind of feel bad for the guy, I mean, it doesn't sound like he did anything wrong.

137
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
It does suck.

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
It does suck.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,440
At least it wasn't a Sony battery, because that would be bad.

140
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
Or did he do anything, maybe?

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't know.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
No, he had the system turned off, and it was in his pocket, and he was in the middle of

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,760
band practice when all of a sudden it melted through his jeaned pocket, sending him to

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,880
the hospital with second-degree burns on his leg.

145
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
That sucks.

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Yeah.

147
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:53,280
So, I don't know, luckily my PSPs aren't bursting into flames there.

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Wow.

149
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,300
Well, it's time to move on into another segment here we like to do on this show pretty regularly.

150
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,680
Every week we like to hear from you guys and your emails that you send us at mailbag at

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,880
orangeloungeradio.com, and we open them up and read through the emails in a little segment

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,720
that we call The Mailbag.

153
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,160
Going to chat real quick though, I got to say this, we've got to read these comments

154
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
here.

155
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
SHJ100Matt says, I smell lawsuit.

156
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Do you think so?

157
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Do you think?

158
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,880
Maybe from the battery company, but I hope it's not, you know, they don't try to sue

159
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Sony.

160
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
It's not their fault.

161
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
It's the fault of the battery manufacturers.

162
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Oh, there you go.

163
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,560
All right, well, let's dig into the mailbag here and see what folks have to say tonight.

164
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
Again, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

165
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,920
We'll read this one first.

166
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:51,440
This comes to us from, we'll call him Nathaniel P, I guess is the name based on the signature

167
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
there.

168
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Dear cynical and acromonious cast of, I totally mispronounced that word, of Orange Lounge

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,600
Radio, acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm a varied gamer when it comes to my playlist

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
and currently I've been playing Guitar Hero 3.

171
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,460
Though I am also varied when it comes to my music, I listen more to classical orchestrated

172
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,760
symphony type music.

173
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,760
One of the few rock bands I find enjoyable are the fine gents of Rhapsody or Rhapsody

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
of Fire.

175
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I was hoping if you knew whether any of the band's numerous songs would ever appear in

176
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,900
any Guitar Hero 3 downloadable content packs.

177
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,560
I don't think we've heard anything like that.

178
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,640
I don't know if you're going to see much more independent music come out in these packs.

179
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,840
Usually that's something that kind of happens towards the end of the cycle than so much

180
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
in the beginning.

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,160
Personally, I would expect a rock band to have more of a chance for content like that

182
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,960
since they actually release stuff on a regular basis.

183
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Now here's what the band should do is they should look out for chances.

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,920
I don't know if you know these guys personally and trying to get them a plug on the show

185
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
or whatever.

186
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,280
If so, good job.

187
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,720
One thing these guys could do is maybe try to contact the folks in Guitar Hero 4 because

188
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,600
I want to say I saw a story earlier this week that I don't think made in our show world

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,520
tonight, but some indie band out there spilled the beans that they were going to be in Guitar

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,840
Hero 4 and posted this entire probable song list from the game.

191
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,160
I think it kind of made a lot of people go, I don't know about that, a little apprehensive

192
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,280
to call it actual news, but certainly Guitar Hero always has like 20, 30 independent songs

193
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,360
in there.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,640
I would say go for Guitar Hero 4.

195
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,460
The band will get out there more that way.

196
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:31,960
This email comes to us from PKJunior92 and sends us this, Hey, I have just two questions

197
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
or comments.

198
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,260
First is directed to Loki and it's about the Eye of Judgment bet.

199
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,240
It's just not possible considering the caliber of the game, and I don't think ratings are

200
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,180
in negative numbers, to reach one million ever.

201
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,440
If you want to make it more reasonable, make it 500,000 copies sold, even though it probably

202
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,080
won't sell more than 350,000.

203
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,520
Loki is too safe and I think he knows it.

204
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,560
Anyways, here's my second question.

205
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,200
Well, before we get to his second question, I think that was the whole point behind Loki

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,320
taking the bet in the first place.

207
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,180
As much as you chatters want it, Loki does not want to come here and dress in a tingle

208
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,760
outfit and set the Eye of Judgment on fire or whatever we talk about here.

209
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Right, Loki?

210
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
You don't really want to do that.

211
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
No.

212
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,040
Yeah, because you know people will take screen caps on Justin.tv and it will be all over

213
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,580
the internet the next day, right?

214
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,060
That's fine, but I mean, and I understand, I don't think it's going to hit 500,000 either,

215
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,960
but you know, I've already reduced it so many times, you know, lifetime of, you know, ever.

216
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,560
The bet was a million, and that was to Loki prove a point that the game will never sell

217
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,720
at all, and he was going to pick something completely, you know, obscure that he would,

218
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,120
you know, something completely insane, I don't even know where that bet came from, to do

219
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,620
if it actually did that, so.

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,920
It's kind of one of those, like, when pigs fly, the game will sell a million copies,

221
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,300
so when Loki puts on a tingle suit, the game will sell a million copies.

222
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,040
Here's the second question from pkjr92, um, sure, anyway, here's my second question, why

223
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,440
all the hate towards the Playstation 3 with the exception of Loki?

224
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Sure there is almost no support from Sony, but if you have a high def TV, the games look

225
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
amazing.

226
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,900
Now I realize that not everyone has a nice TV, but the games still have the ability to

227
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,100
be more in-depth than Xbox 360 games, and the Playstation Network is free!

228
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
How about that?

229
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah, but you get what you pay for with the Playstation Network, unfortunately.

230
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,500
I think you kind of said it yourself in the wording, you said, but the games still have

231
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,520
the ability to be more in-depth than Xbox 360.

232
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
But aren't.

233
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
But aren't.

234
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
That's the part you didn't say.

235
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
But aren't.

236
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Yet.

237
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,320
I mean, sure, the Playstation 3 is capable of a lot.

238
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
Let's see it!

239
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Let's see it!

240
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,560
You know, home, little big planet, that kind of stuff gets us excited, you know?

241
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,440
I'd be pissed if I had to pay for Playstation Network, because it's seriously not worth

242
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,640
my time, I would say.

243
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,200
I try really hard to not bag on Sony.

244
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,400
I think I've given the PSP a lot of slack, and you know what, it's really come a long

245
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
way, I think, since the release.

246
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,440
But the Playstation 3, you know, it really needed to be... it wasn't first out there,

247
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,300
it really needed to be something great on day one, and it just wasn't.

248
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,400
So that's that.

249
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,800
He also wants to say, by the way, thanks for broadcasting on Super Bowl Sunday, considering

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,760
not everyone is in love with football.

251
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,480
However, the Stanley Cup Finals are a totally different thing, pretty much all of Canada

252
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
watches.

253
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Well, sorry for going on and on.

254
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,760
You know a lot of Americans watch the Super Bowl, though, we are in the minority of not

255
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
watching it.

256
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,760
In fact, I believe this year's Super Bowl was the second highest rated American television

257
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
thing ever, behind the final episode of MASH.

258
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,960
But keep in mind, the final episode of MASH aired before there was cable and stuff.

259
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,400
So no broadcast network thing is ever going to do that well again.

260
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,440
Anyway, you want to say something, puppy?

261
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,640
I was just thinking that we don't broadcast from Canada, so...

262
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
That is true.

263
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,960
I don't even know when the hockey season ends or starts, so...

264
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Hockey's pretty fun, though.

265
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,400
One of these days I'm going to get Melody to take me to a Sharks game in San Jose, well

266
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
let's see.

267
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,120
She gets season passes and all that stuff.

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

269
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
Let's go to another email.

270
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,400
This one comes to us from Sakura Max.

271
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,680
Hi, OLR, you people have influenced me to make an OLR Dragon Force movie contest.

272
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,520
We thread on OLR website, and that would be at www.orangehonchord.com.

273
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,040
You record footage of you playing your favorite games and play Dragon Force in your video.

274
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,000
It was influenced by the Yaris video and your mentioning of Dragon Force, hope it goes well.

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,760
For those who might be new to our program, we said that you can make a bad game even

276
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,840
better most of the time by putting Dragon Force music to it, because Dragon Force is

277
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,320
just that awesome.

278
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
And so some of our listeners have taken it upon themselves to do this, and now Sakura

279
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
Max wants to make a little contest out of it.

280
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,560
I say go for it.

281
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
It's pretty awesome.

282
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't know what we can contribute for prizes.

283
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,000
Maybe we're trying to reserve some things on the prize table for something else, but

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
maybe we can dig up something.

285
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
So participate.

286
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,200
And a complete side note, Dragon Force sucks ass live.

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Really?

288
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Yes, they do.

289
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
When did you see them live?

290
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,640
I didn't, but I know they are.

291
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,740
I heard on the radio that they were going to be playing live at some event coming up

292
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,920
in like two months from now in Sacramento.

293
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,840
So I just decided, oh, hey, I'll see what they sound like live, and went to YouTube,

294
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,360
and was terribly disappointed.

295
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,400
All right.

296
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Well here comes the next email, one of two remaining emails we're going to read this

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
week.

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,720
Sorry if we didn't get to your email, but we got a few this week.

299
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
This comes to us from J-Rod.

300
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,200
I think this is a Loki hate mail.

301
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,080
Oh crap, oh crap.

302
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Good times.

303
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Let me back away.

304
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
I love these emails.

305
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
All right, here we go.

306
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,480
I just wanted to write in, nah, it's not really a hate mail.

307
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,040
I just wanted to write in and completely put over Loki.

308
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,520
There's anger and cynicism on the show not only make for hilarious radio, but most of

309
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
the time echo my own thoughts.

310
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
All right, I was lying.

311
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
It's not a hate mail.

312
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,440
Quite a few times though it seems like he's very out of place, because Rob and Jamie are

313
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,520
pretty optimistic people, and it's usually silent after one of Loki's rants.

314
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,500
Not one of those let him have the stage silent moments, but an uncomfortable what's this

315
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,200
guy's deal silent moments.

316
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,680
I was surprised to hear that Loki and Sky used to room together.

317
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,000
I was just so interested in the relationship between all you guys, because you seem so

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
radically different.

319
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,800
But say you.

320
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,680
So are you just an angry person who rants all the time?

321
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm not an angry person.

322
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Yeah.

323
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,480
No, something you guys should know, in the time that I lived with Loki, it's not like

324
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,080
he goes around in his personal life and goes, oh my God, what the hell?

325
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Very much.

326
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,480
I mean, he does once in a while, but only when super bacon baking goes wrong.

327
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
I don't bake super bacon anymore.

328
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
You did back in the day.

329
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I do back in the day.

330
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
You know it.

331
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, the way, obviously, I think I've told a story on the show before, but to go back,

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,680
remember Orange Lounge Radio History, when we started this show, the first few years

333
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,880
that we were doing it, it was all about DDR and music-based video games.

334
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,120
That's because Loki, myself, and Dark Sakura all met at an arcade playing DDR in the local

335
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Sacramento scene.

336
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,440
We used to play together with some other folks and go out to dinner afterwards, to this restaurant

337
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
that was right across the street from Golf Land.

338
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,720
And so we wanted to kind of create a show that had that feel of going to dinner and

339
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,120
talking smack about games and talking about the community or what have you.

340
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,960
It's kind of, I guess you could say it's a spin-off of another show I used to be on,

341
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,320
Understation Live, which is a very similar kind of vibe.

342
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,720
So that's why we're here.

343
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,400
And Loki and I used to be roommates because there was just a point where Loki was looking

344
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,300
to move out the same time I was, and it just made sense.

345
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,960
So there you have it.

346
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,880
As far as us being silent when he does rants and things, you know, sometimes there's just

347
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
no way to respond.

348
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
There's no way to respond.

349
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,360
Also, I have to be honest, I'll let you in on a little secret, we have to multitask like

350
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,000
crazy to make this show happen.

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,040
I mean, keep in mind, relatively on this show for a live radio program, there's not a lot

352
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,920
of dead air.

353
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,540
And keep in mind that when Jamie, myself, and Loki are all here, we're juggling from

354
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,400
story to story, trying to kind of glance at the parts of the story we actually want to

355
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
read on the air.

356
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,440
We're trying to read the chat room.

357
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,720
We're trying to, you know, bring up everything.

358
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,920
So sometimes we can't totally focus on what's being said.

359
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,280
So sometimes I kind of get in that mode where when Loki rants, I just let him rant.

360
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,240
I go, okay, Loki's ranting, you know, just kind of let him do his thing.

361
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,120
Because it is insanely funny to listen to and the listeners love it, so why not, right?

362
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Sure.

363
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Everyone loves Loki.

364
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,320
And in terms of multitasking, Loki's still doing that now.

365
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,040
Yeah, he's playing his fucking game while I try to do the mailbag.

366
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,320
I am contributing to the show, okay?

367
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,440
I am talking.

368
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,280
It's just, it's been the black circles, only two keys, and I can do that with one hand.

369
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,120
Alright, one more thing in J-Rod's email that I think is great, unfortunately Jamie's not

370
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
here to see it.

371
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,600
She said, also, I attached a picture I took before I went to see Rambo that you guys might

372
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
like.

373
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,080
Awesome show and keep on rocking.

374
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,740
And J-Rod's signature as always.

375
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,520
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

376
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,220
And here's the email in front of the Olive Garden.

377
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,240
There is who I assume to be J-Rod wearing a Silent Hill shirt.

378
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,520
I actually own that exact same Silent Hill shirt.

379
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
That's awesome.

380
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,680
And I hope Pyramid Head was going to go in there and cut up some pasta for you guys to

381
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
have.

382
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,480
By the way, F-you to the Olive Garden for getting rid of the dish I like there, the

383
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,800
Tuscan chicken dish.

384
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Oh, oh no.

385
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Ah, they got rid of it.

386
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
They have a new thing that's pretty good though.

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,760
And I don't want to hear from the listeners that go, Olive Garden isn't real Italian food.

388
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
I know.

389
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
It's not.

390
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
You win.

391
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
It's not real Italian food.

392
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
But you know what?

393
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Some days you feel like, like some days you feel like a gourmet burger, right?

394
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,740
You want to go to Black Angus, right?

395
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,160
Some days you feel like McDonald's.

396
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,440
I say the same thing with Italian food, okay?

397
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,200
And unless you have Italian parents, you're not going to get real Italian food.

398
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Probably not.

399
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,880
Or an Italian grandmother, honestly.

400
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,840
Yeah, I came from that kind of a family, so I know what Italian food is.

401
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
You had a nana?

402
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,880
Oh yeah, my grandma, she spoiled me and my brother.

403
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Alright.

404
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Not just with food.

405
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Alright.

406
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Oh, buying you video games and stuff?

407
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Oh, of course, yes.

408
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Alright.

409
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,400
One last email here, and it comes to us from Gray Fox.

410
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,360
Hey, OLR gang, first of all, I would just like to say that it's cool that Rob and I

411
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,680
are now officially friends on Facebook.

412
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,280
Now I can look at all of his sexy pictures without him even knowing.

413
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Hey now.

414
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Whoa, did I say that out loud?

415
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Haha, just kidding.

416
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm not that creepy.

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I think you are a little bit.

418
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Actually, no, I'm kidding.

419
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Anyways.

420
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,080
Oh my god, I'm as bad as Loki.

421
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,740
I was wondering if it was possible to listen to some of the first episodes you guys recorded.

422
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,920
The podcast feed only lets me go back to listen to October 2005.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,280
Actually, it does.

424
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,000
I didn't even think the podcast feed went that far back, unless you've been listening

425
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,800
that long, because usually the podcast feed only keeps like 20 shows.

426
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
That's it.

427
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Also, I really like Dark Sakura's classic Game of the Week segment in the show.

428
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
I think that it is good to pay respect to our elders, as Rob puts it.

429
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,200
I loved Batman for the NES back in the day, but I'm not sure if it would have quite the

430
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
same appeal now.

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Batman was a pretty awesome game.

432
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,560
It was one of the better movie to video game games.

433
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,720
Recently I stumbled upon the Lego Star Wars series for PlayStation 2, and I can't believe

434
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,040
how much fun it is.

435
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,320
Really good party game that is really easy and even hilarious at some points.

436
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,280
I highly recommend it for anyone that just wants to have some good old fashioned fun.

437
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,840
Last comment, I'm thinking about purchasing a PSP, but was wondering if Loki knew if it

438
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,680
was worth installing custom firmware on it, or if I can run homebrew on it without it.

439
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,240
You have to put a custom firmware to run homebrew on it.

440
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
Thanks and keep up the great work, Gray Fox.

441
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
P.S.

442
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I hope another fly lands in Rob's coffee, because that was friggin' hilarious.

443
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
Oh, and say no to exploding babies.

444
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,000
Thankfully, the fly problem in here seems relatively taken care of, except for the one.

445
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There was the one.

446
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There was the one.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
He was flying around here earlier, and he flew in front of my face.

448
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,160
He's not being too annoying as his brothers and sisters were a few weeks ago.

449
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Relatively the fly problem's been in check here in the studio, and I think that's as

450
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,860
it's been getting warmer outside.

451
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,920
So there you have it.

452
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,280
The other question was about the old episodes of the show.

453
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,760
You know, at this time we don't have any of the really old shows posted.

454
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm going to be honest, most, some of them are lost and will probably never be heard

455
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,640
again unless some of our old listeners who used to record happen to have them.

456
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,480
I know one for sure is gone.

457
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
It's really old.

458
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,440
It's like episode 80-something, I think.

459
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,360
But a lot of the old shows we do kind of have, but our problem with distributing the old

460
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,600
shows is this.

461
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,020
We used to play music during the breaks on the old shows, and so for us to like sell

462
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,720
DVDs or whatever is kind of difficult because we had the music during the breaks, plus the

463
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
show really wasn't like what it is now.

464
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,120
I mean, if you think we get off topic now, you should hear the old show.

465
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,760
I mean, my God, it was a mess.

466
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
In a good way.

467
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,880
It was a fun mess, you know, but it was much different.

468
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,160
So if, I think it's kind of one of those things where I want to let true, and I'm sure

469
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Loki and Darkseid were, we want to let true fans of Orange Lawns Radio who like our band

470
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,000
and stuff, we want to let them hear it, but we don't want to put it out there so much

471
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,200
that people are going to hear that thinking that is Orange Lawns Radio today because they

472
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,180
would be like really off.

473
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,920
So does that make sense?

474
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,720
And back when the studio was like a six by six foot square box.

475
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
Drunami says in the chat room, the old OLR was a great clusterfuck.

476
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,720
Yes it was.

477
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,920
I don't know, maybe like in the forums or on the LJ community or something, I'll

478
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,760
put an old episode, or Facebook for you obviously, I'll put an old episode up there so you

479
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,280
can kind of taste what it's like.

480
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,040
And I know like Misty and DDR Angel when she was around, she hasn't been around a lot

481
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,600
lately, but I know both of them really keep a lot of archives, so I'll try to put up

482
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,200
an episode that even Misty doesn't have and everybody will like that, at least those

483
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
that want to hear it.

484
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,280
So there you have it, our mailbag.

485
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,920
If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelownsradio.com.

486
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,680
So if you're a member of Steam, you have a lot of other friends that are going to

487
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:38,200
be on there of course, because Steam has hit 15 million accounts.

488
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,000
That's quite a lot, and of course lots of good content that they have on there and they

489
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
keep adding more stuff.

490
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,160
So apparently Valve had a lot to do with it, their Steam-based sales have jumped 158% over

491
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,240
the holiday season compared to the previous ones, so that's pretty awesome.

492
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Definitely a viable source for gaming.

493
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,680
I still have yet to even check out Steam.

494
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,280
Have you ever used Steam?

495
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Right.

496
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
I don't know.

497
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Like I buy games.

498
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Oh, stop.

499
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,560
Yeah, and you're going to get in trouble for that someday, but you know, what about its

500
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
other elements?

501
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,720
Like doesn't it have like the XFire thing built into it too where you can message across

502
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
games and stuff?

503
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Like I like XFire, it's pretty cool.

504
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,280
The NYR fam loves Steam in chat, he says Steam is the best, it kicks games for Windows apps.

505
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm not saying I have pirate games on the PC, I haven't bought games on PC in a long

506
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,400
time because up until recently I haven't had a PC that can run games.

507
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,880
The last game I bought on PC was Final Fantasy XI, so it's been a while, I mean I guess crisis

508
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,280
since that came out, well that came with my graphics card though, but it's still, I'm

509
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,200
looking forward to some stuff coming out like Spore and stuff, I'll buy that.

510
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,920
Alright, well let's go over to the Nintendo Wii because we haven't been showing Nintendo

511
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,320
a lot of love tonight and I want to talk about some stuff that's coming on the Wii soon and

512
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,240
that is everyone's Nintendo channel.

513
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,960
You might remember this came out in Japan a little while ago and it was kind of like

514
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
a preview channel.

515
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,200
You could check out some new games that are coming out, now not that you really download

516
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,060
full demos and stuff, but you get interviews, basically it's one giant infomercial of a

517
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,720
channel, but the big thing was the DS downloads, that you could get, you could get DS demos

518
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,680
beamed to your DS, and the question was, when in the hell is it coming to the US?

519
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,400
Well the answer is, about next month.

520
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,040
That is coming from an insider source reporting to Kotaku, who ran the story earlier this

521
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
week.

522
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm not surprised.

523
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,480
The channel will be home to some of the same sort of video game videos that you see on

524
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,120
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

525
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,960
Convention videos might actually start popping up on the channel once it goes live in the

526
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
States.

527
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm assuming because like Penny Arcade Expo is up in that same area where Nintendo of

528
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,040
America is, maybe that's one you can expect to see?

529
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I don't know.

530
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Maybe.

531
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,320
I wouldn't be surprised because I want to say March is also the estimated time for when

532
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,960
the WiiWare channel is going to launch, and I bet all of this is going to be documented

533
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,840
when they, I don't know if they have a keynote at, I want to say at the Game Developers Conference,

534
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,360
which is, God I think that's next week or the week after.

535
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
It is.

536
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Sadly I'm not going.

537
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,960
I don't think any of us are.

538
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,320
And I know talking to some buddies over All Games or at least listening to their shows,

539
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,880
All Games Interactive, our friends over there, only Jessica is going, and Bobby B's not going

540
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
this year.

541
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Yeah.

542
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Which is kind of too bad.

543
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
It's, you know, I would love to go, but.

544
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,740
Well, it's not really a media event.

545
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,260
You know, it's not E3, and I think a lot of people get that confused and they expect the

546
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,600
big announcements at Game Developers Conference.

547
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,160
It's not really for you, it's for developers.

548
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,840
But you may, but sometimes because of that you get new engines, like we talked about

549
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,240
last week, the Crysis 2 engines that we showed you.

550
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
You get to get little peaks from a developer angle, but that's really it.

551
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,880
And also you get to see stuff like you might not normally see.

552
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,600
Like I'm expecting them to talk about WiiWare since that makes sense from a developer's

553
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,560
standpoint that they would want to address that stuff.

554
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,720
Also there's rumors that, you know, that Microsoft is going to have something similar to like,

555
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,640
you know, a YouTube of gaming type thing that they may discuss too.

556
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,760
You'll see announcements like that, you know, talking about their network upgrades and crap

557
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
like that.

558
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,560
So that's what I'm kind of excited for, and god damn seriously Sony, I mean, the PlayStation

559
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,760
Eye have seen a lot of those cool things that they're showing off in their blogs and stuff.

560
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,080
Start implementing some of this stuff.

561
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,760
I mean, they have really good ideas, but they're just kind of like, look what we can do with

562
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
this!

563
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,960
But we're never going to use it, so fuck it, you know, come on!

564
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,400
All right.

565
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,160
I want to say really quickly before we get to the next story, TigerClaw is in chat and

566
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,000
he's a big listener over at AGI.

567
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,720
In fact, I think he came to our show because of all games and our syndication there.

568
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,640
He says Jessica's bringing the Justin cam with her, he thinks.

569
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,960
So that's kind of cool, if she's taking that cam with her.

570
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,280
Justin TV is a great way to get that.

571
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,700
I wish we were able to go more mobile with Justin TV.

572
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,860
I think we can, because we have a laptop and camera, it's just difficult.

573
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
You know, it's not easy.

574
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Because they're not together.

575
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,640
Well, you know, you can get the cameras loose.

576
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,980
Well, most people put the camera in the backpack, or I mean, put the laptop in the backpack

577
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,160
and have the wire sticking out and put the, I mean, you can do it with that eyesight because

578
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,440
that eyesight pops right out of the base, so you could just strap it to a helmet.

579
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,400
We could do it, but it's just, it's hard.

580
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,740
And it wouldn't run for very long on that laptop's battery either, because the laptop

581
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
doesn't function when it's closed.

582
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,780
I don't know if that's a setting I can change on there, but oh well.

583
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
It's not worth it.

584
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,400
Do you really want to see us out and about in public?

585
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I don't think so.

586
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Let's have our privacy.

587
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Maybe.

588
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,840
Mine works with the thing closed.

589
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,400
Ah, don't, don't, don't give my ideas.

590
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm just saying, all right.

591
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,880
A game I wasn't too hot on, but a lot of other people were, Drawn to Life.

592
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,240
THQ has announced that it's going to be coming to the Wii, which is cool.

593
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,560
I mean, it was a neat game, I guess.

594
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,880
I just probably need to play it a little bit more, but it's a game where you can draw your

595
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
own character.

596
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,200
Fortunately, it's not a magic pen gel or graffiti kingdom, because, oh god, I love those games.

597
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,480
Those games are endless possibilities, endless possibilities, especially when you're drunk.

598
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,760
It's just like, oh god, and you can have Red Blob versus Blue Blob, Penis versus 2DX controller,

599
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
you know?

600
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
It's hilarious.

601
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Good times.

602
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Good times.

603
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
All right.

604
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,360
Before we get into our next news story, we're going to be getting into tonight's new game

605
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,640
very soon.

606
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,160
And as I mentioned, the entire chat room has the possibility to participate, but you have

607
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,920
to participate through private message.

608
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,920
During tonight's game, the chat room will be locked, and you will be unable to speak

609
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,180
in the chat room during the game.

610
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,100
This is to prevent cheating from you guys for helping each other out.

611
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,560
So you have to play this game through private message.

612
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,360
So if you are interested in playing tonight's game, you have to send me, and just in TV

613
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
chat will not work.

614
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,780
You need to be in chat.orangeandraday.com.

615
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,060
If you are interested in playing tonight's game and possibly winning the prize tonight,

616
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,640
which is Res HD or something else if you don't have an Xbox 360, just send me a private message.

617
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm Skye in the chat room.

618
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
That's S-K-I-E.

619
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,240
Send me a private message that just says, me, or I want to play.

620
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Me.

621
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Okay?

622
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,040
Send me a private message if you want to play, and we'll let you know the next part very

623
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,320
soon when we reveal what we're going to be playing tonight and the contestant who's going

624
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,920
to be coming in over the phone.

625
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,800
So while you guys send that in, I've got one more story for you guys.

626
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:28,260
Nintendo has apparently revealed that they have sold 10 million virtual console games.

627
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,920
So even if you think that, okay, so 10 million, the lowest price somebody's paying for those

628
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,440
is five bucks, that's $50 million they've earned on the virtual console games, considering

629
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,260
most of the stuff was written off, gone, we're never going to profit off of this stuff again.

630
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:51,840
So there it went in free money, basically, from the virtual console, and Satoru Iwata,

631
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,400
who's of course the president of Nintendo, talked about that this is proof of the value

632
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
of digital distribution, however, not totally discounting the retail channel, saying that

633
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,840
the retail channel is still important, but also admits that retail is not quite as profitable.

634
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,240
It's low profit margins on the box titles.

635
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,440
So could Nintendo be stepping more and more into digital distribution?

636
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,720
Who knows?

637
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Possibly quite soon.

638
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,800
Yeah, not any time soon, because they're freaking slow.

639
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,120
Where are they going to put all those digital downloads on the box?

640
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,160
You can't digitally download a Wii remote or a balance board and all that crap you got

641
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
to buy.

642
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,840
Before you get to your story, Loki, I want to say, for those in chat, if you try to do

643
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,740
a private message conversation via DCC, it will not work.

644
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,420
The DCC client that's built into MIRC, you need to do it another way.

645
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,640
Look at Dark Tetsuya's post in chat.

646
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,840
He shows you guys how to do it.

647
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,240
So please get to doing that.

648
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,120
Tomitsu Magazine had some details on the brand new Mario Kart Wii.

649
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,560
It's going to sport 32 courses, mid-air tricks, and of course, Mii integration, which sounds

650
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
pretty awesome.

651
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,500
They're going to be remaking, I know, some of the tracks that were in Mario Kart DS,

652
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,120
as well as pretty much all the Mario games.

653
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,800
Of course, they are saying that 16 of the tracks that are going to be from other games

654
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,400
and the other 16 are brand new, although I wish there were more brand new tracks and

655
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,040
less of the repeated tracks, but whatever.

656
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,380
12-player online matches will also be available, and you'll be able to play 4-player split

657
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,280
screen, and I think you can play 2-player over online, too, so you can do 2 people per

658
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,960
console as well.

659
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,320
Ghost downloads, time trials will also be available, and you can also, of course, choose

660
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,440
a bike or a kart.

661
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,920
I wonder which version of Rainbow Road they would use, because there's quite a few.

662
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,280
And you know if they don't do Rainbow Road just right, people are going to be pissed,

663
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
so we'll see.

664
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,120
All right, you ready to get to tonight's game?

665
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Yay!

666
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,660
All right, well let's get to tonight's game.

667
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,640
By the way, you only have about 15 more seconds to send me a private message or you are out.

668
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,880
You cannot join the game midway through.

669
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,160
You are out if you don't send me a private message, okay?

670
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Time is almost up.

671
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,080
However, we need to get one contestant on the phone, so hopefully if you answered Friday

672
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,520
the 13th in our thing earlier, you might want to stand by the phone, because it could be

673
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,200
ringing right now.

674
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,240
Let's put in the number of our contestant.

675
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,080
Live radio folks, sorry for any delays or dead area here.

676
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,880
Here it goes, it's ringing.

677
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,160
Hello, is this Tiger Claw?

678
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,400
Yo, what's up?

679
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

680
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,360
Guess what?

681
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,480
Yeah, I think I know.

682
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
You think you know?

683
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,360
That's right, you're going to be playing a game with us tonight.

684
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,560
Tiger Claw, it's a brand new game.

685
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
What do you think about that?

686
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Oh, exciting.

687
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,080
I know, it's very exciting.

688
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,760
How would you say your knowledge of video game trivia is?

689
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,400
Well, I would guess so and so, considering that I've been around since it was invented.

690
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,960
Do you think that, were you playing Pong back in the day?

691
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,640
Yeah, my first video game was Pong, and after that was the Power 2600.

692
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,800
Awesome, well then maybe you have an advantage.

693
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,260
Do you think you know enough about video game trivia that you could beat the entire chat

694
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,680
room at video game trivia?

695
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,200
Maybe, I don't know, I didn't play every single video game that's out there.

696
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,720
That's not a game show answer.

697
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,680
That's not a game show answer, you're supposed to say, fuck yeah, I can beat them.

698
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,480
I could see what I possibly know, man.

699
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
I know.

700
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
He sucks.

701
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,760
Well, you know what, Tiger Claw, I hope you can do it, because tonight we are going to

702
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:58,760
be playing a new game called One vs. the Chat Room.

703
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,520
That's right, it's a take of another popular show that you might be hearing on the television.

704
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,320
One vs. the Chat Room, so here it is.

705
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,480
You're playing tonight, Tiger Claw, to win a possible copy of Res HD on the Xbox 360.

706
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,520
Do you own an Xbox 360?

707
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Of course.

708
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Alright, do you have Res HD?

709
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Nope.

710
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,900
Oh, then you know you'd be perfect for winning this code, but here's the thing, Tiger Claw,

711
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,320
if at any point during the game, we're going to ask you some questions, if at any point

712
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,800
during the game, the Chat Room beats you, we're going to give it to one of them.

713
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,880
By the way, chatters, if you don't have an Xbox 360, or you already have Res HD, we're

714
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,400
going to offer you something off of our brand new prize table, and tonight, since I know

715
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,920
you guys all have PCs, we're going to be giving away, if you don't have Res HD, we're going

716
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,160
to give you a brand new PC game from our buddies at PopCap, who sent us some PC games earlier

717
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
this week, so everybody has a chance to win something tonight, even if you don't have

718
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,360
an Xbox 360.

719
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,400
Let me explain how the game works.

720
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,800
Everybody that's in chat, pretty soon, the chat is going to go into lockdown, you will

721
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,680
not be able to speak publicly within the room, it's going to get very quiet in there, you

722
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
will only be able to play this game through private message.

723
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm going to be asking Tiger Claw multiple choice questions with three possible answers.

724
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,440
You will have about 30 seconds to send your answer to me via private message, then Tiger

725
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,480
Claw will answer the question.

726
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,920
If he gets it right, anybody in chat who gets it wrong will be eliminated and will not be

727
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,680
able to proceed any further in the game.

728
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,540
Anybody who gets it right along with Tiger Claw will go to the next question.

729
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,560
If Tiger Claw gets through five questions without the chatroom beating him, then he

730
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,640
will win the game.

731
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
If, however, at any point, and it could be on the very first question, if at any point,

732
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,560
even on the very first question, if he loses, those that got the right answer will be eligible

733
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,400
to win the prize we will pick one of the chat chatters randomly to win the prize

734
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,820
so we'll kind of explain that a little more as we move through it let's see how

735
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,680
many chatters are actually playing tonight want to see how many chatters we

736
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,600
have and who you're playing against? Tigerclaw? Probably the entire chat room. Just about I

737
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,200
hate to say it we have just about the entire damn chat room we're playing

738
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,200
against tonight let's see we got Rama that's one, Frisbee two, RosteelUT three,

739
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,400
GS 191 four, GS 68 five, Junami six, PK Runo seven, Amaze Atsuma eight, SJ 100

740
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,720
Matt nine, Solarwing ten, Dark Tetsuya eleven, Ryoma twelve, Cheeseburger thirteen,

741
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:39,320

742
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:48,600
Dad seventeen, Zeni eighteen, Seed Store nineteen, Raven's Dolphin twenty, and AJ Mix twenty one. So it's

743
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,120
you versus twenty one people think you can do it? Well I'll give it a try. All

744
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,120
right you got to do your best that's all we ask so everybody in chat wish each

745
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:03,360
other luck we'll give them just a minute to do that okay and here we go the chat

746
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,760
room is now locked nobody will be able to tell type in chat and help each

747
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,960
other out let's get to the very first question an ops you have the power to

748
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,800

749
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,840
in our chat have the power to override that like Rama and them but I asked for

750
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,880

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:36,440
character named Ferris was it a Final Fantasy 4 B Final Fantasy 5 or C Final

833
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:45,240
Fantasy 9 again that's a 4 b 5 or c 9 and the character's name is Ferris let's

834
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,760
give the chat a chance to think

835
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:59,800
I need I need the full soundtrack to this show I think yeah there's a

836
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,640
different song for when they were doing the well I only have the one so shoot me

837
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:15,080
we just started off by saying what versus fine one versus six here it is so

838
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,680
somebody's walking away with the prize one of these seven people is gonna win

839
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,800
the prize Tiger claw it's time in which Final Fantasy game was there a character

840
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,920
named Ferris was it a Final Fantasy 4 B Final Fantasy 5 or C Final Fantasy 9 I'm

841
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,160
gonna have to say Final Fantasy 9 all right let's see if that's the correct

842
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,760
answer the Final Fantasy game that had a character named Ferris was Final Fantasy

843
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:49,960
5 I'm sorry Tiger Claw you have lost to the mob in the chat room this is where

the mob cheers I'm sorry Tiger Claw you did very very well though this is a very

845
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,520
hard game for the person in the hot seat to win I think you should be very proud

846
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,600
of yourself okay hey no problem not too familiar with Final Fantasy that's why I

847

857
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,740
chatters are wondering which one of us is gonna win it alright so here we go

858
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,560
let's see who is gonna be knocked out we have that person moves on that person

859
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,400
moves on that person moves on that person moves on that person all six of

860
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,400
them got it right in chat I think we should narrow the field a

861
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,040
little bit you want to narrow the feel a little bit while one more question I

862
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,880
I think so, all right, fine then.

863
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,040
We'll narrow the field a little bit with one more question.

864
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,000
All right, in order to do that,

865
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,080
we gotta put this in moderated mode again

866
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,060
so they can't cheat.

867
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,260
So some poor people were just trying to chat.

868
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,100
Here we go.

869
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,700
Here is the fifth question.

870
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,040
All right, the fifth question is in the category

871
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,400
games Rob hates.

872
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,320
And I didn't have the question fully typed out.

873
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,520
Hold on, somebody fill time for just a moment here.

874
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,040
What games do you hate, Logie?

875
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,040
I'm hating this level of spin black circle.

876
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,120
But...

877
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,360
You've been going at this one level for like 15 minutes.

878
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
I got close to the end too, it's pissing me off.

879
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,680
I hate, oh gosh, I think,

880
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,620
I don't know, anything Barbie.

881
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,400
You need to be more that Velociraptor.

882
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,240
Here we go.

883
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,060
I know.

884
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,000
Here we go, we're gonna eliminate a few more people here

885
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,440
on this question for games Rob hates.

886
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,440
Okay, in the game Bubsy, have you ever played Bubsy?

887
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,280
Unfortunately, yes, and Bubsy 3.

888
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,520
Oh, I'm sorry for you, okay.

889
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,360
Here it is.

890
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,020
In the game Bubsy, which of the following

891
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,900
did you collect for points?

892
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Was it A, cheese pieces, B, yarn balls, or C, leaves?

893
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,600
I actually put one, two, three in chat,

894
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
but it shouldn't be that big a deal.

895
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,240
Okay, was it cheese pieces, yarn balls, or leaves?

896
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,360
I remember this one.

897
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,620
See if we can get it right.

898
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,240
God, I wasn't part of the mob, if you think you're that.

899
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,400
You could be a, maybe an accent,

900
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,360
you could be a special guest celebrity on the mob.

901
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,080
Bob's that, could you do the special and you're not sure.

902
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,840
All right, all the chatters are in, cut off the theme.

903
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,840
All right, thank God.

904
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,700
All right, let's see, let's go through one at a time

905
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,120
to see who got it right and who didn't get it right.

906
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Let's see, all right, wow.

907
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,040
All right, the correct answer in the game,

908
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,560
Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?

909
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,160
It was not cheese pieces, it was not leaves,

910
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,560
it was yarn balls, is the correct answer.

911
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,600
He's a cat.

912
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,220
And how many of the chatters do you think we eliminated?

913
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,060
None.

914
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:14,880
None.

915
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,720
Damn.

916
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,560
None of them, it's all six.

917
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,080
So, Puppy, I need you to pick a number, one through six.

918
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,960
I'm gonna do, oh, I should've brought out my dice.

919
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,080
Oh, you're gonna roll a dice.

920
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,840
Yes, because I hate picking random numbers.

921
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,040
It's between Ryoma, Dark Tetsuya, SSJ 100 Matt,

922
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
Drew Nami, Raw Steel, UT, and Rama,

923
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,520
is what's remaining in our chat.

924
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,360
All right, here it goes.

925
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,180
All right, here it goes.

926
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,020
What's it gonna be?

927
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,040
What did it hit?

928
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,860
Four.

929
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,700
Four.

930
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,200
Our winner tonight, boys and girls,

931
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,480
of one versus the chat room, SSJ 100 Matt, give it up.

932
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,320
Woo!

933
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,320
A winner of trivia and luck.

934
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,680
Exactly.

935
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,480
So, I'm asking SSJ 100 Matt if he's gonna take

936
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,440
the ResHD code.

937
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,000
I seem to recall last week he didn't want it.

938
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,380
Okay, he wants the other prize.

939
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,560
So, SSJ 100 Matt, coming to you very soon,

940
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,920
you're gonna be getting a copy courtesy of our friends

00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,860
Now, this is the full version.

943
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,800
This is not the crap, oh, I shouldn't say the crap version,

944
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,360
but the reduced version that you play online.

946
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,560
and if you're kinda thinking,

947
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,680
well, I don't really want Bejeweled 2,

948
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,360
this will make an awesome Valentine's Day gift

949
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,200
for somebody as well.

950
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,040
My wife loves some Bejeweled 2.

951
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,600
Exactly, the ladies love Bejeweled.

952
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,920
So, Bejeweled comes to us from our friends at PopCap.

Yeah, our first run it went pretty well.

967
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,160
I don't know how much it's gonna translate

968
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,520
to the podcast where people can't play,

969
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,600
but I think for the live listeners, that was a lot of fun.

970
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,440
For the folks on the podcast.

971
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,280
Well, it's just as much fun as watching a game show on TV.

972
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,680
Yeah, I'm hoping for the podcast listeners

973
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,640
and the folks listening to all games,

974
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,120
they could kinda like think in their mind

975
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,480
like how they would've done.

976
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Like maybe they could've had the chance

977
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,160
if they were here live on Sunday night.

978
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,840
You know everybody that watches the game show

979
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,160
thinks they can do better than the person on TV.

980
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,120
That's always the way it is.

981
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,320
All right, Peter Uno says,

982
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,400
I didn't know any of the answers.

983
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,360
He did pretty well, he says it was fun though.

984
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,760
Dark Knight says it should make it its own show.

985
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,720
Peter Uno says, make a Bimani edition.

986
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,280
Who knows, Son of Dad says

987
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,480
more fighting game questions needed.

988
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,560
Ryoma says, more trivia.

989
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,280
All right, well, I'm sure that segment

990
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,920
will make a comeback in a future edition

991
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,140
of Orange Lounge Radio.

992
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,720
I hope you guys enjoyed that.

993
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,000
All right, that's it.

994
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We're gonna go to the Skype line very soon,

995
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,540
but quickly, another couple stories for us.

996
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,640
Well, Bandai Namco is definitely taking

997
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,760
a different approach for games.

998
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,760
For the DS, they're releasing a game called 99 Tears.

999
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,760
It is basically 99 different stories

1000
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,340
that you'll read that are very depressing

1001
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,240
that are supposed to make you cry.

1002
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,320
Because apparently they think

1003
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,780
that it's very therapeutic to cry.

1004
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,440
And that gamers have emotions.

1005
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,200
It's providing with sad graphic novel

1006
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,280
to read for 15 minutes at the end of each day

1007
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,760
with a brief questionnaire following shortly after.

1008
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,660
The result will help you move closer to the story,

1009
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,720
which will make it more effectively tug at your heartstrings

1010
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,280
and further from respect of your brothers

1011
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,820
on the wrestling squad, as Joystick likes to put it.

1012
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,200
I wanna play this game and I'm never gonna cry.

1013
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,480
Maybe that should be a challenge,

1014
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,680
like make Loki cry.

1015
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,720
Oh, it'll never happen, this is gonna be crap.

1016
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,880
When was the last time you cried?

1017
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,480
Do you cry, are you a crier?

1018
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,480
Real men cry, you can cry, it's okay.

1019
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,320
I don't remember.

1020
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,560
Oh, okay.

1021
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,360
I don't wanna ruffle the personal life feathers,

1022
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,720
but I'm just curious.

1023
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,800
All right, me, I cry at every sad movie.

1024
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,020
Hell, I think I watched an episode of Wife Swap

1025
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,860
the other day I cried at it, okay?

1026
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,000
It doesn't take much.

1027
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,820
All right.

1028
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,120
Lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line,

1029
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,820
the Sega is going to be bringing a brand new game

1030
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,760
to the Nintendo DS and it's very similar to one of their old cult classics, The Typing

1031
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,760
of the Dead. However, the new game they are bringing out, The English of the Dead.

1032
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,000
The English of the Dead.

1033
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,140
First word you will learn, brains.

1034
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,200
The British of the Dead.

1035
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,500
The interesting thing though, it's House of the Dead 2, but ported to the DS. And what

1036
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,300
you have to do, you have to translate words into English from Japanese or the zombies

1037
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,900
will eat you. Sometimes the zombies speak out loud and you have to translate what they

1038
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,580
are saying. So that's going to be all kinds of things. I'd like to see how that plays

1039
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,580
out. Do you have to write it out? Because sometimes those handwriting recognitions suck.

1040
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,780
I said blue!

1041
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:04,480
Exactly. I wish this game would come out the other way around. Japanese of the Dead. Maybe

1042
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,620
learn some Japanese or some other languages.

1043
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,180
English of the Dead.

1044
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,400
English of the Dead.

1045
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,560
Grammar of the Dead. I bet Jamie would love that if she was here. She suggests a proper

1046
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,620
grammar game or something. Which actually was not proper grammar in me saying that.

1047
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,060
Oh well, who cares? Maybe I need to play it.

1048
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,980
Sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming out. We're going to open up the Skype line for

1049
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,100
your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Quickly though,

1050
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,820
any last minute stories from Loki?

1051
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:42,220
I have a few actually. Already it's confirmed that there's going to be a Professor Layton

1052
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:48,100
sequel because the game manual says there's going to be a sequel and it will have a code

1053
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,140
in it that you use in the first game or something.

1054
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,780
Shane has been talking to me about how wonderful Professor Layton is all week long.

1055
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,780
What the hell is it?

1056
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,780
It's like an adventure game.

1057
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,780
It's a logic puzzle game for the DS.

1058
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,700
Yeah, it's like an adventure game with logic puzzles and stuff like that.

1059
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,900
Apparently there's going to be no Nazis in the Lego Indiana Jones game. You have no Nazis

1060
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,900
in Star Wars either.

1061
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,540
Your faces are going to melt then.

1062
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,500
Well they're going to have some unnamed bad guys.

1063
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,700
I want some melting Legos in my Indiana Jones game.

1064
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,420
They've replaced them with anonymous genocidal occultist trench coat wearing master race.

1065
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,820
Well I want the anonymous genocidal occult trench coat wearing bastards to have their

1066
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,820
faces melt.

1067
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,140
Let's go to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1068
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,140
GS68.

1069
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,740
Hello GS68. What's on your mind my friend?

1070
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,660
I have some good news and bad news regarding 2D exit Sunnyvale Golf Land.

1071
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,980
2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land, one of our local arcades. Got some attention lately. Somebody

1072
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,260
wrote an article about classic arcades or something.

1073
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,580
You know who that guy was too.

1074
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,540
Yeah, I can't believe I'm plugging it here on the show. But I will point out how convenient

1075
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:57,380
that the person used the arcade they used to go to all the time in that article. I'm

1076
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:05,180
sure it was a real challenge to write it. But anyhow, GS68, what's on your mind regarding

1077
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,300
BeatMania Golf Land?

1078
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:12,940
Good news, we have 2DX DJ Troopers as of this week.

1079
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,620
Nice. Maybe I'll have to go play. But what's the bad news?

1080
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,340
Is it broken?

1081
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:22,580
The machine is unlocked well ahead of what it's supposed to be in Japan and that means

1082
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,820
you're planning on going in or between now and most likely May. You can't take pictures

1083
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,900
of the machine.

1084
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,900
You can't take pictures? How are they policing that?

1085
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,860
Good question. I'm not sure.

1086
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:40,660
You can't. You don't usually see that in arcades where you're completely banned.

1087
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,660
That's just challenging.

1088
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,380
Wait, is it a location test?

1089
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,140
For real. Okay, here's how you're going to do it. GS68, I will tell you how to get around

1090
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,260
this right now. I even have this on my cell phone. You get one of those phones that records

1091
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,260
video.

1092
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,260
Let me get the camera phone.

1093
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,140
Yeah, you get a camera phone and what you do is you kind of stand next to the machine

1094
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,700
and you hit the record button and then you pretend you're talking on your phone while

1095
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:10,060
you're recording the screen right there. That's how you do it. Easy as pie.

1096
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,380
And then it'll be up on YouTube and somebody will get shit in their pants.

1097
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,660
Well, I just sent you a link via a private message and that explains why we can't take

1098
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,660
pictures.

1099
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,700
Here's the thing. Usually it's the new songs people want to know and stuff. Are people

1100
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,420
not allowed to write the songs down and then post them on the internet?

1101
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:40,820
I think it'd be like the fact that the machine is unlocked well ahead of schedule.

1102
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:46,300
Yeah. Let's see. I'm looking at the post here on our friends at Bimani Style. The distributor

1103
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,540
has asked that no pictures or videos be taken yet due to the fact the machine will be fully

1104
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,380
unlocked with all hidden feature songs per my request and as a present to all the players

1105
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,920
at Sunnyvale Golfland. This is about three months ahead of Japan and we cannot have secret

1106
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,660
stuff leak on the internets so please people assist me with the small task of not allowing

1107
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,420
pictures or videos to be taken yet. Do they have a big sign hanging by the machine or

1108
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,780
anything? I don't know if you've been.

1109
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:10,620
No. Like, I went this Saturday and I pulled out my camera and then one of the players

1110
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,020
told me not to take pictures.

1111
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,020
Interesting.

1112
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:17,220
And so they're self-policing it?

1113
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:22,500
Most likely. Maybe. I mean, I wonder if I can talk to them about like having them put

1114
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:30,420
a sign in, like maybe set up a security camera. Like, in a sense, they're breaking their

1115
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,420
own rule.

1116
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,540
I don't know. For me, this sounds like a challenge.

1117
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,780
Well, I mean like facing away from the screen.

1118
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:41,520
Hmm. Interesting. Well, I mean, I know you didn't write the policy GS68. I'll stop grilling

1119
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,580
you about it. I think it's very interesting so thank you for bringing it to our attention.

1120
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,980
I'm kind of curious. I'm curious to see how long they can actually keep it a secret because

1121
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,620
in a way, that's a challenge to some people.

1122
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:56,940
Yeah. Plus, I can imagine like some guy going to the, some guy who's never played a single

1123
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,660
Bomani game, going to the arcade and they're like, hey, this machine looks really cool.

1124
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,940
And then they snap a picture and post on the internet and then the offline gets in trouble.

1125
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,940
So it says no pictures, but can you just go and write down all the stuff on a pad and

1126
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,940
paper?

1127
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,940
I know. That's what I don't know.

1128
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,260
Or you could just walk over to it, walk out to your car, write stuff down, walk back up,

1129
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,480
walk out to your car. I mean, this is stupid.

1130
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:23,420
Loki and I view this as a challenge. It is a challenge. I mean, when somebody says don't,

1131
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,820
you want to do, although I understand, you know, I, in the community maybe just doesn't

1132
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:30,420
want to spoil or whatever, you know, we should probably shouldn't be spoiled sports. Honestly,

1133
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,220
I'm not going to get to Sunnyvale Golf Line anytime soon anyway, but I do kind of want

1134
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,580
to check it out. I haven't played a arcade Beatmania game since E3 when they had the

1135
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,420
machine there that one year randomly. That's the last time I played it. So.

1136
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:48,460
I don't remember the last time I played Beatmania. SSJ 100 Matt in chat has a good point. Most

1137
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,460
people on the forums will say Pics or GTFO.

1138
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:58,340
Alright, fine. We'll get Pics. I'm not opposed to getting Pics.

1139
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,340
Alright.

1140
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,300
With the ban me from SVGL. Oh no.

1141
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Who knows?

1142
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:09,740
What's ironic about this is that, like, even if we, this game's not supposed to be in the

1143
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:15,100
U.S., so we're not allowed to take, so we're supposed to not allowed to be taking Pics

1144
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,100
to begin with.

1145
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,420
You mean it's not even supposed to be in the U.S. to begin with. I guess that's true.

1146
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,380
I mean, well, we had the U.S. location test, but that failed.

1147
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,340
Alright, well, I'm waiting for the next story where somebody gets beaten up in the parking

1148
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,660
lot over taking a picture of this game.

1149
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,300
GS68, we got to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your call.

1150
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
Take care, buddy.

1151
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,300
You too.

1152
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,460
It's just, boy, it's just something else. And by the way, speaking, because we were

1153
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,780
talking about the article here, I'll help our little friend, my bestest friend in the

1154
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,500
whole wide world who writes these articles.

1155
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,060
If you ever want to do one on Roosevelt Golf Land, here's what you just have to write.

1156
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,060
It stinks.

1157
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,060
There you go.

1158
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,580
It's a perfectly, wait, would you, would you agree with that review?

1159
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,580
Yeah, I think that's accurate.

1160
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,580
Wholeheartedly concur.

1161
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,580
Hi.

1162
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,580
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1163
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,580
Who is this?

1164
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,580
Hey there.

1165
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,980
This is Let's Have Tea.

1166
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,200
Let's Have Tea.

1167
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,900
Let's have some tea and chat a little bit.

1168
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,080
What is up, my friend?

1169
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:14,220
I just wanted to plug the game Psychonauts to anybody who hasn't checked this game out

1170
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,220
yet.

1171
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,840
I know it's kind of old, but I finally got a chance to play through it, and it's well

1172
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,140
worth the $15 on the marketplace.

1173
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:26,300
I was going to say Psychonauts is available to a whole new audience thanks to its backwards

1174
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:32,340
compatibility on Xbox 360, and I believe it's in GameTap's library, so some people playing

1175
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,660
it that way as well.

1176
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,500
So you could, don't tell me you can't play Psychonauts due to lack of availability.

1177
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,380
It's out there, right?

1178
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,380
Right.

1179
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,260
It's definitely out there.

1180
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,640
What makes Psychonauts so great?

1181
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:55,020
I'm a big adventure games fan, and it's pretty much the first, like, adventure game that's

1182
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:01,160
really got my attention since, like, Mario 64 or Banjo-The-Zooie.

1183
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,840
Is it, I hear a lot about the sense of humor in this game.

1184
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,980
Is it the sense of humor that draws you in?

1185
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah, the game is seriously, just ridiculously twisted.

1186
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,900
You infiltrate the minds of a lot of really interesting characters, and a lot of them

1187
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,860
are in, like, a loony bin, so there's a lot of weird stuff going on.

1188
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,860
I didn't see a lot of this game, so maybe I need to take your advice and go check it

1189
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,860
out.

1190
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,860
It was actually played by somebody else, but it was, I didn't see a lot of the story, I

1191
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,420
just saw the actual game, and to me it was kind of like, oh, I think I've kind of seen

1192
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,580
this game before, but you're saying, no, it's worth a second look, it really stands out,

1193
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,580
right?

1194
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,180
It's definitely worth it.

1195
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,940
Let's say they make a Psychonauts 2 someday, which with all the cult following you never

1196
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:48,940
know.

1197
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,340
What do you think, what would you most like to see in Psychonauts 2?

1198
01:06:52,340 --> 01:07:03,060
Well, in the story of it, they totally opened it up so that there's a possibility, but really

1199
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:10,420
just the way that Psychonauts 1 worked out with the sense of humor and the way that they

1200
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:18,860
were able to develop the different abilities throughout the game, usually in sequels they

1201
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:22,820
aren't able to rebuild abilities like that.

1202
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:34,180
Like if you take Banjo-Tooie from Banjo-Kazooie, it's hard to add even more to the game when

1203
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:40,340
the original game limits what you do by the moves that you have.

1204
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
That make sense?

1205
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,300
Yeah, no, it does.

1206
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,020
I'm just reading some comments from chat as well, because there are lots of people passionate

1207
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,180
about Psychonauts as well.

1208
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:52,460
Hikaru Uno, he's one of our listeners who lives in Japan currently, he says, I want

1209
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:56,060
Psychonauts but I can't get it because I'm in fucking Japan, making reference to the

1210
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,460
fact that the region is different and you can't get it on the backwards compatibility

1211
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,460
there.

1212
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,700
Son of Dad says, I bought Psychonauts at Blockbuster for $6.99, suck it Xbox Live Arcade!

1213
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:10,000
So yeah, if you can find the old Xbox disc, you can play it with backwards compatibility

1214
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,540
as well, so either works.

1215
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:16,340
Yeah, it's also a PS2 and PC game.

1216
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,340
It's everywhere.

1217
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,340
No excuses for not playing this game.

1218
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
It's all over the place.

1219
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,420
Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thank you very much for what we'll call the not quite classic

1220
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,180
game of the week, because it's not a classic yet, but it probably will be in a few more

1221
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,180
years.

1222
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,180
Not yet.

1223
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,980
Let's Have Tea, I have one more question for you before we let you go.

1224
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,820
Do you really like to drink tea?

1225
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,340
Absolutely not.

1226
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,220
I knew it!

1227
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,740
Maybe it's Mr. Tea.

1228
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,460
Are you more of a coffee drinker?

1229
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:50,420
I'm not really into any of that, I just thought it was a clever name and thought it was funny.

1230
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,420
Well you win.

1231
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,420
It is pretty funny.

1232
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,080
Especially when you consider you don't like tea.

1233
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,580
Even I like a little tea here and there.

1234
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,220
Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thanks so much for reminding us about the greatness of Psychonauts.

1235
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,220
Have a great one, okay?

1236
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,220
Yep, have a good one.

1237
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,220
Later.

1238
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,900
Alright, we can do a couple more calls, I suppose.

1239
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Oh!

1240
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,500
Skype wants us to rate the quality of that call.

1241
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,500
How was the call quality?

1242
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,540
Would you say five?

1243
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:11,540
Very good?

1244
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,540
Four good?

1245
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,540
Four or five?

1246
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,820
I'll give it a four, because I've had issues on other calls.

1247
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,700
I'm like, does he want us to...

1248
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,420
I'm not sending the whole thing, Jesus.

1249
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,220
I know, it's like, now answer thirty more questions.

1250
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1251
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,980
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Ma.

1252
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,220
Actually, this call is a two.

1253
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,220
I like that it...

1254
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:35,460
Darth Tetsuya says, rate the callers.

1255
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,460
Maybe one night.

1256
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:40,820
Like, we ought to give an incentive for the really good calls one night, like, one night

1257
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,940
we'll do nothing but phone calls, like, the really good phone call we'll give something

1258
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,180
from the price table, or something even better, I don't know.

1259
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,220
Alright, Ron Ma, what's on your mind tonight?

1260
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:55,480
Not too much, but to comment on GS68's call, if they don't want people to be taking pictures

1261
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,020
of what's coming out, when you put out these press releases, set it up in a way that you're

1262
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:04,400
not really revealing much of anything, but still, when you say not to, people are going

1263
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,400
to do it anyway.

1264
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,400
So, hey.

1265
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Well, wait a minute, though.

1266
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,100
The press release doesn't have really anything to do with this.

1267
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,940
The distributor turned on some type of cheat in the game that's not supposed to be on.

1268
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,940
But my thinking is, is that, what's to stop anyone from Japan doing the same thing this

1269
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:18,940
distributor did?

1270
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,940
Am I right?

1271
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,940
You're right.

1272
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:21,940
Hmm.

1273
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,940
I don't know.

1274
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,940
Maybe there's something about it I'm not getting.

1275
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,540
Maybe it's through the whole EMUs thing or something, so I'm sure somebody's going to

1276
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,380
say something nasty to me about it, because I'm uninformed.

1277
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,120
It's just, they have all the songs unlocked, and Japan doesn't have them all yet, and normally

1278
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:36,220
Japan's the one saying, hey, look at my song, it's unlocked, and everyone's like, oh, which

1279
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,220
is over here?

1280
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,220
It's like a play, too.

1281
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,220
But, yeah.

1282
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,220
Well, isn't it true that-

1283
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,220
So, you know what?

1284
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,220
It's our turn.

1285
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,220
That's what I want.

1286
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,220
I want you to get the first dibs on everything.

1287
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:52,380
Well, isn't it true that American versions can't get EMUs because they're not in Japan?

1288
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,380
That would seem likely, because the IP address-

1289
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,180
Things that would have to be unlocked by EMUs wouldn't normally be available here, so they

1290
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,180
just have to open it up.

1291
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:03,280
So if they can unlock everything here, and we don't get EMUs, that just means that they're

1292
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,580
plain assholes for not unlocking it at all.

1293
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,580
All right.

1294
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,820
Well, Konami does have a record.

1295
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:13,580
Kevin DDR in chat says, no one knows how.

1296
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:17,700
Somebody does, obviously, because this machine's added done to it, but I get what you're saying.

1297
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,380
I bet it's up, up, down, down, left, left.

1298
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,820
Nobody who can spread the word knows how, I guess.

1299
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,140
Rama, what else is on your mind?

1300
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,140
Anything else?

1301
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,140
Not much.

1302
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:31,740
Like Irene said earlier, I went to a Ren Faire this weekend, and out of all my costumes,

1303
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,020
I found one that would be perfect to blend right in.

1304
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,420
Okay, but I just have to give a little background, because the Ren Faire thing came up during

1305
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,380
our bonus segment, which the podcast people don't hear.

1306
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,580
So podcasters just know we were talking about the Ren Faire earlier in the show.

1307
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,540
It's not completely out of place, this comment, because that would probably be very random

1308
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,620
if you were listening to this with Not Life.

1309
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:52,820
But Rama, so you're saying you found the perfect Ren Faire outfit that's, what, a good blend

1310
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,220
with video games, a blend with this show, or what?

1311
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,940
Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video.

1312
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,120
This call is a one all of a sudden.

1313
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,620
What the fuck was that?

1314
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,380
Rama, your call went into the, he went into the loop.

1315
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,580
What the hell was that?

1316
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,580
I think you got sucked into Tron.

1317
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,620
I don't like it.

1318
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:17,020
That was like a, it was a Rama remix.

1319
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,340
Do not adjust your iPod, we heard the same thing.

1320
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,900
Alright, that's for our candidacy to put into the second mix then.

1321
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,900
I guess so.

1322
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,340
DMN, make a song out of that.

1323
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,580
God, no, no.

1324
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:33,380
Rama, I'm sorry, let's say, a good fit with our show or video games or what?

1325
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,700
A blend with video games.

1326
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,140
Now, what is it?

1327
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,140
Black Mage.

1328
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,140
Nice.

1329
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,900
Did you wear your Black Mage, you have a Black Mage outfit, did you wear it?

1330
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,900
Yes I did.

1331
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Awesome.

1332
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,380
Did you get a lot of people coming up to you wanting to take the old picture?

1333
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,100
Yes, yes I did.

1334
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:54,140
Did you take pictures with large-breasted women in corsets?

1335
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,820
I decided to keep those pictures to myself, okay, at those Ren Faires, you know, the Las

1336
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,340
Vegas rules apply.

1337
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,580
What happens at Ren Faire stays at Ren Faire?

1338
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,580
Damn right.

1339
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,460
That's right, you're not allowed to take pictures of the women in corsets and put them up on

1340
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,660
the internet or the SVGL management will get very mad at you.

1341
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,380
But some people actually thought I was Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.

1342
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,740
Well, because Vivi does look like a Black Mage, I can see that.

1343
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,860
And here's the best thing, someone walked up to me and said, you're Orko from He-Man,

1344
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,140
aren't you?

1345
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,580
That's awesome.

1346
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,500
Black Mage does look like Orko, what can you do?

1347
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,820
After hearing that five, six times, I said, the next Ren Faire I'm going to do a Jedi

1348
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,980
and I'll do Orko, see what happens.

1349
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,980
Nice.

1350
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,020
Well, Rama, glad to hear you had fun at Ren Faire.

1351
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,640
Maybe next time you and Callie will take Irene to one together, okay?

1352
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,700
Or maybe you should take her.

1353
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:45,740
I probably will.

1354
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,900
I think she sent me a private message with one that she wants to go to now, but I've

1355
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:49,900
been too busy doing the show.

1356
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,140
Let me look actually real quick while we're on the subject of Ren Faire.

1357
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,100
Oh no, I accidentally closed it during the game because I needed to keep my private message

1358
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,100
window clean during the game.

1359
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,260
Did you like the game tonight, Rama?

1360
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,660
You came very close to winning.

1361
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:00,660
That was great.

1362
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,660
I loved that.

1363
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,660
All right, good.

1364
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:03,660
I'm glad you like it.

1365
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,660
We'll have to do it again sometime.

1366
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,940
All right, Rama, we got to let you go.

1367
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,940
Have a good one.

1368
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:08,940
All right.

1369
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:09,940
You too.

1370
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:10,940
Bye-bye.

1371
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,940
One more call.

1372
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,940
Sure.

1373
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,020
Hopefully the game doesn't get caught in the loop.

1374
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,900
The crazy...

1375
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,900
Sucked into a black hole.

1376
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,620
No, what the hell was that?

1377
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:23,380
It's not ringing off the hook, so Loki, you have any last minute stories you want to do?

1378
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,380
Okay.

1379
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:28,220
1UP is going to be changing their scoring policies, apparently, how they rate games,

1380
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,220
which is quite funny.

1381
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:34,660
Now, instead of the point system, they're going to be changing it to letters, like grading

1382
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:39,460
system from A plus to F. I want you to bet there's 10 different letters in between there

1383
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,900
and nothing's changing.

1384
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,600
You know, because they're admitting that...

1385
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,600
You know what they are?

1386
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
They're admitting...

1387
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
Well, I guess it's not really admitting.

1388
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,180
AGM is going to do the same thing.

1389
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,180
It's all going to start in March.

1390
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:55,060
Because, well, I'm saying like, I don't know, A through F has a different kind of connotation

1391
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,060
to it than 1 through 10.

1392
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,620
Like F is failing.

1393
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,620
It's a miserable game.

1394
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:04,220
Whereas, I think in the 1 through 10 world, 6 is seen as failing.

1395
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:05,540
I think.

1396
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,900
So I guess that's the point I was trying to make that I didn't do very well.

1397
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,900
But who cares?

1398
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,380
Well, technically enough, it's a 60%.

1399
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,380
Who cares?

1400
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,140
It's one review site on the entire internet.

1401
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,340
I realize it's a big one, but you know, come on.

1402
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,660
It's also a magazine, AGM and Games for Windows.

1403
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,860
We live in a world where there's demos readily available.

1404
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:22,860
Make your own decision.

1405
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,900
Now, I read reviews once in a while, but I haven't found a game reviewer I really 100%

1406
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,620
trust and like yet.

1407
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,620
Maybe the guy from Zero Punctuation.

1408
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,620
I don't know.

1409
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,620
No, he's too negative.

1410
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,620
Funny, but negative.

1411
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:35,620
But he's funny.

1412
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,620
Funny, but negative.

1413
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,860
Let's go to the phones and take one last call.

1414
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,860
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1415
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,860
Who's this?

1416
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,100
Hello, this is Ross Deal, UT.

1417
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,800
Ross Deal, UT.

1418
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,800
What is up, my friend?

1419
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
Oh, nothing.

1420
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
Just shooting shit.

1421
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,900
You know how that goes.

1422
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,740
That's what we do here at Orange Launch Radio.

1423
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,740
What's up?

1424
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,740
Hell yeah.

1425
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,820
Anyway, I got a few things on my mind.

1426
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,820
Not too many, but a few.

1427
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:56,820
All right.

1428
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:04,020
First off, there's this, I don't know, there was somebody linking that already on the chat,

1429
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:08,860
this Marine who went missing.

1430
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,500
Basically what happened is that the family thinks that maybe he was playing Call of Duty

1431
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,740
and he just had a flashback or something.

1432
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:19,620
Yeah, I read about that just before the show started.

1433
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,740
That's crazy.

1434
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:25,140
I guess it gets into the whole, are games too realistic in this day and age?

1435
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,140
I don't know.

1436
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:31,180
Well, I think part of it is because he was in Iraq and if he was playing Call of Duty

1437
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:38,940
4, that there's a lot of stuff in Call of Duty 4 in the story that it's pretty hefty

1438
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:39,940
material.

1439
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:47,820
I mean, I don't want to give away any of the plot line, but you invade a Middle Eastern

1440
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,900
country and a nuclear device goes off.

1441
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,460
Oh, wow.

1442
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:58,380
Yeah, it's a very gritty game.

1443
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,820
I could definitely see where somebody who's been to Iraq, who's maybe having problems

1444
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:11,620
with post-traumatic, might play that game and get a bad reaction from it.

1445
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:19,700
They're saying that he might be actually trying not to be found, so it sounded pretty bad.

1446
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,700
Very unfortunate.

1447
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:25,380
This is not a game he should have been playing in the first place, so the question is, do

1448
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:30,060
they have it out there enough for this guy to know maybe he shouldn't play this game

1449
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:37,540
as he's very sensitive on these type of topics or suffering from this post-war syndrome?

1450
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,620
Is it the responsibility of the makers of this game to put some type of disclaimer on

1451
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,620
the game?

1452
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,620
No.

1453
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,820
No, I think this game might be too real for some people.

1454
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,820
That's stupid.

1455
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:54,940
You know, with post-traumatic stress disorder, that sort of thing, it could be any number

1456
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,760
of things that trigger it.

1457
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:06,660
Any number of things could remind somebody or give someone a bad flashback.

1458
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,300
It's very unpredictable.

1459
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:17,420
Like a lot of mental disorders, it's going to affect people in different ways.

1460
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:21,340
Not only that, but modern warfare, you know they're going to at least deal with the Arab

1461
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,660
angle somewhat.

1462
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:33,740
I was just going to say, very unfortunate news no matter where it kind of falls.

1463
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:36,460
Maybe this was the type of game he should have played with other people.

1464
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:37,860
I think that's kind of the thing, too.

1465
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,260
I know exactly what it is.

1466
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,740
It's not Call of Duty 4.

1467
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,740
What?

1468
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,740
It was Yars.

1469
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,820
He played Yars, and he's like, oh my God, I have to run.

1470
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,740
Well, that's a different kind of drama.

1471
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,380
There's a place in hell waiting for you, Loki.

1472
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,500
Okay, RustyLUT, we don't have too much time.

1473
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,900
What else did you want to say real quick tonight?

1474
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,780
There was this industry blog.

1475
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:09,860
One of these industry analyst people was talking about how there's a problem where the industry

1476
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:19,940
has no real room for anything between the tiny budget casual games and the tens of millions

1477
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,940
of dollars blockbusters.

1478
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:25,220
Let me put up a link right now.

1479
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:31,420
As far as the American market, I can certainly agree with that.

1480
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:38,860
We either see the huge budget Call of Duty and Gears of War, or we see PopCap.

1481
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:51,540
It's not as diverse a market as, say, Japan, where there's stuff all over the budget spectrum.

1482
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,820
This is an opinion piece I didn't read before tonight's show, so it's a little harder for

1483
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,380
me to comment on it.

1484
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:59,380
What do you think?

1485
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:03,220
Do we have enough variety in our styles of games that we have out there right now?

1486
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:12,460
Not so much styles, but we need a real be-real, because if you look at the American market,

1487
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:19,860
it's PopCap games type of deal, and then there's Gears of War, Call of Duty, really big budget

1488
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,460
games, and there's not a lot of stuff in between.

1489
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:28,020
If you compare that to Japan, where you see stuff like Chulipa no Ne-chan Bada, people

1490
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:34,300
just throwing crap out there, hell, even Puzzle Quest, which managed to become a hit.

1491
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:38,620
What this guy's talking about is you can't really experiment when you're dealing with

1492
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:46,580
a budget of $20 million, $30 million, because there's too much risk involved, but at the

1493
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:52,500
same time, there's really only so much you can do in a little budget 2D game.

1494
01:20:52,500 --> 01:21:00,140
Another extreme, you're not really having a lot of room for new ideas.

1495
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,500
Isn't there a similarity with movies, though, because it seems like most movies are either

1496
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:10,740
the art house cheap ones, or the explosion Michael Bay, burning money live on screen

1497
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,980
type of movies.

1498
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,620
There's not a whole lot in between there, either.

1499
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:23,700
There's also the fact that there's not a whole lot for what people want in that middle market

1500
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:29,460
because the American market's a lot different than the Japanese ones.

1501
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,940
There's a lot more people in Japan that play games, for one, but there's either you've

1502
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:37,820
got the hardcore gamers that have been doing it for years, or the people that are just

1503
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:43,220
the casual gamer market, and there really is no target audience for something in between.

1504
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,420
That's the thing, though.

1505
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:50,820
You'd think that the hardcore would be the most receptive of something like, well, you

1506
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:59,180
look at Puzzle Quest, or Chulip, or maybe not so much Chulip, or an Ejambada, just an

1507
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:06,780
idea being thrown out there with maybe a $2 or $3 million budget, and yes, you should

1508
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,500
pick up Puzzle Quest GS68.

1509
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:16,940
Let me make this comparison real quick.

1510
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:23,140
A lot of the hardcore gamers won't play a game like Bejeweled because it's not hardcore

1511
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:28,020
enough, and a lot of the people who play stuff like Bejeweled get turned off by Gears of

1512
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:34,300
War and stuff because there's too many buttons to hit, whereas with movies, anyone can watch

1513
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,900
anything, depending on the hype.

1514
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:45,540
It's true, and perhaps this is just a spot where video games just have a hard time, but

1515
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:52,020
there has to be some place where you can actually do meaningful experimentation, because you

1516
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:59,500
can't do it in the casual space, there's just too many limits.

1517
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:03,380
I suppose it would be hard to convince your wife that going to see Rambo would be a good

1518
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,980
Valentine's Day present, right?

1519
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,780
I think that's also part of it.

1520
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:15,060
We have an industry that's confined to the idea of hardcore and casual.

1521
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,340
You don't hear about hardcore moviegoers, casual moviegoers.

1522
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,620
You hear people who like action, romance.

1523
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:28,380
There's very particular crowds for types of movies, and of course the B-movie alien weirdness

1524
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,680
has its own following.

1525
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:37,140
You need to have that sort of market, for lack of a better term, market segregation,

1526
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:42,980
demographic scanning, because casual, hardcore is perhaps a little too general.

1527
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:43,980
Wow.

1528
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:49,300
Well, Ross, some great topics, some very deep topics you're bringing up tonight, but unfortunately

1529
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,300
we are running out of time.

1530
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:54,460
We've got to wrap things up, but thanks for your call and provoking some good discussion.

1531
01:23:54,460 --> 01:24:03,420
Before I go, I'd like to do a plug, you know, I've started a YouTube channel, and that would

1532
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:12,300
be youtube.com slash user slash RossDLUT, put up a link in the chat right now.

1533
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,620
And what will we find on said YouTube channel?

1534
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:22,980
Right now it's mostly music videos that I've compiled up, but I have a few vlogs as well,

1535
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:28,940
and I'm just kind of looking at some of the things that are in this, so you kind of make

1536
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,420
your own anime music videos and stuff?

1537
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,420
Gaming music videos.

1538
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:37,100
Gaming, oh not anime, GMVs, not AMVs, GMVs, I see.

1539
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:43,540
And I guess that I also have a couple of vlogs using the PlayStation Eye actually, which

1540
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:50,140
is quite an effort, but I'll go into that next time, and I'll see you later.

1541
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,900
Well best of luck with vlogging.

1542
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,900
Good luck.

1543
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,340
Have a nice one, bye bye.

1544
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,700
RossDLUT, he's always kind of the devil's advocate in chat, but then when he calls in

1545
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:04,920
he's the nicest guy, and brings up great topics every time.

1546
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,780
So thank you very much for calling in, we appreciate it.

1547
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:09,420
That's going to do it for phone calls tonight, because that's going to do it for the show

1548
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
tonight.

1549
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,420
Holy crap, that's late.

1550
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,860
I know it's kind of late when you consider that Dark Soccer wasn't even here tonight,

1551
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,300
we managed to do a three hour show, I think the game took a long time.

1552
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
Yeah, that took a big time.

1553
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,300
That's alright.

1554
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
It was fun.

1555
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,300
It was fun, right?

1556
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,300
It was worth it?

1557
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,300
Whee!

1558
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,540
Alright, let's go ahead and wrap things up here tonight.

1559
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,220
Actually first, any other last minute stories I didn't let you get to, Loki?

1560
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:33,460
There's going to be car surfing in Saints Row 2, and that's awesome.

1561
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,220
I can't wait for Saints Row 2.

1562
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:36,420
Ghost Ride the Whip.

1563
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:43,220
Yes, and apparently they have a picture where you have crashed a biplane into a building,

1564
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:49,100
or driven it through a mall, which is even better, so I'm all about a game that allows

1565
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:54,220
you to drive a plane through a mall.

1566
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,620
We all know what's waiting to happen later on.

1567
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,580
That's a feature they should have had in Dead Rising, right?

1568
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,580
Hell yeah.

1569
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,580
Alright.

1570
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,900
Puppy, thank you so much for being here tonight, and participating in the show.

1571
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,940
Talking head number three for the night.

1572
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:07,940
Hooray!

1573
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:11,180
Well, you'll have to come back again soon, and it's probably kind of nice not getting

1574
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,860
talked over tonight, because there's a lot far less people in house.

1575
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,140
Yes, and I had my own microphone the entire time.

1576
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,140
There you go.

1577
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,900
Alright, well thanks for coming, and stay away from the gunshots in your neighborhood.

1578
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:20,900
I will certainly try to.

1579
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:26,540
Alright, we don't want to see Puppy get put down, that would not be fun.

1580
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,940
Do you have any final thoughts, though, Puppy, real quick?

1581
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,940
I was looking on your prize table here, and saw these applications for passports.

1582
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,260
The passport applications are not prizes, they're just out there.

1583
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,260
I was just making sure.

1584
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,720
No, we're not giving out Rob's passport application as a prize, it's just something I'm working

1585
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,620
on for a trip I want to take in June.

1586
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,980
Which by the way, you know how they say it takes forever to get a passport right now?

1587
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:48,980
It doesn't.

1588
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:52,220
My roommate went in, and did his, like, he got it in a week.

1589
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,220
A week.

1590
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,220
He's new.

1591
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,220
Not a renewal.

1592
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,220
New.

1593
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:59,140
Well, my brother managed to get one when he went to Italy, and it took him like a week

1594
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,140
and a half to get his when he went to Italy earlier this year.

1595
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,140
Not bad.

1596
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:07,380
But thankfully I'm not going out of the country, I'm just going to Texas to meet with, for

1597
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,300
a puzzle pirates party.

1598
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,300
Nerd.

1599
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,660
I'm trying to get William to take me back to Canada, because I really want to go to

1600
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:14,660
Canada.

1601
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,260
I'm just trying to decide right now if it's going to be Vancouver, which I've already

1602
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:22,380
been to and I love, or Toronto, which I've never been to, but I really want to go to.

1603
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,220
Toronto's winning in my mind right now, but we'll see.

1604
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:32,980
I went to Canada once, I went to Victoria, and I got stuck having to go to those botanical

1605
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,980
gardens.

1606
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,340
Hey, I love the Bouchard Gardens, don't you go knocking them, unless you go in like fall,

1607
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,660
then there's not a lot to see.

1608
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:45,300
I think William told me he went to the Bouchard Gardens once in October, and I'm like, dude,

1609
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,300
you went at the wrong time.

1610
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,740
Anyway, enough travel chat.

1611
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,900
Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners?

1612
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:57,620
This spin the black circle thing is pretty addicting, except I'm on this one level.

1613
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,260
He's been playing it all fucking night.

1614
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,620
Hey, I have been participating, okay?

1615
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,460
This does not take that much participation.

1616
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:08,860
Hey, if he had been playing the Velociraptor Safari game, you wouldn't have heard a peep

1617
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:11,620
out of him, unless it was maniacal laughter.

1618
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:18,540
All right, my final thought is next week's show, I'm actually going to be out of town

1619
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:24,180
because it's holiday slash anniversary weekend, so I'm going out of town.

1620
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:29,500
We may have a late start to the show because of it, more information to come later throughout

1621
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,500
the week.

1622
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:35,200
I'm not sure exactly what the plan is yet, so there you have it.

1623
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,340
But we are looking forward to being back here next week.

1624
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,900
Frisbee suggests, I vote because of Valentine's Day this week.

1625
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,900
We need to have William, Nellie, and Dan as guests on the show next week.

1626
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:43,900
Not going to happen.

1627
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:47,500
I don't think that'll happen either.

1628
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,500
It's a good thought.

1629
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,860
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

1630
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,540
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1631
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,060
You know we can't do this without you guys.

1632
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,940
Remember, if you like Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you hear, please tell two

1633
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:03,260
friends about our show because that's the only way we get to spread the word.

1634
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,000
We don't have any big magazines or websites that back us.

1635
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,860
We are literally an independent operation run out of somebody's garage and it's your

1636
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,420
voice and talking and word of mouth that helps spread the word.

1637
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:18,140
Another reason to support us, we are not changing our review system to letters.

1638
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,140
That's right, we're not.

1639
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,460
We're going to stick with the whole vague reviews that we've always done here on the

1640
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,460
program.

1641
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:28,340
Until next time, I'm Rob, that's Loki.

1642
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,540
She will be Dark Sakura back with us next week.

1643
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,500
We'll see you then here on Orange Lawns Radio.

1644
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:38,580
You've been listening to Orange Lawns Radio.
