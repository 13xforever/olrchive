[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:40,684
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked a trivia question, and the trivia question was, which one of these games is this music from?

4
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween Friday the 13th Friday the 13th

5
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:27,480
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be picked tonight, but you will get a chance to play in the chat room, so all hope is not lost.

6
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You may still win either a copy of Rez HD, or if you don't have an Xbox, one of our other prizes from our new prize table I'll talk about a little more later.

7
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:37,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you did say Friday the 13th, you might want to stay by your phone.

8
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,189
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

9
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Loki?

10
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

11
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Fooling at Home.

12
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:50,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been available on PCs for a long time, and just not really that recently, but

13
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,488
[SPEAKER_03]: on the PS3 as well.

14
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:59,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they have hit 1 million users actually, at least on the PlayStation 3.

15
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome.

16
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 million consoles contributing to a cure for cancer or God knows what else they're doing.

17
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: All in the name of science.

18
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:16,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Calculating votes for the 2008 primaries or who knows.

19
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Making a better caffeine molecule.

20
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Better caffeine molecule.

21
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,466
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something they need to work on.

22
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Finishing Duke Nukem Forever.

23
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That is also something they need to get to working on.

24
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Also mentioning the PlayStation 3, which Folding at Home appears on.

25
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:37,827
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a brand new Japanese PlayStation 3 that's going to be coming out very soon.

26
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:41,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to come with a 40GB hard drive and a 6-axis wireless controller.

27
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.

28
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes out on March 6th.

29
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It will cost you 39,980 yen.

30
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,677
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to translate that into U.S.

31
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:53,179
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars, that's 376 U.S.

32
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:53,959
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars.

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the Satin Silver PlayStation 3, so...

34
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:01,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, of course, everybody in Japan loves different colors

35
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:19,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, that's really all there is.

36
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 in a new color.

37
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,385
[SPEAKER_06]: How this is news, I don't know, but it is.

38
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:23,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

39
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:38,192
[SPEAKER_03]: According to EGM's Quarterman rumor column, in their March issue, they talk about how that God of War Chain of Olympus, or Chains of Olympus, will be heading to PlayStation 2.

40
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is a rumor, but seeing their trend so far with, I don't know, Twisted Metal head-on, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters,

41
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:47,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff like that.

42
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:51,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be too surprising if they port the PSP game to the PlayStation 2.

43
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And hell, it will sell a lot of copies, so not so surprising.

44
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Silent Hill Origins.

45
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,678
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another one that was ported from PSP.

46
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,966
[SPEAKER_06]: In other Sony news, Flow will be making its way to the PlayStation Portable, and it comes out on March 6th.

47
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,043
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is coming out from Super Villain Studios.

48
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:19,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why you would want to get this when it's probably going to cost you more than it did on PlayStation 3.

49
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is it?

50
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:21,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

51
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:22,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have a price yet.

52
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:27,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, you're going to get it through the PlayStation Store, so I guess it is the same relative price.

53
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:27,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then never mind.

54
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But what a pain in the ass to buy something on the store and then transfer it.

55
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't actually touched the PlayStation Portable Store yet.

56
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even looked at that because I know now they're starting to re-release.

57
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:39,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

58
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:42,093
[SPEAKER_03]: They're starting to put full PlayStation Portable games on there now.

59
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:47,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they had Wipeout Pure you can download and a bunch of other stuff, you know.

60
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they figured that everyone else is already downloading it.

61
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's join the party and charge for it.

62
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:55,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one will still buy it.

63
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:57,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

64
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool idea to have original games on there.

65
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:06,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, what they need is a link to actually be able to view that store from the PSP.

66
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:09,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, as far as I'm aware, now they don't.

67
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:13,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember the URL for it, so I ain't buying anything from it.

68
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a bee in here.

69
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:16,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, that's scary.

70
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

71
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a bee?

72
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,501
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just a fly.

73
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: You sure?

74
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:20,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

75
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty big for a fly.

76
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a look at it.

77
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:23,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you scared?

78
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I will inspect.

79
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not scared of the bee.

80
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, you know, oh my god.

81
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you do news.

82
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take care of the bee.

83
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:38,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, another game that's going to be coming out here for the PlayStation 3 also is going to have... It's a fly, Loki.

84
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:38,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be scared.

85
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:39,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, you've grown big here.

86
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:42,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.

87
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:46,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Devil May Cry 4 that had a mandatory install.

88
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really mandatory.

89
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that one was more of an optional install.

90
00:05:50,202 --> 00:06:00,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot Shots Golf 5 in Japan right now has a 5 gigabyte, that's kind of ironic, install before you can play the game.

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, this is probably going to be on the US version of the Hot Shots Golf.

92
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say on tour is what it's called or out of bounds.

93
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:09,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

94
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of sucks that this trend of now these games having to be installed.

95
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:19,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's why you need your 80 gig system or 40 gigs or whatever.

96
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Install these damn games on it.

97
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That actually makes a lot of sense.

98
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, well, again, to play devil's advocate I suppose a little bit, if the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be more like a computer, then we shouldn't be surprised, right?

99
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:38,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm still kind of a little frustrated at the fact that consoles like the Xbox 360, you don't install games like this.

100
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:43,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have, the only game I know that you can install stuff to it, actually there's two.

101
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a Football Manager game in the UK, and then there's also Final Fantasy, you know, 11.

102
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:53,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that you have to install on every console, so that's not a big deal.

103
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:58,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just all because of that Blu-ray drive being slow, so that kind of sucks.

104
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:00,714
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

105
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, on a smaller scale, Sony is doing these preload things as well.

106
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a brand new Monster Hunter game.

107
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:11,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is coming out.

108
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:21,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this has in common with the last story is that you actually have the option to copy what's on the UMD to your memory card on the PSP, and that will decrease load times.

109
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,959
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of the same concept.

110
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,820
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we should emphasize it's optional here.

111
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,922
[SPEAKER_06]: and not required, which makes sense because there's PSPs out there where your memory card might be very small, like mine.

112
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I only have a 32 megabyte memory card because I bought mine a long time ago.

113
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:38,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the PSP a long time ago before they started coming with a gigabyte memory stick.

114
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

115
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:44,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's funny, though, that you can install it to the PSP memory stick.

116
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

117
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, all this time, they've been trying to stop people from installing it to their memory stick.

118
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how they're so ironic.

119
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,874
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

120
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:24,814
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

121
00:08:54,164 --> 00:09:03,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's time to move on into another segment here we like to do on this show pretty regularly.

122
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:08,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we like to hear from you guys and your emails that you send us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

123
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:12,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And we open them up and read through the emails in a little segment that we call The Mailbag.

124
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,340
The Mailbag

125
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to chat real quick, though, I've got to say this.

126
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:22,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to read these comments here.

127
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:24,316
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, I smell lawsuit.

128
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:24,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think so?

129
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:30,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe from the battery company, but I hope they don't try to sue Sony.

130
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not their fault.

131
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fault of the battery manufacturers.

132
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,522
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's dig into the mailbag here and see what folks have to say tonight.

134
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

135
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll read this one first.

136
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:47,666
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes to us from... We'll call him Nathaniel...

137
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,457
[SPEAKER_06]: P, I guess is the name based on the signature there.

138
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:56,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear cynical and acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio.

139
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio.

140
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:03,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a varied gamer when it comes to my playlist and currently I've been playing Guitar Hero 3.

141
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Though I am also varied when it comes to my music.

142
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:08,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I listen more to classical orchestrated symphony type music.

143
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:13,232
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the few rock bands I find enjoyable are the fine gents of Rhapsody or Rhapsody of Fire.

144
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:19,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping if you knew whether any of the band's numerous songs would ever appear in any Guitar Hero 3 downloadable content packs.

145
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we've heard anything like that.

146
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:26,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you're going to see much more independent music come out in these packs.

147
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:30,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually that's something that kind of happens towards the end of the cycle.

148
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,404
[SPEAKER_06]: and so much in the beginning.

149
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:03,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But some indie band out there spilled the beans that they were going to be Guitar Hero 4 and posted this entire probable song list from the game.

150
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:10,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it kind of made a lot of people go, I don't know about that, a little apprehensive to call it actual news.

151
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:15,597
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly Guitar Hero always has like 20, 30 independent songs in there.

152
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:18,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say go for Guitar Hero 4.

153
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The band will get out there more that way.

154
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:29,061
[SPEAKER_06]: This email comes to us from PKJr92 and sends us this.

155
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:32,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I have just two questions or comments.

156
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,664
[SPEAKER_06]: First is directed to Loki and it's about the Eye of Judgment bet.

157
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:42,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not possible, considering the caliber of the game, and I don't think ratings are in negative numbers, to reach 1 million ever.

158
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to make it more reasonable, make it 500,000 copies sold, even though it probably won't sell more than 350,000.

159
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki is too safe, and I think he knows it.

160
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, here's my second question.

161
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was the whole point behind Loki taking the bet in the first place.

162
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:08,489
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as you chatters want it, Loki does not want to come here and dress in a Tingle outfit and set the Eye of Judgment on fire or whatever we talk about here.

163
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Loki?

164
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,311
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really want to do that.

165
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:15,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because you know people will take screen caps on Justin.TV and it'll be all over the internet the next day, right?

166
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,439
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine, but I mean, and I understand, I don't think it's going to hit 500,000 either, but you know.

167
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already reduced it so many times.

168
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Lifetime of, you know, ever.

169
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:54,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, here's my second question.

170
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Why all the hate towards the PlayStation 3 with the exception of Loki?

171
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:02,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, there's almost no support from Sony, but if you have a high-def TV, the games look amazing.

172
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:07,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I realize that not everyone has a nice TV, but the games still have the ability to be more in-depth than Xbox 360 games.

173
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PlayStation Network is free!

174
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:10,665
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

175
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:14,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be pissed if I had to pay for PlayStation Network, because it's seriously...

176
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not worth my time, I would say.

177
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,330
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that.

178
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:04,516
[SPEAKER_06]: He also wants to say, by the way, thanks for broadcasting on Super Bowl Sunday considering not everyone is in love with football.

179
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,339
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the Stanley Cup finals are a totally different thing.

180
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much all of Canada watches.

181
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sorry for going on and on.

182
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:11,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it.

183
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,506
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of Americans watch the Super Bowl, though.

184
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,308
[SPEAKER_06]: We are in the minority of not watching it.

185
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying, I was just thinking that, uh,

186
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:43,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't broadcast from Canada, so... That is true.

187
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know when the hockey season ends or starts, so... Hockey's pretty fun, though.

188
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,865
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these days I'm going to get Melody to take me to a Sharks game in San Jose.

189
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

190
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Because she gets season passes and all that stuff.

191
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,207
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

192
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:58,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another email.

193
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,009
[SPEAKER_06]: This one comes to us from Sakura Max.

194
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

195
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,232
[SPEAKER_06]: You people have influenced me to make an OLR Dragon Force movie contest.

196
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:07,173
[SPEAKER_06]: See thread on OLR website.

197
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be at www.orangehaunchery.com.

198
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on Forums.

199
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:14,597
[SPEAKER_06]: You record footage of you playing your favorite games and play Dragon Force in your video.

200
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It was influenced by the Yaris video and your mentioning of Dragon Force.

201
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:18,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it goes well.

202
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:25,680
[SPEAKER_06]: For those who might be new to our program, we said that you can make a bad game even better most of the time by putting Dragon Force music to it.

203
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Dragon Force is just that awesome.

204
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some of our listeners have taken it upon themselves to do this.

205
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And now Sakura Max wants to make a little contest out of it.

206
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:35,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I say go for it.

207
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome.

208
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what we can contribute for prizes.

209
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we're trying to reserve some things on the prize table for something else.

210
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:41,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe we can dig up something.

211
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:43,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So participate.

212
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And a complete side note, Dragon Force sucks ass live.

213
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

214
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:48,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

215
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:49,906
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you see them live?

216
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, but I know they are.

217
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard on the radio that they were going to be playing live at some event.

218
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,265
[SPEAKER_05]: coming up in like two months from now in Sacramento.

219
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:07,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just decided, oh, hey, I'll see what they sound like live and went to YouTube and was terribly disappointed.

220
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:08,828
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

221
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:14,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here comes the next email, one of two remaining emails we're going to read this week.

222
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry if we didn't get to your email, but we got a few this week.

223
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:17,931
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes to us from J-Rod.

224
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a Loki hate mail.

225
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:21,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, crap.

226
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, crap.

227
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

228
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:23,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me back away.

229
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I love these emails.

230
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

231
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:31,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to write in and completely put over Loki.

232
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:37,779
[SPEAKER_06]: His anger and cynicism on the show not only make for hilarious radio, but most of the time echo my own thoughts.

233
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:47,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a few times, though, it seems like he's very out of place because Rob and Jamie are pretty optimistic people and it's usually silent after one of Loki's rants.

234
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:53,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Not one of those, let him have the stage silent moments, but an uncomfortable, what's this guy's deal silent moments?

235
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:56,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I was surprised to hear that Loki and Skye used to room together.

236
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:00,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just so interested in the relationship between all you guys because you seem so radically different.

237
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,790
[SPEAKER_06]: What say you?

238
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:03,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

239
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:05,039
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

240
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,200
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

241
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:58,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we wanted to kind of create a show that had that feel of, you know, going to dinner and talking smack about games and talking about the community or what have you.

242
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a... I guess you could say it's a spin-off of another show I used to be on, Under Station Live, which is a very similar kind of vibe.

243
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:06,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're here.

244
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:12,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki and I used to be roommates because there was just a point where Loki was looking to move out the same time I was, and it just made sense.

245
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:13,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

246
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:19,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as far as us being silent when he does rants and things, you know...

247
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there's just no way to respond.

248
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:36,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Relatively on this show for a live radio program, there's not a lot of dead air.

249
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:46,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind that when Jamie, myself, and Loki are all here, we're juggling from story to story, trying to kind of glance at the parts of the story we actually want to read on the air.

250
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to read the chat room.

251
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to bring up different things.

252
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes we can't totally focus on what's being said.

253
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes I kind of get in that mode where when Loki rants, I just let him rant.

254
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I go, okay, Loki's ranting.

255
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just kind of let him do his thing.

256
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is insanely funny to listen to, and the listeners love it, so why not, right?

257
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:04,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

258
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:05,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone loves Loki.

259
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of multitasking, Loki's still doing that now.

260
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:12,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's playing his fucking game while I try to do the mailbag.

261
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I am contributing to the show, okay?

262
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:14,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I am talking.

263
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I just spin the black circles, only two keys, and I can do that with one hand.

264
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, one more thing in J-Rod's email that I think is great.

265
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, Jamie's not here to see it.

266
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:30,924
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, also, I attached a picture I took before I went to see Rambo that you guys might like.

267
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome show and keep on rocking.

268
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:38,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And J-Rod's signature as always, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

269
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the email in front of the Olive Garden.

270
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: There is who I assume to be J-Rod wearing a Silent Hill shirt.

271
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:46,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually own that exact same Silent Hill shirt.

272
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,390
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

273
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:51,922
[SPEAKER_06]: and I hope Pyramid Head was going to go in there and cut up some pasta for you guys to have.

274
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:57,708
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, F you to the Olive Garden for getting rid of the dish I like there, the Tuscan chicken dish.

275
00:19:58,308 --> 00:19:58,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.

276
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, they got rid of it.

277
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,775
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new thing that's pretty good though and I don't want to hear from the listeners to go, Olive Garden isn't real Italian food.

278
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:05,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

279
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:06,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.

280
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:06,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You win.

281
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not real Italian food.

282
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:08,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

283
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:09,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Some days...

284
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:11,499
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

285
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, my grandma, she spoiled me and my brother.

286
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just with food.

287
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, buying you video games and stuff?

288
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course, yes.

289
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,187
[SPEAKER_06]: One last email here, and it comes to us from Gray Fox.

290
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:50,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR gang.

291
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:55,223
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I would just like to say that it's cool that Rob and I are now officially friends on Facebook.

292
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:58,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can look at all of his sexy pictures without him even knowing.

293
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:58,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, now.

294
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:01,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, did I say that out loud?

295
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:02,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha, just kidding.

296
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that creepy.

297
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you are a little bit.

298
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:04,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, I'm kidding.

299
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, oh my God, I'm as bad as Loki.

300
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:12,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if it was possible to listen to some of the first episodes you guys recorded.

301
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:15,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast feed only lets me go back to listen to October 2005.

302
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:15,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it does.

303
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:18,568
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

304
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,487
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to put a custom firmware to run Homebrew on it.

305
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, and keep up the great work, GrayFox.

306
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:08,945
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

307
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:12,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope another fly lands in Rob's coffee, because that was friggin' hilarious.

308
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and say no to exploding babies.

309
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, the fly problem in here seems relatively taken care of.

310
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:18,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the one.

311
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:19,554
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the one.

312
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,595
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the one.

313
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:23,717
[SPEAKER_05]: He was flying around here earlier, and he flew in front of my face.

314
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:27,421
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not being too annoying as his brothers and sisters were a few weeks ago.

315
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:32,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Relatively, the fly problem's been in check here in the studio, and I think that's as it's been getting warmer outside.

316
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,786
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:55,987
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: You should hear the old show.

319
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my God, it was a mess.

320
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:21,228
[SPEAKER_06]: In a good way.

321
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fun mess, you know, but it was much different.

322
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:39,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's kind of one of those things where I want to let, and I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura, we want to let true fans of Orange Lounge Radio who like our banter and stuff, we want to let them hear it, but we don't want to put it out there so much that people are going to hear that thinking that is Orange Lounge Radio today because they would be, like, really off.

323
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So, does that make sense?

324
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:48,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And back when the studio was like a six by six foot square box.

325
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:52,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunami says in the chat room, the old OLR was a great clusterfuck.

326
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:53,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was.

327
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

328
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like in the forums or on the LJ community or something, I'll put an old episode.

329
00:23:58,235 --> 00:23:59,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Facebook for you, obviously.

330
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put an old episode up there so you can kind of taste what it's like.

331
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know like Misty...

332
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: and DDR Angel when she was around.

333
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,230
[SPEAKER_06]: She hasn't been around a lot lately.

334
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,772
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know both of them really keep a lot of archives.

335
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll try to put up an episode that even Misty doesn't have.

336
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:15,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody will like that.

337
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:17,718
[SPEAKER_06]: At least those that want to hear it.

338
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

339
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Our mailbag.

340
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

341
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:37,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're a member of Steam, you have a lot of other friends that are going to be on there, of course, because Steam has hit 15 million accounts.

342
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a lot.

343
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:44,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, lots of good content that they have on there, and they keep adding more stuff.

344
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:49,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So, apparently, Valve had a lot to do with it.

345
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:55,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Steam-based sales have jumped 158% over the holiday season compared to the previous ones.

346
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:55,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

347
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

348
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a viable source for gaming.

349
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have yet to even check out Steam.

350
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever used Steam?

351
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:08,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

352
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:09,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

353
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I buy games.

354
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, stop.

355
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:13,898
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get in trouble for that someday.

356
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, what about its other elements?

357
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it doesn't have, like, the X-Fire thing built into it, too, where you can, like, message across games and stuff.

358
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:23,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I like X-Fire.

359
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:23,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

360
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,928
[SPEAKER_06]: NYR fan loves Steam in chat.

361
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:27,848
[SPEAKER_03]: He says Steam is the best.

362
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:29,069
[SPEAKER_03]: It kicks games for Windows ass.

363
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I pirate games on the PC.

364
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:36,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't bought games on PC in a long time because up until recently I haven't had a PC that can run games.

365
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:42,541
[SPEAKER_03]: The last game I bought on PC was Final Fantasy XI.

366
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.

367
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:45,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Crysis since that came out.

368
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that came with my graphics card though.

369
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:52,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to some stuff coming out like Spore and stuff.

370
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:53,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll buy that.

371
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:54,424
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

372
00:25:55,004 --> 00:26:04,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go over to the Nintendo Wii, because we haven't been showing Nintendo a lot of love tonight, and we want to talk about some stuff that's coming on the Wii soon, and that is everyone's Nintendo channel.

373
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:08,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember this came out in Japan a little while ago, and it was kind of like a preview channel.

374
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:11,147
[SPEAKER_06]: You could check out some new games that were coming out.

375
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, not that you really download full demos and stuff, but you get, you know, interviews.

376
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's one giant infomercial of a channel, but the big thing was the DS downloads.

377
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:19,729
[SPEAKER_06]: That you could get.

378
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get DS demos beamed to your DS channel,

379
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,576
[SPEAKER_06]: and the question was, when in the hell is it coming to the US?

380
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the answer is about next month.

381
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:32,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That is coming from an insider source reporting to Kotaku, who ran the story earlier this week.

382
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:33,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised.

383
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The channel will be home to some of the same sort of video game videos that you see on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

384
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:44,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Convention videos might actually start popping up on the channel once it goes live in the States.

385
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming because Penny Arcade Expo is up in that same area where Nintendo of America is, maybe that's one you can expect to see?

386
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:51,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

387
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:51,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

388
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:57,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised because I want to say March is also the estimated time for when the WiiWare channel is going to launch.

389
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:07,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bet all of this is going to be documented when they... I don't know if they have a keynote at... I want to say they do a Game Developers Conference, which is... God, I think that's next week or the week after.

390
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:08,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's next week.

391
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:08,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

392
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, I'm not going.

393
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:11,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

394
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:12,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to go.

395
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:24,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know talking to some buddies over at All Games, or at least listening to their shows, All Games Interactive, our friends over there, only Jessica is going, and Bobby B's not going this year, which is kind of too bad.

396
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:25,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's, you know...

397
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:26,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to go, but...

398
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:46,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to get little peeks from a developer angle.

399
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:47,308
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really it.

400
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:50,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you get to see stuff you might not normally see.

401
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:56,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm expecting them to talk about WiiWare since that makes sense from a developer's standpoint that they would want to address that stuff.

402
00:27:57,355 --> 00:28:06,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's rumors that Microsoft is going to have something similar to a YouTube of gaming type thing that they may discuss too.

403
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:11,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see announcements like that, talking about their network upgrades and crap like that.

404
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

405
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:39,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say really quickly before we get to the next story, Tiger Claws in chat, and he's a big listener over at AGI.

406
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:43,658
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think he came to our show because of All Games and our syndication there.

407
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, Jessica's bringing the Justin cam with her, he thinks.

408
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool if she's taking that cam with her.

409
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin TV is a great way to get that.

410
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:53,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we were able to go more mobile with Justin TV.

411
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:55,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can because we have a laptop and a camera.

412
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just difficult.

413
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not easy.

414
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're not together.

415
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you can get the cameras loose.

416
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:09,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most people put the camera in the backpack, or I mean, put the laptop in the backpack and have the wire sticking out and put the, I mean, you can do it with that eyesight because that eyesight pops right out of the base and you can just strap it to a helmet.

417
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do it, but it's just, it's hard.

418
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:16,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wouldn't run for very long on that laptop's battery either because the laptop doesn't function when it's closed.

419
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's a setting I can change on there, but oh well.

420
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not worth it.

421
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to see us out and about in public?

422
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

423
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:24,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have our privacy.

424
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:26,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine works with the

425
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,003
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

426
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Those games are... Endless possibilities.

427
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, endless possibilities.

428
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you're drunk.

429
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, oh god, and you can have Red Blob versus Blue Blob, Penis versus 2DX controller, you know.

430
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

431
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

432
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:14,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

433
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:20,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, before we get into our next news story, we're going to be getting into tonight's new game very soon.

434
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:27,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I mentioned, the entire chatroom has the possibility to participate, but you have to participate through private message.

435
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:33,080
[SPEAKER_06]: During tonight's game, the chatroom will be locked, and you will be unable to speak in the chatroom during the game.

436
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,662
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to prevent cheating from you guys for helping each other out.

437
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:38,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to play this game through private message.

438
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:43,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are interested in playing tonight's game, you have to send me a private message.

439
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:43,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Sky in the chatroom.

440
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:44,427
[SPEAKER_06]: That's S-K-I-E.

441
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:45,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me a private message that just says, me.

442
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,033
[SPEAKER_06]: or I want to play, me.

443
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me a private message if you want to play and we'll let you know the next part very soon when we reveal what we're going to be playing tonight and the contestant who's going to be coming in over the phone.

444
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:17,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So while you guys send that in, I've got one more story for you guys.

445
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has apparently revealed that they have sold 10 million virtual console games.

446
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:33,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if you think that, okay, so $10 million, the lowest price somebody's paying for those is $5.

447
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:41,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $50 million they've earned on the virtual console games, considering most of this stuff was written off, gone.

448
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We're never going to profit off this stuff again.

449
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it went.

450
00:31:46,722 --> 00:32:14,169
[SPEAKER_06]: and free money basically from the virtual console and Satoru Iwata who's of course the president of Nintendo talked about that this is proof of the value of digital distribution however not totally discounting the retail channel saying that the retail channel is still important but also admits that retail is not quite as profitable it's low profit margins on the box titles so could Nintendo be stepping more and more into digital distribution who knows possibly quite soon

451
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:17,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not anytime soon because they're freaking slow.

452
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they going to put all those digital downloads?

453
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't digitally download a Wii Remote.

454
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know.

455
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Balance Board and all that crap you gotta buy.

456
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:35,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you get to your story, Loki, I want to say for those in chat, if you try to do a private message conversation via DCC, it will not work.

457
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:39,015
[SPEAKER_06]: The DCC client that's built into MIRC, you need to do it another way.

458
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:41,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Dark Tetsuya's post in chat.

459
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:42,716
[SPEAKER_06]: He shows you guys how to do it.

460
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:44,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So please get to doing that.

461
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:50,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Famitsu Magazine had some details on the brand new Mario Kart Wii.

462
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:58,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to sport 32 courses, Mid-Air Tricks, and of course, Mii Integration, which sounds pretty awesome.

463
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be remaking, I know, some of the tracks that were in Mario Kart DS, as well as pretty much all the Mario games.

464
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:15,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, they are saying that 16 of the tracks that are going to be from other games and the other 16 are brand new.

465
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I wish there was more brand new tracks and less of the

466
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:45,119
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 player online matches will also be available and you'll be able to play 4 player split screen and I think you can play 2 player over online too so you can do 2 people per console as well ghost downloads, time trials will also be available and you can also of course choose a bike or a cart I wonder which version of Rainbow Road they would use

467
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:47,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

468
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

469
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:49,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's quite a few.

470
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know if they don't do Rainbow Road just right, people are going to be pissed.

471
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:56,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

472
00:33:58,315 --> 00:33:59,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you ready to get to tonight's game?

473
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

474
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's get to tonight's game.

475
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:06,520
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, you only have about 15 more seconds to send me a private message or you are out.

476
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot join the game midway through.

477
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:10,922
[SPEAKER_06]: You are out if you don't send me a private message.

478
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Time is almost up.

479
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,025
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we need to get one contestant on the phone.

480
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:22,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully if you answered Friday the 13th in our thing earlier, you might want to stand by the phone because it could be ringing right now.

481
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put in the number of our contestant.

482
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, folks.

483
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for any delays or dead area here.

484
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:33,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it goes.

485
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:33,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ringing.

486
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:36,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, is this Tiger Claw?

487
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:38,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, what's up?

488
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

489
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

490
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I know.

491
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,219
[SPEAKER_06]: You think you know.

492
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:44,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

493
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,001
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be playing a game with us tonight.

494
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw, it's a brand new game.

495
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,204
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about that?

496
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:52,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, exciting.

497
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:53,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

498
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:53,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very exciting.

499
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,289
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you say your knowledge of video game trivia is?

500
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:01,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would guess so-and-so.

501
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:02,154
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

502
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:06,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering that I've been around since it was invented.

503
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that...

504
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:12,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you playing Pong back in the day?

505
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:17,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my first video game was Pong, and after that was Atari 2600.

506
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, well then maybe you have an advantage.

507
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:25,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think you know enough about video game trivia that you could beat the entire chatroom at Video Game Trivia?

508
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,621
[SPEAKER_04]: 1 vs. The Chat Room

509
00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:00,060
[SPEAKER_06]: One vs. The Chatroom

510
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:21,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

511
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:23,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then you'd be perfect for winning this code.

512
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing, TigerClaw.

513
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,789
[SPEAKER_06]: If at any point during the game, we're going to ask you some questions.

514
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:32,053
[SPEAKER_06]: If at any point during the game, the chat room beats you, we're going to give it to one of them.

515
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:34,428
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

516
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody that's in chat, pretty soon the chat is going to go into lockdown.

517
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:10,443
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not be able to speak publicly within the room.

518
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:11,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get very quiet in there.

519
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,925
[SPEAKER_06]: You will only be able to play this game through private message.

520
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:19,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be asking Tigerclaw multiple choice questions with three possible answers.

521
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:24,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You will have about 30 seconds to send your answer to me via private message.

522
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Then Tigerclaw will answer the question.

523
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: If he gets it right...

524
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: www.DarkSakura.com

525
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:55,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Those that got the right answer will be eligible to win the prize.

526
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:59,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We will pick one of the chatters randomly to win the prize.

527
00:38:00,054 --> 00:38:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll kind of explain that a little more as we move through it.

528
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:04,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how many chatters are actually playing tonight.

529
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to see how many chatters we have and who you're playing against, TigerClaw?

530
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the entire chatroom.

531
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:11,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Just about.

532
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:12,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it.

533
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,656
[SPEAKER_06]: We have just about the entire damn chatroom we're playing against tonight.

534
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:14,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

535
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:15,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Ranma.

536
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,077
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one.

537
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:16,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee, two.

538
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,338

[SPEAKER_06]: GS68, five.

541
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Junami, six.

[SPEAKER_06]: PKRuno, seven.

543
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:24,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazatsuma, eight.

544
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100MAT, nine.

545
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:27,703
[SPEAKER_06]: SolarWing, ten.

546
00:38:28,104 --> 00:38:29,284
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTatsuya, eleven.

547
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:30,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryoma, twelve.

548
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:31,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheeseburger, thirteen.

549
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, fourteen.

550
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Trishlicious, fifteen.

[SPEAKER_06]: 15, KevinDDR16, SonOfDad17, Zenny18, SeedStore19, RavensDolphin20, and AJMix21.

552
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:50,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's you versus 21 people.

553
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:50,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Think you can do it?

554
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:52,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll give it a try.

555
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

556
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to do your best.

557
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:54,605
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we ask.

558
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:56,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody in chat, wish each other luck.

559
00:38:58,427 --> 00:38:59,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give them just a minute to do that.

560
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:01,089
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

561
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:02,917
[SPEAKER_06]: and here we go.

562
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:04,878
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is now locked.

563
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:08,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody will be able to type in chat and help each other out.

564
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the very first question.

565
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:18,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Ops, you have the power to override that, but I ask for your silence during this time because the Ops in our chat have the power to override that like Ranma and them, but I ask for their silence.

566
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:21,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you will only have a little bit of time to send your answer.

567
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for the first question?

568
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

569
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,011
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here you go, Tiger Claw.

570
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:27,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Question number one.

571
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: The category is classic sports games.

572
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:41,065
[SPEAKER_06]: In what 8-bit sports game was Gradius featured as a minigame?

573
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:50,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBI Baseball?

574
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:51,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, here's the question.

575
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:56,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw, don't yell it out until I have a chance here to share this with the chat.

576
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:02,401
[SPEAKER_06]: In what 8-bit sports game was Gradius featured as a minigame?

577
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:10,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBI Baseball?

578
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:14,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we'll take a little musical interlude here while we let the chatters submit their answer.

579
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatters, you have about 30 seconds to get your answer in.

580
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh... Wait, hold on, I got it.

581
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, let's see.

582
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played all those games before.

583
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, hold on.

584
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:09,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

585
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:10,970
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw, I'm so sorry.

586
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:11,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to tell you.

587
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:15,133
[SPEAKER_06]: You do get one little lifeline, so to speak.

588
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, lifelines in the game shows?

589
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot about this part.

590
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:24,340
[SPEAKER_06]: If at any time you are unsure about an answer, you can have us eliminate one incorrect answer.

591
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I will tell you two people from the chat room and how they answered the question.

592
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:31,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can help make your decision from there.

593
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:32,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So you only get one of them through the game, though.

594
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're unsure, I just want to let you know you have that.

595
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:37,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So TigerClaw, though, sorry to interrupt.

596
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:48,694
[SPEAKER_04]: A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBR Baseball I'm going to have to take one of those lifelines.

597
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played all three of those games before.

598
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:55,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

599
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,100
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking NES games, right?

600
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

601
00:41:58,881 --> 00:41:59,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there NES games?

602
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:01,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so you want to use that lifeline?

603
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:02,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

604
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:03,949
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be all over right here.

605
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

606
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,751
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to eliminate one wrong answer from the board.

607
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:10,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you two answers here.

608
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,355
[SPEAKER_06]: One is correct, one is incorrect.

609
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:14,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some answers from the chat room.

610
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma has said that the answer is Blades of Steel.

611
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:22,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee has said that the answer is Double Dribble.

612
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:24,102
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those is right.

613
00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:25,684
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those is wrong.

614
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:28,005
[SPEAKER_06]: RBI Baseball is definitely wrong.

615
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:28,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out.

616
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:29,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

617
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,271
[SPEAKER_06]: RBA Baseball being out and your lifeline gone, what do you think?

618
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:34,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Blades of Steel or Double Dribble?

619
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:39,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to go with Blades of Steel.

620
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:46,914
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, the correct answer is Blades of Steel is the correct answer.

621
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:50,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations, Tiger Claw, you move on.

622
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:51,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see how many people you knocked out.

623
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:53,675
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out Frisbee, we know that.

624
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:55,555
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out GS-191.

625
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:57,276
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out GS-68.

626
00:43:02,018 --> 00:43:04,319
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out Solarwing.

627
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:05,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

628
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for playing, though.

629
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:09,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And you knocked out Actdeft.

630
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:15,763
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out Son of Dad.

631
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:17,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out Zenny.

632
00:43:20,325 --> 00:43:21,685
[SPEAKER_06]: You knocked out Raven's Dolphin.

633
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

634
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:28,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 people left.

635
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So not bad, you took out 8 people on that first question.

636
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice job.

637
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:32,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

638
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

639
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready for the next question?

640
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure am.

641
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:37,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

642
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:41,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Question number 2 is in the category of Super Nintendo Shooters.

643
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:47,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?

644
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it UN Squadron?

645
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Flanix, or R-Type?

646
00:43:55,861 --> 00:44:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the question is which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?

647
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:04,844
[SPEAKER_06]: UN Squadron, Flanix, or R-Type?

648
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:06,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room will have just a moment to submit their answers.

649
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give them some thinking music to do so.

650
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be so sick of this fucking song by the time the night's over.

651
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:27,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I think I know what he has.

652
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:30,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, hold on, we gotta give a chat sometime.

653
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:40,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go, Tigerclaw.

654
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:44,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?

655
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:49,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it UN Squadron, Flanix, or R-Type?

656
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:53,474
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer would be UN Squadron.

657
00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:54,794
[SPEAKER_06]: UN Squadron?

658
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Cheeseburger's out, he said C

659
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Trish Lissus, I'm sorry you're out, although I love that name.

660
00:45:32,228 --> 00:45:32,568
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

661
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:35,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're down to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

662
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:38,690
[SPEAKER_06]: You've gone from 21 to 10.

663
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad, Tigerclaw.

664
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready to do it one more time?

665
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:42,751
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

666
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:43,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

667
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:49,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is question number three, and it's in the category The Legend of Zelda.

668
00:45:50,553 --> 00:45:55,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one of these is not a monster name in The Legend of Zelda?

669
00:45:57,404 --> 00:46:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it A, Gleok, B, Aquamentus, or C, Kraken?

670
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:08,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one of these is not a monster name in The Legend of Zelda?

671
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom has a few minutes to reply.

672
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, since I played Legend of Zelda 1

673
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,817
[SPEAKER_04]: and the third one, SNES.

674
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:15,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to probably say C, Kraken.

675
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,165
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, C, Kraken.

676
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:21,227
[SPEAKER_06]: First, I have to eliminate two people for not submitting on time.

677
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:22,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry, Ryoma.

678
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And sorry, Kevin DDR, you didn't get your answers in on time.

679
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:29,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're already... Oh, Ryoma just barely got his in.

680
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:29,494
[SPEAKER_06]: He's back.

681
00:47:30,836 --> 00:47:31,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we go.

682
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:33,218
[SPEAKER_06]: The correct answer is...

683
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Kraken is correct.

684
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:37,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

685
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:38,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if you took anybody out.

686
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was an easy one, personally.

687
00:47:42,256 --> 00:47:42,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Three have got it.

688
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:44,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Piker Uno didn't get it.

689
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:45,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, you're out.

690
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:48,100
[SPEAKER_06]: He said Aquamentus, which was one of the bosses in Zelda.

691
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed Store also said Aquamentus.

692
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, buddy, you're out.

693
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:55,945
[SPEAKER_06]: AJ Mix also said Aquamentus.

694
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:57,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, you're out as well.

695
00:47:58,227 --> 00:47:58,527
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

696
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:02,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the mob is down to six people.

697
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw, you're doing awesome.

698
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:07,617
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

699
00:48:07,897 --> 00:48:10,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Kraken, by the way, was one of the elementals in Final Fantasy.

700
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And our next question is all about Final Fantasy.

701
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,020
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready, Tigerclaw?

702
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:18,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's going to be tough.

703
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:18,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, buddy.

704
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:19,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We wrote it before the show.

705
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:21,003
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

706
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:21,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Here they are.

707
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:22,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your question.

708
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:29,467
[SPEAKER_06]: In which Final Fantasy game was there a character named Ferris?

709
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it A, Final Fantasy IV?

710
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:37,409
[SPEAKER_06]: B, Final Fantasy V, or C, Final Fantasy IX.

711
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's A, IV, B, V, or C, IX.

712
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And the character's name is Ferris.

713
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give the chat a chance to think.

714
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:59,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the full soundtrack to this show, I think.

715
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:04,647
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a different song for when they were doing the... Well, I only have the one, so shoot me.

716
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:12,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to start it off before you question by saying how many... One versus... Alright, fine.

717
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:13,633
[SPEAKER_06]: One versus six.

718
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:14,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

719
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So, somebody's walking away with a prize.

720
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:18,757
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these seven people is going to win the prize.

721
00:49:18,837 --> 00:49:20,017
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw, it's time.

722
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:22,439
[SPEAKER_06]: In which Final Fantasy game was there a character named Ferris?

723
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:26,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it A, Final Fantasy IV, B, Final Fantasy V, or C, Final Fantasy IX?

724
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to say Final Fantasy IX.

725
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:34,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see if that's the correct answer.

726
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:47,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The Final Fantasy game that had a character named Ferris was Final Fantasy V. I'm sorry, TigerClaw, you have lost to the mob.

727
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,742
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where the mob cheers.

728
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:51,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, no problem.

729
00:49:51,482 --> 00:49:53,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too familiar with Final Fantasy.

730
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I kind of took a guess there.

731
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I've been listening to you guys ever since I heard you from all games back in the day.

732
00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:23,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been listening to your show ever since.

733
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Tiger Claw, thanks for supporting us.

734
00:50:26,277 --> 00:50:27,097
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

735
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you enjoy the game at least?

736
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:28,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have fun?

737
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:31,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

738
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure did.

739
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for your consolation applause from the audience.

740
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:35,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, your consolation applause.

741
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:36,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody give Tiger Claw a round of applause.

742
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Tiger Claw, we've got to let you go.

743
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:39,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

744
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:41,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks, and you too.

745
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:42,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you too.

746
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the chatters are wondering, which one of us is going to win it?

747
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:47,795
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so here we go.

748
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see who's going to be knocked out.

749
00:50:49,836 --> 00:50:56,501
[SPEAKER_06]: We have that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on.

750
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: All six of them got it right in chat.

751
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:00,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should narrow the field a little bit.

752
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:02,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to narrow the field a little bit with one more question?

753
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:03,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

754
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:04,886
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, fine then.

755
00:51:04,906 --> 00:51:06,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll narrow the field a little bit with one more question.

756
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:10,770
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, in order to do that, we've got to put this in moderated mode again so they can't cheat.

757
00:51:12,014 --> 00:51:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So some poor people were just trying to chat.

758
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:14,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

759
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:16,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is the fifth question.

760
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:18,258
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

761
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:24,382
[SPEAKER_06]: The fifth question is in the category Games Rob Hates.

762
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:27,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't have the question fully typed out.

763
00:51:27,324 --> 00:51:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

764
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:29,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody fill time for just a moment here.

765
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: What games do you hate, Loki?

766
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:36,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hating this level of Spin the Black Circle.

767
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been going at this one level for like 15 minutes.

768
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I got close to the end, too.

769
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:41,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pissing me off.

770
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate... Oh gosh, let me think.

771
00:51:48,303 --> 00:51:48,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

772
00:51:49,563 --> 00:51:55,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything Barbie.

773
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

774
00:51:57,206 --> 00:52:01,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to eliminate a few more people here on this question for games Rob hates.

775
00:52:02,928 --> 00:52:04,148
[SPEAKER_06]: In the game Bubsy...

776
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:07,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever played Bubsy?

777
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:08,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, yes.

778
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:08,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bubsy 3.

779
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:10,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry for you.

780
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:11,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

781
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

782
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:16,428
[SPEAKER_06]: In the game Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?

783
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:22,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it A, Cheese Pieces, B, Yarn Balls, or C, Leaves?

784
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:25,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually put 1, 2, 3 in chat, but it shouldn't be that big a deal.

785
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:27,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, was it Cheese Pieces, Yarn Balls, or Leaves?

786
00:52:28,256 --> 00:52:32,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this one.

787
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:34,459
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I wasn't part of the mob at the time.

788
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:48,119
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all the chatters are in.

789
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:48,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Cut off the theme.

790
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,140
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

791
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:50,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

792
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:51,603
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

793
00:52:51,643 --> 00:52:54,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go through one at a time to see who got it right and who didn't get it right.

794
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:55,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

795
00:52:58,389 --> 00:52:58,730
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

796
00:52:59,771 --> 00:52:59,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

797
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:00,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

798
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:04,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, the correct answer in the game Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?

799
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:05,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not cheese pieces.

800
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,104
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not leaves.

801
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It was yarn balls is the correct answer.

802
00:53:09,526 --> 00:53:10,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he's a cat.

803
00:53:10,026 --> 00:53:10,547
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a cat.

804
00:53:10,747 --> 00:53:13,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many of the chatters do you think we eliminated?

805
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:13,509
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

806
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,150
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

807
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:14,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

808
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:15,291
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them.

809
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:16,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all six.

810
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Puppy, I need you to pick a number, one through six.

811
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:23,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do, I should have brought out my dice.

812
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:24,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're going to roll a dice.

813
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:33,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It's between Ryoma, DarkTetsuya, SSJ100, Matt, DrewNami, RawSteel, UT, and Ranma is what's remaining in our chat.

814
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:34,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here goes.

815
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:36,378
[SPEAKER_06]: What did it hit?

816
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:37,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Four.

817
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Our winner tonight, boys and girls, of one versus the chatroom, SSJ100, Matt, give it up.

818
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:51,386
[SPEAKER_06]: A winner of trivia and luck.

819
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:52,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

820
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:56,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm asking SSJ100 Matt if he's going to take the Res HD code.

821
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to recall last week he didn't want it.

822
00:53:58,962 --> 00:54:00,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, he wants the other prize.

823
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:02,383
[SPEAKER_06]: So SSJ100, Matt, coming to you very soon.

824
00:54:02,403 --> 00:54:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be getting a copy, courtesy of our friends at PopCap Game, Bejeweled 2, the hit sequel to Bejeweled.

825
00:54:09,564 --> 00:54:10,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is the full version.

826
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:15,985
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the crap, well, I shouldn't say the crap version, but the reduced version that you play online.

827
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:18,325
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the full version of the game.

828
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:23,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're kind of thinking, well, I don't really want Bejeweled 2, this will make an awesome Valentine's Day gift for somebody.

829
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:25,227
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife loves some Bejeweled 2.

830
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:25,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

831
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:27,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The ladies love Bejeweled.

832
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:30,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bejeweled comes to us from our friends at PopCap.

833
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Four different modes of play in this version.

834
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll keep you going for hours and hours.

835
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic mode, action mode, puzzle mode, endless mode.

836
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:39,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

837
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:40,432
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

838
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

839
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:47,054
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt wins Bejeweled 2, courtesy of PopCap Games.

840
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you guys think?

841
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:49,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom, did you guys like that prize?

842
00:54:49,935 --> 00:54:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did you guys like that game?

843
00:54:51,336 --> 00:54:51,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that fun?

844
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

845
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys think the game went well?

846
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:56,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was cool.

847
00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:56,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

848
00:54:57,282 --> 00:54:58,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first run, it went pretty well.

849
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:05,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much it's going to translate to the podcast where people can't play, but I think for the live listeners, that was a lot of fun.

850
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just as much fun as watching a game show on TV.

851
00:55:08,229 --> 00:55:14,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm hoping for the podcast listeners and the folks listening to all games, they could kind of think in their mind how they would have done.

852
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:17,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they could have had the chance if they were here live on Sunday night.

853
00:55:17,254 --> 00:55:20,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You know everybody that watches a game show thinks they can do better than the person on TV.

854
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:22,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always the way it is.

855
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:23,517
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

856
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:26,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Piker Uno says, I didn't know any of the answers.

857
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,981
[SPEAKER_06]: He did pretty well.

858
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: He says it was fun, though.

859
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight says it should make it its own show.

860
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Piker Uno says, make a Bomani edition.

861
00:55:34,726 --> 00:55:35,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

862
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Son of Dad says, more fighting game questions needed.

863
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:39,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryoma says, more trivia.

864
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:39,810
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

865
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure that segment will make a comeback in a future edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

866
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:46,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys enjoyed that.

867
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,037
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

868
00:55:49,467 --> 00:55:49,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

869
00:55:49,988 --> 00:55:54,251
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to the Skype line very soon, but quickly, another couple stories for us.

870
00:55:56,572 --> 00:55:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bandai Namco has definitely taken a different approach for games.

871
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:04,358
[SPEAKER_03]: For the DS, they're releasing a game called 99 Tears.

872
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:10,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It is basically 99 different stories that you'll read that are very depressing that are supposed to make you cry.

873
00:56:11,183 --> 00:56:14,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Because apparently they think that it's very therapeutic to cry.

874
00:56:14,827 --> 00:56:15,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna play this game and I'm never gonna cry.

875
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this should be a challenge.

876
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:43,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, make Loki cry.

877
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:44,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it'll never happen.

878
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be crap.

879
00:56:45,688 --> 00:56:46,609
[SPEAKER_06]: When was the last time you cried?

880
00:56:46,629 --> 00:56:47,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a crier?

881
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:48,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

882
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Real men cry.

883
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:49,970
[SPEAKER_06]: You can cry.

884
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:50,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

885
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:52,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

886
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

887
00:56:53,612 --> 00:56:56,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to ruffle the personal life feathers, but I'm just curious.

888
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:56,993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

889
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, I cry at every sad movie I watch.

890
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:02,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, I think I watched an episode of Wife Swap the other day.

891
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I cried at it.

892
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:03,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't take much.

893
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:04,756
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

894
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:07,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I waste my time on this show.

895
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:09,198
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

896
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:21,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line, the Sega is going to be bringing a brand new game to the Nintendo DS, and it's very similar to one of their old cult classics, The Typing of the Dead.

897
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:25,612
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the new game they are bringing out, The English of the Dead.

898
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: The English of the Dead.

899
00:57:28,753 --> 00:57:29,694
[SPEAKER_06]: First words you will learn...

900
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:31,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Brains!

901
00:57:32,054 --> 00:57:33,055
[SPEAKER_06]: The British of the Dead.

902
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,716
[SPEAKER_06]: The interesting thing, though, it's House of the Dead 2, but ported to the DS.

903
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:43,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you have to do, you have to translate words into English from Japanese, or the zombies will eat you.

904
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:48,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the zombies speak out loud, and you have to translate what they're saying.

905
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be all kinds of interesting.

906
00:57:50,479 --> 00:57:51,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see how that plays out.

907
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:52,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to write it out?

908
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Because sometimes those handwriting recognitions suck.

909
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I said blue!

910
00:57:58,841 --> 00:57:59,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

911
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:02,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish this game would come out the other way around.

912
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:04,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Japanese of the Dead.

913
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:06,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe learn some Japanese or some other languages.

914
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:08,800
[SPEAKER_06]: English, English of the Dead.

915
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:12,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Southern English of the Dead.

916
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Grammar of the Dead.

917
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:16,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet Jamie would love that.

918
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:20,350
[SPEAKER_06]: If she was here, she'd suggest a proper grammar game or something.

919
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:24,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Which actually was not proper grammar in me saying that, but oh well, who cares.

920
00:58:24,694 --> 00:58:25,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I need to play it.

921
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:28,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming out.

922
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:31,530
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to open up the Skype line for your calls.

923
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,310
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

924
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

925
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:37,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly though, any last minute stories from Loki?

926
00:58:38,134 --> 00:58:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a few actually.

927
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:49,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Already it's confirmed that there's going to be a Professor Layton sequel because the game manual says there's going to be a sequel and it will have a code in it that you use in the first game or something.

928
00:58:50,262 --> 00:58:54,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane has been talking to me about how wonderful Professor Layton is like all week long.

929
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:55,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Plastic Yellowways

930
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:15,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some melting Legos in my Indiana Jones game.

931
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,325
[SPEAKER_03]: They've replaced them with anonymous genocidal occultist trench coat wearing master race.

932
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:24,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want the anonymous genocidal occult trench coat wearing bastards to have their faces melt.

933
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:26,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Skype line.

934
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:27,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

935
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:28,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

936
00:59:29,155 --> 00:59:29,655
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68.

937
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:30,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, GS68.

938
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:31,797
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, my friend?

939
00:59:32,258 --> 00:59:32,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

940
00:59:33,078 --> 00:59:36,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask them good news and bad news regarding 2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

941
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:41,300
[SPEAKER_06]: 2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land, one of our local arcades, got some attention lately.

942
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wrote an article about classic arcades or something.

943
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:46,502
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who that guy was, too.

944
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:50,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I'm plugging it here on the show.

945
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:57,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will point out how convenient that the person used the arcade they used to go to all the time in that article.

946
00:59:57,324 --> 00:59:58,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it was a real challenge to write it.

947
00:59:58,905 --> 00:59:59,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow...

948
00:59:59,865 --> 01:00:06,327
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68, what's on your mind regarding Beatmania Golfland?

949
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:12,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news, we have two DX DJ Troopers as of this week.

950
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice!

951
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:15,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll have to go play, but what's the bad news?

952
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:27,513
[SPEAKER_09]: The machine is unlocked well ahead of what's supposed to be in Japan, and that means if you plan on going in or between now and most likely May, you can't take pictures of the machine.

953
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:29,827
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't take pictures.

954
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,988
[SPEAKER_06]: How are they policing that?

955
01:00:32,368 --> 01:00:32,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

956
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:33,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

957
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:35,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

958
01:00:36,031 --> 01:00:40,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't... You don't usually see that in arcades where you're completely banned from taking pictures.

959
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just challenging people.

960
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, is it a location test that they're doing?

961
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:44,116
[SPEAKER_06]: For real.

962
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:45,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's how you're going to do it.

963
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:47,799
[SPEAKER_06]: GSCCA, I will tell you how to get around this right now.

964
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:50,481
[SPEAKER_06]: You get one of those... I even have this on my cell phone.

965
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:52,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You get one of those phones that records video.

966
01:00:53,343 --> 01:00:53,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

967
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:53,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

968
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:56,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get the camera phone.

969
01:00:56,344 --> 01:01:07,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you get a camera phone and what you do is you kind of stand next to the machine and you hit the record button and then you pretend you're talking on your phone while you're recording the screen right there.

970
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:08,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you do it.

971
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:10,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy as pie.

972
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:14,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it'll be up on YouTube and somebody will get shit in their pants.

973
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:21,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just sent you a link via private message and that explains why we can't take pictures.

974
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:26,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, are they, because usually it's the new songs people want to know and stuff.

975
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:29,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Are people not allowed to write the songs down and then post them on the internet?

976
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... Sorry, I don't expect you to know that.

977
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:40,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'd be like the fact that the machine is unlocked well ahead of schedule.

978
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:41,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

979
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

980
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:45,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the post here on our friends at Bomani Style.

981
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:54,455
[SPEAKER_06]: The distributor has asked that no pictures or videos be taken yet due to the fact the machine will be fully unlocked with all hidden feature songs per my request and as a present to all the players at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

982
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:58,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about three months ahead of Japan and we cannot have secret stuff leak on the internets.

983
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, people, assist me with this small task of not allowing pictures or videos to be taken yet.

984
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:04,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a big sign hanging by the machine or anything?

985
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you've been.

986
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:06,424
[SPEAKER_09]: No, like,

987
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I went this Saturday and I pulled out my camera and then one of the players told me not to take pictures.

988
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:12,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

989
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

990
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:15,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're self-policing it?

991
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:17,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, most likely.

992
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:28,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, I mean, I wonder if I can talk to them about, like, having them put a sign in, like, maybe set up a security camera, like... Yeah, a security camera really could be good.

993
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,954
[SPEAKER_06]: In a sense, they're breaking their own rules.

994
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:33,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, for me, this sounds like a challenge.

995
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Facing away from the screen.

996
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

997
01:02:36,258 --> 01:02:36,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

998
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:37,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for that.

999
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, plus I can imagine some guy who's never played a single-ball mining game

1000
01:02:58,103 --> 01:02:59,124
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1001
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a challenge.

1002
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:23,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when somebody says don't, you want to do.

1003
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I understand.

1004
01:03:24,946 --> 01:03:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1005
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: The community maybe just doesn't want to spoil or whatever.

1006
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:29,389
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we probably shouldn't be spoil sports.

1007
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I'm not going to get to Sunnyvale Golf Land anytime soon anyway.

1008
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:33,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do kind of want to check it out.

1009
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:39,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played an arcade Beatmania game since E3 when they had the machine there that one year randomly.

1010
01:03:39,237 --> 01:03:40,117
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the last time I played it.

1011
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1012
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, I don't remember the last time I played Geek Mania.

1013
01:03:46,105 --> 01:03:48,206
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in chat has a good point.

1014
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:50,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people on the forums will say PIX or GTFO.

1015
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine, we'll get PIX.

1016
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:55,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll get PIX.

1017
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:58,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to getting PIX.

1018
01:03:58,852 --> 01:03:59,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1019
01:03:59,372 --> 01:04:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Ban me from SVGL?

1020
01:04:01,954 --> 01:04:02,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

1021
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:03,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1022
01:04:03,495 --> 01:04:07,477
[SPEAKER_09]: What's ironic about this is that, like, even if we...

1023
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:15,822
[SPEAKER_09]: This game's not supposed to be in the U.S., so we're not allowed to take pictures to begin with.

1024
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not even supposed to be in the U.S.

1025
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:18,624
[SPEAKER_05]: to begin with.

1026
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:19,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

1027
01:04:19,624 --> 01:04:20,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well, we had the U.S.

1028
01:04:20,645 --> 01:04:22,425
[SPEAKER_06]: location test, but that failed.

1029
01:04:22,986 --> 01:04:27,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, I'm waiting for the next story where somebody gets beaten up in the parking lot over taking a picture of this game.

1030
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:31,129
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your call.

1031
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:31,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1032
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,790
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

1033
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:34,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, boy.

1034
01:04:34,952 --> 01:04:35,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey there, this is Let's Have Tea

1035
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have tea.

1036
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:04,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have some tea and chat a little bit.

1037
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:05,695
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up, my friend?

1038
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:11,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to plug the game Psychonauts.

1039
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,907
[SPEAKER_10]: To anybody who hasn't checked this game out yet, I know it's kind of old, but...

1040
01:05:17,003 --> 01:05:21,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally got a chance to play through it, and it's well worth the $15 on the marketplace.

1041
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:21,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1042
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:22,044
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely out there.

1043
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I'm a big adventure game fan, and it's pretty much the first, like, adventure game that's really got my attention since, like, Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie.

1044
01:05:59,691 --> 01:05:59,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1045
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:03,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it... I hear a lot about the sense of humor in this game.

1046
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the sense of humor that draws you in?

1047
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:06,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah.

1048
01:06:07,037 --> 01:06:10,199
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is seriously, just ridiculously twisted.

1049
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:10,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1050
01:06:12,293 --> 01:06:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: you infiltrate the minds of a lot of really interesting characters and a lot of them are in like a loony bin so there's a lot of weird stuff going on I didn't see a lot of this game I've uh and so maybe I need to take your advice and go check it out I've watched it being played by somebody else but it was I didn't see a lot of the story I just saw the actual game and to me it was kind of like oh I think I've kind of seen this game before but you're saying no it's worth a second look it really stands out right it's

1051
01:06:41,491 --> 01:06:42,672
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely worth it.

1052
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:48,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say they make a Psychonauts 2 someday, which with all the cult following, you never know.

1053
01:06:48,155 --> 01:06:50,496
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you most like to see in Psychonauts 2?

1054
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:58,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in the story of it, they totally opened it up so that there's a possibility.

1055
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:08,366
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, just the way that Psychonauts 1 worked out with the sense of humor and the

1056
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:14,321
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that they were able to develop the different abilities throughout the game.

1057
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:22,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually in sequels, they aren't able to rebuild abilities like that.

1058
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:38,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you take Banjo-Kazooie from Banjo-Kazooie, it's hard to add even more to the game when the original game limits what you do by the moves that you have.

1059
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:41,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1060
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:11,165
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can find the old Xbox disc, you can play it with backwards compatibility as well, so either works.

1061
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:14,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also a PS2 and PC game.

1062
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everywhere.

1063
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,949
[SPEAKER_06]: No excuses for not playing this.

1064
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:21,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have tea.

1065
01:08:21,549 --> 01:08:28,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for what we'll call the not quite classic game of the week, because it's not a classic yet, but it probably will be in a few more years.

1066
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:30,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have tea.

1067
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more question for you before we let you go.

1068
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:34,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really like to drink tea?

1069
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:36,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely not.

1070
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:38,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew it.

1071
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:42,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's Mr. T. Are you more of a coffee drinker?

1072
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually not really into any of that.

1073
01:08:45,992 --> 01:08:48,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it was a clever name and thought it was funny.

1074
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:50,055
[SPEAKER_10]: So I grabbed it.

1075
01:08:50,316 --> 01:08:50,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you win.

1076
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:51,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It is pretty funny.

1077
01:08:52,117 --> 01:08:53,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when you consider you don't like tea.

1078
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I like a little tea here and there.

1079
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,161
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1080
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:56,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's have tea.

1081
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much for reminding us about the greatness of Psychonauts.

1082
01:08:59,183 --> 01:08:59,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great one, okay?

1083
01:09:01,025 --> 01:09:01,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1084
01:09:01,445 --> 01:09:01,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1085
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:02,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1086
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we can do a couple more calls, I suppose.

1087
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:08,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Skype wants us to rate the quality of that call.

1088
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:09,508
[SPEAKER_06]: How was the call quality?

1089
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:09,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say 5?

1090
01:09:10,388 --> 01:09:10,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good?

1091
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:10,868
4?

1092
01:09:11,268 --> 01:09:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

1093
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it's either 4 or 5.

1094
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it a 4, because I've had issues on other calls.

1095
01:09:16,749 --> 01:09:20,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sending the whole thing, Jesus.

1096
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Now answer 30 more questions.

1097
01:09:22,751 --> 01:09:24,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1098
01:09:25,137 --> 01:09:26,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!

1099
01:09:26,739 --> 01:09:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!

1100
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!

1101
01:09:53,325 --> 01:09:53,885
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1102
01:09:53,905 --> 01:09:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1103
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:22,032
[SPEAKER_06]: E.M.U.s

1104
01:10:52,301 --> 01:11:21,302
[SPEAKER_06]: That would seem likely, because the IP address So things that would have to be unlocked by EMUs wouldn't normally be available here So if they can unlock everything here, and we don't get EMUs, that just means that they're plain assholes for not unlocking at all Alright Konami does have a record Kevin DDR in chat says, no one knows how Somebody does, obviously, because this machine's added done to it But I get what you're saying I bet it's up, up, down, down, left, right, left Nobody who can spread the word knows how, I guess

1105
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, what else is on your mind?

1106
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:23,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1107
01:11:24,752 --> 01:11:25,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

1108
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:34,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Irene said earlier, I went to a Ren Faire this weekend, and out of all my costumes, I found one that would be perfect to blend right in.

1109
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:39,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just have to give a little background because the Ren Faire thing came up during our bonus segment, which the podcast people don't hear.

1110
01:11:40,366 --> 01:11:43,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So podcasters, just know we were talking about the Ren Faire earlier in the show.

1111
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not completely out of place, his comments.

1112
01:11:45,486 --> 01:11:45,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it.

1113
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:46,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it.

1114
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like a... It was a Ranma remix.

1115
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not adjust your iPods.

1116
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:20,908
[SPEAKER_06]: We heard the same thing.

1117
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:21,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

1118
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:23,349
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, make a song out of that.

1119
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:25,671
[SPEAKER_06]: God, no.

1120
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I'm sorry, let's see.

1121
01:12:28,892 --> 01:12:32,354
[SPEAKER_06]: A good fit with our show or video games or what?

1122
01:12:33,595 --> 01:12:34,375
[SPEAKER_06]: With video games.

1123
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:35,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what is it?

1124
01:12:36,956 --> 01:12:37,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Mage.

1125
01:12:38,457 --> 01:12:38,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1126
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:40,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you wear your Black Mage?

1127
01:12:40,538 --> 01:12:41,399
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a Black Mage outfit.

1128
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:41,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you wear it?

1129
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:43,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1130
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1131
01:12:44,386 --> 01:12:46,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get a lot of people coming up to you wanting to take the old picture?

1132
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:48,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, I did.

1133
01:12:50,007 --> 01:12:52,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you take pictures with large-breasted women in corsets?

1134
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:57,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I decided to keep those pictures to myself, okay?

1135
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,991
[SPEAKER_07]: At those Ren Fairs, you know the Las Vegas rules apply.

1136
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens at Ren Fairs stays at Ren Fairs?

1137
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:04,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn right.

1138
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:04,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1139
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not allowed to take pictures of the women in corsets and put them up on the Internet or the SVGL management will get very mad at you.

1140
01:13:12,037 --> 01:13:12,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1141
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:16,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But some people actually thought I was Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.

1142
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:19,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because Vivi does look like a Black Mage.

1143
01:13:19,242 --> 01:13:19,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that.

1144
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:21,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the best thing.

1145
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:25,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone walked up to me and said, You're Orko from He-Man, aren't you?

1146
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1147
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:29,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Mage does look like Orko.

1148
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:30,330
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you do?

1149
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:35,814
[SPEAKER_07]: After hearing that five, six times, I said, The next Ren Faire, I'm going to do a Jedi and I'll do Orko.

1150
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:36,795
[SPEAKER_07]: See what happens.

1151
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:37,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1152
01:13:37,844 --> 01:13:39,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Ranma, glad to hear you had fun at Ren Faire.

1153
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:42,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next time you're in Cali, we'll take Irene to one together, okay?

1154
01:13:43,608 --> 01:13:44,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe you should take her.

1155
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:45,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably will.

1156
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:49,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she sent me a private message with one that she wants to go to now, but I've been too busy doing the show.

1157
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:51,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look, actually, real quick while we're on the subject of Ren Faire.

1158
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:56,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, no, I accidentally closed it during the game because I needed to keep my private message window clean during the game.

1159
01:13:57,177 --> 01:13:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you like the game tonight, Ranma?

1160
01:13:58,338 --> 01:13:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: You came very close to winning.

1161
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

1162
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved that.

1163
01:14:03,261 --> 01:14:03,801
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good.

1164
01:14:03,821 --> 01:14:04,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you liked it.

1165
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:05,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to do it again sometime.

1166
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,623
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.

1167
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:07,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1168
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:07,784
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1169
01:14:10,202 --> 01:14:10,762
[SPEAKER_06]: One more call?

1170
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:11,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1171
01:14:11,963 --> 01:14:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it doesn't get caught in the loop.

1172
01:14:14,945 --> 01:14:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: The crazy... Sucked into a black hole.

1173
01:14:17,807 --> 01:14:18,728
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that?

1174
01:14:19,548 --> 01:14:22,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not ringing off the hook, so Loki, do you have any last-minute stories you want to do?

1175
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: OneUp is going to be changing their scoring policies, apparently, how they rate games, which is quite funny.

1176
01:14:29,336 --> 01:14:36,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, instead of the point system, they're going to be changing it to letters, like grading system from A plus to F.

1177
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:41,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there's ten different letters in between there and nothing's changing.

1178
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,444
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because they're admitting, you know what they are, they're admitting, well, I guess it's not really admitting.

1179
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:51,106
[SPEAKER_03]: EGM is going to do the same thing, it's all going to start in March.

1180
01:14:51,126 --> 01:14:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what I'm saying, like, I don't know, A through F has a different kind of connotation to it than 1 through 10.

1181
01:14:56,930 --> 01:15:02,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, F is failing, it's a miserable game, whereas I think in the 1 through 10 world, 6 is seen as failing, I think.

1182
01:15:05,478 --> 01:15:08,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's the point I was trying to make that I didn't do very well.

1183
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,540
[SPEAKER_06]: But who cares?

1184
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, technically enough, it's a 60%.

1185
01:15:11,361 --> 01:15:11,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1186
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:14,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one review site on the entire internet.

1187
01:15:14,162 --> 01:15:16,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize it's a big one, but, you know, come on.

1188
01:15:16,323 --> 01:15:18,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a magazine, EGM, and Games for Windows.

1189
01:15:18,624 --> 01:15:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a world where there's demos readily available.

1190
01:15:21,786 --> 01:15:22,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your own decision.

1191
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:28,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I read reviews once in a while, but I haven't found a game reviewer I really 100% trust and like yet.

1192
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:31,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the guy from Zero Punctuation.

1193
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:32,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1194
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:33,031
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's too negative.

1195
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny but negative.

1196
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:35,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny but negative.

1197
01:15:35,289 --> 01:15:37,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones and take one last call.

1198
01:15:37,831 --> 01:15:38,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1199
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:39,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1200
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:42,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, this is Ross Deal UT.

1201
01:15:42,194 --> 01:15:43,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Deal UT.

1202
01:15:43,716 --> 01:15:44,777
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up, my friend?

1203
01:15:46,478 --> 01:15:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing, just shooting shit.

1204
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:48,440
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how that goes.

1205
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,141
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we do here at Orange Launch Radio.

1206
01:15:50,642 --> 01:15:50,942
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

1207
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:52,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

1208
01:15:53,104 --> 01:15:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've got a few things on my mind.

1209
01:15:54,745 --> 01:15:55,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too many, but a few.

1210
01:15:56,106 --> 01:15:56,387
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1211
01:15:57,508 --> 01:15:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, there's this...

1212
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:06,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there was somebody linking that already on the chat, this marine who went missing.

1213
01:16:08,556 --> 01:16:11,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what happened is that the family thinks that maybe...

1214
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:13,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty 4 Call of Duty 4

1215
01:16:41,983 --> 01:16:50,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't want to give away any of the plot line, but you invade a Middle Eastern country and a nuclear device goes off.

1216
01:16:50,826 --> 01:16:51,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1217
01:16:52,467 --> 01:17:08,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a very gritty game, you know, and I could definitely see where somebody who's been to Iraq, who's maybe having problems with post-traumatic, you know, might play that game and get a,

1218
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:10,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a bad reaction from it.

1219
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:16,590
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that he might be actually trying not to be found.

1220
01:17:18,031 --> 01:17:19,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded pretty bad.

1221
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Very unfortunate.

1222
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:23,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not a game he should have been playing in the first place.

1223
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is...

1224
01:17:25,325 --> 01:17:36,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have it out there enough for this guy to know maybe he shouldn't play this game as he's very sensitive on these type of topics or suffering from this post-war syndrome?

1225
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:42,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the responsibility of the makers of this game to put some type of disclaimer on the game?

1226
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1227
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:47,156
[SPEAKER_06]: This game might be too real for some people.

1228
01:17:47,636 --> 01:17:48,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

1229
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, though, with post-traumatic stress disorder, that sort of thing,

1230
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:57,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be any number of things that trigger it.

1231
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:04,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Any number of things could remind somebody or give someone a bad flashback.

1232
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,664
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unpredictable.

1233
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:13,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of mental disorders, it's going to affect people in different ways.

1234
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:22,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but modern warfare, you know they're going to at least deal with the Arab angle somewhat.

1235
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:23,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's

1236
01:18:24,272 --> 01:18:30,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, very unfortunate news, no matter, you know, where it kind of falls.

1237
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just kind of unfortunate that, you know, maybe this was the type of game he should have played with other people.

1238
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of the thing, too.

1239
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:39,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly what it is.

1240
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:39,449
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1241
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Call of Duty 4.

1242
01:18:41,552 --> 01:18:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1243
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Yars.

1244
01:18:43,294 --> 01:18:43,995
[SPEAKER_03]: He played Yars.

1245
01:18:44,884 --> 01:18:46,745
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's like, oh my god, I have to run.

1246
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a different kind of trauma.

1247
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:51,288
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a place in hell waiting for you, Loki.

1248
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:53,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, RustyLUT, we don't have too much time.

1249
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:54,630
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you want to say real quick tonight?

1250
01:18:56,051 --> 01:18:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this industry blog.

1251
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these industry analyst people was talking about how there's a problem where the industry has no real room for anything

1252
01:19:14,577 --> 01:19:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: between the tiny budget casual games and the tens of millions of dollars blockbusters.

1253
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put up a link right now.

1254
01:19:25,103 --> 01:19:29,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the American market, I can certainly agree with that.

1255
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:38,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We either see the huge budget Call of Duties and Gears of War or we see PopCap.

1256
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as diverse a market as, say, Japan where

1257
01:19:42,686 --> 01:19:44,907
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff all over the budget spectrum.

1258
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:55,790
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an opinion piece I didn't read before tonight's show, so it's a little harder for me to comment on it.

1259
01:19:58,271 --> 01:19:58,731
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

1260
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:01,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have enough variety in our styles of games that we have out there right now?

1261
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:08,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much styles, but we need a real be real.

1262
01:20:08,694 --> 01:20:09,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Because

1263
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:21,527
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the American market, it's PopCap games type of deal, and then there's Gears of War, Call of Duty, you know, really big budget games, and there's not a lot of stuff in between.

1264
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:25,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you compare that to Japan, where you see stuff like Chuu!

1265
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:31,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Litten no Nechanbara, you know, people just throwing crap out there, hell, even Puzzle Quest, which managed to become a hit.

1266
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:37,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what this guy's talking about is you can't really experiment with

1267
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:44,157
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're dealing with a budget of $20 million, $30 million because there's too much risk involved.

1268
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there's really only so much you can do in a little budget 2D game.

1269
01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So either extreme, you're not really having a lot of room for new ideas.

1270
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:01,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't there a similarity with movies though?

1271
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:11,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like most movies are either the art house cheap ones or the explosion Michael Bay, burning money live on screen type of movies.

1272
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a whole lot in between there either.

1273
01:21:15,398 --> 01:21:18,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the be real basically.

1274
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:24,225
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot for what people want in that middle market because...

1275
01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:28,541
[SPEAKER_05]: The American market is a lot different than the Japanese ones.

1276
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:42,649
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more people in Japan that play games for one, but there's either you've got the hardcore gamers that have been doing it for years, or the people that are just the casual gamer market, and there really is no target audience for something in between.

1277
01:21:44,369 --> 01:21:45,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing, though.

1278
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:52,414
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think that the hardcore would be the most receptive of something like, well, you look at Puzzle Quest, or

1279
01:21:54,686 --> 01:21:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Chulip, or Nechanbara.

1280
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:04,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an idea being thrown out there with maybe a $2 or $3 million budget.

1281
01:22:05,937 --> 01:22:07,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you should pick up Puzzle Quest GS68.

1282
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: This is true.

1283
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:53,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and perhaps this is just a spot where video games just have a hard time, but there has to be some place where you can actually do meaningful experimentation, because you can't do it in the casual space.

1284
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:57,386
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not enough, there's just not enough, you know, there's too many limits.

1285
01:22:58,106 --> 01:23:04,528
[SPEAKER_06]: You know... I suppose it would be hard to convince your wife that going to see Rambo would be a good Valentine's Day present, right?

1286
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:05,229
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

1287
01:23:07,455 --> 01:23:09,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's also part of it.

1288
01:23:10,177 --> 01:23:14,681
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an industry that's confined to the idea of hardcore and casual.

1289
01:23:15,302 --> 01:23:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't hear about hardcore moviegoers, casual moviegoers.

1290
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,926
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear people who like action, romance.

1291
01:23:21,407 --> 01:23:23,809
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very particular crowds for types of movies.

1292
01:23:23,849 --> 01:23:29,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the B-movie alien weirdness has its own following.

1293
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:33,577
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have that sort of market presence.

1294
01:23:34,298 --> 01:23:42,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for lack of a better term, market segregation, demographic scanning, because casual hardcore is perhaps a little too general.

1295
01:23:43,621 --> 01:23:43,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1296
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:50,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Ross DLUT, some great topics, some very deep topics you're bringing up tonight, but unfortunately we are running out of time.

1297
01:23:50,104 --> 01:23:51,124
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to wrap things up.

1298
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks for your call and provoking some good discussion.

1299
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:56,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, before I go, I'd like to do a plug.

1300
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:58,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure thing.

1301
01:23:58,647 --> 01:24:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started up a YouTube channel.

1302
01:24:01,568 --> 01:24:01,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

1303
01:24:01,868 --> 01:24:02,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1304
01:24:03,255 --> 01:24:12,257
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube.com slash user slash rawsteelut Put up a link in the chat right now.

1305
01:24:12,357 --> 01:24:16,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And what will we find on said YouTube channel?

1306
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:21,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's mostly music videos that I've compiled up, but I have a few vlogs as well.

1307
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:25,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

1308
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:28,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just kind of looking at some of the things that are in this.

1309
01:24:28,381 --> 01:24:30,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of make your own anime music videos and stuff?

1310
01:24:31,653 --> 01:24:33,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, gaming music video.

1311
01:24:33,154 --> 01:24:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, not anime.

1312
01:24:34,075 --> 01:24:35,416
[SPEAKER_06]: GMVs, not AMVs.

1313
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:36,216
[SPEAKER_06]: GMVs, I see.

1314
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:36,897
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1315
01:24:37,057 --> 01:24:41,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I also have a couple of vlogs using the PlayStation Eye, actually.

1316
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:44,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is quite an effort.

1317
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, very nice.

1318
01:24:47,605 --> 01:24:48,766
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll go into that next time.

1319
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:49,386
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1320
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:50,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you later.

1321
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:51,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, best of luck with vlogging.

1322
01:24:51,848 --> 01:24:52,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

1323
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:54,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a nice one.

1324
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:54,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

1325
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:56,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel, UT.

1326
01:24:56,372 --> 01:25:00,515
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always kind of the devil's advocate in chat, but then when he calls in, he's the nicest guy.

1327
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1328
01:25:30,795 --> 01:25:33,076
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be car surfing in Saints Row 2 and that's awesome.

1329
01:25:33,556 --> 01:25:34,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for Saints Row 2.

1330
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:36,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghost Ride the Whip.

1331
01:25:36,436 --> 01:25:36,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1332
01:25:37,097 --> 01:25:42,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently they have a picture where you have crashed a biplane into a building.

1333
01:25:43,218 --> 01:25:44,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Or driven it through a mall.

1334
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:45,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh crap.

1335
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:46,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is even better.

1336
01:25:47,259 --> 01:25:50,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm all about a game that allows you to drive a plane through a mall.

1337
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:55,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know what's waiting to happen later on.

1338
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:57,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a feature they should have had in Dead Rising, right?

1339
01:25:58,462 --> 01:25:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

1340
01:25:59,389 --> 01:25:59,649
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1341
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Puppy, thank you so much for being here tonight and participating in the show.

1342
01:26:04,531 --> 01:26:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking head number three for the night.

1343
01:26:06,752 --> 01:26:07,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

1344
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:13,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you'll have to come back again soon, and it's probably kind of nice not getting talked over tonight because there's a lot far less people in-house.

1345
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I had my own microphone the entire time.

1346
01:26:16,056 --> 01:26:16,496
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1347
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:17,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1348
01:26:17,176 --> 01:26:19,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for coming, and stay away from the gunshots in your neighborhood.

1349
01:26:20,078 --> 01:26:20,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I will certainly try to.

1350
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:21,318
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1351
01:26:21,338 --> 01:26:22,559
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to see Puppy get put down.

1352
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:23,839
[SPEAKER_06]: That would not be fun.

1353
01:26:26,512 --> 01:26:29,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any final thoughts though, Puppy, real quick?

1354
01:26:30,014 --> 01:26:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking on your prize table here and saw these applications for passports.

1355
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:36,357
[SPEAKER_06]: The passport applications are not prizes.

1356
01:26:36,397 --> 01:26:37,257
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just out there.

1357
01:26:37,297 --> 01:26:37,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just making sure.

1358
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:40,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're not giving out Rob's passport application as a prize.

1359
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:43,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something I'm working on for a trip I want to take in June.

1360
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, you know how they say it takes forever to get a passport right now?

1361
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:48,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't.

1362
01:26:48,743 --> 01:26:51,544
[SPEAKER_06]: My roommate went in and he got it in a week.

1363
01:26:52,385 --> 01:26:52,625
[SPEAKER_05]: A week.

1364
01:26:53,225 --> 01:26:53,966
[SPEAKER_06]: He's new.

1365
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:54,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a renewal.

1366
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:54,786
[SPEAKER_05]: New.

1367
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:58,030
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother managed to get one when he went to Italy.

1368
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:01,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It took him like a week and a half to get his when he went to Italy earlier this year.

1369
01:27:02,012 --> 01:27:02,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

1370
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:04,113
[SPEAKER_05]: But thankfully I'm not going out of the country.

1371
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:08,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to Texas to meet for a Puzzle Pirates party.

1372
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:10,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd.

1373
01:27:10,436 --> 01:27:13,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get William to take me back to Canada because I really want to go to Canada.

1374
01:27:14,237 --> 01:27:21,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to decide right now if it's going to be Vancouver, which I've already been to and I love, or Toronto, which I've never been to but I really want to go to.

1375
01:27:22,381 --> 01:27:24,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Toronto's winning in my mind right now, but we'll see.

1376
01:27:25,526 --> 01:27:26,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Canada once.

1377
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:33,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Victoria, and I got stuck having to go to those botanical gardens.

1378
01:27:33,768 --> 01:27:35,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love the Bouchard Gardens.

1379
01:27:35,728 --> 01:27:36,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you go knocking them.

1380
01:27:37,008 --> 01:27:39,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you go in, like, fall, then there's not a lot to see.

1381
01:27:41,989 --> 01:27:46,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I think William told me he went to the Bouchard Gardens once in October, and I'm like, dude, you went at the wrong time.

1382
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:49,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, enough travel chat.

1383
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners?

1384
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:54,151
[SPEAKER_03]: The spin the black circle thing is...

1385
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty addicting.

1386
01:27:56,221 --> 01:27:57,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I'm on this one level.

1387
01:27:57,602 --> 01:27:59,263
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been playing it all fucking night.

1388
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:01,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have been participating, okay?

1389
01:28:01,504 --> 01:28:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: This does not take that much participation.

1390
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:11,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if he had been playing the Velociraptor Safari game, you wouldn't have heard a peep out of him, unless it was maniacal laughter.

1391
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:16,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my final thought is next week's show.

1392
01:28:16,776 --> 01:28:21,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to be out of town because it's holiday slash anniversary weekend.

1393
01:28:21,901 --> 01:28:23,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going out of town.

1394
01:28:24,144 --> 01:28:27,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have a late start to the show because of it.

1395
01:28:27,488 --> 01:28:29,890
[SPEAKER_06]: More information to come later throughout the week.

1396
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:32,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure exactly what the plan is yet.

1397
01:28:32,653 --> 01:28:33,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

1398
01:28:35,286 --> 01:28:36,848
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking forward to being back here next week.

1399
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:39,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee suggests I vote because of Valentine's Day this week.

1400
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:42,895
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have William, Nellie, and Dan as guests on the show next week.

1401
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:43,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Not going to happen.

1402
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that will happen either.

1403
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good thought.

1404
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1405
01:28:50,152 --> 01:28:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for tonight's show.

1406
01:28:51,933 --> 01:28:55,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1407
01:28:55,535 --> 01:28:56,795
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we can't do this without you guys.

1408
01:28:56,835 --> 01:29:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show because that's the only way we get to spread the word.

1409
01:29:03,259 --> 01:29:05,640
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any big magazines or websites that back us.

1410
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We are literally an independent operation run out of somebody's garage, and it's your voice and talking and word of mouth that helps spread the word.

1411
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Another reason to support us, we are not changing our review system to letters.

1412
01:29:17,987 --> 01:29:18,827
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, we're not.

1413
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:24,049
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to stick with the whole vague reviews that we've always done here on the program.

1414
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Until next time, I'm Rob.

1415
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:27,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Loki.

1416
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,452
[SPEAKER_06]: She will be DarkSakura back with us next week.

1417
01:29:30,492 --> 01:29:32,473
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you then here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1418
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:38,076
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1419
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:41,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1420
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:51,110
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on our live and podcast programs, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!
