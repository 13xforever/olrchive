0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26000	Welcome back everybody, here to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 10th of 2008.
26000	30000	We're going to get back into the gaming news in just a moment, but we're really looking forward here in Part B tonight
30000	34000	to trying out a brand new game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
34000	38000	We're very excited to test out a new game. We're going to be playing that a little bit later.
38000	43000	Yes, I'm keeping it a secret what it is, but don't be worried if you weren't picked to play in tonight's game
43000	48000	because everybody in chat has a chance to play and win tonight.
48000	50000	It's amazing!
50000	53000	But here's the thing, if you were listening right at the end of Part A, even the podcast folks,
53000	61000	we asked a trivia question, and the trivia question was which one of these games is this music from?
61000	71000	And the three answers you could pick from was A, Nightmare on Elm Street, B, Halloween, or C, Friday the 13th.
71000	78000	So we'll give you a little hint, we're not going to tell you who won just yet, but we will tell you the correct answer was C, Friday the 13th.
78000	83000	So if you didn't guess Friday the 13th, sorry, you're not going to be picked tonight,
83000	87000	but you will get a chance to play in the chat room, so all hope is not lost.
87000	93000	You may still win either a copy of Res HD or if you don't have an Xbox, one of our other prizes from our new prize table,
93000	98000	I'll talk about a little more later, but if you did say Friday the 13th, you might want to stay by your phone.
98000	102000	Alright, but in the meantime, we're going to get back into some gaming news, right, Loki?
102000	112000	Yes, Fooling at Home, it's been available on PCs for a long time and just not really that recently, but on the PS3 as well.
112000	121000	Now they have hit one million users actually, at least on the PlayStation 3, so that's pretty awesome.
121000	129000	One million consoles contributing to a cure for cancer or God knows what else they're doing.
129000	137000	Calculating votes for the 2008 primaries or who knows.
137000	139000	Making a better caffeine molecule.
139000	141000	Better caffeine molecule.
141000	142000	That is something they need to work on actually.
142000	144000	Finishing Duke Nukem Forever.
144000	149000	That is also something they need to get to working on.
149000	158000	Also mentioning the PlayStation 3, which Fooling at Home appears on, there's a brand new Japanese PlayStation 3 that's going to be coming out very soon.
158000	162000	It's going to come with a 40GB hard drive and a 6-axis wireless controller.
162000	165000	It is the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.
165000	166000	It comes out on March 6th.
166000	170000	It will cost you 39,980 yen.
170000	174000	If you want to translate that into U.S. dollars, that's 376 U.S. dollars.
174000	177000	So it's the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.
177000	181000	So that should be interesting, I guess, if you like different colors.
181000	185000	Of course, everybody in Japan loves different colors.
185000	186000	I guess.
186000	192000	People were hoping that it was going to be coming out with the DualShock 3 in there as well, but nope, Sony's smarter than that.
192000	196000	They're like, hahaha, no, you have to buy that controller, bitch.
196000	200000	Alright, well that's really all there is.
200000	201000	PlayStation 3 in a new color.
201000	203000	How this is news, I don't know, but it is.
203000	204000	So there you have it.
204000	215000	According to EGM's Quarterman rumor column, in their March issue they talk about how that God of War Chain of Olympus, or Chains of Olympus,
215000	218000	will be heading to PlayStation 2.
218000	227000	Of course, this is a rumor, but seeing their trend so far with, I don't know, Twisted Metal Head On, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters, stuff like that,
227000	231000	it's not going to be too surprising if they port the PSP game to the PlayStation 2.
231000	237000	And hell, it will sell a lot of copies, so not so surprising.
237000	242000	Oh, and Silent Hill Origins, that was another one that was ported from PSP.
242000	248000	In other Sony news, Flow will be making its way to the PlayStation Portable,
248000	250000	and it comes out on March 6th.
250000	253000	The game is coming out from Super Villain Studios,
253000	260000	and yeah, I don't know why, though, you would want to get this when it's probably going to cost you more than it did on PlayStation 3.
260000	261000	How much is it?
261000	263000	I don't know, it doesn't have a price yet, but...
263000	266000	Oh no, you're going to get it through the PlayStation Store, so I guess it is the same.
266000	267000	Yeah, it might be the same price.
267000	268000	Oh, then never mind.
268000	271000	But what a pain in the ass to buy something on the store and then transfer and all that stuff, you know?
271000	275000	I haven't actually touched the PlayStation Portable store yet.
275000	278000	I haven't even looked at that, because I know now they're starting to re-release...
278000	282000	It's where they're starting to put full PlayStation Portable games on there now.
282000	283000	Huh.
283000	287000	Like, they had Wipeout, Pure you can download, and a bunch of other stuff, you know.
287000	290000	Well, because they figured that everyone else is already downloading stuff.
290000	291000	Yeah, everyone else is already downloading it.
291000	296000	So let's join the party and charge for it, and no one will still buy it.
296000	301000	I don't know, it's a cool idea to have original games on there, but you know...
301000	306000	What they need is a link to actually be able to view that store from the PSP.
306000	309000	Because, I mean, as far as I'm aware, now they don't.
309000	312000	And I don't remember the URL for it, so...
312000	314000	I ain't buying anything from it.
314000	316000	And there's a bee in here.
316000	317000	Ah, that's scary.
317000	318000	I think.
318000	319000	Is that a bee?
319000	320000	No, it's just a fly.
320000	321000	You sure?
321000	322000	Yeah, it is.
322000	323000	That's pretty big for a fly.
323000	324000	I'll take a look at it.
324000	325000	Are you scared?
325000	326000	Yeah, I'm just saying, you know.
326000	327000	Oh my god, there's a bee.
327000	328000	Well, Loki, you do news.
328000	330000	I'll take care of the bee.
330000	337360	Anyways, another game that's going to be coming out here for the PlayStation 3 also is going
337360	338360	to have...
338360	339360	It's a fly, Loki.
339360	340360	Don't be scared.
340360	341360	Oh, well, you've grown big here.
341360	342920	Yes, we do.
342920	347800	Just like Devil May Cry 4 that had a mandatory install, or not really mandatory, I guess
347800	350360	that one was more of an optional install.
350360	359680	Hot Shots Golf 5 in Japan right now has a 5GB, that's kind of ironic, install before
359680	360680	you can play the game.
360680	367120	And, of course, this is probably going to be on the US version, the Hot Shots Golf on
367120	369520	Tour, is what it's called, or Out of Bounds.
369520	375640	And that kind of sucks that this trend of now these games having to be installed, I
375640	380600	guess that's why you need your 80GB system, or 40GB, or whatever, to install these damn
380600	381600	games.
381600	382600	That actually makes a lot of sense.
382600	386400	But, you know, well, again, to play Devil's Advocate, I suppose a little bit, if the PlayStation
386400	391440	3 is supposed to be more like a computer, then we shouldn't be surprised, right?
391440	396240	Yeah, but I'm still kind of a little frustrated at the fact that, you know, consoles like
396240	398960	the Xbox 360, you don't install games like this.
398960	399960	I mean, they have...
399960	403560	The only game I know that you install stuff to it, actually there's two.
403560	408600	I think there's a Football Manager game in the UK, and then there's also Final Fantasy
408600	414160	XI, but, you know, you have to install it on every console, so that's not a big deal.
414160	420000	But it's just all because of that Blu-ray drive being slow, so that kind of sucks.
420000	425520	Alright, well, you know, on a smaller scale, Sony is doing these preload things as well.
425520	427480	It's a brand new Monster Hunter game.
427480	432480	It's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is coming out, and what this has in common with the
432480	438300	last story is that you actually have the option to copy what's on the UMD to your memory card
438300	441840	on the PSP, and that will decrease load times.
441840	445240	So it's kind of the same concept, however, we should emphasize it's optional here and
445240	448600	not required, which makes sense, because there's PSPs out there, you know, where your memory
448600	449600	card might be very small.
449600	453280	Like mine, I only have like a 32 megabyte memory card, because I bought mine a long
453280	454280	time ago.
454280	457760	I bought the PSP a long time ago before they started, like, coming with a gigabyte memory
457760	458760	stick.
458760	459760	Yeah, it's...
459760	460760	I don't know.
460760	465640	I think it's funny, though, that you can install it to the PSP memory stick, and yet all this
465640	469320	time we've been trying to stop people from installing it to their memory stick.
469320	476120	Oh, how they're so ironic.
476120	480160	Another thing that's ironic is a PSP exploding in your pocket.
480160	483600	Is that a PSP in your pocket, or are you just really happy?
483600	489960	Apparently, a student was hospitalized after suffering leg burns from a PSP.
489960	495480	He had a third-party battery in his PSP and apparently charged it up, and the battery
495480	496480	exploded.
496480	497480	It's also...
497480	501600	I kind of feel bad for the guy, I mean, it doesn't sound like he did anything wrong.
501600	502600	It does suck.
502600	503600	It does suck.
503600	508440	At least it wasn't a Sony battery, because that would be bad.
508440	509800	Or did he do anything, maybe?
509800	510800	I don't know.
510800	514200	No, he had the system turned off, and it was in his pocket, and he was in the middle of
514200	518760	band practice when all of a sudden it melted through his jeaned pocket, sending him to
518760	520880	the hospital with second-degree burns on his leg.
520880	521880	That sucks.
521880	522880	Yeah.
522880	533280	So, I don't know, luckily my PSPs aren't bursting into flames there.
533280	535280	Wow.
535280	543300	Well, it's time to move on into another segment here we like to do on this show pretty regularly.
543300	546680	Every week we like to hear from you guys and your emails that you send us at mailbag at
546680	550880	orangeloungeradio.com, and we open them up and read through the emails in a little segment
550880	559720	that we call The Mailbag.
559720	562160	Going to chat real quick though, I got to say this, we've got to read these comments
562160	563160	here.
563160	564160	SHJ100Matt says, I smell lawsuit.
564160	565160	Do you think so?
565160	566160	Do you think?
566160	569880	Maybe from the battery company, but I hope it's not, you know, they don't try to sue
569880	570880	Sony.
570880	571880	It's not their fault.
571880	572880	It's the fault of the battery manufacturers.
572880	573880	Oh, there you go.
573880	578560	All right, well, let's dig into the mailbag here and see what folks have to say tonight.
578560	580720	Again, it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
580720	582920	We'll read this one first.
582920	591440	This comes to us from, we'll call him Nathaniel P, I guess is the name based on the signature
591440	592440	there.
592440	596480	Dear cynical and acromonious cast of, I totally mispronounced that word, of Orange Lounge
596480	601600	Radio, acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio, I'm a varied gamer when it comes to my playlist
601600	604160	and currently I've been playing Guitar Hero 3.
604160	607460	Though I am also varied when it comes to my music, I listen more to classical orchestrated
607460	608760	symphony type music.
608760	612760	One of the few rock bands I find enjoyable are the fine gents of Rhapsody or Rhapsody
612760	613760	of Fire.
613760	616760	I was hoping if you knew whether any of the band's numerous songs would ever appear in
616760	620900	any Guitar Hero 3 downloadable content packs.
620900	622560	I don't think we've heard anything like that.
622560	627640	I don't know if you're going to see much more independent music come out in these packs.
627640	631840	Usually that's something that kind of happens towards the end of the cycle than so much
631840	632840	in the beginning.
632840	637160	Personally, I would expect a rock band to have more of a chance for content like that
637160	639960	since they actually release stuff on a regular basis.
639960	643200	Now here's what the band should do is they should look out for chances.
643200	645920	I don't know if you know these guys personally and trying to get them a plug on the show
645920	646920	or whatever.
646920	649280	If so, good job.
649280	652720	One thing these guys could do is maybe try to contact the folks in Guitar Hero 4 because
652720	655600	I want to say I saw a story earlier this week that I don't think made in our show world
655600	659520	tonight, but some indie band out there spilled the beans that they were going to be in Guitar
659520	663840	Hero 4 and posted this entire probable song list from the game.
663840	668160	I think it kind of made a lot of people go, I don't know about that, a little apprehensive
668160	675280	to call it actual news, but certainly Guitar Hero always has like 20, 30 independent songs
675280	676360	in there.
676360	678640	I would say go for Guitar Hero 4.
678640	681460	The band will get out there more that way.
681460	691960	This email comes to us from PKJunior92 and sends us this, Hey, I have just two questions
691960	692960	or comments.
692960	696260	First is directed to Loki and it's about the Eye of Judgment bet.
696260	700240	It's just not possible considering the caliber of the game, and I don't think ratings are
700240	703180	in negative numbers, to reach one million ever.
703180	707440	If you want to make it more reasonable, make it 500,000 copies sold, even though it probably
707440	710080	won't sell more than 350,000.
710080	712520	Loki is too safe and I think he knows it.
712520	714560	Anyways, here's my second question.
714560	718200	Well, before we get to his second question, I think that was the whole point behind Loki
718200	720320	taking the bet in the first place.
720320	725180	As much as you chatters want it, Loki does not want to come here and dress in a tingle
725180	728760	outfit and set the Eye of Judgment on fire or whatever we talk about here.
728760	729760	Right, Loki?
729760	730760	You don't really want to do that.
730760	731760	No.
731760	734040	Yeah, because you know people will take screen caps on Justin.tv and it will be all over
734040	735580	the internet the next day, right?
735580	740060	That's fine, but I mean, and I understand, I don't think it's going to hit 500,000 either,
740060	744960	but you know, I've already reduced it so many times, you know, lifetime of, you know, ever.
744960	749560	The bet was a million, and that was to Loki prove a point that the game will never sell
749560	753720	at all, and he was going to pick something completely, you know, obscure that he would,
753720	757120	you know, something completely insane, I don't even know where that bet came from, to do
757120	759620	if it actually did that, so.
759620	763920	It's kind of one of those, like, when pigs fly, the game will sell a million copies,
763920	768300	so when Loki puts on a tingle suit, the game will sell a million copies.
768300	775040	Here's the second question from pkjr92, um, sure, anyway, here's my second question, why
775040	778440	all the hate towards the Playstation 3 with the exception of Loki?
778440	781600	Sure there is almost no support from Sony, but if you have a high def TV, the games look
781600	782600	amazing.
782600	785900	Now I realize that not everyone has a nice TV, but the games still have the ability to
785900	790100	be more in-depth than Xbox 360 games, and the Playstation Network is free!
790100	791100	How about that?
791100	794600	Yeah, but you get what you pay for with the Playstation Network, unfortunately.
794600	798500	I think you kind of said it yourself in the wording, you said, but the games still have
798500	801520	the ability to be more in-depth than Xbox 360.
801520	802520	But aren't.
802520	803520	But aren't.
803520	804520	That's the part you didn't say.
804520	805520	But aren't.
805520	806520	Yet.
806520	808320	I mean, sure, the Playstation 3 is capable of a lot.
808320	809600	Let's see it!
809600	810600	Let's see it!
810600	813560	You know, home, little big planet, that kind of stuff gets us excited, you know?
813560	819440	I'd be pissed if I had to pay for Playstation Network, because it's seriously not worth
819440	820640	my time, I would say.
820640	823200	I try really hard to not bag on Sony.
823200	827400	I think I've given the PSP a lot of slack, and you know what, it's really come a long
827400	828900	way, I think, since the release.
828900	833440	But the Playstation 3, you know, it really needed to be... it wasn't first out there,
833440	837300	it really needed to be something great on day one, and it just wasn't.
837300	839400	So that's that.
839400	842800	He also wants to say, by the way, thanks for broadcasting on Super Bowl Sunday, considering
842800	844760	not everyone is in love with football.
844760	848480	However, the Stanley Cup Finals are a totally different thing, pretty much all of Canada
848480	849480	watches.
849480	852480	Well, sorry for going on and on.
852480	855760	You know a lot of Americans watch the Super Bowl, though, we are in the minority of not
855760	856760	watching it.
856760	861760	In fact, I believe this year's Super Bowl was the second highest rated American television
861760	865120	thing ever, behind the final episode of MASH.
865120	869960	But keep in mind, the final episode of MASH aired before there was cable and stuff.
869960	874400	So no broadcast network thing is ever going to do that well again.
874400	877440	Anyway, you want to say something, puppy?
877440	882640	I was just thinking that we don't broadcast from Canada, so...
882640	883640	That is true.
883640	887960	I don't even know when the hockey season ends or starts, so...
887960	888960	Hockey's pretty fun, though.
888960	893400	One of these days I'm going to get Melody to take me to a Sharks game in San Jose, well
893400	894400	let's see.
894400	896120	She gets season passes and all that stuff.
896120	897360	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
897360	898520	Let's go to another email.
898520	900400	This one comes to us from Sakura Max.
900400	905680	Hi, OLR, you people have influenced me to make an OLR Dragon Force movie contest.
905680	910520	We thread on OLR website, and that would be at www.orangehonchord.com.
910520	915040	You record footage of you playing your favorite games and play Dragon Force in your video.
915040	919000	It was influenced by the Yaris video and your mentioning of Dragon Force, hope it goes well.
919000	922760	For those who might be new to our program, we said that you can make a bad game even
922760	926840	better most of the time by putting Dragon Force music to it, because Dragon Force is
926840	928320	just that awesome.
928320	931680	And so some of our listeners have taken it upon themselves to do this, and now Sakura
931680	934160	Max wants to make a little contest out of it.
934160	935560	I say go for it.
935560	936560	It's pretty awesome.
936560	938360	I don't know what we can contribute for prizes.
938360	941000	Maybe we're trying to reserve some things on the prize table for something else, but
941000	942480	maybe we can dig up something.
942480	943480	So participate.
943480	947200	And a complete side note, Dragon Force sucks ass live.
947200	948200	Really?
948200	949200	Yes, they do.
949200	950200	When did you see them live?
950200	952640	I didn't, but I know they are.
952640	957740	I heard on the radio that they were going to be playing live at some event coming up
957740	960920	in like two months from now in Sacramento.
960920	964840	So I just decided, oh, hey, I'll see what they sound like live, and went to YouTube,
964840	968360	and was terribly disappointed.
968360	970400	All right.
970400	974000	Well here comes the next email, one of two remaining emails we're going to read this
974000	975000	week.
975000	976720	Sorry if we didn't get to your email, but we got a few this week.
976720	978360	This comes to us from J-Rod.
978360	980200	I think this is a Loki hate mail.
980200	982080	Oh crap, oh crap.
982080	983080	Good times.
983080	984080	Let me back away.
984080	985080	I love these emails.
985080	986080	All right, here we go.
986080	988480	I just wanted to write in, nah, it's not really a hate mail.
988480	992040	I just wanted to write in and completely put over Loki.
992040	996520	There's anger and cynicism on the show not only make for hilarious radio, but most of
996520	997720	the time echo my own thoughts.
997720	998720	All right, I was lying.
998720	999720	It's not a hate mail.
999720	1003440	Quite a few times though it seems like he's very out of place, because Rob and Jamie are
1003440	1008520	pretty optimistic people, and it's usually silent after one of Loki's rants.
1008520	1012500	Not one of those let him have the stage silent moments, but an uncomfortable what's this
1012500	1014200	guy's deal silent moments.
1014200	1016680	I was surprised to hear that Loki and Sky used to room together.
1016680	1020000	I was just so interested in the relationship between all you guys, because you seem so
1020000	1021200	radically different.
1021200	1024800	But say you.
1024800	1026680	So are you just an angry person who rants all the time?
1026680	1027680	I'm not an angry person.
1027680	1028680	Yeah.
1028680	1031480	No, something you guys should know, in the time that I lived with Loki, it's not like
1031480	1036080	he goes around in his personal life and goes, oh my God, what the hell?
1036080	1037080	Very much.
1037080	1040480	I mean, he does once in a while, but only when super bacon baking goes wrong.
1040480	1041920	I don't bake super bacon anymore.
1041920	1042920	You did back in the day.
1042920	1043920	I do back in the day.
1043920	1045920	You know it.
1045920	1051000	Well, the way, obviously, I think I've told a story on the show before, but to go back,
1051000	1054680	remember Orange Lounge Radio History, when we started this show, the first few years
1054680	1057880	that we were doing it, it was all about DDR and music-based video games.
1057880	1063120	That's because Loki, myself, and Dark Sakura all met at an arcade playing DDR in the local
1063120	1064120	Sacramento scene.
1064120	1069440	We used to play together with some other folks and go out to dinner afterwards, to this restaurant
1069440	1071080	that was right across the street from Golf Land.
1071080	1075720	And so we wanted to kind of create a show that had that feel of going to dinner and
1075720	1079120	talking smack about games and talking about the community or what have you.
1079120	1082960	It's kind of, I guess you could say it's a spin-off of another show I used to be on,
1082960	1085320	Understation Live, which is a very similar kind of vibe.
1085320	1086720	So that's why we're here.
1086720	1090400	And Loki and I used to be roommates because there was just a point where Loki was looking
1090400	1093300	to move out the same time I was, and it just made sense.
1093300	1095960	So there you have it.
1095960	1100880	As far as us being silent when he does rants and things, you know, sometimes there's just
1100880	1103520	no way to respond.
1103520	1104520	There's no way to respond.
1104520	1108360	Also, I have to be honest, I'll let you in on a little secret, we have to multitask like
1108360	1110000	crazy to make this show happen.
1110000	1116040	I mean, keep in mind, relatively on this show for a live radio program, there's not a lot
1116040	1117920	of dead air.
1117920	1121540	And keep in mind that when Jamie, myself, and Loki are all here, we're juggling from
1121540	1125400	story to story, trying to kind of glance at the parts of the story we actually want to
1125400	1126800	read on the air.
1126800	1128440	We're trying to read the chat room.
1128440	1129720	We're trying to, you know, bring up everything.
1129720	1132920	So sometimes we can't totally focus on what's being said.
1132920	1136280	So sometimes I kind of get in that mode where when Loki rants, I just let him rant.
1136280	1139240	I go, okay, Loki's ranting, you know, just kind of let him do his thing.
1139240	1144120	Because it is insanely funny to listen to and the listeners love it, so why not, right?
1144120	1145120	Sure.
1145120	1146120	Everyone loves Loki.
1146120	1149320	And in terms of multitasking, Loki's still doing that now.
1149320	1152040	Yeah, he's playing his fucking game while I try to do the mailbag.
1152040	1154320	I am contributing to the show, okay?
1154320	1156440	I am talking.
1156440	1161280	It's just, it's been the black circles, only two keys, and I can do that with one hand.
1161280	1165120	Alright, one more thing in J-Rod's email that I think is great, unfortunately Jamie's not
1165120	1166120	here to see it.
1166120	1170600	She said, also, I attached a picture I took before I went to see Rambo that you guys might
1170600	1171600	like.
1171600	1173080	Awesome show and keep on rocking.
1173080	1174740	And J-Rod's signature as always.
1174740	1178520	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
1178520	1181220	And here's the email in front of the Olive Garden.
1181220	1184240	There is who I assume to be J-Rod wearing a Silent Hill shirt.
1184240	1186520	I actually own that exact same Silent Hill shirt.
1186520	1187520	That's awesome.
1187520	1191680	And I hope Pyramid Head was going to go in there and cut up some pasta for you guys to
1191680	1192680	have.
1192680	1196480	By the way, F-you to the Olive Garden for getting rid of the dish I like there, the
1196480	1197800	Tuscan chicken dish.
1197800	1198800	Oh, oh no.
1198800	1199800	Ah, they got rid of it.
1199800	1201280	They have a new thing that's pretty good though.
1201280	1204760	And I don't want to hear from the listeners that go, Olive Garden isn't real Italian food.
1204760	1205840	I know.
1205840	1206840	It's not.
1206840	1207840	You win.
1207840	1208840	It's not real Italian food.
1208840	1209840	But you know what?
1209840	1213840	Some days you feel like, like some days you feel like a gourmet burger, right?
1213840	1215740	You want to go to Black Angus, right?
1215740	1218160	Some days you feel like McDonald's.
1218160	1221440	I say the same thing with Italian food, okay?
1221440	1227200	And unless you have Italian parents, you're not going to get real Italian food.
1227200	1228200	Probably not.
1228200	1229880	Or an Italian grandmother, honestly.
1229880	1234840	Yeah, I came from that kind of a family, so I know what Italian food is.
1234840	1236840	You had a nana?
1236840	1240880	Oh yeah, my grandma, she spoiled me and my brother.
1240880	1241880	Alright.
1241880	1242880	Not just with food.
1242880	1243880	Alright.
1243880	1244880	Oh, buying you video games and stuff?
1244880	1245880	Oh, of course, yes.
1245880	1246880	Alright.
1246880	1249400	One last email here, and it comes to us from Gray Fox.
1249400	1253360	Hey, OLR gang, first of all, I would just like to say that it's cool that Rob and I
1253360	1255680	are now officially friends on Facebook.
1255680	1258280	Now I can look at all of his sexy pictures without him even knowing.
1258280	1259280	Hey now.
1259280	1261280	Whoa, did I say that out loud?
1261280	1262280	Haha, just kidding.
1262280	1263280	I'm not that creepy.
1263280	1264280	I think you are a little bit.
1264280	1265280	Actually, no, I'm kidding.
1265280	1266280	Anyways.
1266280	1268080	Oh my god, I'm as bad as Loki.
1268080	1272740	I was wondering if it was possible to listen to some of the first episodes you guys recorded.
1272740	1275920	The podcast feed only lets me go back to listen to October 2005.
1275920	1278280	Actually, it does.
1278280	1282000	I didn't even think the podcast feed went that far back, unless you've been listening
1282000	1285800	that long, because usually the podcast feed only keeps like 20 shows.
1285800	1286800	That's it.
1286800	1290640	Also, I really like Dark Sakura's classic Game of the Week segment in the show.
1290640	1293520	I think that it is good to pay respect to our elders, as Rob puts it.
1293520	1297200	I loved Batman for the NES back in the day, but I'm not sure if it would have quite the
1297200	1299200	same appeal now.
1299200	1300200	Batman was a pretty awesome game.
1300200	1302560	It was one of the better movie to video game games.
1302560	1305720	Recently I stumbled upon the Lego Star Wars series for PlayStation 2, and I can't believe
1305720	1307040	how much fun it is.
1307040	1310320	Really good party game that is really easy and even hilarious at some points.
1310320	1314280	I highly recommend it for anyone that just wants to have some good old fashioned fun.
1314280	1317840	Last comment, I'm thinking about purchasing a PSP, but was wondering if Loki knew if it
1317840	1322680	was worth installing custom firmware on it, or if I can run homebrew on it without it.
1322680	1326240	You have to put a custom firmware to run homebrew on it.
1326240	1328480	Thanks and keep up the great work, Gray Fox.
1328480	1329480	P.S.
1329480	1332480	I hope another fly lands in Rob's coffee, because that was friggin' hilarious.
1332480	1334640	Oh, and say no to exploding babies.
1334640	1339000	Thankfully, the fly problem in here seems relatively taken care of, except for the one.
1339000	1340000	There was the one.
1340000	1341000	There was the one.
1341000	1343880	He was flying around here earlier, and he flew in front of my face.
1343880	1348160	He's not being too annoying as his brothers and sisters were a few weeks ago.
1348160	1350880	Relatively the fly problem's been in check here in the studio, and I think that's as
1350880	1352860	it's been getting warmer outside.
1352860	1353920	So there you have it.
1353920	1356280	The other question was about the old episodes of the show.
1356280	1358760	You know, at this time we don't have any of the really old shows posted.
1358760	1363600	I'm going to be honest, most, some of them are lost and will probably never be heard
1363600	1367640	again unless some of our old listeners who used to record happen to have them.
1367640	1370480	I know one for sure is gone.
1370480	1371480	It's really old.
1371480	1373440	It's like episode 80-something, I think.
1373440	1379360	But a lot of the old shows we do kind of have, but our problem with distributing the old
1379360	1380600	shows is this.
1380600	1385020	We used to play music during the breaks on the old shows, and so for us to like sell
1385020	1390720	DVDs or whatever is kind of difficult because we had the music during the breaks, plus the
1390720	1393760	show really wasn't like what it is now.
1393760	1398120	I mean, if you think we get off topic now, you should hear the old show.
1398120	1400760	I mean, my God, it was a mess.
1400760	1401760	In a good way.
1401760	1403880	It was a fun mess, you know, but it was much different.
1403880	1408160	So if, I think it's kind of one of those things where I want to let true, and I'm sure
1408160	1411080	Loki and Darkseid were, we want to let true fans of Orange Lawns Radio who like our band
1411080	1414000	and stuff, we want to let them hear it, but we don't want to put it out there so much
1414000	1418200	that people are going to hear that thinking that is Orange Lawns Radio today because they
1418200	1420180	would be like really off.
1420180	1422920	So does that make sense?
1422920	1428720	And back when the studio was like a six by six foot square box.
1428720	1432240	Drunami says in the chat room, the old OLR was a great clusterfuck.
1432240	1433720	Yes it was.
1433720	1436920	I don't know, maybe like in the forums or on the LJ community or something, I'll
1436920	1441760	put an old episode, or Facebook for you obviously, I'll put an old episode up there so you
1441760	1443280	can kind of taste what it's like.
1443280	1448040	And I know like Misty and DDR Angel when she was around, she hasn't been around a lot
1448040	1451600	lately, but I know both of them really keep a lot of archives, so I'll try to put up
1451600	1457200	an episode that even Misty doesn't have and everybody will like that, at least those
1457200	1458480	that want to hear it.
1458480	1460280	So there you have it, our mailbag.
1460280	1466920	If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelownsradio.com.
1466920	1471680	So if you're a member of Steam, you have a lot of other friends that are going to
1471680	1478200	be on there of course, because Steam has hit 15 million accounts.
1478200	1483000	That's quite a lot, and of course lots of good content that they have on there and they
1483000	1485000	keep adding more stuff.
1485000	1493160	So apparently Valve had a lot to do with it, their Steam-based sales have jumped 158% over
1493160	1499240	the holiday season compared to the previous ones, so that's pretty awesome.
1499240	1503200	Definitely a viable source for gaming.
1503200	1505680	I still have yet to even check out Steam.
1505680	1507280	Have you ever used Steam?
1507280	1508280	Right.
1508280	1509280	I don't know.
1509280	1510280	Like I buy games.
1510280	1511280	Oh, stop.
1511280	1517560	Yeah, and you're going to get in trouble for that someday, but you know, what about its
1517560	1518560	other elements?
1518560	1521720	Like doesn't it have like the XFire thing built into it too where you can message across
1521720	1522720	games and stuff?
1522720	1525160	Like I like XFire, it's pretty cool.
1525160	1529280	The NYR fam loves Steam in chat, he says Steam is the best, it kicks games for Windows apps.
1529280	1533240	I'm not saying I have pirate games on the PC, I haven't bought games on PC in a long
1533240	1537400	time because up until recently I haven't had a PC that can run games.
1537400	1544880	The last game I bought on PC was Final Fantasy XI, so it's been a while, I mean I guess crisis
1544880	1550280	since that came out, well that came with my graphics card though, but it's still, I'm
1550280	1554200	looking forward to some stuff coming out like Spore and stuff, I'll buy that.
1554200	1557920	Alright, well let's go over to the Nintendo Wii because we haven't been showing Nintendo
1557920	1562320	a lot of love tonight and I want to talk about some stuff that's coming on the Wii soon and
1562320	1565240	that is everyone's Nintendo channel.
1565240	1567960	You might remember this came out in Japan a little while ago and it was kind of like
1567960	1569280	a preview channel.
1569280	1572200	You could check out some new games that are coming out, now not that you really download
1572200	1577060	full demos and stuff, but you get interviews, basically it's one giant infomercial of a
1577060	1580720	channel, but the big thing was the DS downloads, that you could get, you could get DS demos
1580720	1584680	beamed to your DS, and the question was, when in the hell is it coming to the US?
1584680	1588400	Well the answer is, about next month.
1588400	1592040	That is coming from an insider source reporting to Kotaku, who ran the story earlier this
1592040	1593040	week.
1593040	1594040	I'm not surprised.
1594040	1597480	The channel will be home to some of the same sort of video game videos that you see on
1597480	1600120	Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
1600120	1603960	Convention videos might actually start popping up on the channel once it goes live in the
1603960	1604960	States.
1604960	1608680	I'm assuming because like Penny Arcade Expo is up in that same area where Nintendo of
1608680	1611040	America is, maybe that's one you can expect to see?
1611040	1612040	I don't know.
1612040	1613040	Maybe.
1613040	1616320	I wouldn't be surprised because I want to say March is also the estimated time for when
1616320	1619960	the WiiWare channel is going to launch, and I bet all of this is going to be documented
1619960	1624840	when they, I don't know if they have a keynote at, I want to say at the Game Developers Conference,
1624840	1628360	which is, God I think that's next week or the week after.
1628360	1629360	It is.
1629360	1630360	Sadly I'm not going.
1630360	1632960	I don't think any of us are.
1632960	1637320	And I know talking to some buddies over All Games or at least listening to their shows,
1637320	1642880	All Games Interactive, our friends over there, only Jessica is going, and Bobby B's not going
1642880	1643880	this year.
1643880	1644880	Yeah.
1644880	1645880	Which is kind of too bad.
1645880	1646880	It's, you know, I would love to go, but.
1646880	1648740	Well, it's not really a media event.
1648740	1652260	You know, it's not E3, and I think a lot of people get that confused and they expect the
1652260	1654600	big announcements at Game Developers Conference.
1654600	1657160	It's not really for you, it's for developers.
1657160	1660840	But you may, but sometimes because of that you get new engines, like we talked about
1660840	1664240	last week, the Crysis 2 engines that we showed you.
1664240	1667520	You get to get little peaks from a developer angle, but that's really it.
1667520	1670880	And also you get to see stuff like you might not normally see.
1670880	1674600	Like I'm expecting them to talk about WiiWare since that makes sense from a developer's
1674600	1677560	standpoint that they would want to address that stuff.
1677560	1681720	Also there's rumors that, you know, that Microsoft is going to have something similar to like,
1681720	1686640	you know, a YouTube of gaming type thing that they may discuss too.
1686640	1690760	You'll see announcements like that, you know, talking about their network upgrades and crap
1690760	1691760	like that.
1691760	1696560	So that's what I'm kind of excited for, and god damn seriously Sony, I mean, the PlayStation
1696560	1700760	Eye have seen a lot of those cool things that they're showing off in their blogs and stuff.
1700760	1702080	Start implementing some of this stuff.
1702080	1705760	I mean, they have really good ideas, but they're just kind of like, look what we can do with
1705760	1706760	this!
1706760	1710960	But we're never going to use it, so fuck it, you know, come on!
1710960	1713400	All right.
1713400	1718160	I want to say really quickly before we get to the next story, TigerClaw is in chat and
1718160	1720000	he's a big listener over at AGI.
1720000	1723720	In fact, I think he came to our show because of all games and our syndication there.
1723720	1726640	He says Jessica's bringing the Justin cam with her, he thinks.
1726640	1729960	So that's kind of cool, if she's taking that cam with her.
1729960	1731280	Justin TV is a great way to get that.
1731280	1733700	I wish we were able to go more mobile with Justin TV.
1733700	1736860	I think we can, because we have a laptop and camera, it's just difficult.
1736860	1737860	You know, it's not easy.
1737860	1738860	Because they're not together.
1738860	1740640	Well, you know, you can get the cameras loose.
1740640	1743980	Well, most people put the camera in the backpack, or I mean, put the laptop in the backpack
1743980	1747160	and have the wire sticking out and put the, I mean, you can do it with that eyesight because
1747160	1750440	that eyesight pops right out of the base, so you could just strap it to a helmet.
1750440	1752400	We could do it, but it's just, it's hard.
1752400	1755740	And it wouldn't run for very long on that laptop's battery either, because the laptop
1755740	1756740	doesn't function when it's closed.
1756740	1759780	I don't know if that's a setting I can change on there, but oh well.
1759780	1760780	It's not worth it.
1760780	1762400	Do you really want to see us out and about in public?
1762400	1763400	I don't think so.
1763400	1764400	Let's have our privacy.
1764400	1765400	Maybe.
1765400	1767840	Mine works with the thing closed.
1767840	1770400	Ah, don't, don't, don't give my ideas.
1770400	1775160	I'm just saying, all right.
1775160	1779880	A game I wasn't too hot on, but a lot of other people were, Drawn to Life.
1779880	1784240	THQ has announced that it's going to be coming to the Wii, which is cool.
1784240	1786560	I mean, it was a neat game, I guess.
1786560	1790880	I just probably need to play it a little bit more, but it's a game where you can draw your
1790880	1791880	own character.
1791880	1797200	Fortunately, it's not a magic pen gel or graffiti kingdom, because, oh god, I love those games.
1797200	1804480	Those games are endless possibilities, endless possibilities, especially when you're drunk.
1804480	1811760	It's just like, oh god, and you can have Red Blob versus Blue Blob, Penis versus 2DX controller,
1811760	1812760	you know?
1812760	1813760	It's hilarious.
1813760	1814760	Good times.
1814760	1815760	Good times.
1815760	1816760	All right.
1816760	1819360	Before we get into our next news story, we're going to be getting into tonight's new game
1819360	1820640	very soon.
1820640	1825160	And as I mentioned, the entire chat room has the possibility to participate, but you have
1825160	1827920	to participate through private message.
1827920	1831920	During tonight's game, the chat room will be locked, and you will be unable to speak
1831920	1833180	in the chat room during the game.
1833180	1836100	This is to prevent cheating from you guys for helping each other out.
1836100	1838560	So you have to play this game through private message.
1838560	1843360	So if you are interested in playing tonight's game, you have to send me, and just in TV
1843360	1844400	chat will not work.
1844400	1846780	You need to be in chat.orangeandraday.com.
1846780	1851060	If you are interested in playing tonight's game and possibly winning the prize tonight,
1851060	1856640	which is Res HD or something else if you don't have an Xbox 360, just send me a private message.
1856640	1858160	I'm Skye in the chat room.
1858160	1859160	That's S-K-I-E.
1859160	1863240	Send me a private message that just says, me, or I want to play.
1863240	1864240	Me.
1864240	1865240	Okay?
1865240	1868040	Send me a private message if you want to play, and we'll let you know the next part very
1868040	1871320	soon when we reveal what we're going to be playing tonight and the contestant who's going
1871320	1872920	to be coming in over the phone.
1872920	1878800	So while you guys send that in, I've got one more story for you guys.
1878800	1888260	Nintendo has apparently revealed that they have sold 10 million virtual console games.
1888260	1892920	So even if you think that, okay, so 10 million, the lowest price somebody's paying for those
1892920	1898440	is five bucks, that's $50 million they've earned on the virtual console games, considering
1898440	1904260	most of the stuff was written off, gone, we're never going to profit off of this stuff again.
1904260	1911840	So there it went in free money, basically, from the virtual console, and Satoru Iwata,
1911840	1915400	who's of course the president of Nintendo, talked about that this is proof of the value
1915400	1920400	of digital distribution, however, not totally discounting the retail channel, saying that
1920400	1926840	the retail channel is still important, but also admits that retail is not quite as profitable.
1926840	1929240	It's low profit margins on the box titles.
1929240	1932440	So could Nintendo be stepping more and more into digital distribution?
1932440	1933720	Who knows?
1933720	1934720	Possibly quite soon.
1934720	1938800	Yeah, not any time soon, because they're freaking slow.
1938800	1941120	Where are they going to put all those digital downloads on the box?
1941120	1947160	You can't digitally download a Wii remote or a balance board and all that crap you got
1947160	1948160	to buy.
1948160	1951840	Before you get to your story, Loki, I want to say, for those in chat, if you try to do
1951840	1955740	a private message conversation via DCC, it will not work.
1955740	1959420	The DCC client that's built into MIRC, you need to do it another way.
1959420	1961640	Look at Dark Tetsuya's post in chat.
1961640	1962840	He shows you guys how to do it.
1962840	1966240	So please get to doing that.
1966240	1971120	Tomitsu Magazine had some details on the brand new Mario Kart Wii.
1971120	1977560	It's going to sport 32 courses, mid-air tricks, and of course, Mii integration, which sounds
1977560	1978560	pretty awesome.
1978560	1983500	They're going to be remaking, I know, some of the tracks that were in Mario Kart DS,
1983500	1988120	as well as pretty much all the Mario games.
1988120	1993800	Of course, they are saying that 16 of the tracks that are going to be from other games
1993800	1998400	and the other 16 are brand new, although I wish there were more brand new tracks and
1998400	2002040	less of the repeated tracks, but whatever.
2002040	2007380	12-player online matches will also be available, and you'll be able to play 4-player split
2007380	2012280	screen, and I think you can play 2-player over online, too, so you can do 2 people per
2012280	2013960	console as well.
2013960	2020320	Ghost downloads, time trials will also be available, and you can also, of course, choose
2020320	2022440	a bike or a kart.
2022440	2029920	I wonder which version of Rainbow Road they would use, because there's quite a few.
2029920	2036280	And you know if they don't do Rainbow Road just right, people are going to be pissed,
2036280	2037280	so we'll see.
2037280	2040120	All right, you ready to get to tonight's game?
2040120	2041120	Yay!
2041120	2042660	All right, well let's get to tonight's game.
2042660	2046640	By the way, you only have about 15 more seconds to send me a private message or you are out.
2046640	2048880	You cannot join the game midway through.
2048880	2051160	You are out if you don't send me a private message, okay?
2051160	2052640	Time is almost up.
2052640	2058080	However, we need to get one contestant on the phone, so hopefully if you answered Friday
2058080	2061520	the 13th in our thing earlier, you might want to stand by the phone, because it could be
2061520	2063200	ringing right now.
2063200	2069240	Let's put in the number of our contestant.
2069240	2073080	Live radio folks, sorry for any delays or dead area here.
2073080	2074880	Here it goes, it's ringing.
2074880	2077160	Hello, is this Tiger Claw?
2077160	2078400	Yo, what's up?
2078400	2080000	Hey, it's Orange Lounge Radio.
2080000	2081360	Guess what?
2081360	2083480	Yeah, I think I know.
2083480	2084480	You think you know?
2084480	2087360	That's right, you're going to be playing a game with us tonight.
2087360	2089560	Tiger Claw, it's a brand new game.
2089560	2090560	What do you think about that?
2090560	2091560	Oh, exciting.
2091560	2094080	I know, it's very exciting.
2094080	2097760	How would you say your knowledge of video game trivia is?
2097760	2106400	Well, I would guess so and so, considering that I've been around since it was invented.
2106400	2112960	Do you think that, were you playing Pong back in the day?
2112960	2117640	Yeah, my first video game was Pong, and after that was the Power 2600.
2117640	2119800	Awesome, well then maybe you have an advantage.
2119800	2124260	Do you think you know enough about video game trivia that you could beat the entire chat
2124260	2126680	room at video game trivia?
2126680	2132200	Maybe, I don't know, I didn't play every single video game that's out there.
2132200	2133720	That's not a game show answer.
2133720	2137680	That's not a game show answer, you're supposed to say, fuck yeah, I can beat them.
2137680	2141480	I could see what I possibly know, man.
2141480	2142480	I know.
2142480	2143480	He sucks.
2143480	2146760	Well, you know what, Tiger Claw, I hope you can do it, because tonight we are going to
2146760	2158760	be playing a new game called One vs. the Chat Room.
2158760	2165520	That's right, it's a take of another popular show that you might be hearing on the television.
2165520	2169320	One vs. the Chat Room, so here it is.
2169320	2175480	You're playing tonight, Tiger Claw, to win a possible copy of Res HD on the Xbox 360.
2175480	2177520	Do you own an Xbox 360?
2177520	2178520	Of course.
2178520	2179520	Alright, do you have Res HD?
2179520	2180520	Nope.
2180520	2184900	Oh, then you know you'd be perfect for winning this code, but here's the thing, Tiger Claw,
2184900	2188320	if at any point during the game, we're going to ask you some questions, if at any point
2188320	2195800	during the game, the Chat Room beats you, we're going to give it to one of them.
2195800	2200880	By the way, chatters, if you don't have an Xbox 360, or you already have Res HD, we're
2200880	2205400	going to offer you something off of our brand new prize table, and tonight, since I know
2205400	2210920	you guys all have PCs, we're going to be giving away, if you don't have Res HD, we're going
2210920	2216160	to give you a brand new PC game from our buddies at PopCap, who sent us some PC games earlier
2216160	2219920	this week, so everybody has a chance to win something tonight, even if you don't have
2219920	2221360	an Xbox 360.
2221360	2224400	Let me explain how the game works.
2224400	2227800	Everybody that's in chat, pretty soon, the chat is going to go into lockdown, you will
2227800	2231680	not be able to speak publicly within the room, it's going to get very quiet in there, you
2231680	2234240	will only be able to play this game through private message.
2234240	2240280	I'm going to be asking Tiger Claw multiple choice questions with three possible answers.
2240280	2245440	You will have about 30 seconds to send your answer to me via private message, then Tiger
2245440	2247480	Claw will answer the question.
2247480	2253920	If he gets it right, anybody in chat who gets it wrong will be eliminated and will not be
2253920	2256680	able to proceed any further in the game.
2256680	2260540	Anybody who gets it right along with Tiger Claw will go to the next question.
2260540	2265560	If Tiger Claw gets through five questions without the chatroom beating him, then he
2265560	2266640	will win the game.
2266640	2270320	If, however, at any point, and it could be on the very first question, if at any point,
2270320	2274560	even on the very first question, if he loses, those that got the right answer will be eligible
2274560	2279400	to win the prize we will pick one of the chat chatters randomly to win the prize
2279400	2282820	so we'll kind of explain that a little more as we move through it let's see how
2282820	2285680	many chatters are actually playing tonight want to see how many chatters we
2285680	2291600	have and who you're playing against? Tigerclaw? Probably the entire chat room. Just about I
2291600	2294200	hate to say it we have just about the entire damn chat room we're playing
2294200	2298200	against tonight let's see we got Rama that's one, Frisbee two, RosteelUT three,

3067040	3068000	All right, in order to do that,
3068000	3070080	we gotta put this in moderated mode again
3070080	3071060	so they can't cheat.

3082040	3085400	games Rob hates.
3085400	3087320	And I didn't have the question fully typed out.

3089520	3091040	What games do you hate, Logie?
3091040	3096040	I'm hating this level of spin black circle.
3096280	3097120	But...
3097120	3099360	You've been going at this one level for like 15 minutes.
3099360	3101840	I got close to the end too, it's pissing me off.

3117060	3119000	Here we go, we're gonna eliminate a few more people here
3119000	3121440	on this question for games Rob hates.
3121440	3126440	Okay, in the game Bubsy, have you ever played Bubsy?
3127360	3129280	Unfortunately, yes, and Bubsy 3.
3129280	3131520	Oh, I'm sorry for you, okay.
3131520	3132360	Here it is.
3132360	3135020	In the game Bubsy, which of the following
3135020	3136900	did you collect for points?
3136900	3141900	Was it A, cheese pieces, B, yarn balls, or C, leaves?
3143160	3144600	I actually put one, two, three in chat,
3144600	3145600	but it shouldn't be that big a deal.
3145600	3148240	Okay, was it cheese pieces, yarn balls, or leaves?
3148240	3149360	I remember this one.
3149360	3151620	See if we can get it right.
3152880	3157240	God, I wasn't part of the mob, if you think you're that.
3157240	3158400	You could be a, maybe an accent,
3158400	3161360	you could be a special guest celebrity on the mob.
3162960	3167080	Bob's that, could you do the special and you're not sure.
3167080	3168840	All right, all the chatters are in, cut off the theme.
3168840	3170840	All right, thank God.
3170840	3172700	All right, let's see, let's go through one at a time
3172700	3175120	to see who got it right and who didn't get it right.
3175120	3180120	Let's see, all right, wow.
3180560	3182040	All right, the correct answer in the game,
3182040	3184560	Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?
3184560	3187160	It was not cheese pieces, it was not leaves,
3187160	3189560	it was yarn balls, is the correct answer.
3189560	3190600	He's a cat.
3190600	3193220	And how many of the chatters do you think we eliminated?
3193220	3194060	None.
3194060	3194880	None.
3194880	3195720	Damn.
3195720	3196560	None of them, it's all six.
3196560	3199080	So, Puppy, I need you to pick a number, one through six.
3200520	3203960	I'm gonna do, oh, I should've brought out my dice.
3203960	3205080	Oh, you're gonna roll a dice.
3205080	3206840	Yes, because I hate picking random numbers.
3206840	3210040	It's between Ryoma, Dark Tetsuya, SSJ 100 Matt,
3210040	3212040	Drew Nami, Raw Steel, UT, and Rama,

3232320	3233680	Exactly.
3233680	3235480	So, I'm asking SSJ 100 Matt if he's gonna take
3235480	3236440	the ResHD code.
3236440	3239000	I seem to recall last week he didn't want it.
3239000	3240380	Okay, he wants the other prize.
3240380	3242560	So, SSJ 100 Matt, coming to you very soon,
3242560	3244920	you're gonna be getting a copy courtesy of our friends
3244920	3249560	at PopCap Game, Bejeweled 2, the hit sequel to Bejeweled.
3249560	3250860	Now, this is the full version.
3250860	3253800	This is not the crap, oh, I shouldn't say the crap version,
3253800	3256360	but the reduced version that you play online.
3256360	3258520	This is the full version of the game,
3258520	3259560	and if you're kinda thinking,
3259560	3260680	well, I don't really want Bejeweled 2,
3260680	3263360	this will make an awesome Valentine's Day gift
3263360	3264200	for somebody as well.
3264200	3265040	My wife loves some Bejeweled 2.
3265040	3268600	Exactly, the ladies love Bejeweled.
3268600	3270920	So, Bejeweled comes to us from our friends at PopCap.
3270920	3273860	Four different modes of play in this version.
3273860	3275980	It'll keep you going for hours and hours.
3275980	3279060	Classic mode, action mode, puzzle mode, endless mode.
3279060	3280640	Enjoy, there you have it.
3282480	3285920	So, there you go, SSJ 100 Matt wins Bejeweled 2
3285920	3287360	courtesy of PopCap Games.
3287360	3288580	What'd you guys think, chat room,
3288580	3289920	did you guys like that prize,
3289920	3291320	or did you guys like that game?
3291320	3293760	Was that fun?
3293760	3295560	I hope so, did you guys think the game went well?
3295560	3296400	I think it was cool.
3296400	3297240	It was fun?
3297240	3298560	Yeah, our first run it went pretty well.
3298560	3301160	I don't know how much it's gonna translate
3301160	3303520	to the podcast where people can't play,
3303520	3305600	but I think for the live listeners, that was a lot of fun.
3305600	3306440	For the folks on the podcast.
3306440	3308280	Well, it's just as much fun as watching a game show on TV.
3308280	3310680	Yeah, I'm hoping for the podcast listeners
3310680	3311640	and the folks listening to all games,
3311640	3313120	they could kinda like think in their mind
3313120	3314480	like how they would've done.
3314480	3315880	Like maybe they could've had the chance
3315880	3317160	if they were here live on Sunday night.
3317160	3318840	You know everybody that watches the game show
3318840	3321160	thinks they can do better than the person on TV.
3321160	3323120	That's always the way it is.
3323120	3325320	All right, Peter Uno says,
3325320	3327400	I didn't know any of the answers.
3327400	3329360	He did pretty well, he says it was fun though.
3329360	3331760	Dark Knight says it should make it its own show.
3332800	3334720	Peter Uno says, make a Bimani edition.
3334720	3336280	Who knows, Son of Dad says
3336280	3338480	more fighting game questions needed.
3338480	3339560	Ryoma says, more trivia.
3339560	3341280	All right, well, I'm sure that segment
3341280	3342920	will make a comeback in a future edition
3342920	3344140	of Orange Lounge Radio.
3345380	3347720	I hope you guys enjoyed that.
3347720	3350000	All right, that's it.
3350000	3352000	We're gonna go to the Skype line very soon,
3352000	3354540	but quickly, another couple stories for us.
3356600	3358640	Well, Bandai Namco is definitely taking
3358640	3360760	a different approach for games.
3360760	3364760	For the DS, they're releasing a game called 99 Tears.
3364760	3367760	It is basically 99 different stories
3367760	3369340	that you'll read that are very depressing
3369340	3371240	that are supposed to make you cry.
3371240	3372320	Because apparently they think
3372320	3374780	that it's very therapeutic to cry.
3374780	3376440	And that gamers have emotions.
3376440	3379200	It's providing with sad graphic novel
3379200	3382280	to read for 15 minutes at the end of each day
3382280	3384760	with a brief questionnaire following shortly after.
3384760	3387660	The result will help you move closer to the story,
3387660	3390720	which will make it more effectively tug at your heartstrings
3390720	3393280	and further from respect of your brothers
3393280	3395820	on the wrestling squad, as Joystick likes to put it.
3396760	3399200	I wanna play this game and I'm never gonna cry.
3399200	3401480	Maybe that should be a challenge,
3401480	3403680	like make Loki cry.
3403680	3405720	Oh, it'll never happen, this is gonna be crap.
3405720	3406880	When was the last time you cried?
3406880	3408480	Do you cry, are you a crier?
3408480	3411480	Real men cry, you can cry, it's okay.
3411480	3412320	I don't remember.
3412320	3413560	Oh, okay.
3413560	3415360	I don't wanna ruffle the personal life feathers,
3415360	3416720	but I'm just curious.
3416720	3419800	All right, me, I cry at every sad movie.
3419800	3422020	Hell, I think I watched an episode of Wife Swap
3422020	3422860	the other day I cried at it, okay?
3422860	3424000	It doesn't take much.
3429000	3429820	All right.
3431280	3434120	Lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line,
3434120	3436820	the Sega is going to be bringing a brand new game
3436820	3440760	to the Nintendo DS and it's very similar to one of their old cult classics, The Typing
3440760	3445760	of the Dead. However, the new game they are bringing out, The English of the Dead.
3445760	3449000	The English of the Dead.
3449000	3452140	First word you will learn, brains.
3452140	3454200	The British of the Dead.
3454200	3458500	The interesting thing though, it's House of the Dead 2, but ported to the DS. And what
3458500	3462300	you have to do, you have to translate words into English from Japanese or the zombies
3462300	3467900	will eat you. Sometimes the zombies speak out loud and you have to translate what they
3467900	3471580	are saying. So that's going to be all kinds of things. I'd like to see how that plays
3471580	3476580	out. Do you have to write it out? Because sometimes those handwriting recognitions suck.
3476580	3478780	I said blue!
3478780	3484480	Exactly. I wish this game would come out the other way around. Japanese of the Dead. Maybe
3484480	3486620	learn some Japanese or some other languages.
3486620	3491180	English of the Dead.
3491180	3494400	English of the Dead.
3494400	3498560	Grammar of the Dead. I bet Jamie would love that if she was here. She suggests a proper
3498560	3503620	grammar game or something. Which actually was not proper grammar in me saying that.
3503620	3507060	Oh well, who cares? Maybe I need to play it.
3507060	3509980	Sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming out. We're going to open up the Skype line for
3509980	3516100	your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Quickly though,
3516100	3517820	any last minute stories from Loki?
3517820	3522220	I have a few actually. Already it's confirmed that there's going to be a Professor Layton
3522220	3528100	sequel because the game manual says there's going to be a sequel and it will have a code
3528100	3530140	in it that you use in the first game or something.
3530140	3534780	Shane has been talking to me about how wonderful Professor Layton is all week long.
3534780	3535780	What the hell is it?
3535780	3536780	It's like an adventure game.
3536780	3537780	It's a logic puzzle game for the DS.
3537780	3540700	Yeah, it's like an adventure game with logic puzzles and stuff like that.
3540700	3545900	Apparently there's going to be no Nazis in the Lego Indiana Jones game. You have no Nazis
3545900	3546900	in Star Wars either.
3546900	3548540	Your faces are going to melt then.
3548540	3552500	Well they're going to have some unnamed bad guys.
3552500	3555700	I want some melting Legos in my Indiana Jones game.
3555700	3560420	They've replaced them with anonymous genocidal occultist trench coat wearing master race.
3560420	3563820	Well I want the anonymous genocidal occult trench coat wearing bastards to have their
3563820	3564820	faces melt.
3564820	3568140	Let's go to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3568140	3569140	GS68.
3569140	3571740	Hello GS68. What's on your mind my friend?
3571740	3576660	I have some good news and bad news regarding 2D exit Sunnyvale Golf Land.
3576660	3581980	2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land, one of our local arcades. Got some attention lately. Somebody
3581980	3585260	wrote an article about classic arcades or something.
3585260	3586580	You know who that guy was too.
3586580	3592540	Yeah, I can't believe I'm plugging it here on the show. But I will point out how convenient
3592540	3597380	that the person used the arcade they used to go to all the time in that article. I'm
3597380	3605180	sure it was a real challenge to write it. But anyhow, GS68, what's on your mind regarding
3605180	3606300	BeatMania Golf Land?
3606300	3612940	Good news, we have 2DX DJ Troopers as of this week.
3612940	3615620	Nice. Maybe I'll have to go play. But what's the bad news?
3615620	3617340	Is it broken?
3617340	3622580	The machine is unlocked well ahead of what it's supposed to be in Japan and that means
3622580	3626820	you're planning on going in or between now and most likely May. You can't take pictures
3626820	3628900	of the machine.
3628900	3630900	You can't take pictures? How are they policing that?
3630900	3635860	Good question. I'm not sure.
3635860	3640660	You can't. You don't usually see that in arcades where you're completely banned.
3640660	3641660	That's just challenging.
3641660	3643380	Wait, is it a location test?
3643380	3647140	For real. Okay, here's how you're going to do it. GS68, I will tell you how to get around
3647140	3652260	this right now. I even have this on my cell phone. You get one of those phones that records
3652260	3653260	video.
3653260	3656260	Let me get the camera phone.
3656260	3661140	Yeah, you get a camera phone and what you do is you kind of stand next to the machine
3661140	3665700	and you hit the record button and then you pretend you're talking on your phone while
3665700	3670060	you're recording the screen right there. That's how you do it. Easy as pie.
3670060	3675380	And then it'll be up on YouTube and somebody will get shit in their pants.
3675380	3680660	Well, I just sent you a link via a private message and that explains why we can't take
3680660	3681660	pictures.
3681660	3686700	Here's the thing. Usually it's the new songs people want to know and stuff. Are people
3686700	3689420	not allowed to write the songs down and then post them on the internet?
3689420	3700820	I think it'd be like the fact that the machine is unlocked well ahead of schedule.
3700820	3706300	Yeah. Let's see. I'm looking at the post here on our friends at Bimani Style. The distributor
3706300	3709540	has asked that no pictures or videos be taken yet due to the fact the machine will be fully
3709540	3713380	unlocked with all hidden feature songs per my request and as a present to all the players
3713380	3716920	at Sunnyvale Golfland. This is about three months ahead of Japan and we cannot have secret
3716920	3720660	stuff leak on the internets so please people assist me with the small task of not allowing
3720660	3724420	pictures or videos to be taken yet. Do they have a big sign hanging by the machine or
3724420	3725780	anything? I don't know if you've been.
3725780	3730620	No. Like, I went this Saturday and I pulled out my camera and then one of the players
3730620	3732020	told me not to take pictures.
3732020	3733020	Interesting.
3733020	3737220	And so they're self-policing it?
3737220	3742500	Most likely. Maybe. I mean, I wonder if I can talk to them about like having them put
3742500	3750420	a sign in, like maybe set up a security camera. Like, in a sense, they're breaking their
3750420	3751420	own rule.
3751420	3752540	I don't know. For me, this sounds like a challenge.
3752540	3754780	Well, I mean like facing away from the screen.
3754780	3761520	Hmm. Interesting. Well, I mean, I know you didn't write the policy GS68. I'll stop grilling
3761520	3765580	you about it. I think it's very interesting so thank you for bringing it to our attention.
3765580	3769980	I'm kind of curious. I'm curious to see how long they can actually keep it a secret because
3769980	3771620	in a way, that's a challenge to some people.
3771620	3776940	Yeah. Plus, I can imagine like some guy going to the, some guy who's never played a single
3776940	3780660	Bomani game, going to the arcade and they're like, hey, this machine looks really cool.
3780660	3784940	And then they snap a picture and post on the internet and then the offline gets in trouble.
3784940	3788940	So it says no pictures, but can you just go and write down all the stuff on a pad and
3788940	3789940	paper?
3789940	3790940	I know. That's what I don't know.
3790940	3794260	Or you could just walk over to it, walk out to your car, write stuff down, walk back up,
3794260	3797480	walk out to your car. I mean, this is stupid.
3797480	3803420	Loki and I view this as a challenge. It is a challenge. I mean, when somebody says don't,
3803420	3806820	you want to do, although I understand, you know, I, in the community maybe just doesn't
3806820	3810420	want to spoil or whatever, you know, we should probably shouldn't be spoiled sports. Honestly,
3810420	3813220	I'm not going to get to Sunnyvale Golf Line anytime soon anyway, but I do kind of want
3813220	3817580	to check it out. I haven't played a arcade Beatmania game since E3 when they had the
3817580	3821420	machine there that one year randomly. That's the last time I played it. So.
3821420	3828460	I don't remember the last time I played Beatmania. SSJ 100 Matt in chat has a good point. Most
3828460	3830460	people on the forums will say Pics or GTFO.
3830460	3838340	Alright, fine. We'll get Pics. I'm not opposed to getting Pics.
3838340	3839340	Alright.
3839340	3842300	With the ban me from SVGL. Oh no.
3842300	3843300	Who knows?
3843300	3849740	What's ironic about this is that, like, even if we, this game's not supposed to be in the
3849740	3855100	U.S., so we're not allowed to take, so we're supposed to not allowed to be taking Pics
3855100	3856100	to begin with.
3856100	3859420	You mean it's not even supposed to be in the U.S. to begin with. I guess that's true.
3859420	3862380	I mean, well, we had the U.S. location test, but that failed.
3862380	3866340	Alright, well, I'm waiting for the next story where somebody gets beaten up in the parking
3866340	3867660	lot over taking a picture of this game.
3867660	3871300	GS68, we got to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your call.
3871300	3872300	Take care, buddy.
3872300	3873300	You too.
3873300	3876460	It's just, boy, it's just something else. And by the way, speaking, because we were
3876460	3880780	talking about the article here, I'll help our little friend, my bestest friend in the
3880780	3883500	whole wide world who writes these articles.
3883500	3887060	If you ever want to do one on Roosevelt Golf Land, here's what you just have to write.
3887060	3888060	It stinks.
3888060	3889060	There you go.
3889060	3892580	It's a perfectly, wait, would you, would you agree with that review?
3892580	3894580	Yeah, I think that's accurate.
3894580	3895580	Wholeheartedly concur.
3895580	3896580	Hi.
3896580	3897580	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3897580	3898580	Who is this?
3898580	3899580	Hey there.
3899580	3901980	This is Let's Have Tea.
3901980	3903200	Let's Have Tea.
3903200	3904900	Let's have some tea and chat a little bit.
3904900	3908080	What is up, my friend?
3908080	3914220	I just wanted to plug the game Psychonauts to anybody who hasn't checked this game out
3914220	3915220	yet.
3915220	3919840	I know it's kind of old, but I finally got a chance to play through it, and it's well
3919840	3922140	worth the $15 on the marketplace.
3922140	3926300	I was going to say Psychonauts is available to a whole new audience thanks to its backwards
3926300	3932340	compatibility on Xbox 360, and I believe it's in GameTap's library, so some people playing
3932340	3933660	it that way as well.
3933660	3938500	So you could, don't tell me you can't play Psychonauts due to lack of availability.
3938500	3940380	It's out there, right?
3940380	3941380	Right.
3941380	3943260	It's definitely out there.
3943260	3947640	What makes Psychonauts so great?
3947640	3955020	I'm a big adventure games fan, and it's pretty much the first, like, adventure game that's
3955020	3961160	really got my attention since, like, Mario 64 or Banjo-The-Zooie.
3961160	3963840	Is it, I hear a lot about the sense of humor in this game.
3963840	3965980	Is it the sense of humor that draws you in?
3965980	3972360	Yeah, the game is seriously, just ridiculously twisted.
3972360	3977900	You infiltrate the minds of a lot of really interesting characters, and a lot of them
3977900	3983860	are in, like, a loony bin, so there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
3983860	3988860	I didn't see a lot of this game, so maybe I need to take your advice and go check it
3988860	3989860	out.
3989860	3992860	It was actually played by somebody else, but it was, I didn't see a lot of the story, I
3992860	3996420	just saw the actual game, and to me it was kind of like, oh, I think I've kind of seen
3996420	4000580	this game before, but you're saying, no, it's worth a second look, it really stands out,
4000580	4001580	right?
4001580	4004180	It's definitely worth it.
4004180	4007940	Let's say they make a Psychonauts 2 someday, which with all the cult following you never
4007940	4008940	know.
4008940	4012340	What do you think, what would you most like to see in Psychonauts 2?
4012340	4023060	Well, in the story of it, they totally opened it up so that there's a possibility, but really
4023060	4030420	just the way that Psychonauts 1 worked out with the sense of humor and the way that they
4030420	4038860	were able to develop the different abilities throughout the game, usually in sequels they
4038860	4042820	aren't able to rebuild abilities like that.
4042820	4054180	Like if you take Banjo-Tooie from Banjo-Kazooie, it's hard to add even more to the game when
4054180	4060340	the original game limits what you do by the moves that you have.
4060340	4061340	That make sense?
4061340	4063300	Yeah, no, it does.
4063300	4067020	I'm just reading some comments from chat as well, because there are lots of people passionate
4067020	4068180	about Psychonauts as well.
4068180	4072460	Hikaru Uno, he's one of our listeners who lives in Japan currently, he says, I want
4072460	4076060	Psychonauts but I can't get it because I'm in fucking Japan, making reference to the
4076060	4079460	fact that the region is different and you can't get it on the backwards compatibility
4079460	4080460	there.
4080460	4085700	Son of Dad says, I bought Psychonauts at Blockbuster for $6.99, suck it Xbox Live Arcade!
4085700	4090000	So yeah, if you can find the old Xbox disc, you can play it with backwards compatibility
4090000	4091540	as well, so either works.
4091540	4096340	Yeah, it's also a PS2 and PC game.
4096340	4097340	It's everywhere.
4097340	4099340	No excuses for not playing this game.
4099340	4100340	It's all over the place.
4100340	4104420	Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thank you very much for what we'll call the not quite classic
4104420	4108180	game of the week, because it's not a classic yet, but it probably will be in a few more
4108180	4109180	years.
4109180	4110180	Not yet.
4110180	4112980	Let's Have Tea, I have one more question for you before we let you go.
4112980	4114820	Do you really like to drink tea?
4114820	4116340	Absolutely not.
4116340	4118220	I knew it!
4118220	4120740	Maybe it's Mr. Tea.
4120740	4123460	Are you more of a coffee drinker?
4123460	4130420	I'm not really into any of that, I just thought it was a clever name and thought it was funny.
4130420	4131420	Well you win.
4131420	4132420	It is pretty funny.
4132420	4134080	Especially when you consider you don't like tea.
4134080	4135580	Even I like a little tea here and there.
4135580	4139220	Alright, well Let's Have Tea, thanks so much for reminding us about the greatness of Psychonauts.
4139220	4140220	Have a great one, okay?
4140220	4142220	Yep, have a good one.
4142220	4143220	Later.
4143220	4145900	Alright, we can do a couple more calls, I suppose.
4145900	4146900	Oh!
4146900	4148500	Skype wants us to rate the quality of that call.
4148500	4149500	How was the call quality?
4149500	4150540	Would you say five?
4150540	4151540	Very good?
4151540	4152540	Four good?
4152540	4153540	Four or five?
4153540	4155820	I'll give it a four, because I've had issues on other calls.
4155820	4157700	I'm like, does he want us to...
4157700	4159420	I'm not sending the whole thing, Jesus.
4159420	4162220	I know, it's like, now answer thirty more questions.
4162220	4164620	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4164620	4166980	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Ma.
4166980	4170220	Actually, this call is a two.
4170220	4171220	I like that it...
4171220	4175460	Darth Tetsuya says, rate the callers.
4175460	4176460	Maybe one night.
4176460	4180820	Like, we ought to give an incentive for the really good calls one night, like, one night
4180820	4183940	we'll do nothing but phone calls, like, the really good phone call we'll give something
4183940	4186180	from the price table, or something even better, I don't know.
4186180	4189220	Alright, Ron Ma, what's on your mind tonight?
4189220	4195480	Not too much, but to comment on GS68's call, if they don't want people to be taking pictures
4195480	4200020	of what's coming out, when you put out these press releases, set it up in a way that you're
4200020	4204400	not really revealing much of anything, but still, when you say not to, people are going
4204400	4205400	to do it anyway.
4205400	4206400	So, hey.
4206400	4207400	Well, wait a minute, though.
4207400	4210100	The press release doesn't have really anything to do with this.
4210100	4213940	The distributor turned on some type of cheat in the game that's not supposed to be on.
4213940	4217940	But my thinking is, is that, what's to stop anyone from Japan doing the same thing this
4217940	4218940	distributor did?
4218940	4219940	Am I right?
4219940	4220940	You're right.
4220940	4221940	Hmm.
4221940	4222940	I don't know.
4222940	4223940	Maybe there's something about it I'm not getting.
4223940	4226540	Maybe it's through the whole EMUs thing or something, so I'm sure somebody's going to
4226540	4228380	say something nasty to me about it, because I'm uninformed.
4228380	4232120	It's just, they have all the songs unlocked, and Japan doesn't have them all yet, and normally
4232120	4236220	Japan's the one saying, hey, look at my song, it's unlocked, and everyone's like, oh, which
4236220	4237220	is over here?
4237220	4238220	It's like a play, too.
4238220	4239220	But, yeah.
4239220	4240220	Well, isn't it true that-
4240220	4241220	So, you know what?
4241220	4242220	It's our turn.
4242220	4243220	That's what I want.
4243220	4244220	I want you to get the first dibs on everything.
4244220	4252380	Well, isn't it true that American versions can't get EMUs because they're not in Japan?
4252380	4254380	That would seem likely, because the IP address-
4254380	4258180	Things that would have to be unlocked by EMUs wouldn't normally be available here, so they
4258180	4259180	just have to open it up.
4259180	4263280	So if they can unlock everything here, and we don't get EMUs, that just means that they're
4263280	4266580	plain assholes for not unlocking it at all.
4266580	4267580	All right.
4267580	4269820	Well, Konami does have a record.
4269820	4273580	Kevin DDR in chat says, no one knows how.
4273580	4277700	Somebody does, obviously, because this machine's added done to it, but I get what you're saying.
4277700	4279380	I bet it's up, up, down, down, left, left.
4279380	4281820	Nobody who can spread the word knows how, I guess.
4281820	4284140	Rama, what else is on your mind?
4284140	4285140	Anything else?
4285140	4287140	Not much.
4287140	4291740	Like Irene said earlier, I went to a Ren Faire this weekend, and out of all my costumes,
4291740	4294020	I found one that would be perfect to blend right in.
4294020	4297420	Okay, but I just have to give a little background, because the Ren Faire thing came up during
4297420	4300380	our bonus segment, which the podcast people don't hear.
4300380	4303580	So podcasters just know we were talking about the Ren Faire earlier in the show.
4303580	4306540	It's not completely out of place, this comment, because that would probably be very random
4306540	4308620	if you were listening to this with Not Life.
4308620	4312820	But Rama, so you're saying you found the perfect Ren Faire outfit that's, what, a good blend
4312820	4315220	with video games, a blend with this show, or what?
4315220	4319940	Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video, fun with video.
4319940	4322120	This call is a one all of a sudden.
4322120	4323620	What the fuck was that?
4323620	4327380	Rama, your call went into the, he went into the loop.
4327380	4328580	What the hell was that?
4328580	4330580	I think you got sucked into Tron.
4330580	4332620	I don't like it.
4332620	4337020	That was like a, it was a Rama remix.
4337020	4338340	Do not adjust your iPod, we heard the same thing.
4338340	4340900	Alright, that's for our candidacy to put into the second mix then.
4340900	4341900	I guess so.
4341900	4344340	DMN, make a song out of that.
4344340	4346580	God, no, no.
4346580	4353380	Rama, I'm sorry, let's say, a good fit with our show or video games or what?
4353380	4354700	A blend with video games.
4354700	4357140	Now, what is it?
4357140	4358140	Black Mage.
4358140	4359140	Nice.
4359140	4362900	Did you wear your Black Mage, you have a Black Mage outfit, did you wear it?
4362900	4363900	Yes I did.
4363900	4364900	Awesome.
4364900	4367380	Did you get a lot of people coming up to you wanting to take the old picture?
4367380	4370100	Yes, yes I did.
4370100	4374140	Did you take pictures with large-breasted women in corsets?
4374140	4378820	I decided to keep those pictures to myself, okay, at those Ren Faires, you know, the Las
4378820	4381340	Vegas rules apply.
4381340	4383580	What happens at Ren Faire stays at Ren Faire?
4383580	4384580	Damn right.
4384580	4387460	That's right, you're not allowed to take pictures of the women in corsets and put them up on
4387460	4392660	the internet or the SVGL management will get very mad at you.
4392660	4396380	But some people actually thought I was Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.
4396380	4400740	Well, because Vivi does look like a Black Mage, I can see that.
4400740	4404860	And here's the best thing, someone walked up to me and said, you're Orko from He-Man,
4404860	4407140	aren't you?
4407140	4408580	That's awesome.
4408580	4410500	Black Mage does look like Orko, what can you do?
4410500	4414820	After hearing that five, six times, I said, the next Ren Faire I'm going to do a Jedi
4414820	4416980	and I'll do Orko, see what happens.
4416980	4417980	Nice.
4417980	4420020	Well, Rama, glad to hear you had fun at Ren Faire.
4420020	4423640	Maybe next time you and Callie will take Irene to one together, okay?
4423640	4424700	Or maybe you should take her.
4424700	4425740	I probably will.
4425740	4428900	I think she sent me a private message with one that she wants to go to now, but I've
4428900	4429900	been too busy doing the show.
4429900	4432140	Let me look actually real quick while we're on the subject of Ren Faire.
4432140	4436100	Oh no, I accidentally closed it during the game because I needed to keep my private message
4436100	4437100	window clean during the game.
4437100	4438260	Did you like the game tonight, Rama?
4438260	4439660	You came very close to winning.
4439660	4440660	That was great.
4440660	4441660	I loved that.
4441660	4442660	All right, good.
4442660	4443660	I'm glad you like it.
4443660	4444660	We'll have to do it again sometime.
4444660	4446940	All right, Rama, we got to let you go.
4446940	4447940	Have a good one.
4447940	4448940	All right.
4448940	4449940	You too.
4449940	4450940	Bye-bye.
4450940	4451940	One more call.
4451940	4452940	Sure.
4452940	4455020	Hopefully the game doesn't get caught in the loop.
4455020	4456900	The crazy...
4456900	4457900	Sucked into a black hole.
4457900	4459620	No, what the hell was that?
4459620	4463380	It's not ringing off the hook, so Loki, you have any last minute stories you want to do?
4463380	4464380	Okay.
4464380	4468220	1UP is going to be changing their scoring policies, apparently, how they rate games,
4468220	4469220	which is quite funny.
4469220	4474660	Now, instead of the point system, they're going to be changing it to letters, like grading
4474660	4479460	system from A plus to F. I want you to bet there's 10 different letters in between there
4479460	4481900	and nothing's changing.
4481900	4484600	You know, because they're admitting that...
4484600	4485600	You know what they are?
4485600	4486600	They're admitting...
4486600	4487600	Well, I guess it's not really admitting.
4487600	4490180	AGM is going to do the same thing.
4490180	4491180	It's all going to start in March.
4491180	4495060	Because, well, I'm saying like, I don't know, A through F has a different kind of connotation
4495060	4497060	to it than 1 through 10.
4497060	4498620	Like F is failing.
4498620	4499620	It's a miserable game.
4499620	4504220	Whereas, I think in the 1 through 10 world, 6 is seen as failing.
4504220	4505540	I think.
4505540	4508900	So I guess that's the point I was trying to make that I didn't do very well.
4508900	4509900	But who cares?
4509900	4511380	Well, technically enough, it's a 60%.
4511380	4512380	Who cares?
4512380	4514140	It's one review site on the entire internet.
4514140	4516340	I realize it's a big one, but you know, come on.
4516340	4518660	It's also a magazine, AGM and Games for Windows.
4518660	4521860	We live in a world where there's demos readily available.
4521860	4522860	Make your own decision.
4522860	4527900	Now, I read reviews once in a while, but I haven't found a game reviewer I really 100%
4527900	4530620	trust and like yet.
4530620	4531620	Maybe the guy from Zero Punctuation.
4531620	4532620	I don't know.
4532620	4533620	No, he's too negative.
4533620	4534620	Funny, but negative.
4534620	4535620	But he's funny.
4535620	4536620	Funny, but negative.
4536620	4537860	Let's go to the phones and take one last call.
4537860	4538860	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4538860	4539860	Who's this?
4539860	4542100	Hello, this is Ross Deal, UT.
4542100	4543800	Ross Deal, UT.
4543800	4544800	What is up, my friend?
4544800	4545800	Oh, nothing.
4545800	4546800	Just shooting shit.
4546800	4548900	You know how that goes.
4548900	4550740	That's what we do here at Orange Launch Radio.
4550740	4551740	What's up?
4551740	4552740	Hell yeah.
4552740	4554820	Anyway, I got a few things on my mind.
4554820	4555820	Not too many, but a few.
4555820	4556820	All right.
4556820	4564020	First off, there's this, I don't know, there was somebody linking that already on the chat,
4564020	4568860	this Marine who went missing.
4568860	4573500	Basically what happened is that the family thinks that maybe he was playing Call of Duty
4573500	4575740	and he just had a flashback or something.
4575740	4579620	Yeah, I read about that just before the show started.
4579620	4580740	That's crazy.
4580740	4585140	I guess it gets into the whole, are games too realistic in this day and age?
4585140	4586140	I don't know.
4586140	4591180	Well, I think part of it is because he was in Iraq and if he was playing Call of Duty
4591180	4598940	4, that there's a lot of stuff in Call of Duty 4 in the story that it's pretty hefty
4598940	4599940	material.
4599940	4607820	I mean, I don't want to give away any of the plot line, but you invade a Middle Eastern
4607820	4610900	country and a nuclear device goes off.
4610900	4612460	Oh, wow.
4612460	4618380	Yeah, it's a very gritty game.
4618380	4623820	I could definitely see where somebody who's been to Iraq, who's maybe having problems
4623820	4631620	with post-traumatic, might play that game and get a bad reaction from it.
4631620	4639700	They're saying that he might be actually trying not to be found, so it sounded pretty bad.
4639700	4640700	Very unfortunate.
4640700	4645380	This is not a game he should have been playing in the first place, so the question is, do
4645380	4650060	they have it out there enough for this guy to know maybe he shouldn't play this game
4650060	4657540	as he's very sensitive on these type of topics or suffering from this post-war syndrome?
4657540	4661620	Is it the responsibility of the makers of this game to put some type of disclaimer on
4661620	4662620	the game?
4662620	4663620	No.
4663620	4667820	No, I think this game might be too real for some people.
4667820	4668820	That's stupid.
4668820	4674940	You know, with post-traumatic stress disorder, that sort of thing, it could be any number
4674940	4678760	of things that trigger it.
4678760	4686660	Any number of things could remind somebody or give someone a bad flashback.
4686660	4688300	It's very unpredictable.
4688300	4697420	Like a lot of mental disorders, it's going to affect people in different ways.
4697420	4701340	Not only that, but modern warfare, you know they're going to at least deal with the Arab
4701340	4702660	angle somewhat.
4702660	4713740	I was just going to say, very unfortunate news no matter where it kind of falls.
4713740	4716460	Maybe this was the type of game he should have played with other people.
4716460	4717860	I think that's kind of the thing, too.
4717860	4720260	I know exactly what it is.
4720260	4721740	It's not Call of Duty 4.
4721740	4722740	What?
4722740	4723740	It was Yars.
4723740	4726820	He played Yars, and he's like, oh my God, I have to run.
4726820	4728740	Well, that's a different kind of drama.
4728740	4731380	There's a place in hell waiting for you, Loki.
4731380	4733500	Okay, RustyLUT, we don't have too much time.
4733500	4736900	What else did you want to say real quick tonight?
4736900	4738780	There was this industry blog.
4738780	4749860	One of these industry analyst people was talking about how there's a problem where the industry
4749860	4759940	has no real room for anything between the tiny budget casual games and the tens of millions
4759940	4760940	of dollars blockbusters.
4760940	4765220	Let me put up a link right now.
4765220	4771420	As far as the American market, I can certainly agree with that.
4771420	4778860	We either see the huge budget Call of Duty and Gears of War, or we see PopCap.
4778860	4791540	It's not as diverse a market as, say, Japan, where there's stuff all over the budget spectrum.
4791540	4794820	This is an opinion piece I didn't read before tonight's show, so it's a little harder for
4794820	4798380	me to comment on it.
4798380	4799380	What do you think?
4799380	4803220	Do we have enough variety in our styles of games that we have out there right now?
4803220	4812460	Not so much styles, but we need a real be-real, because if you look at the American market,
4812460	4819860	it's PopCap games type of deal, and then there's Gears of War, Call of Duty, really big budget
4819860	4822460	games, and there's not a lot of stuff in between.
4822460	4828020	If you compare that to Japan, where you see stuff like Chulipa no Ne-chan Bada, people
4828020	4834300	just throwing crap out there, hell, even Puzzle Quest, which managed to become a hit.
4834300	4838620	What this guy's talking about is you can't really experiment when you're dealing with
4838620	4846580	a budget of $20 million, $30 million, because there's too much risk involved, but at the
4846580	4852500	same time, there's really only so much you can do in a little budget 2D game.
4852500	4860140	Another extreme, you're not really having a lot of room for new ideas.
4860140	4863500	Isn't there a similarity with movies, though, because it seems like most movies are either
4863500	4870740	the art house cheap ones, or the explosion Michael Bay, burning money live on screen
4870740	4871980	type of movies.
4871980	4875620	There's not a whole lot in between there, either.
4875620	4883700	There's also the fact that there's not a whole lot for what people want in that middle market
4883700	4889460	because the American market's a lot different than the Japanese ones.
4889460	4892940	There's a lot more people in Japan that play games, for one, but there's either you've
4892940	4897820	got the hardcore gamers that have been doing it for years, or the people that are just
4897820	4903220	the casual gamer market, and there really is no target audience for something in between.
4903220	4905420	That's the thing, though.
4905420	4910820	You'd think that the hardcore would be the most receptive of something like, well, you
4910820	4919180	look at Puzzle Quest, or Chulip, or maybe not so much Chulip, or an Ejambada, just an
4919180	4926780	idea being thrown out there with maybe a $2 or $3 million budget, and yes, you should
4926780	4928500	pick up Puzzle Quest GS68.
4928500	4936940	Let me make this comparison real quick.
4936940	4943140	A lot of the hardcore gamers won't play a game like Bejeweled because it's not hardcore
4943140	4948020	enough, and a lot of the people who play stuff like Bejeweled get turned off by Gears of
4948020	4954300	War and stuff because there's too many buttons to hit, whereas with movies, anyone can watch
4954300	4957900	anything, depending on the hype.
4957900	4965540	It's true, and perhaps this is just a spot where video games just have a hard time, but
4965540	4972020	there has to be some place where you can actually do meaningful experimentation, because you
4972020	4979500	can't do it in the casual space, there's just too many limits.
4979500	4983380	I suppose it would be hard to convince your wife that going to see Rambo would be a good
4983380	4987980	Valentine's Day present, right?
4987980	4990780	I think that's also part of it.
4990780	4995060	We have an industry that's confined to the idea of hardcore and casual.
4995060	4998340	You don't hear about hardcore moviegoers, casual moviegoers.
4998340	5001620	You hear people who like action, romance.
5001620	5008380	There's very particular crowds for types of movies, and of course the B-movie alien weirdness
5008380	5010680	has its own following.
5010680	5017140	You need to have that sort of market, for lack of a better term, market segregation,
5017140	5022980	demographic scanning, because casual, hardcore is perhaps a little too general.
5022980	5023980	Wow.
5023980	5029300	Well, Ross, some great topics, some very deep topics you're bringing up tonight, but unfortunately
5029300	5030300	we are running out of time.
5030300	5034460	We've got to wrap things up, but thanks for your call and provoking some good discussion.
5034460	5043420	Before I go, I'd like to do a plug, you know, I've started a YouTube channel, and that would
5043420	5052300	be youtube.com slash user slash RossDLUT, put up a link in the chat right now.
5052300	5056620	And what will we find on said YouTube channel?
5056620	5062980	Right now it's mostly music videos that I've compiled up, but I have a few vlogs as well,
5062980	5068940	and I'm just kind of looking at some of the things that are in this, so you kind of make
5068940	5071420	your own anime music videos and stuff?
5071420	5072420	Gaming music videos.
5072420	5077100	Gaming, oh not anime, GMVs, not AMVs, GMVs, I see.
5077100	5083540	And I guess that I also have a couple of vlogs using the PlayStation Eye actually, which
5083540	5090140	is quite an effort, but I'll go into that next time, and I'll see you later.
5090140	5091900	Well best of luck with vlogging.
5091900	5092900	Good luck.
5092900	5095340	Have a nice one, bye bye.
5095340	5099700	RossDLUT, he's always kind of the devil's advocate in chat, but then when he calls in
5099700	5104920	he's the nicest guy, and brings up great topics every time.
5104920	5106780	So thank you very much for calling in, we appreciate it.
5106780	5109420	That's going to do it for phone calls tonight, because that's going to do it for the show
5109420	5110420	tonight.
5110420	5111420	Holy crap, that's late.
5111420	5114860	I know it's kind of late when you consider that Dark Soccer wasn't even here tonight,
5114860	5118300	we managed to do a three hour show, I think the game took a long time.
5118300	5119300	Yeah, that took a big time.
5119300	5120300	That's alright.
5120300	5121300	It was fun.
5121300	5122300	It was fun, right?
5122300	5123300	It was worth it?
5123300	5124300	Whee!
5124300	5127540	Alright, let's go ahead and wrap things up here tonight.
5127540	5130220	Actually first, any other last minute stories I didn't let you get to, Loki?
5130220	5133460	There's going to be car surfing in Saints Row 2, and that's awesome.
5133460	5135220	I can't wait for Saints Row 2.
5135220	5136420	Ghost Ride the Whip.
5136420	5143220	Yes, and apparently they have a picture where you have crashed a biplane into a building,
5143220	5149100	or driven it through a mall, which is even better, so I'm all about a game that allows
5149100	5154220	you to drive a plane through a mall.
5154220	5155620	We all know what's waiting to happen later on.
5155620	5158580	That's a feature they should have had in Dead Rising, right?
5158580	5159580	Hell yeah.
5159580	5160580	Alright.
5160580	5164900	Puppy, thank you so much for being here tonight, and participating in the show.
5164900	5166940	Talking head number three for the night.
5166940	5167940	Hooray!
5167940	5171180	Well, you'll have to come back again soon, and it's probably kind of nice not getting
5171180	5173860	talked over tonight, because there's a lot far less people in house.
5173860	5176140	Yes, and I had my own microphone the entire time.
5176140	5177140	There you go.
5177140	5179900	Alright, well thanks for coming, and stay away from the gunshots in your neighborhood.
5179900	5180900	I will certainly try to.
5180900	5186540	Alright, we don't want to see Puppy get put down, that would not be fun.
5186540	5189940	Do you have any final thoughts, though, Puppy, real quick?
5189940	5193940	I was looking on your prize table here, and saw these applications for passports.
5193940	5197260	The passport applications are not prizes, they're just out there.
5197260	5198260	I was just making sure.
5198260	5201720	No, we're not giving out Rob's passport application as a prize, it's just something I'm working
5201720	5204620	on for a trip I want to take in June.
5204620	5207980	Which by the way, you know how they say it takes forever to get a passport right now?
5207980	5208980	It doesn't.
5208980	5212220	My roommate went in, and did his, like, he got it in a week.
5212220	5213220	A week.
5213220	5214220	He's new.
5214220	5215220	Not a renewal.
5215220	5216220	New.
5216220	5219140	Well, my brother managed to get one when he went to Italy, and it took him like a week
5219140	5222140	and a half to get his when he went to Italy earlier this year.
5222140	5223140	Not bad.
5223140	5227380	But thankfully I'm not going out of the country, I'm just going to Texas to meet with, for
5227380	5229300	a puzzle pirates party.
5229300	5230300	Nerd.
5230300	5233660	I'm trying to get William to take me back to Canada, because I really want to go to
5233660	5234660	Canada.
5234660	5237260	I'm just trying to decide right now if it's going to be Vancouver, which I've already
5237260	5242380	been to and I love, or Toronto, which I've never been to, but I really want to go to.
5242380	5245220	Toronto's winning in my mind right now, but we'll see.
5245220	5252980	I went to Canada once, I went to Victoria, and I got stuck having to go to those botanical
5252980	5253980	gardens.
5253980	5258340	Hey, I love the Bouchard Gardens, don't you go knocking them, unless you go in like fall,
5258340	5261660	then there's not a lot to see.
5261660	5265300	I think William told me he went to the Bouchard Gardens once in October, and I'm like, dude,
5265300	5267300	you went at the wrong time.
5267300	5269740	Anyway, enough travel chat.
5269740	5271900	Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners?
5271900	5277620	This spin the black circle thing is pretty addicting, except I'm on this one level.
5277620	5279260	He's been playing it all fucking night.
5279260	5281620	Hey, I have been participating, okay?
5281620	5283460	This does not take that much participation.
5283460	5288860	Hey, if he had been playing the Velociraptor Safari game, you wouldn't have heard a peep
5288860	5291620	out of him, unless it was maniacal laughter.
5291620	5298540	All right, my final thought is next week's show, I'm actually going to be out of town
5298540	5304180	because it's holiday slash anniversary weekend, so I'm going out of town.
5304180	5309500	We may have a late start to the show because of it, more information to come later throughout
5309500	5310500	the week.
5310500	5315200	I'm not sure exactly what the plan is yet, so there you have it.
5315200	5317340	But we are looking forward to being back here next week.
5317340	5319900	Frisbee suggests, I vote because of Valentine's Day this week.
5319900	5322900	We need to have William, Nellie, and Dan as guests on the show next week.
5322900	5323900	Not going to happen.
5323900	5327500	I don't think that'll happen either.
5327500	5328500	It's a good thought.
5328500	5331860	All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
5331860	5335540	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
5335540	5337060	You know we can't do this without you guys.
5337060	5339940	Remember, if you like Orange Lawns Radio, if you like what you hear, please tell two
5339940	5343260	friends about our show because that's the only way we get to spread the word.
5343260	5346000	We don't have any big magazines or websites that back us.
5346000	5351860	We are literally an independent operation run out of somebody's garage and it's your
5351860	5354420	voice and talking and word of mouth that helps spread the word.
5354420	5358140	Another reason to support us, we are not changing our review system to letters.
5358140	5359140	That's right, we're not.
5359140	5363460	We're going to stick with the whole vague reviews that we've always done here on the
5363460	5364460	program.
5364460	5368340	Until next time, I'm Rob, that's Loki.
5368340	5370540	She will be Dark Sakura back with us next week.
5370540	5372500	We'll see you then here on Orange Lawns Radio.
5372500	5378580	You've been listening to Orange Lawns Radio.
