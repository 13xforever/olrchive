20789	22911	Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio
36823	40684	We asked a trivia question, and the trivia question was, which one of these games is this music from?
63962	66265	Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween Friday the 13th Friday the 13th
81616	87480	You're not going to be picked tonight, but you will get a chance to play in the chat room, so all hope is not lost.
87520	93904	You may still win either a copy of Rez HD, or if you don't have an Xbox, one of our other prizes from our new prize table I'll talk about a little more later.
94925	97987	But if you did say Friday the 13th, you might want to stay by your phone.
99428	101189	But in the meantime, we're going to get back into some gaming news.
101269	101630	Right, Loki?
102350	102610	Yes.
103551	104812	Fooling at Home.
105152	110856	It's been available on PCs for a long time, and just not really that recently, but
111388	112488	on the PS3 as well.
113289	119371	Now they have hit 1 million users actually, at least on the PlayStation 3.
119531	121432	So that's pretty awesome.
122252	128815	1 million consoles contributing to a cure for cancer or God knows what else they're doing.
129375	130216	All in the name of science.
130236	136398	Calculating votes for the 2008 primaries or who knows.
137479	139219	Making a better caffeine molecule.
139460	140540	Better caffeine molecule.
141223	142466	That is something they need to work on.
142646	144009	Finishing Duke Nukem Forever.
144851	146495	That is also something they need to get to working on.
150041	153184	Also mentioning the PlayStation 3, which Folding at Home appears on.
153224	157827	There's a brand new Japanese PlayStation 3 that's going to be coming out very soon.
158187	161770	It's going to come with a 40GB hard drive and a 6-axis wireless controller.
162110	164512	It is the Satin Silver PlayStation 3.
164732	166033	It comes out on March 6th.
166434	169896	It will cost you 39,980 yen.
170296	171677	If you want to translate that into U.S.
171718	173179	dollars, that's 376 U.S.
173599	173959	dollars.
174720	177001	So it's the Satin Silver PlayStation 3, so...
178268	181230	I don't know, of course, everybody in Japan loves different colors
197882	199783	Alright, well, that's really all there is.
200343	201684	PlayStation 3 in a new color.
201744	203385	How this is news, I don't know, but it is.
203445	203985	So there you have it.
204966	218192	According to EGM's Quarterman rumor column, in their March issue, they talk about how that God of War Chain of Olympus, or Chains of Olympus, will be heading to PlayStation 2.
218512	225596	Of course, this is a rumor, but seeing their trend so far with, I don't know, Twisted Metal head-on, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters,
226403	227104	Stuff like that.
227464	231368	It's not going to be too surprising if they port the PSP game to the PlayStation 2.
232048	237133	And hell, it will sell a lot of copies, so not so surprising.
237914	239015	Oh, and Silent Hill Origins.
239035	241678	That was another one that was ported from PSP.
243359	249966	In other Sony news, Flow will be making its way to the PlayStation Portable, and it comes out on March 6th.
250780	253043	The game is coming out from Super Villain Studios.
254765	259270	I don't know why you would want to get this when it's probably going to cost you more than it did on PlayStation 3.
260285	260765	How much is it?
261646	261906	I don't know.
261926	262806	It doesn't have a price yet.
263146	267208	Oh, no, you're going to get it through the PlayStation Store, so I guess it is the same relative price.
267448	267928	Oh, then never mind.
268108	271089	But what a pain in the ass to buy something on the store and then transfer it.
271129	274590	I haven't actually touched the PlayStation Portable Store yet.
275110	278252	I haven't even looked at that because I know now they're starting to re-release.
278752	279012	It's weird.
279032	282093	They're starting to put full PlayStation Portable games on there now.
282953	287215	Like they had Wipeout Pure you can download and a bunch of other stuff, you know.
287540	291542	Well, because they figured that everyone else is already downloading it.
291562	294123	So let's join the party and charge for it.
294383	295183	And no one will still buy it.
297164	297464	I don't know.
297484	299865	That's a cool idea to have original games on there.
299925	306027	But, you know, what they need is a link to actually be able to view that store from the PSP.
306288	309209	Because, I mean, as far as I'm aware, now they don't.
309549	313650	And I don't remember the URL for it, so I ain't buying anything from it.
314411	315671	And there's a bee in here.
316352	316992	Ah, that's scary.
317012	317292	I think.
317921	318681	Is that a bee?
318701	319501	No, it's just a fly.
319761	320102	You sure?
320282	320562	Yeah, it is.
320582	321722	That's pretty big for a fly.
322002	322802	I'll take a look at it.
323142	323582	Are you scared?
323622	324243	I will inspect.
324263	325043	I'm not scared of the bee.
325083	326783	I'm just saying, you know, oh my god.
326823	327563	Loki, you do news.
327603	328924	I'll take care of the bee.
331024	338066	Anyways, another game that's going to be coming out here for the PlayStation 3 also is going to have... It's a fly, Loki.
338086	338566	Don't be scared.
338946	339966	Oh, well, you've grown big here.
341527	342107	Yes, we do.
342796	346739	Just like Devil May Cry 4 that had a mandatory install.
346779	347680	Well, not really mandatory.
347700	349541	I guess that one was more of an optional install.
350202	360630	Hot Shots Golf 5 in Japan right now has a 5 gigabyte, that's kind of ironic, install before you can play the game.
360850	366314	And of course, this is probably going to be on the US version of the Hot Shots Golf.
366334	368616	I want to say on tour is what it's called or out of bounds.
369416	369537	And...
370640	375423	That kind of sucks that this trend of now these games having to be installed.
375443	379105	I guess that's why you need your 80 gig system or 40 gigs or whatever.
379125	380786	Install these damn games on it.
380806	382026	That actually makes a lot of sense.
382267	391412	But you know, well, again, to play devil's advocate I suppose a little bit, if the PlayStation 3 is supposed to be more like a computer, then we shouldn't be surprised, right?
391832	398816	Yeah, but I'm still kind of a little frustrated at the fact that consoles like the Xbox 360, you don't install games like this.
399457	403520	I mean, they have, the only game I know that you can install stuff to it, actually there's two.
403580	409945	I think there's a Football Manager game in the UK, and then there's also Final Fantasy, you know, 11.
410005	413869	But, you know, that you have to install on every console, so that's not a big deal.
414029	418832	But it's just all because of that Blu-ray drive being slow, so that kind of sucks.
420354	420714	All right.
421212	425393	Well, you know, on a smaller scale, Sony is doing these preload things as well.
425433	427294	It's a brand new Monster Hunter game.
427374	431195	It's Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is coming out.
431255	441419	And what this has in common with the last story is that you actually have the option to copy what's on the UMD to your memory card on the PSP, and that will decrease load times.
441779	442959	So it's kind of the same concept.
442999	444820	However, we should emphasize it's optional here.
445180	449922	and not required, which makes sense because there's PSPs out there where your memory card might be very small, like mine.
449942	453844	I only have a 32 megabyte memory card because I bought mine a long time ago.
454164	458025	I bought the PSP a long time ago before they started coming with a gigabyte memory stick.
458045	459826	Yeah, I don't know.
460546	464228	I think it's funny, though, that you can install it to the PSP memory stick.
464628	464928	I know.
464988	469690	And yet, all this time, they've been trying to stop people from installing it to their memory stick.
470050	473612	Oh, how they're so ironic.
475933	476874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
503874	504814	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
534164	543071	Well, it's time to move on into another segment here we like to do on this show pretty regularly.
543171	548054	Every week we like to hear from you guys and your emails that you send us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
548435	552298	And we open them up and read through the emails in a little segment that we call The Mailbag.
553358	555340	The Mailbag
559554	561155	Going to chat real quick, though, I've got to say this.
561175	562215	We've got to read these comments here.
562335	564316	SSJ100Matt says, I smell lawsuit.
564456	564976	Do you think so?
566217	570299	Maybe from the battery company, but I hope they don't try to sue Sony.
570339	571039	It's not their fault.
571219	573200	It's the fault of the battery manufacturers.
573780	574380	Oh, there you go.
574840	578522	All right, well, let's dig into the mailbag here and see what folks have to say tonight.
578562	580583	Again, it's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
580603	581783	We'll read this one first.
582744	587666	This comes to us from... We'll call him Nathaniel...
588635	591457	P, I guess is the name based on the signature there.
592738	596800	Dear cynical and acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio.
597700	599422	Acrimonious cast of Orange Lounge Radio.
599722	603384	I'm a varied gamer when it comes to my playlist and currently I've been playing Guitar Hero 3.
604084	605885	Though I am also varied when it comes to my music.
605925	608287	I listen more to classical orchestrated symphony type music.
608707	613232	One of the few rock bands I find enjoyable are the fine gents of Rhapsody or Rhapsody of Fire.
613613	619038	I was hoping if you knew whether any of the band's numerous songs would ever appear in any Guitar Hero 3 downloadable content packs.
620960	622482	I don't think we've heard anything like that.
622662	626867	I don't know if you're going to see much more independent music come out in these packs.
627648	630611	Usually that's something that kind of happens towards the end of the cycle.
631464	632404	and so much in the beginning.
656121	663547	But some indie band out there spilled the beans that they were going to be Guitar Hero 4 and posted this entire probable song list from the game.
663867	670893	And I think it kind of made a lot of people go, I don't know about that, a little apprehensive to call it actual news.
671353	675597	But certainly Guitar Hero always has like 20, 30 independent songs in there.
675837	678099	So I would say go for Guitar Hero 4.
678599	679860	The band will get out there more that way.
681358	689061	This email comes to us from PKJr92 and sends us this.
689141	692523	Hey, I have just two questions or comments.
692883	695664	First is directed to Loki and it's about the Eye of Judgment bet.
696184	702811	It's just not possible, considering the caliber of the game, and I don't think ratings are in negative numbers, to reach 1 million ever.
703131	709137	If you want to make it more reasonable, make it 500,000 copies sold, even though it probably won't sell more than 350,000.
709858	711820	Loki is too safe, and I think he knows it.
712440	714422	Anyways, here's my second question.
716678	719761	I think that was the whole point behind Loki taking the bet in the first place.
720261	728489	As much as you chatters want it, Loki does not want to come here and dress in a Tingle outfit and set the Eye of Judgment on fire or whatever we talk about here.
728829	729250	Right, Loki?
729310	730311	You don't really want to do that.
730551	735155	Yeah, because you know people will take screen caps on Justin.TV and it'll be all over the internet the next day, right?
735335	739439	That's fine, but I mean, and I understand, I don't think it's going to hit 500,000 either, but you know.
740782	742883	I've already reduced it so many times.
743223	745025	Lifetime of, you know, ever.
773768	774830	Anyway, here's my second question.
774950	777933	Why all the hate towards the PlayStation 3 with the exception of Loki?
778313	782157	Sure, there's almost no support from Sony, but if you have a high-def TV, the games look amazing.
782497	787922	Now, I realize that not everyone has a nice TV, but the games still have the ability to be more in-depth than Xbox 360 games.
788222	789844	And the PlayStation Network is free!
790024	790665	How about that?
791718	794018	I'd be pissed if I had to pay for PlayStation Network, because it's seriously...
818957	820359	I'm not worth my time, I would say.
837950	838330	That's that.
839351	844516	He also wants to say, by the way, thanks for broadcasting on Super Bowl Sunday considering not everyone is in love with football.
844877	847339	However, the Stanley Cup finals are a totally different thing.
847399	848680	Pretty much all of Canada watches.
849021	850222	Well, sorry for going on and on.
851103	851443	I have it.
852404	854506	You know, a lot of Americans watch the Super Bowl, though.
854546	856308	We are in the minority of not watching it.
857139	859320	I was just saying, I was just thinking that, uh,
880217	883179	We don't broadcast from Canada, so... That is true.
883299	888842	I don't even know when the hockey season ends or starts, so... Hockey's pretty fun, though.
889323	892865	One of these days I'm going to get Melody to take me to a Sharks game in San Jose.
892905	893305	We'll see.
893765	895626	Because she gets season passes and all that stuff.
896167	897207	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
897247	898408	Let's go to another email.
898448	900009	This one comes to us from Sakura Max.
900810	901450	Hi, OLR.
901490	905232	You people have influenced me to make an OLR Dragon Force movie contest.
905592	907173	See thread on OLR website.
907253	909115	And that would be at www.orangehaunchery.com.
909135	909715	Click on Forums.
910436	914597	You record footage of you playing your favorite games and play Dragon Force in your video.
914997	917778	It was influenced by the Yaris video and your mentioning of Dragon Force.
917818	918478	Hope it goes well.
918938	925680	For those who might be new to our program, we said that you can make a bad game even better most of the time by putting Dragon Force music to it.
925980	927540	Because Dragon Force is just that awesome.
928241	930601	And so some of our listeners have taken it upon themselves to do this.
930881	933902	And now Sakura Max wants to make a little contest out of it.
934242	935062	I say go for it.
935462	936203	It's pretty awesome.
936283	938043	I don't know what we can contribute for prizes.
938123	940584	Maybe we're trying to reserve some things on the prize table for something else.
940884	941864	But maybe we can dig up something.
942404	943625	So participate.
943705	946845	And a complete side note, Dragon Force sucks ass live.
947666	947966	Really?
948346	948986	Yes, they do.
949086	949906	When did you see them live?
950506	952267	I didn't, but I know they are.
952747	956008	I heard on the radio that they were going to be playing live at some event.
957324	960265	coming up in like two months from now in Sacramento.
960865	967508	So I just decided, oh, hey, I'll see what they sound like live and went to YouTube and was terribly disappointed.
968568	968828	All right.
970289	974290	Well, here comes the next email, one of two remaining emails we're going to read this week.
974390	976491	Sorry if we didn't get to your email, but we got a few this week.
976651	977931	This comes to us from J-Rod.
978632	979932	I think this is a Loki hate mail.
980732	981173	Oh, crap.
981373	981773	Oh, crap.
981973	982613	Good times.
982653	983413	Let me back away.
983533	984454	I love these emails.
984474	984974	All right, here we go.
985914	991417	I just wanted to write in and completely put over Loki.
991917	997779	His anger and cynicism on the show not only make for hilarious radio, but most of the time echo my own thoughts.
999500	1007684	Quite a few times, though, it seems like he's very out of place because Rob and Jamie are pretty optimistic people and it's usually silent after one of Loki's rants.
1008394	1013841	Not one of those, let him have the stage silent moments, but an uncomfortable, what's this guy's deal silent moments?
1014261	1016644	I was surprised to hear that Loki and Skye used to room together.
1016684	1020949	I was just so interested in the relationship between all you guys because you seem so radically different.
1021070	1021790	What say you?
1023492	1023573	Um...
1024659	1025039	DarkSakura.com
1046320	1047200	DarkSakura.com
1071030	1078333	And so we wanted to kind of create a show that had that feel of, you know, going to dinner and talking smack about games and talking about the community or what have you.
1079033	1085176	It's kind of a... I guess you could say it's a spin-off of another show I used to be on, Under Station Live, which is a very similar kind of vibe.
1085796	1086456	So that's why we're here.
1086656	1092678	And Loki and I used to be roommates because there was just a point where Loki was looking to move out the same time I was, and it just made sense.
1093259	1093799	So there you have it.
1094779	1099021	So, as far as us being silent when he does rants and things, you know...
1099975	1101818	Sometimes there's just no way to respond.
1111855	1116816	Relatively on this show for a live radio program, there's not a lot of dead air.
1117837	1126219	And keep in mind that when Jamie, myself, and Loki are all here, we're juggling from story to story, trying to kind of glance at the parts of the story we actually want to read on the air.
1126759	1128119	We're trying to read the chat room.
1128400	1129660	We're trying to bring up different things.
1129680	1132841	So sometimes we can't totally focus on what's being said.
1132881	1136262	So sometimes I kind of get in that mode where when Loki rants, I just let him rant.
1136302	1137422	I go, okay, Loki's ranting.
1137802	1138842	You know, just kind of let him do his thing.
1139043	1143044	Because it is insanely funny to listen to, and the listeners love it, so why not, right?
1143964	1144304	Sure.
1144705	1145645	Everyone loves Loki.
1146645	1149166	And in terms of multitasking, Loki's still doing that now.
1149286	1152047	Yeah, he's playing his fucking game while I try to do the mailbag.
1152127	1153888	I am contributing to the show, okay?
1154408	1154988	I am talking.
1156129	1159750	I just spin the black circles, only two keys, and I can do that with one hand.
1161601	1164082	All right, one more thing in J-Rod's email that I think is great.
1164162	1165682	Unfortunately, Jamie's not here to see it.
1166003	1170924	She said, also, I attached a picture I took before I went to see Rambo that you guys might like.
1171084	1172685	Awesome show and keep on rocking.
1172985	1178247	And J-Rod's signature as always, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
1178407	1180708	And here's the email in front of the Olive Garden.
1181088	1184229	There is who I assume to be J-Rod wearing a Silent Hill shirt.
1184329	1186070	I actually own that exact same Silent Hill shirt.
1186090	1186390	That's awesome.
1187017	1191922	and I hope Pyramid Head was going to go in there and cut up some pasta for you guys to have.
1192382	1197708	By the way, F you to the Olive Garden for getting rid of the dish I like there, the Tuscan chicken dish.
1198308	1198689	Oh no.
1198869	1199550	Ah, they got rid of it.
1200030	1204775	They have a new thing that's pretty good though and I don't want to hear from the listeners to go, Olive Garden isn't real Italian food.
1204955	1205355	I know.
1205776	1206236	It's not.
1206356	1206777	You win.
1206897	1208078	It's not real Italian food.
1208318	1208879	But you know what?
1208979	1209580	Some days...
1210478	1211499	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1237228	1240474	Oh yeah, my grandma, she spoiled me and my brother.
1241635	1243138	Not just with food.
1243498	1244620	Oh, buying you video games and stuff?
1244660	1245361	Oh, of course, yes.
1246203	1249187	One last email here, and it comes to us from Gray Fox.
1249921	1250761	Hey, OLR gang.
1250821	1255223	First of all, I would just like to say that it's cool that Rob and I are now officially friends on Facebook.
1255643	1258184	Now I can look at all of his sexy pictures without him even knowing.
1258224	1258604	Hey, now.
1259824	1261205	Whoa, did I say that out loud?
1261245	1262005	Ha ha, just kidding.
1262025	1262825	I'm not that creepy.
1263125	1264006	I think you are a little bit.
1264106	1264726	Actually, no, I'm kidding.
1265626	1267807	Anyways, oh my God, I'm as bad as Loki.
1268227	1272388	I was wondering if it was possible to listen to some of the first episodes you guys recorded.
1272728	1275089	The podcast feed only lets me go back to listen to October 2005.
1275129	1275469	Actually, it does.
1278288	1278568	DarkSakura.com
1302526	1304487	You have to put a custom firmware to run Homebrew on it.
1325942	1328424	Thanks, and keep up the great work, GrayFox.
1328564	1328945	P.S.
1329165	1332568	I hope another fly lands in Rob's coffee, because that was friggin' hilarious.
1332848	1334269	Oh, and say no to exploding babies.
1334910	1337812	Thankfully, the fly problem in here seems relatively taken care of.
1338153	1338953	Except for the one.
1338973	1339554	There was the one.
1339834	1340595	There was the one.
1341015	1343717	He was flying around here earlier, and he flew in front of my face.
1343797	1347421	He's not being too annoying as his brothers and sisters were a few weeks ago.
1347601	1352305	Relatively, the fly problem's been in check here in the studio, and I think that's as it's been getting warmer outside.
1352625	1353786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1375046	1375987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1396784	1398065	You should hear the old show.
1398245	1399607	I mean, my God, it was a mess.
1400768	1401228	In a good way.
1401248	1403811	It was a fun mess, you know, but it was much different.
1403851	1419646	So I think it's kind of one of those things where I want to let, and I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura, we want to let true fans of Orange Lounge Radio who like our banter and stuff, we want to let them hear it, but we don't want to put it out there so much that people are going to hear that thinking that is Orange Lounge Radio today because they would be, like, really off.
1420166	1421227	So, does that make sense?
1422839	1428164	And back when the studio was like a six by six foot square box.
1428685	1432248	Drunami says in the chat room, the old OLR was a great clusterfuck.
1432589	1433049	Yes, it was.
1433910	1434231	I don't know.
1434291	1438215	Maybe like in the forums or on the LJ community or something, I'll put an old episode.
1438235	1439576	Or Facebook for you, obviously.
1439876	1442820	I'll put an old episode up there so you can kind of taste what it's like.
1443220	1444882	And I know like Misty...
1445908	1447249	and DDR Angel when she was around.
1447269	1448230	She hasn't been around a lot lately.
1448470	1450772	But I know both of them really keep a lot of archives.
1450832	1453134	So I'll try to put up an episode that even Misty doesn't have.
1454195	1455456	And everybody will like that.
1456818	1457718	At least those that want to hear it.
1458399	1458979	So there you have it.
1459640	1460201	Our mailbag.
1460221	1464084	If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1466835	1477299	So, if you're a member of Steam, you have a lot of other friends that are going to be on there, of course, because Steam has hit 15 million accounts.
1478019	1479259	That's quite a lot.
1479639	1484221	And, of course, lots of good content that they have on there, and they keep adding more stuff.
1484921	1489023	So, apparently, Valve had a lot to do with it.
1489243	1495605	Their Steam-based sales have jumped 158% over the holiday season compared to the previous ones.
1495765	1495945	So...
1496869	1497529	That's pretty awesome.
1498870	1500971	Definitely a viable source for gaming.
1503272	1505333	I still have yet to even check out Steam.
1505634	1506594	Have you ever used Steam?
1507975	1508835	Right.
1508975	1509275	I don't know.
1509295	1510716	Like, I buy games.
1510836	1512417	Oh, stop.
1512437	1513898	You're going to get in trouble for that someday.
1513978	1518220	But, you know, what about its other elements?
1518240	1522322	Like, it doesn't have, like, the X-Fire thing built into it, too, where you can, like, message across games and stuff.
1522342	1523103	Like, I like X-Fire.
1523143	1523563	It's pretty cool.
1525126	1526928	NYR fan loves Steam in chat.
1526968	1527848	He says Steam is the best.
1527908	1529069	It kicks games for Windows ass.
1529089	1530971	I'm not saying I pirate games on the PC.
1531752	1536736	I haven't bought games on PC in a long time because up until recently I haven't had a PC that can run games.
1537376	1542541	The last game I bought on PC was Final Fantasy XI.
1543061	1543862	It's been a while.
1544202	1545924	I guess Crysis since that came out.
1546144	1547565	Well, that came with my graphics card though.
1549106	1552569	I'm looking forward to some stuff coming out like Spore and stuff.
1552669	1553270	I'll buy that.
1554164	1554424	All right.
1555004	1564486	Well, let's go over to the Nintendo Wii, because we haven't been showing Nintendo a lot of love tonight, and we want to talk about some stuff that's coming on the Wii soon, and that is everyone's Nintendo channel.
1565206	1568927	You might remember this came out in Japan a little while ago, and it was kind of like a preview channel.
1569227	1571147	You could check out some new games that were coming out.
1571167	1574348	Now, not that you really download full demos and stuff, but you get, you know, interviews.
1574668	1578989	Basically, it's one giant infomercial of a channel, but the big thing was the DS downloads.
1579049	1579729	That you could get.
1579749	1581689	You could get DS demos beamed to your DS channel,
1581889	1584576	and the question was, when in the hell is it coming to the US?
1584616	1587263	Well, the answer is about next month.
1588246	1592349	That is coming from an insider source reporting to Kotaku, who ran the story earlier this week.
1592429	1593150	I'm not surprised.
1593690	1599135	The channel will be home to some of the same sort of video game videos that you see on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
1599535	1604059	Convention videos might actually start popping up on the channel once it goes live in the States.
1604819	1610704	I'm assuming because Penny Arcade Expo is up in that same area where Nintendo of America is, maybe that's one you can expect to see?
1610724	1611485	I don't know.
1611525	1611745	Maybe.
1612205	1617690	I wouldn't be surprised because I want to say March is also the estimated time for when the WiiWare channel is going to launch.
1617990	1627713	And I bet all of this is going to be documented when they... I don't know if they have a keynote at... I want to say they do a Game Developers Conference, which is... God, I think that's next week or the week after.
1627733	1628313	Yeah, it's next week.
1628353	1628633	It is.
1629393	1630354	Sadly, I'm not going.
1630774	1631554	Yeah, I know.
1631854	1632514	I wanted to go.
1632854	1644398	And I know talking to some buddies over at All Games, or at least listening to their shows, All Games Interactive, our friends over there, only Jessica is going, and Bobby B's not going this year, which is kind of too bad.
1644418	1645438	Yeah, it's, you know...
1645854	1646875	I would love to go, but...
1664185	1666807	You get to get little peeks from a developer angle.
1666867	1667308	That's really it.
1667428	1670950	And also you get to see stuff you might not normally see.
1671151	1676835	I'm expecting them to talk about WiiWare since that makes sense from a developer's standpoint that they would want to address that stuff.
1677355	1686502	Also, there's rumors that Microsoft is going to have something similar to a YouTube of gaming type thing that they may discuss too.
1686562	1691126	You'll see announcements like that, talking about their network upgrades and crap like that.
1691544	1692585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1713533	1719976	I want to say really quickly before we get to the next story, Tiger Claws in chat, and he's a big listener over at AGI.
1720757	1723658	In fact, I think he came to our show because of All Games and our syndication there.
1723698	1726080	He says, Jessica's bringing the Justin cam with her, he thinks.
1726580	1729121	So that's kind of cool if she's taking that cam with her.
1729822	1731162	Justin TV is a great way to get that.
1731402	1733724	I wish we were able to go more mobile with Justin TV.
1733764	1735645	I think we can because we have a laptop and a camera.
1735685	1736345	It's just difficult.
1736820	1737400	You know, it's not easy.
1737420	1738521	Because they're not together.
1738821	1740661	Well, you know, you can get the cameras loose.
1740681	1749884	Well, most people put the camera in the backpack, or I mean, put the laptop in the backpack and have the wire sticking out and put the, I mean, you can do it with that eyesight because that eyesight pops right out of the base and you can just strap it to a helmet.
1750404	1752065	We could do it, but it's just, it's hard.
1752325	1756946	And it wouldn't run for very long on that laptop's battery either because the laptop doesn't function when it's closed.
1757286	1759507	I don't know if that's a setting I can change on there, but oh well.
1759707	1760327	It's not worth it.
1760647	1762368	Do you really want to see us out and about in public?
1762428	1763008	I don't think so.
1763688	1764468	Let's have our privacy.
1765509	1766549	Mine works with the
1767042	1769003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1797096	1800818	Those games are... Endless possibilities.
1800858	1802819	Yeah, endless possibilities.
1803299	1804280	Especially when you're drunk.
1804380	1811964	It's just like, oh god, and you can have Red Blob versus Blue Blob, Penis versus 2DX controller, you know.
1812364	1813024	It's hilarious.
1813164	1813685	Good times.
1814005	1814445	Good times.
1814830	1820153	Alright, before we get into our next news story, we're going to be getting into tonight's new game very soon.
1820533	1827297	And as I mentioned, the entire chatroom has the possibility to participate, but you have to participate through private message.
1827697	1833080	During tonight's game, the chatroom will be locked, and you will be unable to speak in the chatroom during the game.
1833100	1835662	This is to prevent cheating from you guys for helping each other out.
1836022	1838363	So you have to play this game through private message.
1838484	1843066	So if you are interested in playing tonight's game, you have to send me a private message.
1843086	1843867	I'm Sky in the chatroom.
1843887	1844427	That's S-K-I-E.
1844447	1845968	Send me a private message that just says, me.
1862032	1864033	or I want to play, me.
1864113	1872237	Send me a private message if you want to play and we'll let you know the next part very soon when we reveal what we're going to be playing tonight and the contestant who's going to be coming in over the phone.
1872838	1877020	So while you guys send that in, I've got one more story for you guys.
1878781	1886805	Nintendo has apparently revealed that they have sold 10 million virtual console games.
1888167	1893070	So even if you think that, okay, so $10 million, the lowest price somebody's paying for those is $5.
1894270	1901233	That's $50 million they've earned on the virtual console games, considering most of this stuff was written off, gone.
1901533	1902934	We're never going to profit off this stuff again.
1904174	1905275	So there it went.
1906722	1934169	and free money basically from the virtual console and Satoru Iwata who's of course the president of Nintendo talked about that this is proof of the value of digital distribution however not totally discounting the retail channel saying that the retail channel is still important but also admits that retail is not quite as profitable it's low profit margins on the box titles so could Nintendo be stepping more and more into digital distribution who knows possibly quite soon
1934602	1937807	Yeah, not anytime soon because they're freaking slow.
1938708	1940691	Where are they going to put all those digital downloads?
1940791	1943695	Yeah, you can't digitally download a Wii Remote.
1944076	1945017	Or, you know.
1945712	1947452	Balance Board and all that crap you gotta buy.
1947933	1955614	Before you get to your story, Loki, I want to say for those in chat, if you try to do a private message conversation via DCC, it will not work.
1955714	1959015	The DCC client that's built into MIRC, you need to do it another way.
1959335	1961156	Look at Dark Tetsuya's post in chat.
1961616	1962716	He shows you guys how to do it.
1962776	1964557	So please get to doing that.
1966197	1970378	Famitsu Magazine had some details on the brand new Mario Kart Wii.
1971002	1978287	It's going to sport 32 courses, Mid-Air Tricks, and of course, Mii Integration, which sounds pretty awesome.
1979128	1985712	They're going to be remaking, I know, some of the tracks that were in Mario Kart DS, as well as pretty much all the Mario games.
1987553	1995879	And, of course, they are saying that 16 of the tracks that are going to be from other games and the other 16 are brand new.
1996459	1998981	Although, I wish there was more brand new tracks and less of the
2001019	2025119	12 player online matches will also be available and you'll be able to play 4 player split screen and I think you can play 2 player over online too so you can do 2 people per console as well ghost downloads, time trials will also be available and you can also of course choose a bike or a cart I wonder which version of Rainbow Road they would use
2027608	2027948	I don't know.
2028088	2028489	Who knows?
2028589	2029649	Because there's quite a few.
2029869	2034152	And you know if they don't do Rainbow Road just right, people are going to be pissed.
2036213	2036834	So we'll see.
2038315	2039836	Alright, you ready to get to tonight's game?
2039856	2041236	Yay!
2041356	2042617	Alright, well let's get to tonight's game.
2042637	2046520	By the way, you only have about 15 more seconds to send me a private message or you are out.
2046620	2048761	You cannot join the game midway through.
2048861	2050922	You are out if you don't send me a private message.
2050982	2052043	Time is almost up.
2052483	2055025	However, we need to get one contestant on the phone.
2056127	2062350	So hopefully if you answered Friday the 13th in our thing earlier, you might want to stand by the phone because it could be ringing right now.
2063091	2066392	Let's put in the number of our contestant.
2069094	2070014	Live radio, folks.
2070315	2072256	Sorry for any delays or dead area here.
2073056	2073356	Here it goes.
2073416	2073776	It's ringing.
2075857	2076978	Hello, is this Tiger Claw?
2077939	2078499	Yo, what's up?
2078659	2079920	Hey, it's Orange Lounge Radio.
2079960	2080460	Guess what?
2082357	2083178	Yeah, I think I know.
2083418	2084219	You think you know.
2084259	2084639	That's right.
2084659	2087001	You're going to be playing a game with us tonight.
2087342	2089123	Tiger Claw, it's a brand new game.
2089464	2090204	What do you think about that?
2091565	2092686	Oh, exciting.
2092907	2093107	I know.
2093167	2093827	It's very exciting.
2094067	2096289	How would you say your knowledge of video game trivia is?
2097871	2101274	Well, I would guess so-and-so.
2101854	2102154	All right.
2102375	2106138	Considering that I've been around since it was invented.
2106398	2107319	Do you think that...
2110781	2112442	Were you playing Pong back in the day?
2113482	2117524	Yeah, my first video game was Pong, and after that was Atari 2600.
2117785	2119425	Awesome, well then maybe you have an advantage.
2119806	2125869	Do you think you know enough about video game trivia that you could beat the entire chatroom at Video Game Trivia?
2127780	2128621	1 vs. The Chat Room
2158578	2160060	One vs. The Chatroom
2180662	2181523	Nope.
2181543	2183665	Oh, then you'd be perfect for winning this code.
2183685	2184806	But here's the thing, TigerClaw.
2184866	2187789	If at any point during the game, we're going to ask you some questions.
2187829	2192053	If at any point during the game, the chat room beats you, we're going to give it to one of them.
2194068	2194428	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
2224059	2227621	Everybody that's in chat, pretty soon the chat is going to go into lockdown.
2227641	2230443	You will not be able to speak publicly within the room.
2230483	2231623	It's going to get very quiet in there.
2231643	2233925	You will only be able to play this game through private message.
2234285	2239928	I'm going to be asking Tigerclaw multiple choice questions with three possible answers.
2240248	2244671	You will have about 30 seconds to send your answer to me via private message.
2245011	2246912	Then Tigerclaw will answer the question.
2247432	2248753	If he gets it right...
2249133	2249733	www.DarkSakura.com
2272651	2275212	Those that got the right answer will be eligible to win the prize.
2275252	2279594	We will pick one of the chatters randomly to win the prize.
2280054	2282355	So we'll kind of explain that a little more as we move through it.
2282395	2284636	Let's see how many chatters are actually playing tonight.
2284656	2287877	You want to see how many chatters we have and who you're playing against, TigerClaw?
2289093	2290734	Probably the entire chatroom.
2290794	2291494	Just about.
2291574	2292155	I hate to say it.
2292195	2294656	We have just about the entire damn chatroom we're playing against tonight.
2294676	2294936	Let's see.
2294956	2295617	We got Ranma.
2295637	2296077	That's one.
2296137	2296837	Frisbee, two.
2297218	2298338	RossDLUT, three.
2298638	2299879	GS191, four.
2300279	2301320	GS68, five.
2301360	2302240	Junami, six.
2302440	2303501	PKRuno, seven.
2303821	2304782	Amazatsuma, eight.
2304902	2306123	SJ100MAT, nine.
2306323	2307703	SolarWing, ten.
2308104	2309284	DarkTatsuya, eleven.
2309364	2310305	Ryoma, twelve.
2310645	2311846	Cheeseburger, thirteen.
2312046	2313046	Actdeft, fourteen.
2313407	2314747	Trishlicious, fifteen.
2316815	2327641	15, KevinDDR16, SonOfDad17, Zenny18, SeedStore19, RavensDolphin20, and AJMix21.
2328302	2330043	So it's you versus 21 people.
2330083	2330623	Think you can do it?
2332024	2332804	Oh, I'll give it a try.
2333044	2333305	All right.
2333345	2334025	You got to do your best.
2334045	2334605	That's all we ask.
2334645	2336666	So everybody in chat, wish each other luck.
2338427	2339648	We'll give them just a minute to do that.
2340849	2341089	All right.
2341876	2342917	and here we go.
2342997	2344878	The chat room is now locked.
2344998	2348280	Nobody will be able to type in chat and help each other out.
2348860	2350742	Let's get to the very first question.
2350962	2358326	Ops, you have the power to override that, but I ask for your silence during this time because the Ops in our chat have the power to override that like Ranma and them, but I ask for their silence.
2358366	2361888	Again, you will only have a little bit of time to send your answer.
2361908	2363009	You ready for the first question?
2364390	2364590	Yep.
2364910	2366011	All right, here you go, Tiger Claw.
2366091	2367792	Question number one.
2370242	2374763	The category is classic sports games.
2375243	2381065	In what 8-bit sports game was Gradius featured as a minigame?
2381845	2390147	Is it A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBI Baseball?
2390547	2391508	Again, here's the question.
2391548	2396689	Tiger Claw, don't yell it out until I have a chance here to share this with the chat.
2397478	2402401	In what 8-bit sports game was Gradius featured as a minigame?
2402882	2410167	Is it A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBI Baseball?
2410187	2414970	Okay, we'll take a little musical interlude here while we let the chatters submit their answer.
2415070	2418312	Chatters, you have about 30 seconds to get your answer in.
2419293	2421134	Okay, uh... Wait, hold on, I got it.
2446294	2446674	Hmm, let's see.
2446694	2447775	I've played all those games before.
2468228	2469029	Wait, hold on.
2469149	2469469	You know what?
2469749	2470970	TigerClaw, I'm so sorry.
2471170	2471951	I forgot to tell you.
2472391	2475133	You do get one little lifeline, so to speak.
2475173	2476474	You know, lifelines in the game shows?
2476574	2477775	I totally forgot about this part.
2478656	2484340	If at any time you are unsure about an answer, you can have us eliminate one incorrect answer.
2484480	2489244	Because I will tell you two people from the chat room and how they answered the question.
2489644	2491286	And you can help make your decision from there.
2491326	2492947	So you only get one of them through the game, though.
2492987	2495008	So if you're unsure, I just want to let you know you have that.
2495028	2497010	So TigerClaw, though, sorry to interrupt.
2497947	2508694	A. Blades of Steel, B. Double Dribble, C. RBR Baseball I'm going to have to take one of those lifelines.
2508974	2513037	I've played all three of those games before.
2514418	2515299	I don't think so.
2515959	2518100	We're talking NES games, right?
2518280	2518781	That's right.
2518881	2519821	Is there NES games?
2519981	2521282	Alright, so you want to use that lifeline?
2522163	2522303	Yeah.
2522648	2523949	It could be all over right here.
2524069	2524769	Alright, here we go.
2525370	2527751	We're going to eliminate one wrong answer from the board.
2528152	2530453	I'm going to tell you two answers here.
2530633	2532355	One is correct, one is incorrect.
2532795	2534156	Here's some answers from the chat room.
2534576	2538078	Ranma has said that the answer is Blades of Steel.
2539259	2542301	Frisbee has said that the answer is Double Dribble.
2543202	2544102	One of those is right.
2544723	2545684	One of those is wrong.
2546264	2548005	RBI Baseball is definitely wrong.
2548065	2548425	It's out.
2548946	2549146	So...
2549790	2552271	RBA Baseball being out and your lifeline gone, what do you think?
2552371	2554391	Blades of Steel or Double Dribble?
2556251	2559652	Okay, I'm going to go with Blades of Steel.
2560692	2566914	All right, the correct answer is Blades of Steel is the correct answer.
2567034	2570034	So congratulations, Tiger Claw, you move on.
2570074	2571615	And let's see how many people you knocked out.
2572035	2573675	You knocked out Frisbee, we know that.
2574135	2575555	You knocked out GS-191.
2575635	2577276	You knocked out GS-68.
2582018	2584319	You knocked out Solarwing.
2584979	2585539	Sorry, guys.
2585960	2586800	Thanks for playing, though.
2588301	2589901	And you knocked out Actdeft.
2594563	2595763	You knocked out Son of Dad.
2597084	2597984	You knocked out Zenny.
2600325	2601685	You knocked out Raven's Dolphin.
2602526	2603006	And that's it.
2603379	2608900	So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 people left.
2608920	2611000	So not bad, you took out 8 people on that first question.
2611380	2611881	Nice job.
2611921	2612161	Wow.
2612541	2612861	Alright.
2613261	2614781	Are you ready for the next question?
2616181	2616661	Sure am.
2617021	2617842	Alright, here we go.
2617962	2621762	Question number 2 is in the category of Super Nintendo Shooters.
2622702	2627683	Which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?
2630004	2631384	Is it UN Squadron?
2632560	2635041	Flanix, or R-Type?
2635861	2640002	Again, the question is which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?
2641483	2644844	UN Squadron, Flanix, or R-Type?
2644884	2646985	The chat room will have just a moment to submit their answers.
2647525	2649185	Let's give them some thinking music to do so.
2650726	2657448	We're going to be so sick of this fucking song by the time the night's over.
2666269	2667869	Okay, I think I know what he has.
2668409	2670710	Alright, hold on, we gotta give a chat sometime.
2678231	2680351	Alright, here we go, Tigerclaw.
2680431	2684532	Which of these games was known in Japan as Area 88?
2685812	2689453	Was it UN Squadron, Flanix, or R-Type?
2690913	2693474	The answer would be UN Squadron.
2693854	2694794	UN Squadron?
2695820	2697280	I believe Cheeseburger's out, he said C
2727827	2730268	Trish Lissus, I'm sorry you're out, although I love that name.
2732228	2732568	All right.
2733848	2735309	So now we're down to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
2737629	2738690	You've gone from 21 to 10.
2739050	2739970	Not bad, Tigerclaw.
2740010	2741310	You ready to do it one more time?
2742351	2742751	All righty.
2743031	2743511	Here we go.
2743631	2749272	Here is question number three, and it's in the category The Legend of Zelda.
2750553	2755994	Which one of these is not a monster name in The Legend of Zelda?
2757404	2764288	Is it A, Gleok, B, Aquamentus, or C, Kraken?
2764969	2768311	Which one of these is not a monster name in The Legend of Zelda?
2768331	2769652	Chatroom has a few minutes to reply.
2797833	2799734	Okay, since I played Legend of Zelda 1
2827535	2829817	and the third one, SNES.
2832139	2835402	I'm going to have to probably say C, Kraken.
2836483	2838165	All right, C, Kraken.
2838245	2841227	First, I have to eliminate two people for not submitting on time.
2841768	2842929	So sorry, Ryoma.
2843329	2845671	And sorry, Kevin DDR, you didn't get your answers in on time.
2846212	2849074	So you're already... Oh, Ryoma just barely got his in.
2849094	2849494	He's back.
2850836	2851496	And here we go.
2851796	2853218	The correct answer is...
2856072	2857193	Kraken is correct.
2857253	2857673	Good job.
2857733	2858694	Let's see if you took anybody out.
2858734	2860035	I think that was an easy one, personally.
2862256	2862937	Three have got it.
2863217	2864678	Oh, Piker Uno didn't get it.
2864738	2865458	Sorry, you're out.
2865498	2868100	He said Aquamentus, which was one of the bosses in Zelda.
2870401	2873103	Seed Store also said Aquamentus.
2873163	2874224	Sorry, buddy, you're out.
2874384	2875945	AJ Mix also said Aquamentus.
2876005	2877666	Sorry, you're out as well.
2878227	2878527	All right.
2879547	2882089	So now the mob is down to six people.
2883650	2884911	Tigerclaw, you're doing awesome.
2887276	2887617	All right.
2887897	2890938	Kraken, by the way, was one of the elementals in Final Fantasy.
2891318	2894119	And our next question is all about Final Fantasy.
2894140	2895020	You ready, Tigerclaw?
2896681	2898221	Oh, that's going to be tough.
2898401	2898882	Sorry, buddy.
2898902	2899942	We wrote it before the show.
2900422	2901003	All right.
2901023	2901403	Here they are.
2901843	2902543	Here's your question.
2903884	2909467	In which Final Fantasy game was there a character named Ferris?
2910507	2912128	Was it A, Final Fantasy IV?
2913163	2917409	B, Final Fantasy V, or C, Final Fantasy IX.
2917830	2921736	Again, that's A, IV, B, V, or C, IX.
2922076	2924600	And the character's name is Ferris.
2925160	2926803	Let's give the chat a chance to think.
2937061	2939543	I need the full soundtrack to this show, I think.
2939563	2944647	There's a different song for when they were doing the... Well, I only have the one, so shoot me.
2944807	2952612	We need to start it off before you question by saying how many... One versus... Alright, fine.
2952732	2953633	One versus six.
2953793	2954233	Here it is.
2954994	2956595	So, somebody's walking away with a prize.
2956635	2958757	One of these seven people is going to win the prize.
2958837	2960017	TigerClaw, it's time.
2960258	2962439	In which Final Fantasy game was there a character named Ferris?
2962499	2966322	Was it A, Final Fantasy IV, B, Final Fantasy V, or C, Final Fantasy IX?
2967958	2971801	I'm going to have to say Final Fantasy IX.
2972742	2974624	Alright, let's see if that's the correct answer.
2975124	2987815	The Final Fantasy game that had a character named Ferris was Final Fantasy V. I'm sorry, TigerClaw, you have lost to the mob.
2988920	2990742	This is where the mob cheers.
2990982	2991442	Hey, no problem.
2991482	2993404	I'm not too familiar with Final Fantasy.
2993424	2994725	That's why I kind of took a guess there.
3015092	3020875	Oh no, I've been listening to you guys ever since I heard you from all games back in the day.
3020915	3023136	So I've been listening to your show ever since.
3024036	3026237	Well, Tiger Claw, thanks for supporting us.
3026277	3027097	We really appreciate it.
3027157	3028338	And did you enjoy the game at least?
3028358	3028898	Did you have fun?
3029779	3031139	Well, yeah.
3031239	3032100	I sure did.
3032200	3034421	Now for your consolation applause from the audience.
3034461	3035441	Yes, your consolation applause.
3035461	3036962	Everybody give Tiger Claw a round of applause.
3037862	3039323	Alright, Tiger Claw, we've got to let you go.
3039403	3039983	Have a good one, buddy.
3040649	3041972	Alright, thanks, and you too.
3042213	3042694	Alright, you too.
3042734	3045320	Now the chatters are wondering, which one of us is going to win it?
3046474	3047795	All right, so here we go.
3047875	3049516	Let's see who's going to be knocked out.
3049836	3056501	We have that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on, that person moves on.
3056701	3058842	All six of them got it right in chat.
3059102	3060783	I think we should narrow the field a little bit.
3060903	3062905	You want to narrow the field a little bit with one more question?
3063105	3063645	I think so.
3063785	3064886	All right, fine then.
3064906	3066667	We'll narrow the field a little bit with one more question.
3066687	3070770	All right, in order to do that, we've got to put this in moderated mode again so they can't cheat.
3072014	3074215	So some poor people were just trying to chat.
3074235	3074576	Here we go.
3074896	3076377	Here is the fifth question.
3077938	3078258	All right.
3078818	3084382	The fifth question is in the category Games Rob Hates.
3085503	3087264	And I didn't have the question fully typed out.
3087324	3087784	Hold on.
3087804	3089125	Somebody fill time for just a moment here.
3089525	3090766	What games do you hate, Loki?
3092327	3096190	I'm hating this level of Spin the Black Circle.
3096210	3098631	You've been going at this one level for like 15 minutes.
3099412	3100772	I got close to the end, too.
3100832	3101593	It was pissing me off.
3103101	3106322	I hate... Oh gosh, let me think.
3108303	3108723	I don't know.
3109563	3115905	Anything Barbie.
3116746	3117166	Here we go.
3117206	3121707	We're going to eliminate a few more people here on this question for games Rob hates.
3122928	3124148	In the game Bubsy...
3125962	3127123	Have you ever played Bubsy?
3127423	3128243	Unfortunately, yes.
3128444	3128984	And Bubsy 3.
3129544	3130605	Oh, I'm sorry for you.
3130725	3131045	Okay.
3131565	3132006	Here it is.
3132406	3136428	In the game Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?
3136969	3142692	Was it A, Cheese Pieces, B, Yarn Balls, or C, Leaves?
3143193	3145334	I actually put 1, 2, 3 in chat, but it shouldn't be that big a deal.
3145614	3147915	Okay, was it Cheese Pieces, Yarn Balls, or Leaves?
3148256	3152878	I remember this one.
3152898	3154459	God, I wasn't part of the mob at the time.
3157749	3168119	All right, all the chatters are in.
3168139	3168660	Cut off the theme.
3168860	3169140	All right.
3169781	3170281	Thank God.
3170942	3171603	All right, let's see.
3171643	3174445	Let's go through one at a time to see who got it right and who didn't get it right.
3175166	3175727	Let's see.
3178389	3178730	All right.
3179771	3179991	Wow.
3180011	3180071	Wow.
3180578	3184001	All right, the correct answer in the game Bubsy, which of the following did you collect for points?
3184602	3185983	It was not cheese pieces.
3186103	3187104	It was not leaves.
3187204	3189506	It was yarn balls is the correct answer.
3189526	3190006	Because he's a cat.
3190026	3190547	He's a cat.
3190747	3193029	And how many of the chatters do you think we eliminated?
3193309	3193509	None.
3193810	3194150	None.
3194490	3194850	Damn.
3194931	3195291	None of them.
3195351	3196031	It's all six.
3196392	3198474	So, Puppy, I need you to pick a number, one through six.
3198494	3203358	I'm going to do, I should have brought out my dice.
3203752	3204873	Oh, you're going to roll a dice.
3206874	3213457	It's between Ryoma, DarkTetsuya, SSJ100, Matt, DrewNami, RawSteel, UT, and Ranma is what's remaining in our chat.
3214057	3214637	Alright, here goes.
3214717	3216378	What did it hit?
3217379	3217699	Four.
3218239	3223522	Our winner tonight, boys and girls, of one versus the chatroom, SSJ100, Matt, give it up.
3229725	3231386	A winner of trivia and luck.
3232371	3232932	Exactly.
3233655	3236343	So I'm asking SSJ100 Matt if he's going to take the Res HD code.
3236524	3238370	I seem to recall last week he didn't want it.
3238962	3240082	Okay, he wants the other prize.
3240402	3242383	So SSJ100, Matt, coming to you very soon.
3242403	3249364	You're going to be getting a copy, courtesy of our friends at PopCap Game, Bejeweled 2, the hit sequel to Bejeweled.
3249564	3250764	Now, this is the full version.
3250804	3255985	This is not the crap, well, I shouldn't say the crap version, but the reduced version that you play online.
3256305	3258325	This is the full version of the game.
3258625	3263846	And if you're kind of thinking, well, I don't really want Bejeweled 2, this will make an awesome Valentine's Day gift for somebody.
3263906	3265227	My wife loves some Bejeweled 2.
3265287	3265867	Exactly.
3266127	3267787	The ladies love Bejeweled.
3268627	3270868	So, Bejeweled comes to us from our friends at PopCap.
3270968	3273149	Four different modes of play in this version.
3273909	3275910	It'll keep you going for hours and hours.
3276010	3278391	Classic mode, action mode, puzzle mode, endless mode.
3279131	3279511	Enjoy.
3279891	3280432	There you have it.
3282612	3284253	So, there you go.
3284413	3287054	SSJ100 Matt wins Bejeweled 2, courtesy of PopCap Games.
3287394	3287934	What'd you guys think?
3288195	3289835	Chatroom, did you guys like that prize?
3289935	3290936	Or did you guys like that game?
3291336	3291796	Was that fun?
3293760	3294040	I hope so.
3294100	3295441	Did you guys think the game went well?
3295461	3296121	I thought it was cool.
3296222	3296642	It was fun.
3297282	3298443	Our first run, it went pretty well.
3298583	3305647	I don't know how much it's going to translate to the podcast where people can't play, but I think for the live listeners, that was a lot of fun.
3305667	3308129	Well, it's just as much fun as watching a game show on TV.
3308229	3314692	Yeah, I'm hoping for the podcast listeners and the folks listening to all games, they could kind of think in their mind how they would have done.
3314752	3317134	Maybe they could have had the chance if they were here live on Sunday night.
3317254	3320436	You know everybody that watches a game show thinks they can do better than the person on TV.
3321175	3322836	That's always the way it is.
3323157	3323517	All right.
3324578	3326539	Piker Uno says, I didn't know any of the answers.
3327400	3327981	He did pretty well.
3328021	3328821	He says it was fun, though.
3329382	3331383	Dark Knight says it should make it its own show.
3332825	3334686	Piker Uno says, make a Bomani edition.
3334726	3335026	Who knows?
3335667	3337749	Son of Dad says, more fighting game questions needed.
3338529	3339570	Ryoma says, more trivia.
3339610	3339810	All right.
3339830	3343874	Well, I'm sure that segment will make a comeback in a future edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3345435	3346716	I hope you guys enjoyed that.
3347777	3348037	All right.
3349467	3349928	That's it.
3349988	3354251	We're going to go to the Skype line very soon, but quickly, another couple stories for us.
3356572	3359755	Well, Bandai Namco has definitely taken a different approach for games.
3360795	3364358	For the DS, they're releasing a game called 99 Tears.
3364918	3370702	It is basically 99 different stories that you'll read that are very depressing that are supposed to make you cry.
3371183	3374285	Because apparently they think that it's very therapeutic to cry.
3374827	3375828	I wanna play this game and I'm never gonna cry.
3400266	3401407	Maybe this should be a challenge.
3401487	3403527	Like, make Loki cry.
3403688	3404648	Oh, it'll never happen.
3404708	3405628	This is going to be crap.
3405688	3406609	When was the last time you cried?
3406629	3407289	Are you a crier?
3407509	3408129	I don't remember.
3408489	3409130	Real men cry.
3409230	3409970	You can cry.
3410130	3410530	It's okay.
3411511	3412031	I don't remember.
3412391	3413592	Okay.
3413612	3416153	I don't want to ruffle the personal life feathers, but I'm just curious.
3416753	3416993	All right.
3418314	3420034	Me, I cry at every sad movie I watch.
3420054	3422335	Hell, I think I watched an episode of Wife Swap the other day.
3422375	3423095	I cried at it.
3423115	3423696	It doesn't take much.
3424516	3424756	All right.
3424776	3427477	I waste my time on this show.
3428958	3429198	All right.
3431406	3441430	Lastly tonight, before we get to the Skype line, the Sega is going to be bringing a brand new game to the Nintendo DS, and it's very similar to one of their old cult classics, The Typing of the Dead.
3441810	3445612	However, the new game they are bringing out, The English of the Dead.
3445632	3447993	The English of the Dead.
3448753	3449694	First words you will learn...
3450074	3451414	Brains!
3452054	3453055	The British of the Dead.
3453695	3457716	The interesting thing, though, it's House of the Dead 2, but ported to the DS.
3458276	3463077	And what you have to do, you have to translate words into English from Japanese, or the zombies will eat you.
3464257	3468498	Sometimes the zombies speak out loud, and you have to translate what they're saying.
3469099	3470459	So that's going to be all kinds of interesting.
3470479	3471759	I'd like to see how that plays out.
3471859	3472879	Do you have to write it out?
3473119	3476180	Because sometimes those handwriting recognitions suck.
3476200	3477300	I said blue!
3478841	3479501	Exactly.
3480892	3482914	I wish this game would come out the other way around.
3482994	3484075	Japanese of the Dead.
3484316	3486658	Maybe learn some Japanese or some other languages.
3487238	3488800	English, English of the Dead.
3491162	3492303	Southern English of the Dead.
3494024	3495226	Grammar of the Dead.
3495406	3496447	I bet Jamie would love that.
3496487	3500350	If she was here, she'd suggest a proper grammar game or something.
3501051	3504354	Which actually was not proper grammar in me saying that, but oh well, who cares.
3504694	3505355	Maybe I need to play it.
3506907	3508548	Sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming out.
3508608	3511530	We're going to open up the Skype line for your calls.
3511550	3512310	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3512391	3514552	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3515432	3517414	Quickly though, any last minute stories from Loki?
3518134	3519235	You have a few actually.
3519735	3529961	Already it's confirmed that there's going to be a Professor Layton sequel because the game manual says there's going to be a sequel and it will have a code in it that you use in the first game or something.
3530262	3534064	Shane has been talking to me about how wonderful Professor Layton is like all week long.
3534679	3535280	Plastic Yellowways
3552877	3555580	I want some melting Legos in my Indiana Jones game.
3555720	3560325	They've replaced them with anonymous genocidal occultist trench coat wearing master race.
3560345	3564630	Well, I want the anonymous genocidal occult trench coat wearing bastards to have their faces melt.
3566131	3566972	Let's go to the Skype line.
3566992	3567873	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3567893	3568214	Who's this?
3569155	3569655	GS68.
3569995	3570956	Hello, GS68.
3570976	3571797	What's on your mind, my friend?
3572258	3572318	Um,
3573078	3576439	Ask them good news and bad news regarding 2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
3576799	3581300	2DX at Sunnyvale Golf Land, one of our local arcades, got some attention lately.
3581460	3585281	Somebody wrote an article about classic arcades or something.
3585341	3586502	You know who that guy was, too.
3587682	3590063	I can't believe I'm plugging it here on the show.
3590383	3597004	But I will point out how convenient that the person used the arcade they used to go to all the time in that article.
3597324	3598865	I'm sure it was a real challenge to write it.
3598905	3599265	But anyhow...
3599865	3606327	GS68, what's on your mind regarding Beatmania Golfland?
3608107	3612769	Good news, we have two DX DJ Troopers as of this week.
3613109	3613529	Nice!
3613769	3615650	Maybe I'll have to go play, but what's the bad news?
3617310	3627513	The machine is unlocked well ahead of what's supposed to be in Japan, and that means if you plan on going in or between now and most likely May, you can't take pictures of the machine.
3628846	3629827	You can't take pictures.
3629927	3630988	How are they policing that?
3632368	3632929	Good question.
3632969	3633589	I'm not sure.
3635330	3635951	Interesting.
3636031	3640954	So you can't... You don't usually see that in arcades where you're completely banned from taking pictures.
3640974	3642015	That's just challenging people.
3642055	3643676	Wait, is it a location test that they're doing?
3643696	3644116	For real.
3644137	3645217	Okay, here's how you're going to do it.
3645297	3647799	GSCCA, I will tell you how to get around this right now.
3648219	3650481	You get one of those... I even have this on my cell phone.
3650501	3652802	You get one of those phones that records video.
3653343	3653503	Huh?
3653523	3653583	Huh?
3654963	3656004	Let me get the camera phone.
3656344	3667651	Yeah, you get a camera phone and what you do is you kind of stand next to the machine and you hit the record button and then you pretend you're talking on your phone while you're recording the screen right there.
3668071	3668752	That's how you do it.
3669192	3670273	Easy as pie.
3671033	3674255	And then it'll be up on YouTube and somebody will get shit in their pants.
3675396	3681100	Well, I just sent you a link via private message and that explains why we can't take pictures.
3681809	3686332	Here's the thing, are they, because usually it's the new songs people want to know and stuff.
3686352	3689434	Are people not allowed to write the songs down and then post them on the internet?
3689494	3696218	I mean... Sorry, I don't expect you to know that.
3696238	3700961	I think it'd be like the fact that the machine is unlocked well ahead of schedule.
3701321	3701481	Yeah.
3702325	3703046	Um, let's see.
3703106	3705808	I'm looking at the post here on our friends at Bomani Style.
3705848	3714455	The distributor has asked that no pictures or videos be taken yet due to the fact the machine will be fully unlocked with all hidden feature songs per my request and as a present to all the players at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
3714715	3718097	This is about three months ahead of Japan and we cannot have secret stuff leak on the internets.
3718358	3722361	So please, people, assist me with this small task of not allowing pictures or videos to be taken yet.
3722621	3724823	Do they have a big sign hanging by the machine or anything?
3725003	3725663	I don't know if you've been.
3726004	3726424	No, like,
3727355	3732039	I went this Saturday and I pulled out my camera and then one of the players told me not to take pictures.
3732740	3732980	Hmm.
3733800	3734141	Interesting.
3734201	3735362	So they're self-policing it?
3736783	3737563	Uh, most likely.
3737643	3748912	Maybe, I mean, I wonder if I can talk to them about, like, having them put a sign in, like, maybe set up a security camera, like... Yeah, a security camera really could be good.
3749312	3750954	In a sense, they're breaking their own rules.
3750974	3753075	I don't know, for me, this sounds like a challenge.
3753516	3754897	Facing away from the screen.
3754917	3755717	Hmm.
3756258	3756658	Interesting.
3757419	3757800	Thanks for that.
3757820	3761023	Yeah, plus I can imagine some guy who's never played a single-ball mining game
3778103	3779124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3800342	3801423	Yeah, it is a challenge.
3801723	3803825	I mean, when somebody says don't, you want to do.
3804145	3804906	Although, I understand.
3804946	3805626	You know what?
3805706	3807728	The community maybe just doesn't want to spoil or whatever.
3807748	3809389	You know, we probably shouldn't be spoil sports.
3810110	3812491	Honestly, I'm not going to get to Sunnyvale Golf Land anytime soon anyway.
3812511	3813432	But I do kind of want to check it out.
3813472	3819036	I haven't played an arcade Beatmania game since E3 when they had the machine there that one year randomly.
3819237	3820117	That's the last time I played it.
3820918	3821078	Yeah.
3821922	3825204	Uh, yeah, I don't remember the last time I played Geek Mania.
3826105	3828206	SSJ100 Matt in chat has a good point.
3828286	3830607	Most people on the forums will say PIX or GTFO.
3833429	3834610	Alright, fine, we'll get PIX.
3834630	3835570	Yeah, we'll get PIX.
3836851	3838192	I'm not opposed to getting PIX.
3838852	3839132	Alright.
3839372	3841794	Ban me from SVGL?
3841954	3842634	Oh no.
3842654	3843174	Who knows?
3843495	3847477	What's ironic about this is that, like, even if we...
3848559	3855822	This game's not supposed to be in the U.S., so we're not allowed to take pictures to begin with.
3856523	3858043	I mean, it's not even supposed to be in the U.S.
3858083	3858624	to begin with.
3858724	3859384	I guess that's true.
3859624	3860625	I mean, well, we had the U.S.
3860645	3862425	location test, but that failed.
3862986	3867628	Alright, well, I'm waiting for the next story where somebody gets beaten up in the parking lot over taking a picture of this game.
3868268	3871129	GS68, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for your call.
3871230	3871670	Take care, buddy.
3872470	3872790	You too.
3873611	3874311	It's just, boy.
3874952	3875812	Hey there, this is Let's Have Tea
3901770	3902891	Let's have tea.
3903052	3904794	Let's have some tea and chat a little bit.
3904834	3905695	What is up, my friend?
3908178	3911462	I just wanted to plug the game Psychonauts.
3912283	3915907	To anybody who hasn't checked this game out yet, I know it's kind of old, but...
3917003	3921264	I finally got a chance to play through it, and it's well worth the $15 on the marketplace.
3921284	3921384	Right.
3921404	3922044	It's definitely out there.
3946902	3959071	Um, I'm a big adventure game fan, and it's pretty much the first, like, adventure game that's really got my attention since, like, Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie.
3959691	3959912	Hmm.
3961132	3963774	Is it... I hear a lot about the sense of humor in this game.
3963814	3965135	Is it the sense of humor that draws you in?
3966516	3966977	Uh, yeah.
3967037	3970199	The game is seriously, just ridiculously twisted.
3970559	3970599	Um...
3972293	4000920	you infiltrate the minds of a lot of really interesting characters and a lot of them are in like a loony bin so there's a lot of weird stuff going on I didn't see a lot of this game I've uh and so maybe I need to take your advice and go check it out I've watched it being played by somebody else but it was I didn't see a lot of the story I just saw the actual game and to me it was kind of like oh I think I've kind of seen this game before but you're saying no it's worth a second look it really stands out right it's
4001491	4002672	It's definitely worth it.
4004052	4008075	Let's say they make a Psychonauts 2 someday, which with all the cult following, you never know.
4008155	4010496	What would you most like to see in Psychonauts 2?
4013598	4018460	Well, in the story of it, they totally opened it up so that there's a possibility.
4019001	4028366	But really, just the way that Psychonauts 1 worked out with the sense of humor and the
4029697	4034321	The way that they were able to develop the different abilities throughout the game.
4036983	4042667	Usually in sequels, they aren't able to rebuild abilities like that.
4042707	4058660	Like if you take Banjo-Kazooie from Banjo-Kazooie, it's hard to add even more to the game when the original game limits what you do by the moves that you have.
4059318	4061198	Does that make sense?
4086583	4091165	If you can find the old Xbox disc, you can play it with backwards compatibility as well, so either works.
4092246	4094767	It's also a PS2 and PC game.
4096267	4096847	It's everywhere.
4097828	4099949	No excuses for not playing this.
4100789	4101369	Let's have tea.
4101549	4108292	Thank you very much for what we'll call the not quite classic game of the week, because it's not a classic yet, but it probably will be in a few more years.
4110252	4110733	Let's have tea.
4110793	4112613	I have one more question for you before we let you go.
4112933	4114174	Do you really like to drink tea?
4115803	4116744	Absolutely not.
4118385	4118846	I knew it.
4119286	4122229	Maybe it's Mr. T. Are you more of a coffee drinker?
4123550	4125952	I'm actually not really into any of that.
4125992	4128414	I just thought it was a clever name and thought it was funny.
4128934	4130055	So I grabbed it.
4130316	4130876	Well, you win.
4130916	4131517	It is pretty funny.
4132117	4133598	Especially when you consider you don't like tea.
4133999	4135340	Even I like a little tea here and there.
4135460	4136161	All right.
4136181	4136661	Well, let's have tea.
4136701	4139163	Thanks so much for reminding us about the greatness of Psychonauts.
4139183	4139844	Have a great one, okay?
4141025	4141205	Yep.
4141445	4141886	Have a good one.
4142106	4142286	Later.
4143226	4145687	Alright, we can do a couple more calls, I suppose.
4145867	4148407	Oh, Skype wants us to rate the quality of that call.
4148467	4149508	How was the call quality?
4149548	4149948	Would you say 5?
4150388	4150868	Very good?
4151208	4150868	4?
4151268	4151488	Good?
4151648	4152628	I would say it's either 4 or 5.
4153588	4155649	I'll give it a 4, because I've had issues on other calls.
4156749	4160090	I'm not sending the whole thing, Jesus.
4160410	4162070	Now answer 30 more questions.
4162751	4164311	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4165137	4166418	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!
4166739	4167739	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!
4167759	4169221	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma!
4193325	4193885	You're right.
4193905	4193985	Hmm.
4221892	4222032	E.M.U.s
4252301	4281302	That would seem likely, because the IP address So things that would have to be unlocked by EMUs wouldn't normally be available here So if they can unlock everything here, and we don't get EMUs, that just means that they're plain assholes for not unlocking at all Alright Konami does have a record Kevin DDR in chat says, no one knows how Somebody does, obviously, because this machine's added done to it But I get what you're saying I bet it's up, up, down, down, left, right, left Nobody who can spread the word knows how, I guess
4282370	4283251	Ranma, what else is on your mind?
4283291	4283651	Anything else?
4284752	4285173	Not much.
4285673	4294200	Like Irene said earlier, I went to a Ren Faire this weekend, and out of all my costumes, I found one that would be perfect to blend right in.
4294561	4299565	Okay, I just have to give a little background because the Ren Faire thing came up during our bonus segment, which the podcast people don't hear.
4300366	4303488	So podcasters, just know we were talking about the Ren Faire earlier in the show.
4303549	4305210	It's not completely out of place, his comments.
4305486	4305786	I don't like it.
4305806	4306146	I don't like it.
4332904	4335625	That was like a... It was a Ranma remix.
4336966	4338267	Do not adjust your iPods.
4338287	4340908	We heard the same thing.
4340968	4341709	I guess so.
4341989	4343349	DMN, make a song out of that.
4344870	4345671	God, no.
4347532	4348552	Ranma, I'm sorry, let's see.
4348892	4352354	A good fit with our show or video games or what?
4353595	4354375	With video games.
4355155	4355736	Now what is it?
4356956	4357577	Black Mage.
4358457	4358817	Nice.
4359498	4360518	Did you wear your Black Mage?
4360538	4361399	You have a Black Mage outfit.
4361419	4361899	Did you wear it?
4362805	4363245	Yes, I did.
4363765	4364326	Awesome.
4364386	4366966	Did you get a lot of people coming up to you wanting to take the old picture?
4368027	4368887	Yes, yes, I did.
4370007	4372528	Did you take pictures with large-breasted women in corsets?
4374369	4377090	I decided to keep those pictures to myself, okay?
4377510	4379991	At those Ren Fairs, you know the Las Vegas rules apply.
4381251	4382732	What happens at Ren Fairs stays at Ren Fairs?
4383592	4384232	Damn right.
4384252	4384512	That's right.
4384532	4390034	You're not allowed to take pictures of the women in corsets and put them up on the Internet or the SVGL management will get very mad at you.
4392037	4392257	Right.
4392497	4396060	But some people actually thought I was Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.
4397001	4399102	Well, because Vivi does look like a Black Mage.
4399242	4399763	I can see that.
4400663	4401804	And here's the best thing.
4401844	4405347	Someone walked up to me and said, You're Orko from He-Man, aren't you?
4405367	4407728	That's awesome.
4408449	4409810	Black Mage does look like Orko.
4409830	4410330	What can you do?
4410610	4415814	After hearing that five, six times, I said, The next Ren Faire, I'm going to do a Jedi and I'll do Orko.
4416054	4416795	See what happens.
4417035	4417335	Nice.
4417844	4419605	Well, Ranma, glad to hear you had fun at Ren Faire.
4419865	4422827	Maybe next time you're in Cali, we'll take Irene to one together, okay?
4423608	4424448	Or maybe you should take her.
4424989	4425709	I probably will.
4425769	4429812	I think she sent me a private message with one that she wants to go to now, but I've been too busy doing the show.
4429852	4431973	Let me look, actually, real quick while we're on the subject of Ren Faire.
4432574	4436977	Ah, no, I accidentally closed it during the game because I needed to keep my private message window clean during the game.
4437177	4438298	Did you like the game tonight, Ranma?
4438338	4439418	You came very close to winning.
4440199	4441340	That was great.
4441940	4442540	I loved that.
4443261	4443801	All right, good.
4443821	4444282	I'm glad you liked it.
4444302	4445162	We'll have to do it again sometime.
4445482	4446623	All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
4446863	4447304	Have a good one.
4447564	4447784	All right.
4450202	4450762	One more call?
4451743	4451943	Sure.
4451963	4454164	Hopefully it doesn't get caught in the loop.
4454945	4457767	The crazy... Sucked into a black hole.
4457807	4458728	What the hell was that?
4459548	4462731	It's not ringing off the hook, so Loki, do you have any last-minute stories you want to do?
4463752	4469015	OneUp is going to be changing their scoring policies, apparently, how they rate games, which is quite funny.
4469336	4476381	Now, instead of the point system, they're going to be changing it to letters, like grading system from A plus to F.
4477597	4481500	I bet there's ten different letters in between there and nothing's changing.
4481840	4487444	You know, because they're admitting, you know what they are, they're admitting, well, I guess it's not really admitting.
4488844	4491106	EGM is going to do the same thing, it's all going to start in March.
4491126	4496069	Because what I'm saying, like, I don't know, A through F has a different kind of connotation to it than 1 through 10.
4496930	4502053	Like, F is failing, it's a miserable game, whereas I think in the 1 through 10 world, 6 is seen as failing, I think.
4505478	4508019	So I guess that's the point I was trying to make that I didn't do very well.
4508740	4509540	But who cares?
4509560	4510841	Well, technically enough, it's a 60%.
4511361	4511881	Who cares?
4511981	4514142	It's one review site on the entire internet.
4514162	4516303	I realize it's a big one, but, you know, come on.
4516323	4518564	It's also a magazine, EGM, and Games for Windows.
4518624	4521586	We live in a world where there's demos readily available.
4521786	4522566	Make your own decision.
4522806	4528869	Now, I read reviews once in a while, but I haven't found a game reviewer I really 100% trust and like yet.
4530510	4531890	Maybe the guy from Zero Punctuation.
4531910	4532211	I don't know.
4532251	4533031	No, he's too negative.
4533547	4534348	Funny but negative.
4534568	4535248	Funny but negative.
4535289	4537791	Let's go to the phones and take one last call.
4537831	4538731	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4538751	4539072	Who's this?
4540133	4542014	Hello, this is Ross Deal UT.
4542194	4543616	Ross Deal UT.
4543716	4544777	What is up, my friend?
4546478	4547619	Nothing, just shooting shit.
4547639	4548440	You know how that goes.
4548760	4550141	That's what we do here at Orange Launch Radio.
4550642	4550942	What's up?
4551863	4552423	Hell yeah.
4553104	4554705	Anyway, I've got a few things on my mind.
4554745	4555846	Not too many, but a few.
4556106	4556387	All right.
4557508	4558689	First off, there's this...
4560083	4566373	I don't know, there was somebody linking that already on the chat, this marine who went missing.
4568556	4571180	Basically what happened is that the family thinks that maybe...
4572429	4573609	Call of Duty 4 Call of Duty 4
4601983	4610186	I mean, I don't want to give away any of the plot line, but you invade a Middle Eastern country and a nuclear device goes off.
4610826	4611286	Oh, wow.
4612467	4628432	Yeah, it's a very gritty game, you know, and I could definitely see where somebody who's been to Iraq, who's maybe having problems with post-traumatic, you know, might play that game and get a,
4629266	4630967	Get a bad reaction from it.
4631327	4636590	They're saying that he might be actually trying not to be found.
4638031	4639351	It sounded pretty bad.
4639531	4640232	Very unfortunate.
4640272	4643253	Probably not a game he should have been playing in the first place.
4643313	4644334	So the question is...
4645325	4656391	Do they have it out there enough for this guy to know maybe he shouldn't play this game as he's very sensitive on these type of topics or suffering from this post-war syndrome?
4657531	4662514	Is it the responsibility of the makers of this game to put some type of disclaimer on the game?
4662614	4662854	No.
4664475	4667156	This game might be too real for some people.
4667636	4668357	That's stupid.
4668377	4672599	The thing is, though, with post-traumatic stress disorder, that sort of thing,
4674181	4677722	It could be any number of things that trigger it.
4678662	4684203	Any number of things could remind somebody or give someone a bad flashback.
4684763	4687664	It's very unpredictable.
4688184	4693885	Like a lot of mental disorders, it's going to affect people in different ways.
4696686	4702147	Not only that, but modern warfare, you know they're going to at least deal with the Arab angle somewhat.
4703047	4703267	It's
4704272	4710840	I was just going to say, very unfortunate news, no matter, you know, where it kind of falls.
4710880	4715965	I mean, it's just kind of unfortunate that, you know, maybe this was the type of game he should have played with other people.
4716546	4717868	I think that's kind of the thing, too.
4717908	4719069	I know exactly what it is.
4719209	4719449	What?
4720170	4721232	It's not Call of Duty 4.
4721552	4721792	What?
4721972	4722453	It was Yars.
4723294	4723995	He played Yars.
4724884	4726745	and he's like, oh my god, I have to run.
4726765	4728466	Well, that's a different kind of trauma.
4728546	4731288	There's a place in hell waiting for you, Loki.
4731548	4733149	Okay, RustyLUT, we don't have too much time.
4733409	4734630	What else did you want to say real quick tonight?
4736051	4738452	There was this industry blog.
4740274	4753742	One of these industry analyst people was talking about how there's a problem where the industry has no real room for anything
4754577	4761001	between the tiny budget casual games and the tens of millions of dollars blockbusters.
4761041	4762381	Let me put up a link right now.
4765103	4769325	And as far as the American market, I can certainly agree with that.
4770566	4778090	We either see the huge budget Call of Duties and Gears of War or we see PopCap.
4778770	4781712	It's not as diverse a market as, say, Japan where
4782686	4784907	There's stuff all over the budget spectrum.
4791429	4795790	This is an opinion piece I didn't read before tonight's show, so it's a little harder for me to comment on it.
4798271	4798731	What do you think?
4798771	4801812	Do we have enough variety in our styles of games that we have out there right now?
4803132	4808374	Not so much styles, but we need a real be real.
4808694	4809214	Because
4810022	4821527	If you look at the American market, it's PopCap games type of deal, and then there's Gears of War, Call of Duty, you know, really big budget games, and there's not a lot of stuff in between.
4822087	4825169	You know, if you compare that to Japan, where you see stuff like Chuu!
4825209	4831731	Litten no Nechanbara, you know, people just throwing crap out there, hell, even Puzzle Quest, which managed to become a hit.
4832252	4837654	You know, what this guy's talking about is you can't really experiment with
4837970	4844157	when you're dealing with a budget of $20 million, $30 million because there's too much risk involved.
4845238	4851645	But at the same time, there's really only so much you can do in a little budget 2D game.
4852066	4857792	So either extreme, you're not really having a lot of room for new ideas.
4858644	4861787	Isn't there a similarity with movies though?
4861827	4871775	Because it seems like most movies are either the art house cheap ones or the explosion Michael Bay, burning money live on screen type of movies.
4871835	4874917	There's not a whole lot in between there either.
4875398	4878800	Well, that's the be real basically.
4880642	4884225	There's not a whole lot for what people want in that middle market because...
4886179	4888541	The American market is a lot different than the Japanese ones.
4889281	4902649	There's a lot more people in Japan that play games for one, but there's either you've got the hardcore gamers that have been doing it for years, or the people that are just the casual gamer market, and there really is no target audience for something in between.
4904369	4905190	That's the thing, though.
4905370	4912414	You'd think that the hardcore would be the most receptive of something like, well, you look at Puzzle Quest, or
4914686	4917429	Chulip, or Nechanbara.
4918630	4924856	Just an idea being thrown out there with maybe a $2 or $3 million budget.
4925937	4927899	And yes, you should pick up Puzzle Quest GS68.
4929858	4930598	This is true.
4959480	4973365	You know, and perhaps this is just a spot where video games just have a hard time, but there has to be some place where you can actually do meaningful experimentation, because you can't do it in the casual space.
4973385	4977386	There's just not enough, there's just not enough, you know, there's too many limits.
4978106	4984528	You know... I suppose it would be hard to convince your wife that going to see Rambo would be a good Valentine's Day present, right?
4984929	4985229	That's...
4987455	4989737	Well, I think that's also part of it.
4990177	4994681	We have an industry that's confined to the idea of hardcore and casual.
4995302	4998264	You don't hear about hardcore moviegoers, casual moviegoers.
4998284	5000926	You hear people who like action, romance.
5001407	5003809	There's very particular crowds for types of movies.
5003849	5009393	And, of course, the B-movie alien weirdness has its own following.
5010634	5013577	You need to have that sort of market presence.
5014298	5022241	Well, for lack of a better term, market segregation, demographic scanning, because casual hardcore is perhaps a little too general.
5023621	5023821	Wow.
5024201	5030064	Well, Ross DLUT, some great topics, some very deep topics you're bringing up tonight, but unfortunately we are running out of time.
5030104	5031124	We've got to wrap things up.
5031424	5034565	But thanks for your call and provoking some good discussion.
5034645	5036406	Okay, before I go, I'd like to do a plug.
5036866	5038386	Sure thing.
5038647	5040867	I've started up a YouTube channel.
5041568	5041848	Oh, really?
5041868	5042328	Yes.
5043255	5052257	YouTube.com slash user slash rawsteelut Put up a link in the chat right now.
5052357	5056098	And what will we find on said YouTube channel?
5056498	5061240	Right now it's mostly music videos that I've compiled up, but I have a few vlogs as well.
5065661	5065981	I'm sorry?
5066201	5068361	So I'm just kind of looking at some of the things that are in this.
5068381	5070762	So you kind of make your own anime music videos and stuff?
5071653	5073114	Well, gaming music video.
5073154	5073795	Oh, not anime.
5074075	5075416	GMVs, not AMVs.
5075476	5076216	GMVs, I see.
5076236	5076897	There you go.
5077057	5081160	And like I said, I also have a couple of vlogs using the PlayStation Eye, actually.
5083422	5084523	Which is quite an effort.
5085583	5086644	Well, very nice.
5087605	5088766	But I'll go into that next time.
5089126	5089386	All right.
5089446	5090047	I'll see you later.
5090067	5091428	Well, best of luck with vlogging.
5091848	5092228	Good luck.
5093569	5094030	Have a nice one.
5094050	5094230	Bye-bye.
5095411	5096311	Ross Steel, UT.
5096372	5100515	He's always kind of the devil's advocate in chat, but then when he calls in, he's the nicest guy.
5101860	5104741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5130795	5133076	There's going to be car surfing in Saints Row 2 and that's awesome.
5133556	5134636	I can't wait for Saints Row 2.
5135176	5136036	Ghost Ride the Whip.
5136436	5136677	Yes.
5137097	5142218	And apparently they have a picture where you have crashed a biplane into a building.
5143218	5144899	Or driven it through a mall.
5145039	5145459	Oh crap.
5145479	5146379	Which is even better.
5147259	5150440	So I'm all about a game that allows you to drive a plane through a mall.
5154201	5155621	We all know what's waiting to happen later on.
5155641	5157702	That's a feature they should have had in Dead Rising, right?
5158462	5158942	Hell yeah.
5159389	5159649	All right.
5161550	5164511	Puppy, thank you so much for being here tonight and participating in the show.
5164531	5166652	Talking head number three for the night.
5166752	5167232	Hooray.
5167372	5173655	Well, you'll have to come back again soon, and it's probably kind of nice not getting talked over tonight because there's a lot far less people in-house.
5173835	5176036	Yes, and I had my own microphone the entire time.
5176056	5176496	There you go.
5176896	5177156	All right.
5177176	5179497	Well, thanks for coming, and stay away from the gunshots in your neighborhood.
5180078	5180918	I will certainly try to.
5181078	5181318	All right.
5181338	5182559	We don't want to see Puppy get put down.
5182579	5183839	That would not be fun.
5186512	5189173	Do you have any final thoughts though, Puppy, real quick?
5190014	5194296	I was looking on your prize table here and saw these applications for passports.
5194316	5196357	The passport applications are not prizes.
5196397	5197257	They're just out there.
5197297	5197938	I was just making sure.
5197958	5200859	No, we're not giving out Rob's passport application as a prize.
5200939	5203741	It's just something I'm working on for a trip I want to take in June.
5204541	5207682	Which, by the way, you know how they say it takes forever to get a passport right now?
5208263	5208603	It doesn't.
5208743	5211544	My roommate went in and he got it in a week.
5212385	5212625	A week.
5213225	5213966	He's new.
5214006	5214506	Not a renewal.
5214666	5214786	New.
5215869	5218030	My brother managed to get one when he went to Italy.
5218530	5221852	It took him like a week and a half to get his when he went to Italy earlier this year.
5222012	5222472	Not bad.
5222652	5224113	But thankfully I'm not going out of the country.
5224333	5228535	I'm just going to Texas to meet for a Puzzle Pirates party.
5229755	5230056	Nerd.
5230436	5233857	I'm trying to get William to take me back to Canada because I really want to go to Canada.
5234237	5241661	I'm just trying to decide right now if it's going to be Vancouver, which I've already been to and I love, or Toronto, which I've never been to but I really want to go to.
5242381	5244362	Toronto's winning in my mind right now, but we'll see.
5245526	5246326	I went to Canada once.
5246366	5253187	I went to Victoria, and I got stuck having to go to those botanical gardens.
5253768	5255688	Hey, I love the Bouchard Gardens.
5255728	5256608	Don't you go knocking them.
5257008	5259949	Unless you go in, like, fall, then there's not a lot to see.
5261989	5266590	I think William told me he went to the Bouchard Gardens once in October, and I'm like, dude, you went at the wrong time.
5267050	5269310	Anyway, enough travel chat.
5269990	5271631	Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners?
5271791	5274151	The spin the black circle thing is...
5275080	5275861	Pretty addicting.
5276221	5277582	Except I'm on this one level.
5277602	5279263	He's been playing it all fucking night.
5279303	5281004	Hey, I have been participating, okay?
5281504	5283846	This does not take that much participation.
5283866	5291191	Hey, if he had been playing the Velociraptor Safari game, you wouldn't have heard a peep out of him, unless it was maniacal laughter.
5292591	5296175	Alright, my final thought is next week's show.
5296776	5301841	I'm actually going to be out of town because it's holiday slash anniversary weekend.
5301901	5303423	So I'm going out of town.
5304144	5307367	We may have a late start to the show because of it.
5307488	5309890	More information to come later throughout the week.
5309990	5312173	I'm not sure exactly what the plan is yet.
5312653	5313434	So there you have it.
5315286	5316848	We are looking forward to being back here next week.
5317289	5319832	Frisbee suggests I vote because of Valentine's Day this week.
5319852	5322895	We need to have William, Nellie, and Dan as guests on the show next week.
5323135	5323856	Not going to happen.
5323876	5326419	I don't think that will happen either.
5327440	5328041	It's a good thought.
5328562	5328802	All right.
5330152	5331893	That's going to do it for tonight's show.
5331933	5335515	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
5335535	5336795	You know we can't do this without you guys.
5336835	5343219	Remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show because that's the only way we get to spread the word.
5343259	5345640	We don't have any big magazines or websites that back us.
5345980	5354164	We are literally an independent operation run out of somebody's garage, and it's your voice and talking and word of mouth that helps spread the word.
5354465	5357927	Another reason to support us, we are not changing our review system to letters.
5357987	5358827	That's right, we're not.
5359267	5364049	We're going to stick with the whole vague reviews that we've always done here on the program.
5364750	5366570	Until next time, I'm Rob.
5367051	5367811	That's Loki.
5368291	5370452	She will be DarkSakura back with us next week.
5370492	5372473	We'll see you then here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5373914	5378076	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5378396	5381057	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
