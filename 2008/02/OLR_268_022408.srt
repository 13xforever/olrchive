00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,060
Today, February 24th, 2008, community games come to Xbox Live and Zune, Microsoft officially

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,140
abandons HD DVD, and Nintendo reveals that there is much more in store for the Wii Balance

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,520
board.

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,480
Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,360
Yes, we are back from an unexpected vacation last week, we'll tell you more about what's

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,380
going down in just a little bit, but it wouldn't be a show if I couldn't introduce my lovely

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,480
co-host over there as the one and only Happiest Bunny on the Farm, Ms. Dark Sakura, Jamie

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Summers.

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Yo.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
How you doing, Jamie Summers?

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm satiated.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
You're satiated?

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
That's good.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Yes.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,680
I've had a mostly unsatisfactory day as far as things to dine on.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,960
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
I've had a power bar and ice cream until this year.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
That's not healthy.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
That's all we had.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Oh, sorry to hear it.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,440
So, I'm going to be going to the store tomorrow.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
How about you, Loki?

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,080
Are you well fed today?

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
I just had McDonald's because it was on the way.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
The one and only tech master, Loki.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
You always have McDonald's.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
I don't always have McDonald's.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
You use the spice up once in a while.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
Try Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, oh, you did have Subway.

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
I don't like Carl's Jr.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Carl's Jr. is actually pretty nasty, but Jack in the Box, that's also pretty nasty.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,520
McDonald's, it's nasty, but in smaller portions, so I don't know.

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,600
Burger King, now that's the only fast food that's not so nasty.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,760
I haven't had Burger King in a long time.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I don't know.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,360
There's one really, really good thing that they would occasionally have on their menu.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
What's that?

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
I actually miss.

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
What's that?

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
Those chicken sandwiches that were on the long buns.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Oh, okay.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
You had that Italian one.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Oh, my God, that was so good.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
You know, it's so funny.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,120
We're a video game podcast, yet we keep talking about food.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
It's like the two go hand-in-hand.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm not sure.

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,520
It's because our modern society is patterned around food and feeding.

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,840
Well, hello to everybody in our chat room at chat.orangelaundryradio.com.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Also we're live on Justin TV with our webcam, and they have a chat room as well.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
We try to keep an eye on it.

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,600
It's justintv.com slash orangelaundryradio that always has the video archive of our shows.

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,960
You can see our smiling faces, or tonight, according to one of our chatters, frowning

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,120
face.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
It's a comment from a NYR fan in chat, chat.orangelaundry.com, says, Rob sounds sad this week.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm not sad.

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm just sick.

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,880
If it's not one thing, it's another.

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,400
Last week, we weren't here with the show.

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,840
What happened is that I was in Long Beach.

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
William and I were away for the weekend.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
We went to the Star Trek tour in Long Beach.

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Shut up.

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't laugh.

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
It was awesome.

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,680
But what wasn't awesome was my car breaking down over the grapevine on the way there.

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,480
So I had to find a mechanic in Long Beach Saturday morning, paid him like $450 to fix

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
my car.

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
But they did do a lot on my car.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,280
And then as I was driving home, one of the stinking lights came on again.

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,240
Something's wrong with something in the oil, and I would explain it, but it would bore

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
you to tears.

75
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,320
I've probably told like 50 different people about what's going on.

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,340
So needless to say, I couldn't rush home on Sunday, and I made it back late.

77
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,680
So unfortunately, we didn't have a show on Sunday.

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,980
And now this week, I'm sick.

79
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,240
So if it's not one thing, it's another.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,920
And then we're starting late tonight, I mean, podcast listeners, you guys don't hear a difference.

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,580
But for those listening live tonight, we're about 15 minutes late because the Wi-Fi in

82
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,620
studio wasn't working and some of our computers couldn't get online.

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,000
So it's just February's broken.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want a refund.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
And then Jamie wasn't here two weeks ago.

86
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
I mean, February's just broken.

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
That's because I was sick.

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
I know.

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
It was nasty, too.

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,200
And then we're up against the Oscars tonight.

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah, fuck them.

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Oscars suck.

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
But who cares?

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Who cares about the Oscars?

95
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
It's not even a good name.

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,320
It's not got people sucking each other's, anyway.

97
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Why do they call the Oscars anyway?

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Who's Oscar?

99
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,280
It's the award, but it's actually the Academy Awards.

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Yeah, you could probably read it on Wikipedia.

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,240
Why did they name it after somebody named Oscar?

102
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,080
I think it's short for something.

103
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,720
Oscar is short for something?

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
I don't know.

105
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,920
Let's just talk about our gaming week, shall we?

106
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,800
Let's be better than those Oscars.

107
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
How was your gaming week?

108
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,240
What games would you give an Oscar to this week, Dark Soccer?

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,200
Did some Half-Life 2 and lots of Ragnarok.

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Now I have another character over 100.

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Rebirth, by the way.

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Addict.

113
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
So.

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:45,440
And I played, I looked at my copy of Imagine Babies, laughed and put it back up.

115
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,320
And then, although it spawned an interesting conversation about whether or not you could

116
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,080
raise them like Pokemon.

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,760
And I thought it was kind of silly.

118
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:04,420
And then there was also some more burnout going on in my house, but I think that Dan's

119
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
getting tired of it.

120
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,680
I think it'd be cool, though, if you could raise them like Pokemon and then have them

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,960
fight in underground baby cage matches.

122
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,680
That would be great.

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,920
It'd be like cockfighting, but with babies, put little razor blades on their feet.

124
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,280
The babies couldn't actually fight because they don't have any motor coordination when

125
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
they're that little.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,040
That's why you pop them up on crack and then, you know.

127
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,320
You have a one-year-old battle when they're old enough to walk.

128
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah.

129
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,380
And then I played Wedding the Game, which was me just sitting there going, how much

130
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,400
more can I drink?

131
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
That's about it.

132
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,420
Let's see, this week I played a few things.

133
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,480
I got around to playing some Lost Odyssey, and that game is pretty awesome.

134
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy VIII, just not necessarily, well, I guess a little bit

135
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,520
like the gameplay, but more of just the environment reminds me of Final Fantasy VIII.

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,660
But it's good, and I like the game.

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,960
And I played more Burnout, Paradise, because it's available, and I don't know.

138
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Mainly this entire weekend, or actually the entire week for that matter, I've been trying

139
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,280
to get this other 360 of mine to work, and it's not three-ringed anymore, but it freezes

140
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
up every now and then.

141
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,680
It was freezing up after about 30 seconds when I take it to work, however before that

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,760
it would run for like nine hours straight.

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Just fine.

144
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,320
So, I got really frustrated with that, but I think I may have figured out what it was.

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,040
Maybe it's allergic to your job.

146
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
No, well, I think it would be.

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:47,000
I had these screws in it that were too large, so it was causing the board to bend too much.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
So I replaced them with some different stuff.

149
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,520
I did a 12-volt mod on the fan, and also put heat sinks on the different chips in there,

150
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,840
and made heat sinks out of pennies and aluminum tape for the bottom of the board.

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,840
So hopefully with all that stuff done, it should work.

152
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,540
If not, I've already soldered in a fan connector for additional fans, and I just found my own

153
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,840
Dremel today, so I can cut the case open to put a 120mm fan on it.

154
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,720
Other things I've been playing.

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,040
I actually was trying out, and we'll get to some of this stuff later, the XNA community

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,460
games, and they had a few that were pretty cool, some that really sucked.

157
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,120
One of which that was pretty cool was the dishwasher.

158
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
I knew it would be the dishwasher.

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
That game was awesome.

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,040
The minute I played that game, I was like, this is Loki's dream game right here.

161
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,880
This is not my dream game, but it totally could be a TV series or something like that.

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
It was just really, really cool.

163
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
Something you would see on Adult Swim.

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
But absolutely bloody game.

165
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,920
It kind of reminds me a little bit also of Alien Hominid or something like that.

166
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,800
That's the exact same thing I thought.

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,920
That's so funny.

168
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,040
But less shooting, more slashing with swords and stuff.

169
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Other things I tried, I tried Gummy Car or Jelly Car, where the fuck it was called.

170
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
It was okay.

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I didn't really, I mean it was a neat idea, but not executed too well.

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,040
You know what makes Jelly Car hilarious is when you realize that all the noises or some

173
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,280
guy doing it in his microphone, like, boop boop boop boop boop, meow meow meow meow.

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
That's great.

175
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,880
I laughed my ass off playing Jelly Car.

177
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,640
It's very customizable, with its little completely different looks, like you can play the blueprint

178
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,320
looking things or the, you can kind of completely change the look of the game and the options.

179
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Check it out.

180
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Oh, I didn't even play with the options.

181
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,760
Oh yeah, you can mess with the options and make the game look completely different.

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
It's great.

183
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
That's cool.

184
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,240
Other than that though, it was alright.

185
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,920
Some of the levels seemed kind of broken, but whatever.

186
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,040
Then there was Culture, which was neat.

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,800
I don't know, it's an interesting puzzle game, I guess, with flowers.

188
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
Pretty flowers.

189
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,000
And then, gosh, I played that, was it Little Gamers, I think it was called?

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,100
That was okay.

191
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,480
That's actually just based off of a webcomic, I guess.

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,520
And it was okay, but it just reminded me a lot of, like, there wasn't a lot of movement

193
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
or dodging you can do.

194
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,120
It was just kind of shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, and very bloody.

195
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,560
But hey, that's cool.

196
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,980
And I don't know, that was pretty much it though.

197
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,160
There were some games that they showed off at Game Developers Conference that I wish

198
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:39,240
were on there, like iSheep or, what was it, there was a dancing one, like a breakdancing

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
thing.

200
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,320
Now, wait a minute, did you, and I'm sorry, I ran in the house and you were talking about

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,680
your game a week, but I didn't hear anything about N. Didn't you play N this week on X

202
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Motion Life?

203
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
No.

204
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
I thought you loved that game.

205
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
I love N, but I haven't gotten a chance to download it, and I really, I mean, I've played

206
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,000
it before, so, you know, it's not, it's not like I'm, I don't know, I don't know what

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it is.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,320
Also, finally, I was going to say I played Space Invaders Extreme, I actually was playing

209
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,740
that this afternoon, and awesome game.

210
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,240
Really needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game or something like that, and it's coming out

211
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,840
the DS and on PSP as well, so, absolutely cool.

212
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,600
All the stuff in the game kind of goes with the music, like when you're firing and stuff,

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,640
it's all in time with the music, and, you know, stuff kind of remixes a little bit,

214
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,720
a little like Musaguchi and stuff.

215
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,240
They have little bonus things that go in there, plus the backgrounds are all really flashy

216
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
and stuff.

217
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
It'll be cool.

218
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Definitely worth picking up when it comes out.

219
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
So you're all done with your gaming week?

220
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Yes.

221
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,400
Then I will move on to mine, because I just want to say I did play N this week on Xbox

222
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,360
360, and it was kind of cool, well, at least I should clarify, I only played the demo,

223
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,280
I didn't play the full version, I don't want to give the false impression or anything,

224
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,400
but I played the demo of N, because I remember Loki spoke very highly of this game, and I

225
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,560
remember playing it a little bit on the free web thing or whatever.

226
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,380
Here's the problem I had with N, is that I played it after I played those Xbox community

227
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,560
games, and I was kind of playing it going, you know what, I don't think I want to spend

228
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,360
$10 on this, especially after just playing those other things that are potentially, I

229
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,440
mean I guess we don't know much about pricing, I think we'll get into it later in the show,

230
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,520
but potentially these other games are going to be free or, you know, very low cost.

231
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,220
And if you haven't tried those Xbox Live community games, I recommend doing that, since they

232
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,400
are timed demos.

233
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,000
But I think, and it's kind of fun, I just think $800 is the wrong price point, I think

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
$400 would have been a little more appropriate, I probably would have bought it for $400,

235
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,160
especially when you consider it's based off a free web game, just, I don't know, I feel

236
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
like I've played a lot of free games on the web like it, although there's a certain sense

237
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
of humor to N that I think is really funny, like I watch, I like watching a little stick

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,440
guy get blown to bits, and it certainly has a very, you know, kind of action pace, I just,

239
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,280
I don't know, in this day of those microtransactions, you really kind of think about every point,

240
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,200
and I just don't think it was worth $800.

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,520
Something that was money well spent, I am madly in love with Lost Odyssey, this is the

242
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,580
game I have totally been waiting for on the 360, and I know, you know, I'm going to admit,

243
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,600
I am kind of biased, well I don't want to say I'm biased, but I definitely have a preference

244
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,520
towards Japanese RPGs, that's no big secret, those are the type of games I like, I don't

245
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,400
play a lot of sports games, I like these type of games, and so, you know, the Xbox 360 has

246
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,240
been sorely lacking in this department, we've had Blue Dragon, which was, eh, it was okay,

247
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,360
but it wasn't great, it was a good game, not a great game, and then we had Enchanted Arms,

248
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,120
same thing, decent, I think better than a lot of people gave it credit for, but it started

249
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,960
to get a little monotonous towards the end, Lost Odyssey, I'm loving it, like, it's tearing

250
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,760
me away from wow, which is saying something, you know, because you hear about how much

251
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,160
I've been playing World of Warcraft lately and doing this stuff, I cannot put down Lost

252
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,840
Odyssey, and it's funny because I've been reading reviews, because I'm kind of curious,

253
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,440
I usually don't read a lot of reviews on the internet, but I was kind of curious what the

254
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,200
critics think of Lost Odyssey, and I was very surprised to see on Metacritic that the game

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,040
only has like a 76 or something like that, I am shocked!

256
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,040
This is like an old school RPG, you know, it's so old, everyone's complaining that it's

257
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,040
like very old, but yet when you go back to the RPGs of the past, like all the Final Fantasy

258
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,520
games, they really didn't change much between each other, and you don't have to innovate

259
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,920
on something, don't try and reinvent it if it's good in the first place.

260
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,640
And here, here's a comment in chat I have to respond to, chat.orgiliterator.com, rawstealut

261
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,560
says, so Sky likes games that are all the same, no, that's your perception of these

262
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,480
types of games, I look at sports games, I look at these Madden games, and I go, pfft,

263
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,080
they're all the same to me, these games are all the same.

264
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,920
It's the story that go along with it, I mean it's not necessarily the combat and stuff,

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,760
it's just kind of, yeah, it's fun, or you know, it's grinding or whatever, but, um...

266
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,200
You know, and I've heard people say it reminded them too much of Final Fantasy, and I'll admit,

267
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,160
there's a lot in this game that reminds me of Final Fantasy X, I wouldn't call it Final

268
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,480
Fantasy VIII because it has a good combat system on like VIII, Final Fantasy X it really

269
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
reminds me of.

270
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I like the combat system.

271
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,960
And you know, it does, it innovates it on it enough, where like, I love the ring thing

272
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,680
because it makes you pay attention to kind of what's going on, you know, to make sure

273
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,760
you get the perfect hits and all that stuff, and the game is just gorgeous, it is like

274
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,240
playing a Final Fantasy type game on a next-gen system, but without a whiny, spiky-haired

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,120
guy as the lead character, instead you get more of a, you know, badass, not gonna talk

276
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
type guy.

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Besides, I don't know if you heard, and I'm pretty sure this is not in the show role,

278
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,840
but Final Fantasy XIII, what, Spring 2010 is when they said?

279
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,160
So I'm glad we have games like this to hold this over.

280
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Exactly.

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,420
You know, if you enjoy Japanese RPGs in the slightest, you are doing yourself a disservice

282
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,800
by not at least checking out Lost Odyssey.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,960
Don't listen to reviewers, because their big complaints are, they don't like these type

284
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,600
of games in the first place, which, fine, this game is not gonna win you over to the

285
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,680
Japanese RPG world, it's not, so, you know, if you already, if you don't like the Final

286
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Fantasy games, you're not gonna like this.

287
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,240
That's why they have places that rent games, because, you know, just because one guy doesn't

288
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
like it doesn't mean you should base your opinion on that one guy, I mean, you know,

289
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,240
some of these reviews I read are just like, oh, well, this game's been done so many times,

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
that's why I hate it.

291
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
No?

292
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Well, who cares?

293
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Action movies.

294
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,080
Oh my god, it's an action movie with guns in it.

295
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh, should I not go see it, because this one had guns too?

296
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,240
It's just beautiful to watch.

297
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,440
My roommate who doesn't play a lot of games, you know, he's, the game he's been playing

298
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
a lot lately is Cold Sep Saga, that's the one game he's been getting really into lately,

299
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,600
because he likes the more puzzle-type games, but he's been watching me play Lost Odyssey,

300
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,080
and he's always kind of, like, appreciated the Fantasy games too, and he's just like,

301
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
this game is outstanding.

302
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,880
He's just like, the way it moves, and we were kind of talking about it, the fluidity of

303
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,000
the game and the way the battle systems just look gorgeous, the in-game battles are phenomenal.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,680
So I totally like this game, I love this game, you know, and I will kind of put this out

305
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,320
there as a disclaimer, I'm only about eight hours in, I haven't had a chance to really

306
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,380
fully immerse myself.

307
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,180
It could be one of those games that gets shitty and monotonous as it goes on, that is a possibility,

308
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,160
but for right now, I'm saying there's money well spent, and I fully enjoy the eight hours

309
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,000
I've put in so far, which is more than some games I've dropped six months on.

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,360
My only gripe in the game is these dreams that you have, which are basically reading

311
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,040
a bunch of text, and there's no real cutscene, I would think with a game that, you know,

312
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,040
is four to slong, that they would at least do some sort of cutscene with the in-game

313
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
engine.

314
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,840
It doesn't necessarily have to be like, you know, that detail or something, but seriously,

315
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,640
I don't want to read, you know, all this stuff in the game, and I know it's optional to get

316
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
some of the backstory stuff, but...

317
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
You know what's funny?

318
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Have you actually read it, though?

319
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Have you actually read it?

320
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I have read it.

321
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,080
I thought the writing was amazing in those little stories, and I kind of get it, though,

322
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,320
I think I would like to see maybe a little more of the animation side, but I don't know,

323
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,000
there's something about that whole using your imagination book thing, you know, that you

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
don't really see in video games.

325
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I don't know.

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I kind of don't mind.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,000
Like, if they did the cutscenes more like, you know, folklore a little bit, where it's

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,360
actually like a comic book and stuff, in fact, that's how I remember they were describing

329
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,000
the cutscenes in, or at least the dreams and stuff in this game, and there is actually

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,200
a part where you do have a dream, and it is a cutscene, that kind of thing, but I would

331
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,480
have appreciated it more like that, you know, it doesn't even have to be anything, it'd

332
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,760
be just still pictures or whatever, just a little bit more effort put into it other than

333
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,920
just having text.

334
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,220
One more fangasm over this game and then I promise I'll shut up, and you can send your

335
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,120
emails about what a fanboy I am, okay, the voice acting in this game is actually really

336
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,580
good, and I'm using the English soundtrack, shock and awe, like, English voice acting

337
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,160
in these games is usually pretty terrible, but I actually think it's very well voice

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,440
acted so far, I am, I'm like, just shocked, so, and my roommate had said the same thing,

339
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,220
he's like, wow, the voice acting is actually pretty good, the comic relief guy especially

340
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,000
is pretty funny, and I, just the way the cutscenes are done, all the comic book stars are, I

341
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,300
could sit here for an hour and have a fangasm about how wonderful I think Lost Odyssey is,

342
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,080
but I'm gonna play it more, and I'll let you know if it starts sucking, okay, I'll keep

343
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,800
an open mind about it, but, whatever, I'm totally fanboy over this game, I'll admit

344
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
it.

345
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,320
I've also been playing the same XNA games that Loki earlier spoke of, and I'll wait

346
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,340
for more thoughts on that when we get to the stories tonight, otherwise I've been playing

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
Wow!

348
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,240
X-Saga as well, I mentioned that a little earlier, my roommate's been playing a lot

349
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,560
of that, but I have two, just a real different kind of game, still think they could've pulled

350
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,300
it off on Xbox Live Arcade and it would've been better suited for that, but, it's kinda

351
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,900
one of those games that's really hard to put down, but, I, seriously, rounds in Cold

352
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,440
Step Saga can go on for like an hour and a half, it's crazy, but I'm having a good time.

353
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,040
I guess I'll do it for my gaming week, I don't have a lot else to share, so, then let's get

354
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,880
to tonight's housekeeping, we wanted to formally apologize for last week's show, or lack thereof,

355
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,240
you know, what can we say, get what you pay for, it's a free show, so sorry, and we're

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,360
here tonight, and actually, I gotta admit, tonight we're only gonna do a short show,

357
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,200
we're gonna do like, just one part, there's not gonna be part A, part B, just because

358
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,720
of the fact I'm sick, I'm having a hard time being here, any other week, probably would've

359
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,980
just canceled it, but we didn't wanna go two weeks without a show, because consistency

360
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,280
is important, and a lot of, not a lot, but sometimes I've been asked by other podcasters

361
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,200
like what, you know, because we've been doing this for like, we've been podcasting ever

362
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,600
since, you know, it was first out pretty much, and we've been doing internet radio for six

363
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
years and people say, you know, what's your trick, what do you do to keep listeners, I'm

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,760
always like consistency, it's all about consistency, if you're not consistent, then people will

365
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,840
go look elsewhere, I mean, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, because there's lots

366
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,360
of great independent shows out there, but that's how you lose listeners, is that if

367
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,280
you're inconsistent, then people look elsewhere to fill in time, so I hate, I hate missing

368
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,620
a show, but it had to be done, so, that's that, otherwise, you can join our Myspace

369
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,560
community at Orange Launch Radio, our Facebook community is the OLRME, and our LiveJournal

370
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,460
community is Orange Launch, one other thing I wanna plug, completely has nothing to do

371
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,880
with video games, but it's another passion of mine, something I've been getting into

372
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,320
over the past six months is these ORGs, these online reality games, where people play games

373
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,680
based on reality shows on web forums, if that makes sense, there's a lot of strategy involved,

374
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,460
if you're like into the strategical thinking that goes behind a lot of shows, such as like

375
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,680
Survivor and Big Brother and all those, you know, types of shows that are on TV, these

376
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,040
games are a lot of fun, and I've met a lot of really interesting people playing them,

377
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,600
I am gonna be hosting a game on LiveJournal, I'm actually co-hosting with somebody you

378
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,400
might recognize from this show, Shane, so if you want more information on that, we're

379
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,000
looking for some new players, people that might be into this, so if this sounds like

380
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,700
something you might be into, it's certainly much different from a video game, but check

381
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,360
it out, we're taking applications right now, it's SurvivorLJ, just ran that all together,

382
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,440
SurvivorLJ.LiveJournal.com, so there you go, I hope some of you guys will check that out,

383
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,360
maybe sign up to play, LiveJournal's free and all that good stuff, you do have to have

384
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,840
a LiveJournal account to play, but they're all like free, and many of us use it, and

385
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,480
we've been on there for a long time.

386
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,640
Okay, I will shut up now and do some video game news, actually I'm not gonna shut up

387
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,680
because I'm doing video game news, but I'll shut up about my personal life.

388
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,280
First off, I want to cover some things we missed last week since we didn't have a show

389
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,240
last week, some of the stories we missed last week, one of them is a rumor that Netflix

390
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,120
is soon going to be streaming to the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, and this is based

391
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,000
off some type of survey that Netflix has been conducting recently, and the question that

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,640
was in the survey was this, quote, if as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly

393
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,960
watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS3 or Xbox 360, how likely would you

394
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,480
or anyone in your household be able to do that?

395
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,840
Hmm, so who knows about that?

396
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,340
Rumor says that there could be a special Netflix disc that could cost as little as $3 will

397
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,000
enable this all to work.

398
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,320
So I don't know, this could be interesting.

399
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It's not too incredibly surprising when you consider Netflix is already doing those PC

400
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,760
downloads where you can watch the movies if you have a Netflix account on your PC.

401
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,300
This seems like a logical next step, but then again, would Microsoft and Sony want to lose

402
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,400
those dollars if they could pocket themselves?

403
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,560
I don't know, but it would be a very formidable alliance.

404
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,940
EA is rumored to be working on The Sims 3, and this is actually not a rumor because that's

405
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,400
according to The Sims studio creative director Rod Humble, and this was on the forum called

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Quarter to Three.

407
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,520
He says, Rod Humble says there will be new information soon.

408
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,400
In other news, Madden 2010, scheduled for next year.

409
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,640
I know, it's kind of obvious news when you think about it, but at the same time it's

410
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,400
been a while since I've heard anything about The Sims.

411
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Anything that ever was kind of like Sims news was another expansion for an existing Sims

412
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
game.

413
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,600
They should have Sims 3 where I can import my Spore characters and attack the Sims characters.

414
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,040
Yet another way to kill Sims.

415
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,720
I would like to see if Sims 3 comes to light, maybe some type of link between the PC and

416
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
the consoles.

417
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I don't know.

418
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
Maybe that's just the console fan in me, because The Sims is kind of at heart a PC game, even

419
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,920
though they've had all those spin-offs on systems and such.

420
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,560
The Sims is kind of a PC game, but it would be kind of neat.

421
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm all about connectivity between all the crap I have and my friends have.

422
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,840
One other story we missed last week, which I think is kind of funny, there are some filmmakers

423
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,640
that are going to be producing a documentary about the E.T. landfill.

424
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,000
For a quote from the Auburn University students who are putting this together, quote, we are

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
proud to announce our upcoming documentary, E.T.'s March.

426
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,280
Over the course of a week this March, we will go on a road trip from Auburn, Alabama to

427
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,980
El Paso, Texas.

428
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,640
From there, we will take the actual path of those 14 trucks took that faithful day into

429
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,040
the heart of Alamogordo, New Mexico.

430
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,240
Along the way, we will take in the video game culture of our great country.

431
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,240
The documentary will be released for free via the internet this summer.

432
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,140
I almost went to school there.

433
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,440
I think it's kind of interesting that they're going to make a whole documentary about this.

434
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,800
Of course, video game documentaries, King of Kong did very well.

435
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Who knows?

436
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
The DVD should be out now, I think.

437
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
It is out.

438
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I still haven't seen it.

439
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I haven't.

440
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I still haven't seen it.

441
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I need to borrow it.

442
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
It's an interesting watch.

443
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I need Netflix it or something.

444
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I really want to see it.

445
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,160
I feel like I'm totally missing something.

446
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
I'll loan it.

447
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay, cool.

448
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
I'll also loan you this other one I have that's really stupid.

449
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,120
It's about the first, they claim they're the first ever internet radio show about games.

450
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,000
It's uber stupid.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I actually watch the DVD.

452
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,440
It's a game review show.

453
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
It's lame.

454
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Oh, whatever.

455
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,480
Let's get to this week's news.

456
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,760
That's all I really want to touch on from last week.

457
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,720
Last week, actually, ironically enough, was a little bit of a slow news week because this

458
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,820
week we started getting into Game Developers Conference and some big bombshells dropped

459
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
at GDC.

460
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Correct?

461
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
Yes.

462
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,760
Unfortunately, this year they didn't have keynotes from a bunch of other people like

463
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,600
Nintendo and Sony and stuff like that, but Microsoft was there and they were doing their

464
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
keynote.

465
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,360
Their big thing they announced, of course, was the Xbox Live Community Arcade.

466
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,540
It will be kind of an easy way for people that develop games in XNA to share their games

467
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,080
with the world.

468
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,120
It'll allow people that are members of, I think, live, I'm not sure if it's just the

469
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,080
XNA community, to rate their games and basically give feedback and that kind of stuff.

470
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,360
Also, they will be able to sell their games or offer them free and that kind of stuff.

471
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,320
Tons and tons and tons of stuff out there.

472
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Of course, they said, now 10 million people on Xbox Live get to play your game.

473
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,420
It's all user created content.

474
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:48,560
They put up a brief sampling of about nine games or so on there, including some of what

475
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,740
we talked about, Jelly Car and Dishwasher and stuff like that.

476
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,920
Pretty cool stuff and very exciting, especially if you're into game development and stuff

477
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
in XNA.

478
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,360
As far as I'm aware, I think the software is free and all you have to do is pay for

479
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,680
the membership if you want to upload your games, $100 a year.

480
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,960
So if you're really interested in that stuff, I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will probably all

481
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
over this kind of thing.

482
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,360
I seem to recall he was creating some type of Crazy Eights game from what I was following

483
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,640
on a show, but who knows?

484
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,480
Now maybe that he'll be able to post it to the world, he might finish that up.

485
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I don't know.

486
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
I'll have to ask him.

487
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
It'll be a little while.

488
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,720
And then, of course, other things that they announced to go along with that is that you

489
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,920
will finally be able to game on your Zune as well.

490
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,880
They're going to allow XNA games to come to the Zune and you'll be able to play them kind

491
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,840
of similar to playing stuff on an iPod or something like that.

492
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,720
And they said, of course, XNA Zune games can also support custom soundtracks since it is

493
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,800
an MP3 player and you'll be able to take your games from Windows to Xbox to Zune.

494
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,440
And you haven't really announced anything else additional to that.

495
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
Now, I don't know if it's just me.

496
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,920
This news is fucking huge, this news.

497
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
This is huge.

498
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:10,120
I think a lot of us saw this coming, but I kind of see this as kind of a turning point

499
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,600
in gaming and I think this is what is going to set the Xbox 360 really apart from its

500
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,120
competitors right now.

501
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
You know what I mean?

502
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Well, they said also...

503
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I think this is huge news.

504
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,360
They said at the end of this year they're going to have 1,000 games on Xbox 360 and

505
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,120
that's not including the Xbox Live community games.

506
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,040
You know what this is?

507
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,000
This is YouTube, but with video games.

508
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah, it's YouTube of games that they were...

509
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
And that's kind of what it's going to turn into.

510
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,160
And I know people's opinions is that a lot of the user stuff is crap.

511
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,920
You know, a lot of user-made stuff is crap and you look on YouTube and yeah, a lot of

512
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
YouTube is crap.

513
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,480
There's 14-year-old girls doing their blogs and shit.

514
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
No one wants to watch that.

515
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,200
I understand that a lot of it's crap, but you know, at the same time I think these people

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
are actually...

517
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
I mean, YouTube is free.

518
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,640
Any idiot with a camera can go and shoot something and throw it up on YouTube.

519
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,360
This you actually pay membership, you know, you have to have the tools to develop the

520
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
games and stuff like that.

521
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,500
You have to be somewhat intelligent to even do this.

522
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,140
It's not an easy thing to just throw something together and put it on there and stuff.

523
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,240
I would be really interested to see this stuff on here because a lot of it is going to be

524
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
independent games.

525
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,200
You're going to have people that are developing some of these free web games to put it on

526
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,280
there now and they can make a little bit of money off of it and that kind of stuff.

527
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,000
I think that's great and also at the same time, it's something that Sony or Nintendo

528
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,540
doesn't have that they can brag about.

529
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,940
This is something you can play these games if you want.

530
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,460
They're optional, obviously, but on top of the two games that we get released each week

531
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,500
on Xbox Live Arcade, now you're going to have a ton of these games that are going to be

532
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,000
available on there and yes, some of them will be crap, but you know what?

533
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,280
That's why you can do your research out there.

534
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,060
Obviously, they will not be requiring demos, I don't think, for these things, but some

535
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:57,980
of them will have demos available so you can test them out and plus also read the ratings.

536
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,680
For those that say that the user-created games are crap, fucking go check out that Dishwasher

537
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,480
game and the Jelly Car game.

538
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,180
Put it next to some of the things that they're actually charging money for on Xbox Live Marketplace.

539
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,340
They've got some crappy games on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

540
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,760
There is certainly some good stuff that can come of this, absolutely, and there's a lot

541
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,040
of great independent games that, you know, so I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot

542
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,520
of crap that you're going to have to weed through, but I think this whole community

543
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,260
kind of aspect of it where it's the peer review, I think that's kind of a smart way to kind

544
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
of weed it out.

545
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Not everything independent is crap either.

546
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,660
I mean, look at, you know, N Plus started off as an independent game.

547
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,040
You have two Mickey Fighters, that started off as an independent game.

548
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,640
You have, you know, Everyday Shooter.

549
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,340
Just a ton of stuff out there that, you know, was independent stuff is now becoming mainstream

550
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,060
and it's not bad.

551
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,200
It's just, you know, a lot of times it costs a lot of these people a lot of money to develop

552
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,920
these games and if they don't have a lot of money to put into them, they can't, you know,

553
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
get a wide release for them.

554
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,660
Now, this is allowing people that may not have the funds to advertise their game or

555
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,880
do anything like that to do a lot smaller scale and, you know, advertise their stuff

556
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,760
on websites and that kind of thing and then throw it on this, you know, community arcade

557
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,220
and have a lot of people actually get to play their game instead of just not ever hearing

558
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,220
about it.

559
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,060
And I do think that the fact that these games are going to be playable on Zune, I think

560
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,140
that's huge too because I think Microsoft can really be positioning themselves to do

561
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,260
a game handheld if they want.

562
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,220
Imagine if Microsoft releases a portable gaming handheld, not necessarily a Zune, but something

563
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,580
that is more along, you know, is strictly a gaming machine, imagine they release it

564
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,200
and they support XNA on this handheld, boom, this thing comes out, it instantly supports

565
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,560
thousands of games that you can get, I mean, that's what I think is big and I kind of see

566
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,440
like this could be Microsoft positioning the chess pieces and kind of seeing how much this

567
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,180
takes off.

568
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,460
How many people do this and put this on their Zune?

569
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,060
How many kind of get into this whole thing?

570
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,760
So I kind of think this is big news and we're really looking down the next couple years

571
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
of gaming.

572
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,540
Maybe I'm running around screaming like a lunatic cultist, which is fine, but I think

573
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,700
this is huge and I look forward to seeing some of the games that are going to come out

574
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
from this.

575
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,700
What do you think they would call it if they did a Microsoft handheld?

576
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,940
A Microsoft handheld system?

577
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Yeah.

578
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:29,120
The, not the Xbox, but the X brick, no, I don't know, I have no idea, X game, I have

579
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
no idea.

580
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,360
It could be like the X paper, I don't know.

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,740
Paper, rock, scissors, I don't know.

582
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
X book says frisbee.

583
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
That's kind of funny.

584
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,120
Yes, make it sound like a Mac product.

585
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
There you go.

586
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,160
I'd sell it.

587
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,160
You never know.

588
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,480
What about something like Xbox Go?

589
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,420
Something really quick to the point, Xbox Go, doesn't that make you, doesn't that kind

590
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,860
of have the ring of, hey, it's an Xbox product, but you go and you take it places.

591
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,740
I think that's a fine name.

592
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,980
I'm going to trademark that name right now so Microsoft can't use it.

593
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
Just kidding.

594
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,620
Well, I have some interesting news, and you know, everybody, well, for the most part loves

595
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Portal.

596
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,620
It's been a big, big internet phenomenon, especially with that psychotic song at the

597
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:23,020
end of the game that's so funny, but that song, Still Alive, is going to be in a rock

598
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,860
band.

599
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,260
That's cool.

600
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,380
This was a triumph.

601
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,060
Now we've got to get Mo back.

602
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Yeah.

603
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,260
You realize we've got to download this song.

604
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,220
See, we've got a whole band going right here.

605
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,780
Loki can play the drums.

606
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
You enjoy bass, right?

607
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
You can play bass.

608
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
I'll play whatever guitar.

609
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,860
Actually, I usually play the drums when we play at the house.

610
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,340
Well, then you two can fight over it.

611
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
I don't really care.

612
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,540
I'll play regular guitar.

613
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I'm just not singing.

614
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,700
Well, Mo can sing because she's got a pretty voice.

615
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,900
She can do the singing, and we'll have ourselves a little OLR house band.

616
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
It'll be fun.

617
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,180
And you know what?

618
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,860
Maybe by the time that comes out, we'll have the rock band stage kit, and we can have the

619
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
smoke and the lights.

620
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Hell yeah.

621
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Rob almost snorted his coffee.

622
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,740
Are you really wasting money on that stage kit?

623
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,980
I want to get it because it sounds so stupid that I have to get it.

624
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,620
It's one of those things.

625
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,940
I'm not spending money on it.

626
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,460
I'll use store credit, obviously.

627
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,460
That is money that you could spend on something more better.

628
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
More better.

629
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Yes, more better.

630
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
Okay.

631
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
I'm sick.

632
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,620
Leave me alone.

633
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,380
I spend money on stupid things, though.

634
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,380
I don't know.

635
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,580
I'll have to look at it to see what it is, because if it's something really retarded,

636
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,260
I don't know if it works out.

637
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,540
Now the chat room is up in arms.

638
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Loki must sing.

639
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Loki must sing.

640
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Can I finish my story?

641
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Loki must play vocals.

642
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
Yes, you may.

643
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
Okay.

644
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,660
Well, it was also stated, though, that they've confirmed that another portal is in the works.

645
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,540
In fact, the words Portal 2 were actually used.

646
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,260
In other news, Madden 2010, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts III, and all these other

647
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
games confirmed.

648
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,500
Well, here's the thing about, you know, the Portal 2 thing.

649
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,260
It was kind of like, you know, her comment was, oh, I think that they've announced this

650
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
already.

651
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,460
She didn't say that, you know, they have, but obviously they're going to make a Portal

652
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
2, duh.

653
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,580
I mean, oh my god, a sequel to a game that made a lot of money?

654
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,580
Hmm.

655
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,900
I always think it's funny that it was a throwaway to begin with, pretty much, wasn't it?

656
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,220
I mean, it was more of a nod to an old project.

657
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Yeah, really.

658
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,860
Well, I think it's because we all know it's coming.

659
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Hello.

660
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,740
I mean, Portal, little game with not that big a budget, I don't think, has humongous

661
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,420
success and practically a cult following, duh, it's going to have a sequel.

662
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,580
It's kind of last year's Katamari Damacy.

663
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,540
Let's just hope they don't run it into the ground like they did Katamari.

664
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
That's my only concern.

665
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,500
Like, can too much Portal be too much of a good thing?

666
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Absolutely.

667
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,340
Too much Portal when you're intoxicated is too much of a good thing.

668
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,180
I fully support Portal 2, but when we start getting, you know, Portal DS, Portal PSP,

669
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
Portal your brain out.

670
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
Could you imagine Portal DS?

671
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,940
Yeah, it would be all sorts of lame.

672
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,300
Yeah, no, I just stick to the formula that works, make little improvements as you need

673
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,580
to, that's fine.

674
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,940
How about multiplayer Portal?

675
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,340
There you go, might be kind of fun.

676
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,580
That would be a processing nightmare.

677
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,420
Just put a giant knife on the end of the Portal gun, there you go.

678
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Yeah.

679
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Portal deathmatch.

680
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Giant bayonet.

681
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,460
Imagine what a Portal deathmatch would be like.

682
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
With no actual...

683
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Confusing as hell.

684
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,780
With no actual weapon.

685
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:41,180
Of course, the comparison between Portal and Katamari leads AJ Mix in our chatroom to say,

686
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
me and my Portal.

687
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
That would be cute.

688
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,620
Active Dad says, Portal 5 Disney Edition.

689
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,020
Oh lordy.

690
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
We'll see what happens.

691
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,940
A game that I'm kind of looking forward to, strangely enough, Fable 2, even though the

692
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,020
first one kind of lost interest in that for a little while.

693
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
I'm all over this game.

694
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,260
I am all over some of these more recent announcements.

695
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,000
You know, I think this is great, and one of the huge things that they announced in Fable

696
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,820
2, co-op play.

697
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,620
It's pretty big for a somewhat role-playing adventure game.

698
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,900
You get co-op play, so if you and someone else own Fable 2, you can suddenly go into

699
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,660
their single-player world, do your thing, and then leave.

700
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
Kind of like the...

701
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Do they spread rumors about them?

702
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,940
Well, the same idea, like in Crackdown.

703
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,260
If somebody's playing the game, you just kind of hop in and join, hello, and leave.

704
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:38,500
Well, the demo that they showed, actually, Jamie, the woman, or Peter's character, who

705
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,660
was a woman, her husband was kind of pissing this other guy off, so he shot him in the

706
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
head with a gun.

707
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
That's great.

708
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:52,140
And now, you know, his character's child or whatever will be put into an orphanage, seriously,

709
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,300
and you can visit and stuff.

710
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
That's crazy.

711
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,900
I just hope it's one of those things that doesn't sound really good, and then the execution

712
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
of it is kind of...

713
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,420
Because, like, to me, that was kind of the first Fable game.

714
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,180
I'm like, this sounds great, and then I played it, and I'm like, this plays mediocre.

715
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,180
It's going to be awesome.

716
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,700
I kind of hope that it's...

717
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:16,860
Yeah, I have very high hopes, so I'm hoping I'm not let down, but I am a little bit worried.

718
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,460
Also, you know, you have the little doggy companion that follows you and all that good

719
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:29,500
stuff, and also, this is big, Xbox Live mini-game that will interact with the full Fable 2 game.

720
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,580
In other words, I guess it's some type of, like, little gambling game that you can play,

721
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,760
and they're actually going to release this game a couple weeks before Fable 2 actually

722
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,540
hits shelves, so you can actually start building gold in the gambling game that you will be

723
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,940
able to spend in Fable 2.

724
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,300
Yeah, it's a game that they had in the first Fable game.

725
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:50,180
It was called Keystones, like, compared to Craps meets Roulette, and yeah, you can earn

726
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,220
lots of money and be rich and stuff.

727
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,180
What's also cool, though, when you're doing co-op, you actually earn experience, and you

728
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,900
split your golden items, and when you're, like, introducing someone into the co-op game,

729
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,040
you can decide on what the split is going to be like.

730
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,740
If you want to, say, for example, help someone out, you could give them 100% of the gold

731
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,820
and 100% of, you know, item drops or whatever, or you can do 50-50, so that's kind of neat.

732
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,780
What would happen, though, if a really high-level advanced character came into your world and

733
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,820
gave you an Uber sword?

734
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,900
Is there anything to safeguard the game from essentially cheating like that?

735
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,340
I don't know about that, but, you know, if it's like some Final Fantasy games, you can

736
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,020
only be, you have to be a certain level before you can use, you know, X sword, but yeah,

737
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
I mean, sure, why not.

738
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,540
Anything back to the first Fable, it's been so long.

739
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,780
It's what we did in Crackdown, you know, someone would come in with a rocket launcher and give

740
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,560
it to you, and there you go, now you have a rocket launcher, it makes the game a hell

741
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,620
lot easier, so.

742
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,460
Well, I'm looking forward to this game and checking it out, that's pretty cool, and I,

743
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,000
it's kind of funny, the whole Xbox Live connection, you know what it reminds me of?

744
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,220
It reminds me of the Pocket Station, like, remember Chocobo Breeding and Final, or, it

745
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,780
wasn't Chocobo Breeding, it was some type of, like, raise your Chocobo, like, a Tamagotchi

746
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,140
type thing that you could have on a little Pocket Station for Final Fantasy VIII?

747
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Yes.

748
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,420
Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that, but instead of something in your pocket on the go, it's

749
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
Xbox Live.

750
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,460
I don't know, I don't know, that's the comparison I get in my mind.

751
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,280
The great thing about the Pocket Station game is it'll play itself, so all you have to do

752
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,820
is just leave it on a Playstation system and just leave it, like, running for days at a

753
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
time.

754
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,340
Boom, you come back and you have, like, thousands of items.

755
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Awesome.

756
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,700
Nice, well I'm looking forward to Fable 2.

757
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Another game that's coming out here pretty soon in the US will be Wii Fit.

758
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,540
Nintendo has officially announced a date for it, it's going to be coming out May 19th,

759
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:44,060
and also around the same time the WiiWare service will be launching in the US, May 12th,

760
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,020
and they did have a press release and stuff, of course, you know, this game is insanely

761
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:55,880
popular in Japan right now, just absolutely selling millions of copies, and I'm sure we'll

762
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,180
do the same over here, just, you know, leave them to announce...

763
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,540
It's going to keep Wii Mania alive in soccer mom's households.

764
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just leave them to announce another...

765
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
See, I knew this was coming out this time, in fact, you know, I know when some other

766
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,840
games are coming out, but I can't say that, but yeah, Wii Fit's going to be doing awesome

767
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,740
and there'll be some other games before it that'll be even more awesome, so...

768
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,260
I'm looking in the chat room and, let's see, who called it Wii Fat?

769
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,500
Somebody called it Wii Fat, I think it was GS68, somebody...

770
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,420
It'd be like an eating game.

771
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,260
Yeah, eat as much as you can, then get on the balance board, and then I'm very happy

772
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,900
that we finally have a date for WiiWare, finally, kind of after all this speculation, oh, it's

773
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,660
going to be out last Christmas, oh, I guess first quarter, oh, second quarter, now we

774
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,220
have a date, so that's finally when Nintendo will kind of be, you know, showing us what

775
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
they have there.

776
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,500
Get on board with what everyone else has been doing for years already.

777
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,140
In a way, but, you know, I don't know, Nintendo often can surprise, you know, they can do

778
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,460
this shit later and sometimes surprise us, so we'll see, we'll see, it all depends on

779
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,460
the quality of the games, in my opinion.

780
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,140
Well, it's something else that they're enacting is something called, it's a payment service

781
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:14,940
called Wii Connection Pay and Play, so it's that you can buy the WiiWare stuff with Wii

782
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Points.

783
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,300
I think that's kind of interesting, I mean, they say that there's already, you know, we've

784
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,420
got that with a virtual console, pretty much, but.

785
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,100
This is a little different, though, this is actually for online play in certain games,

786
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,900
you have to pay with Wii Points, and it's for download content and that kind of thing.

787
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
I've, I've.

788
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
That's what I was getting to.

789
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Oh, go ahead.

790
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,260
That's okay, we've pretty much already said it.

791
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,420
I've heard this concept said before for what Xbox Live should have done, is that, especially

792
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,220
for these retro arcade titles that, you know, you play them once and you're kind of done,

793
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,360
like wouldn't it be nice if you actually only played a quarter to play Tron, or, oh, here's

794
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
a great example.

795
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,900
I love Tron, but Disks of Tron, that game gets old a little bit fast for me.

796
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,740
I don't know, it was one of those games that's better left in my memories of being a seven-year-old,

797
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,900
is Disks of Tron, so I wish I could have only paid 25 cents to play it once and then be

798
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,380
done with it, and not have it permanently for five dollars, if that makes sense.

799
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,420
So hearing that Nintendo might be adopting a model like this, that's kind of interesting

800
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
to me.

801
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,780
I don't really have a better word, but interesting.

802
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,900
Do you think that's a better price model, Dark Sakura, to do more pay-to-play?

803
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
It depends.

804
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,220
I think that there should be the option of having the full thing and then having the,

805
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,260
it should either be pay for all of it or pay-to-play.

806
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,660
Like a, give you a choice.

807
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,980
Gerardimo in chat asks a good question, says, but Rob, isn't that what the demos are for?

808
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,100
Kinda, but what if you can get really far on one quarter?

809
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,220
I mean, that's how the old-school arcades work.

810
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,980
Sometimes you're really good at the game naturally, you know?

811
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,780
I took this news as something totally different.

812
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,260
I thought that this was going to be, like, extended services that they're going to be

813
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,460
adding to, like, we say, for example, voice chat or something in a game, and you would

814
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,100
have to pay extra for that kind of thing, because they were saying that, I thought they

815
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:13,260
were saying that this was actually going to be used in disc-based games as well as, you

816
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:19,260
know, the WiiWare games and stuff, but I guess I read that wrong, I don't know.

817
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,140
Because I was understanding, you know, okay, their service kind of sucks right now as far

818
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,300
as what they have available online, and so some stuff they were going to add later on,

819
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,700
or in order to finance that, they were going to charge for some of the services, like,

820
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,180
say for example, you know, leaderboards or friends lists or something like that online,

821
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,820
similar, like, live services, but, oh well.

822
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:46,740
Well, one of the other things I was going to bring up is that there is the whole Nintendo

823
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:53,140
channel, we're supposed to be getting that over here and in Europe, which will let you

824
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,700
get to screenshots, videos of new games, play demos of DS titles, and then after you've

825
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,180
played for an hour, you can rate it, but you only, of course, do that through the Nintendo

826
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:11,540
channel, and it'll keep track of what you play, what you use to find new games, so it'll,

827
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,180
it's basically more like, it's like TiVo, I guess, for your games, you know, it sees

828
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,060
what types of games you've been looking into and says, well, here's others, you know.

829
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,780
That's kind of interesting.

830
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,900
And then the WiiWare games will be stored on the console and accessed through the channel

831
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,940
on the Wii menu, and you can store them on your SD cards.

832
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,340
You'll get manuals online, too, from the Wii Shop channel, so you can check them out so

833
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,620
that you know what you're paying for before you do it.

834
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,780
And you can only get them, of course, through your Wi-Fi connection, and they're, again,

835
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,460
going to be based on, like, what you like.

836
00:44:53,460 --> 00:45:00,380
Another thing that they're launching in Japan that we're probably not going to get is another

837
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,780
type of channel that shows TV program listings so that you can see what you want to watch.

838
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,420
I mean, then again, we basically already have that already built into cable, you know.

839
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
TV Guide channel.

840
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
Yeah, the TV Guide channel.

841
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,000
But, and it doesn't really say anything else about that, but they're saying that they're

842
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,700
not going to bring it out anywhere else yet.

843
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,700
Huh.

844
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Interesting.

845
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,500
Yeah, I doubt we're going to get that, since I think it's all for Japanese channels anyways,

846
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,780
unless we really care what's on Japanese TV, I don't know.

847
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,780
You know, between everything Jamie's saying here about what's coming to the Wii and what

848
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,540
we were talking about earlier with the XNA Creators Club, this is going to be a really

849
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,220
big year for digital distribution.

850
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,580
And then if the Netflix thing turns out to be true, this is a big, big year for download

851
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,580
stuff.

852
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,300
I think that's the way everything's going.

853
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,080
I think we've all known that for quite some time.

854
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
This is kind of interesting.

855
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,660
To see it actually happen?

856
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,660
Yes.

857
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,660
Yeah.

858
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,660
Yeah.

859
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,420
It's one thing to talk about, and it's one thing to see how it plays out, if that makes

860
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
sense.

861
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,580
Well, I'm also curious to see how the Wii Balance Board plays out, and apparently, according

862
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:06,780
to Reggie Fils-Aime, over 10 Wii Balance Board games are in development.

863
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,700
The most common problem with a peripheral, they come out, there's only one or two games

864
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
for it.

865
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,940
If that game fails, the whole damn peripheral fails, they obey the bots, it feels like they

866
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,260
wasted their money.

867
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,600
Now it seems like, you know, when these peripherals come out, a company's throwing a lot of money

868
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,200
behind it to try and make them take off, and that's certainly one thing that they're doing

869
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,260
with the Wii Balance Board.

870
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,220
Maybe the fact that it's already done so well in Japan helps, who knows?

871
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,700
But Reggie Fils-Aime commented in something he was speaking to with IGN, he said, quote,

872
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,740
there are over 10 games in development that take advantage of the Balance Board.

873
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,740
All we know so far would be Wii Fit, and then the skiing game that Namco's putting out,

874
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,200
but who knows what else?

875
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Could it be that the other Wii Balance Board games are some of these download titles that

876
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,340
you'll be able to play?

877
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,060
Or another WarioWare game?

878
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,180
Oh, I bet a WarioWare game's a given, actually.

879
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,700
That's a good thought.

880
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:04,780
To kind of go back to that last story we were talking about, Nintendo's Takashi Aoyama,

881
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,420
actually they were saying, his description of the service was that Nintendo will begin

882
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,440
collecting fees for some services that will allow us to adapt flexibility.

883
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,180
So in other words, it's subsidizing additional services like new channels and stuff like

884
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,180
that.

885
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,540
And it will be something that's on boxes, like they said that it's going to be an orange

886
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,540
logo that's going to be right next to the Wi-Fi Connect logo.

887
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,780
So I think this is something additional.

888
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,060
It's not just like an arcade kind of format where you pay X amount of Wii points to play

889
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,080
a game or something like that online.

890
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,940
So I don't know, we'll have to see when it finally comes out.

891
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:47,060
SSJ100Matt says, why couldn't anyone bring back the Sega Activator?

892
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,660
Speaking of peripherals, it didn't do so hot.

893
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:55,940
Well, that's another reason why games like Para Para didn't really take off either.

894
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,100
They had similar type of peripherals.

895
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,300
Hey, I have an activator.

896
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,940
I had one and I disassembled it because I was going to turn it into a Para Para controller.

897
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,940
Isn't that ironic?

898
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,500
I had no time in my life that I owned an activator.

899
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:18,180
Anyways, so another game that of course we're looking forward to pretty soon is Mario Kart

900
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:27,660
Wii, and luckily the rest of the world knows when it's coming out, except the US.

901
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,360
Isn't that ironic?

902
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,500
But apparently though, Mario Kart Wii will be hitting Japan on April 10th.

903
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,300
Also coming to Europe the day after on the 11th.

904
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,300
So that's pretty awesome.

905
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,220
Of course it's going to be bundled with the Wii Wheel, a piece of plastic crap that you're

906
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,100
going to stick the remote in, however you do not need to use that to play the game.

907
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,660
In fact, you'll have as many control options as Smash Bros. did, so that's awesome, including

908
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,020
GameCube and Classic Controllers.

909
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:02,060
Okay, if I used logic, if it's coming out the same week in Japan and Europe, wouldn't

910
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,900
it be logical to say that's going to be the same time frame we get it here?

911
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,180
I mean, that would be my guess.

912
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,500
I can't comment on that.

913
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,860
You bastard, you know, don't you?

914
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,340
You're just afraid of a Katamari redo.

915
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,340
Alright fine.

916
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
I know when it's coming out.

917
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
Okay, tell me this.

918
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,340
Am I right or am I wrong?

919
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,340
You're wrong.

920
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,340
But you're close.

921
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Oh, shiz.

922
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
You're wrong.

923
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,340
Alright, fair enough.

924
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,820
We'll leave it at that.

925
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,820
I know when.

926
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,820
I know when.

927
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,820
I know, I know, I know.

928
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,820
What?

929
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
Soon.

930
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
You're a bitch.

931
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,820
I know.

932
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,820
Heart.

933
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,740
Well, I have some fun news and stuff that actually I can say when it's coming out because

934
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,740
it already has.

935
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,940
And this is our UK Virtual Console.

936
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,420
And this is pretty cool because this is actually, speaking of the Activator, this is a game

937
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,900
that I bought with my Activator.

938
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,300
Was Eternal Champions.

939
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Nice.

940
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,980
I love Eternal Champions.

941
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,180
That game is, actually I love Eternal Champions CD a lot more.

942
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,740
That was a really good transition.

943
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:09,420
No, I'm just saying for the Activator, that was a really good transition.

944
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,420
That's all.

945
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,420
Oh, okay.

946
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,420
I just want to take time out to acknowledge that really good transition.

947
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
Thank you, Rob.

948
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,420
You're welcome.

949
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,460
I feel very confident now in my announcing skills.

950
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,540
Thank you.

951
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,740
As if an endorsement from me is what's needed.

952
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,740
Alright, I'll shut up.

953
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,740
I'm ruining the show.

954
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,740
No, you're not.

955
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:32,340
Anyway, Eternal Champions is like one of those, like, if you have wanted violence in video

956
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,100
games, this is what did it, you know.

957
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:40,740
You had your over-kills, you know, how each level would have like this, like, you know,

958
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,780
super destructive violent move and you had people from all over the world and all through

959
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:53,100
time you had a robot kickboxer and a caveman and like, what's your face that had the really

960
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,180
cool snake look and dress thing?

961
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,180
She was really cool.

962
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,180
I didn't play it.

963
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,220
And there was one guy who, I can never remember what he was called, but I always called him

964
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:08,180
Darkman because he had the hat and the coat and everything, but this is just a really,

965
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:15,220
really fun game, but it's going to be, it's 800 Wii points, really, really fun, but this

966
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,380
also raises a question that I was thinking of.

967
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,620
Which is?

968
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:26,020
Do we have any Sega CD games that have come out on Wii?

969
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,940
Sega CD?

970
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,940
Not that I can think of.

971
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:36,340
If we're getting Turbo Duo games, and why can't we get...

972
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,460
Night Trap on virtual consoles?

973
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,300
Please say we can have, or, dude, I want Criss Cross Make Your Own Video.

974
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,300
Rob?

975
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
What?

976
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,900
I have that game.

977
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,340
I have that one too.

978
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,900
And the Marky Mark and the Funky Munch one?

979
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,940
I have that one too.

980
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,940
That is awesome.

981
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,980
Dude, you didn't bring those over.

982
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,220
We need to play it one night.

983
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,340
Well, if I can find where we put them, but you know what I need to bring over?

984
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,340
What?

985
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
Because I think that you would like this one.

986
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
What?

987
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
Do you like Information Society?

988
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,720
I guess.

989
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,900
I have one of the karaoke CDs that came on the Sega CD.

990
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,900
Anyway.

991
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:17,100
So, also out for UK Virtual Console, and this is also super happy, Phantasy Star 2.

992
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,660
Which is another 800 Wii Points game.

993
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,460
And it's actually, I'd have to say, probably tops to me in the series, because it had Nae

994
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,500
in it, and she was really cool.

995
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,940
DJ Dark Knight in Chat would like you to know the girl's name was Jetta Max.

996
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
That was it.

997
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,100
And I should have remembered that, because my favorite character on Gem was Jetta.

998
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,900
But that's another story.

999
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,700
Plus it's a pretty cool car.

1000
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,700
Okay.

1001
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Alright.

1002
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:54,820
But for the Phantasy Star games, it was like, you know, you had your different viewpoint

1003
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,520
where you played from behind the characters and could attack for your different scenes

1004
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,620
and your little dungeon crawl areas.

1005
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,620
You know, it was really cool.

1006
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,940
I mean, pretty, I'd have to say, the story wasn't all that great, but it was just a fun

1007
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,760
game to play.

1008
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:20,140
And moving forward, we also have Street Gangs that was a Nintendo NES game for 500 points,

1009
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:28,780
and it's not worth, and actually, the cool thing about this is, you want to know what's

1010
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,780
super cool about it?

1011
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
What?

1012
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,820
The River City Ransom is what it is.

1013
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,380
Ah, okay.

1014
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
Yep.

1015
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,100
Which, the Japanese name of it was Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.

1016
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
That sounds fun.

1017
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,500
When you phrase it that way, that sounds a lot of fun.

1018
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,060
I have to tell you this, and if I can find my copy of it, because I only have a burn

1019
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:53,660
of it, I haven't been able to find an original yet, is it has voice on the PC Engine Duo

1020
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,660
version.

1021
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,660
Wow.

1022
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:01,900
You know, the scenes where you go inside and go order food, you know, they start off the

1023
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,860
adashimase, and then talk to you all cutesy and everything.

1024
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,780
When the guys die, do they actually say, barf?

1025
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,300
They make more punch noises.

1026
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,300
Do they?

1027
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,300
Like, ooh.

1028
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,900
Because that's all I remember is in the NES one, when you killed people, they'd go barf.

1029
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:27,380
Well, I will have to, if you would like, I would have to find my burn of the PC Engine

1030
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,700
Duo ones that you can see.

1031
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,500
It just adds a completely different element to the game, having the voice with it, but

1032
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
anyway, that's just me.

1033
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:41,140
One weekend, we need to have a marathon gaming session with Jamie's Rare Fucking Games

1034
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,520
Weekend or something, where we just play these obscure-ass video games that we've been talking

1035
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
about all night long.

1036
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,060
I have a ton of obscure games for the Wii.

1037
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,740
And we could raise money for charity, like all those marathon gamer people do.

1038
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,900
You know what game I'd have to bring you, if I can find my copy of it?

1039
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,580
Psychic Storm.

1040
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,700
And this game has a subtitle.

1041
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:07,140
Dan calls it I Get Pissed Off, because when they say Psychic Storm, they say it in a very

1042
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,460
thick accent, and Dan thinks they're saying I Get Pissed Off.

1043
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,020
And there's another one that I'm going to have to get from a friend of mine that I think

1044
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:20,700
I've talked about on the show before, that's called Silphia, where it's a shooter game

1045
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,180
with fairies.

1046
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,340
Interesting.

1047
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,140
I would be actually, like maybe we could do something where we bring in a whole stock

1048
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,300
of games, and we'll play each game for an hour, and we let the chat vote on which game

1049
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,300
we'll play next or something.

1050
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,180
Dude, you know it's going to be over as soon as I put Dracula X in, because you won't get

1051
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,180
me off that game.

1052
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,140
Maybe save that for last.

1053
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,140
Who knows?

1054
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:46,060
But anyway, the last game on the list is Adventure Island, for 500 Wii points, and Adventure

1055
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,860
Island is just, it's classic.

1056
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:54,980
I mean, it's, I don't mean, today it's, you know, maybe kind of, you know, more repeat,

1057
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,580
repeat, repeat, but Adventure Island is one of the major classics, so I'm glad that's

1058
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,580
in there.

1059
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,180
That is one of the first NES games I actually remember playing.

1060
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,980
It's also technically a Wonder Boy game.

1061
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,980
That's right.

1062
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:11,940
I know, though, that series spawned one of my favorite games, Wonder Boy Monster Land.

1063
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,420
You know, actually, one game I loved in the Adventure Island series was Super Adventure

1064
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,420
Island.

1065
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,420
Did you ever play that on Super Ninja?

1066
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,060
And you know what I loved about Super Adventure Island was the music.

1067
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,820
I thought it had one of the best soundtracks, and years later, I figured it out.

1068
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,900
Do you know why Super Adventure Island had such a kickass soundtrack?

1069
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,900
Yuzo Koshiro.

1070
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,900
Huh?

1071
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,220
Well, I'll tell you what, though, I've got the TurboGrafx Adventure Island cue card.

1072
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,220
Fun.

1073
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,220
That's pretty cool.

1074
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,380
But, um, you know, though, I would really, really like to see, um, is, uh, I haven't

1075
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:50,300
seen, at least as far as I've paid attention, I haven't seen any of the Alex Kidd games.

1076
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,500
Maybe someday.

1077
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,560
I would personally like to see Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

1078
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,340
You seem to bring that up every chance you get.

1079
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,340
You want Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

1080
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,340
It's a great game.

1081
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,340
One of these days, it's gonna be my classic game.

1082
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
Alright.

1083
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,340
Not anytime soon.

1084
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,300
Alright, well, if that's all that's coming to the Virtual Console, then we will move

1085
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,780
on with what is coming to a store near you around the world.

1086
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,900
We'll start with Japan and the Japanese release dates.

1087
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:19,820
Coming out on February 28th, Call of Juarez and the Idolmaster live for you on the Xbox

1088
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,820
360.

1089
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,320
Idolmaster is pretty big over in Japan, and so it's a pretty big title coming out this

1090
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,920
week for them.

1091
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,640
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, nothing, but you do get Guitar Hero 3 next week, so

1092
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,420
stay tuned for that.

1093
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:41,820
Also in Japan, coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Choro Q Wii, sorry, Koro Q Wii.

1094
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,780
Remember, part of the fun is listening to me horribly mispronounce Japanese names, especially

1095
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,780
when I'm sick.

1096
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,060
The Koro 2 games are fun.

1097
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:54,540
Also coming out, more games in the Simple Wii series, the block Kuzushi and the Wai

1098
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,820
Wai Combat are coming out.

1099
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:03,200
Also Uchi Suri, Sega Bass Fishing will be coming out as well on the Nintendo Wii in

1100
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
Japan this week.

1101
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,620
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3 Take Down comes out.

1102
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,940
I think that's a price reduction, though.

1103
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,440
I don't think that's actually a new release.

1104
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,840
Final Approach 2, First Priority comes out from one of my favorite companies, Princess

1105
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,720
Soft comes out there.

1106
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,460
Also coming out, lots of price reductions, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed Underground

1107
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,460
2.

1108
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,460
I like this title, Night Wizard the Video Game, Denial of the World is coming out.

1109
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,460
That sounds like fun.

1110
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,460
It sounds so emo.

1111
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,460
It does.

1112
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,460
Denial of the World.

1113
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
Deny.

1114
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:44,340
Coming out on the Nintendo DS, Soma Bringer, as well as Akajawa Jiro Mystery, Yasu Kiyoku

1115
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,020
is coming out as well.

1116
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:55,980
Coming out on the PSP in Japan is nothing but a new pouch in mint green.

1117
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,660
Enjoy that, but no games.

1118
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,660
That's it.

1119
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,780
The U.S. is getting in quite a few things.

1120
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:08,860
Potapon on the PSP, it's a pretty cool rhythm game, also a bit of action thrown in there.

1121
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:16,160
On the 360 and PC, no PS3 version for this, Frontline's Fuel War, another military first

1122
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,140
person shooter.

1123
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,380
Lost Via Domus coming to Xbox 360, PC, and PS3.

1124
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,300
Good spin off of this show.

1125
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:30,500
Turning Point, Fall of Liberty on 360, PC, and PS3, kind of an alternate World War II

1126
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,500
shooter game.

1127
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Naruto Ninja Destiny on the DS, it's a Naruto 3D fighter game.

1128
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,460
The Sims 2 Free Time for PC.

1129
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:48,060
Lost Planet Extreme Condition on the PS3, which includes bonus characters like Mega

1130
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:52,700
Man, Frank from Dead Rising, and some of the other characters from the PC version.

1131
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:58,740
Plus, it's only $39.99, so pretty good price for a game that came out a year ago.

1132
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:04,100
Destroy All Humans Big Willy Unleashed for the Wii, looks awesome, I love the Destroy

1133
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,820
All Humans series.

1134
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:13,340
Mazes of Fate DS, it's an RPG, kind of a traditional one for the DS there.

1135
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:20,140
Agatha Christie's and Then There Were None for the Wii, an adventure game.

1136
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:25,140
Let's see here, Arma Gold Edition for PC.

1137
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:31,620
Heavenly Guardian for PlayStation 2, it's kind of an anime style 2D shooter game.

1138
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:37,700
Puzzle Guzzle for the PSP, that's another...

1139
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,700
Puzzle Guzzle?

1140
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,700
Puzzle Guzzle.

1141
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,060
That is the dumbest name I've ever heard for games, sorry to the makers of Puzzle Guzzle,

1142
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,060
whoever you are.

1143
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,060
It's huge tech.

1144
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,820
But that's a bad name, that's a bad name.

1145
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:54,140
Some GameStop exclusive stuff, Fantasy Aquarium, yes, you can raise all sorts of different

1146
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,420
fish and sea life, including dolphins.

1147
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,580
Sea Man 3, I was just going to say, can you raise a Sea Man?

1148
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,660
I don't know if you can.

1149
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:10,320
This actually is also coming out, not GameStop exclusive, Block is Portable Steam Bot Championship.

1150
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,940
This is actually a game that was in that Steam Bot Chronicles game, which I thought was very

1151
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:21,200
niche anyways, and now you can play it away from the game, yay, I guess.

1152
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:31,340
And let's see, Bubble Bobble Doubleshot on the DS, hopefully with level 30 as well.

1153
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,340
And let's see...

1154
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,340
I see what you did there.

1155
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,340
Exactly.

1156
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:41,540
Brain Assist, that's coming out on the DS from Sega, yet another brain training game.

1157
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:47,960
Sega Bass Fishing for the Wii, that's not necessarily using the Dreamcast fishing rod,

1158
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,380
but you can pretend with the Wii Remote.

1159
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:58,420
And Spitfire Heroes Tales Royal Air Force for the DS by Destineer, because they put

1160
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,100
out a lot of shit.

1161
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:08,420
And I believe that's it, but I like this title that's coming out next week, though, it's

1162
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:15,880
a horse riding sim, but if you say the name of the title a little bit, it sounds weird.

1163
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Let's Ride Friends Forever.

1164
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,460
Don't say that out loud really fast, because that sounds really, really bad.

1165
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:33,820
Oh, and Tigers, or Pets, Wild Animals, Tigers game, yes, because now you can raise tigers.

1166
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,500
Oh, and Bratz Super Babies, I forgot about that.

1167
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,380
Hey, Jamie, let's go ride friends forever.

1168
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,460
Only friends let friends ride friends.

1169
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,500
Nice.

1170
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,180
Oh, is that it for US releases?

1171
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:58,140
Uh, yeah, and this isn't really a game, but the extra guitars for Guitar Hero 3 are coming

1172
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:04,780
out for PS3 and the Wii now, so, um, if you're looking for extra guitars, there you go.

1173
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,700
Is that a copy of Bejeweled I'm seeing on the table over there?

1174
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,020
That's actually already been given away, I just haven't gotten to the post office yet.

1175
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,020
I was like...

1176
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,700
What was the week you were here?

1177
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,980
I think I'm baffled by that, but that's okay.

1178
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,980
Bejeweled 2, even better.

1179
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,980
Yes.

1180
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,980
You know what I thought?

1181
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,340
Um, you guys were talking about obscure games.

1182
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,060
This isn't really obscure, but I guess it's obscure now.

1183
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,060
Commander Keen.

1184
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Ooh!

1185
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,060
Play some of that.

1186
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,060
I remember those.

1187
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:31,500
Bunch of, uh, EGA colored games, that'd be fun.

1188
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,860
You know, you know what other game, though, I was thinking about just the other day?

1189
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,620
Was Jazz Jackrabbit.

1190
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,740
How about Jill of the Jungle?

1191
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,740
I remember that game.

1192
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,740
The game was rad.

1193
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,740
That's what it is.

1194
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,740
How about him?

1195
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,740
You know me, though, my favorite PC game is so super obscure right now.

1196
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,420
Anyway.

1197
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,260
On the 28th, we have Lost on PC.

1198
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,340
Um, yay.

1199
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:01,700
29th, um, we have, uh, 8 Ball All-Stars on DS.

1200
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:06,780
We have, uh, Asterix at the Olympic Games comic series.

1201
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,820
And then we have, like, a French version, I think.

1202
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,020
Because it's in, because the, uh, title's in French.

1203
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:16,180
We have Beautiful Katamari on the 29th on Xbox 360.

1204
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,180
Blacksite Area 51.

1205
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:23,940
We have Bleach, Shattered Blade, and the Blade of Fate, um, Wii and DS, respectively.

1206
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,820
Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.

1207
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,940
Fish Tycoon.

1208
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,860
My brain's still wrapping around that, sorry.

1209
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,700
Frontlines Fuel of War on Xbox 360 and PC.

1210
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,980
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on Wii.

1211
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:46,300
Um, Jamster All-Stars, King of Clubs, Lost, um, yeah.

1212
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:53,460
Lost Odyssey, Lost Planet Extreme Condition, Namco Museum on DS, Persona 3, SpongeBob Atlantis

1213
01:04:53,460 --> 01:05:00,260
SquarePants, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empire, and Zoo Hospital.

1214
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:05,300
All right, sounds like an exciting week over there.

1215
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,660
That's a, that's a long wait for Beautiful Katamari.

1216
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,980
I would say so.

1217
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Wow.

1218
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,980
Poor, poor guys over here.

1219
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,780
Epic and Apogee, or 3D Realms now, they really need to go back and remake a lot of their

1220
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,980
older games, like Shareware stuff.

1221
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,980
Seriously.

1222
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,380
Those are some IPs that need to be, be gone and revisited, seriously.

1223
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,380
Yeah.

1224
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,820
Who doesn't want a new Jill of the Jungle 3D shooter, or something?

1225
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,540
Hey, you know, people are looking for that, uh, good female heroine.

1226
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:37,660
Well, hey, speaking of new IPs, uh, based on old ideas, possibly, um, Activision apparently

1227
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,580
has filed a trademark for a game name called DJ Hero.

1228
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,500
You just couldn't stop there, could you?

1229
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,260
You just have it going.

1230
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,300
You know, I think a lot of us have seen this coming for a long time, and of course the

1231
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,500
reason why, you know, a lot of us, remember, Orange Launch Radio, hello, look at our name.

1232
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:58,900
We started a long time ago as a station dedicated to music-based video games, and one of them

1233
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,060
specifically was Beatmania, and I think a lot of us called this a long time ago when

1234
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,060
we started seeing Guitar Hero's success.

1235
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,060
It's only a matter of time.

1236
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,500
If Konami's gonna sit on it and not do anything with it, somebody else is gonna pick it up

1237
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
and run with it, and I think that's what we're gonna see happen.

1238
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,920
I mean, well, I'm sure Konami's gonna license, you know, the rights for their controller-type

1239
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,660
design and that stuff, but they've already done one here, so we know that they have trademarks

1240
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:25,060
and, you know, copyrights in place for stuff like that, like Beatmania, but, um...

1241
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:30,300
I think Sega does also have the Kraken DJ1 licensed over here, too.

1242
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,100
But here's what I'm wondering, though, with this, is, um, really all they're doing, and

1243
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:39,500
I mean, this isn't that big of a surprise, because most buying games are like that, too.

1244
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:44,660
All they're really doing is just swapping out guitar for, you know, a turntable and

1245
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,660
buttons.

1246
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,660
I mean, if that's what they're gonna be doing with this.

1247
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:53,100
They're really whoring that Guitar Hero franchise and kind of running it into the ground, I

1248
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,880
think.

1249
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,620
I think it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

1250
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,180
I don't think it's gonna be a clone of Beatmania.

1251
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:03,160
I mean, they're not gonna do that, but it's gonna be interesting to see kind of what happens

1252
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,160
with it, what they decide to change.

1253
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,620
I hope it's Kraken DJ!

1254
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,500
I think you're gonna see something like frequency amplitude, but with a different type of controller.

1255
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,220
I don't think that's what it's gonna be.

1256
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,660
But we'll see.

1257
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,660
I hope.

1258
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,280
I hope it's something different.

1259
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,380
I'm thinking this is gonna be announced at E3 this year.

1260
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,380
Wait for it.

1261
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,380
I'm sorry, go ahead.

1262
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,380
Oh, nothing.

1263
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,380
Go ahead.

1264
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:30,220
So, Microsoft is officially, well, along with everyone else...

1265
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,220
Wait, I gotta say this.

1266
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,220
This is a very good point.

1267
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
A.J.

1268
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,380
Mixx says, this isn't a Harmonic 6 Activision.

1269
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,660
True point, but, you know, still, it could be something like that.

1270
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:40,660
That's all.

1271
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,660
Okay.

1272
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:47,100
So, Microsoft, as well as everyone else, is pretty much getting up on HD DVD.

1273
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:53,620
Rightly so, they have stopped supporting their HD DVD players.

1274
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,180
They will, of course, still warranty the product and stuff like that, but they're no longer

1275
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,460
manufacturing them.

1276
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,860
In other news, and, you know, this hasn't really made it out there that well, other

1277
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:10,740
than a rumor, they have dropped the price of $50, you know, and that's official, so...

1278
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:15,420
So, you're gonna actually get one so I can hang out with my laser disc player and the

1279
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,420
Betamax in our closet.

1280
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,420
I mean, if you're looking for something cheap...

1281
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:24,620
I kind of laughed because I saw an ad on the Xbox 360 not even, like, six hours ago that

1282
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:29,780
said HD DVD player now only $129, and I just kind of snickered.

1283
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,780
Yeah.

1284
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,020
There's a lot of good movies out on HD DVD, though, but...

1285
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,020
$50.

1286
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,020
Good luck finding them, though.

1287
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,500
I know GameStop's not carrying them anymore and they're not selling their movies.

1288
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,220
In fact, they had a pretty good deal, buy two, get two free type thing, but...

1289
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,220
Damn it.

1290
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,060
I need to start looking for these deals, because I need to stock up on HD DVDs now that my

1291
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,300
player isn't gonna be able to do shit.

1292
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,460
I only own, like, four HD DVD movies.

1293
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,460
Yeah.

1294
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,460
Thank God I have Stardust.

1295
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,460
I love that movie.

1296
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,460
And Batman Begins.

1297
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,580
Oh, I hope that that comes out.

1298
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,300
See, I think if you can get a hold of one of these for pretty dirt cheap, I mean, just

1299
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,300
hold out.

1300
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,300
It's just like UMDs, man.

1301
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,940
Those UMD movies, they're dirt cheap, because no one wants them, and, you know, people start

1302
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:10,980
trying to get rid of these things and I think you'll be able to find them pretty, you know,

1303
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,980
cheap.

1304
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,020
Plus, I mean, there's no real difference between those and Blu-ray movies anyways as

1305
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:19,500
far as, you know, image quality goes, so I don't think you're gonna notice.

1306
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,980
Well, I don't know about some of you guys, but me as somebody who picked up an HD DVD

1307
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:29,420
player, I'm mad that it's all over and that makes me angsty and that means it's time for

1308
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,420
the FUs of the Week.

1309
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:53,940
My FUs of the Week goes towards this stupid, clearly compensating for something, man driving

1310
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,100
a truck.

1311
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,020
We had a very, very rainy day.

1312
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:06,100
It was very rainy, very windy, kind of nasty, and there's this one particular turn where

1313
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,780
it's a little sharper than I think that it needs to be to turn, and it's pretty much

1314
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:17,540
a two-lane left turn, and so this one guy was in the inside lane and I was in the outside

1315
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,540
lane.

1316
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:25,420
Well, when we turned in, he basically cut me off in the middle of the turn, which isn't,

1317
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:28,820
you know, just rude.

1318
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,060
It's incredibly dangerous.

1319
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,340
It's something that only an idiot would do.

1320
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:39,060
So he cuts me off and then he starts to spin out, and then I start to spin out because

1321
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:44,860
I was trying to, you know, avoid the tail end of these retarded, you know, small penis

1322
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,340
truck.

1323
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:54,940
So in his spinning out and me losing control, and I actually, I, you know, steered into

1324
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:56,940
it and managed to get myself straightened out.

1325
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:03,780
By the time I got my car, you know, back lined up and everything was fine, he swung out again,

1326
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:11,420
and if I hadn't stopped when I did, then he would have pretty much taken off my bumper.

1327
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:17,940
So the other really kind of scary part about this is that, you know, there's that, well,

1328
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,580
I'm sure those of us in the room know, there's that ditch on the side, and I didn't want

1329
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:25,580
to go in that ditch, that would have gotten my car dirty.

1330
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:34,740
But it was just really the fact that there are people who should have to take psychological

1331
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,020
exams before they are permitted to drive.

1332
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,820
That's what I have to say.

1333
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:48,060
This person driving this truck was clearly of poor judgment, very, very poor driving

1334
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,180
skills and substandard intelligence.

1335
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:56,540
So F you to stupid people who drive.

1336
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:01,580
My FUs ought to be pretty obvious this week, F you to being sick, F you to my car not working

1337
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,620
completely right when I pay a lot of money for my car, and F you to the Wi-Fi here not

1338
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:10,060
working and just F you to February.

1339
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,060
That's it.

1340
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:18,220
F you to my 360 sort of working, or at least playing games with me, and once I think it's

1341
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,780
working, you know, I've tested it extensively, I take it to work, it starts up, ten seconds

1342
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,500
later it freezes.

1343
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,900
It really fucking pisses me off because I can't figure out what's wrong with it, although

1344
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:34,020
I'm getting close to where there's nothing more I can fix on it, so I'm going to have

1345
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,620
to cut a hole in the side of it, just because I think that's necessary that I get the Dremel

1346
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,620
out.

1347
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,220
And it'll look cool.

1348
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,340
As it is, it sounds like a jet coming out of that thing now that I've, you know, twelve

1349
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,660
of modded the fan.

1350
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,700
Alright, is that it?

1351
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,420
Yeah, and that broke an intercooler too because I took it apart.

1352
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,420
Is that it?

1353
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,420
Yes, but...

1354
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,420
That's fine.

1355
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:03,020
Alright, let's keep moving on with the news.

1356
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,980
You know, for supposedly being a short show tonight, I don't think we're going to be that

1357
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,980
short of a show.

1358
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:07,980
We'll see.

1359
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,780
It's just kind of like one long show.

1360
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,780
That's right.

1361
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,780
It'll be fun, right, Jamie?

1362
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Fun?

1363
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,060
Yeah, fun.

1364
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,060
We're having fun, right?

1365
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,060
The more you have fun, the more drunk I am.

1366
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,060
No, I'm kidding.

1367
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,060
Right.

1368
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,060
Anyway, um...

1369
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,660
We're fans of the Commodore 64, wouldn't you say?

1370
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,660
Fuck yes we are!

1371
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,660
I love the Commodore 64.

1372
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,660
By we, I mean Rob.

1373
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:29,660
I get...

1374
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,460
The Commodore 64 was my first gaming system, okay?

1375
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:37,060
I mean, I had an Atari 2600, but I played tons of games on Commodore 64.

1376
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,060
I love the C64.

1377
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:40,060
My first one makes me cry.

1378
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,940
It was the Odyssey.

1379
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,940
That would make me cry too.

1380
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:51,900
Anyway, the Commodore 64 is coming to the European Virtual Console later this year.

1381
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:58,060
The first two games to be out are Iridium and International Karate.

1382
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:06,500
So it looks to me like they're also going to be charging for them 500 Wii points.

1383
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:12,900
There's not any kind of notice as if we're going to be getting them over here.

1384
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:21,580
And I think the other thing that they've recently announced is Master System games.

1385
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,380
I hope some of the classic Commodore 64 games come out, but then again, I think about it,

1386
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:29,300
and a lot of the games I played on Commodore 64 were ports of arcade games and things that

1387
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,340
are out in various other types of ways now, so I don't know.

1388
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,140
But there were some old C64 games that were kind of fun, but a lot of them required a

1389
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,140
keyboard.

1390
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,140
I just want Impossible Mission, okay?

1391
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,140
That's what I want.

1392
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:44,380
I want more than anything.

1393
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,740
Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel, or is it?

1394
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:52,460
It seems like they've taken a game that was already in development and slapped the Puzzle

1395
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,180
Quest name on it.

1396
01:14:54,180 --> 01:15:00,260
The game is called Galactrix, and it's now being called Puzzle Quest Galactrix.

1397
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,340
Is it possibly D3 just using the Puzzle Quest name to sell copies of a game that might not

1398
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,540
have sold much otherwise?

1399
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:13,100
I don't know, but it looks interesting, because now instead of having squares in a more bejeweled-ish

1400
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:18,500
type of setting, now it looks like you have hexagons, and I don't know if it's hexic or

1401
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,500
what the deal is.

1402
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
It's Galactrix.

1403
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
It's not hexic.

1404
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,740
It's clearly different.

1405
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:28,300
But apparently now it has a whole sci-fi theme as opposed to a fantasy theme.

1406
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,100
You know what?

1407
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,100
I don't know.

1408
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,380
I'm going to withhold judgment until I play it.

1409
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:35,980
It does look like it has spells and all that good stuff from the old one, but you know

1410
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,780
what they say about too much of a good thing.

1411
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,900
Don't oversaturate the market with all these sub-par puzzle games that you slap the name

1412
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,060
Puzzle Quest on or you're going to be in trouble.

1413
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:45,060
That's all I think.

1414
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,060
But I don't know.

1415
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,060
Puzzle Quest?

1416
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,060
Bookworm Adventures?

1417
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,060
This game might be kind of fun, so we'll see.

1418
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,780
Dude, Bookworm Adventures is rad.

1419
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,780
Don't be knocking Bookworm Adventures.

1420
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,780
Besides, there's two different people.

1421
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,340
You're talking PopCap Games.

1422
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:59,500
Somebody else that apparently likes to take PopCap Cans and remake them.

1423
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,180
Puzzle Quest is just like Bejeweled.

1424
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:05,900
I mean, that's the only reason Nelly plays it, so I don't know.

1425
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,660
Rob with Two Bees in Chat says, I want Puzzle Quest Pirates Booty.

1426
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,180
We need a good pirate puzzle game.

1427
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,300
Oh wait, we have puzzle pirates.

1428
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:17,740
So EA, being the pompous asses that they are, decided, hey, we're fucking EA.

1429
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,540
We're going to try to buy Take Two.

1430
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,500
We're going to offer you two billion dollars.

1431
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:34,660
Anyway, of course, Take Two looked at it and said, no, sorry.

1432
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,940
You know why I think this is interesting?

1433
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,460
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Take Two own 2K games?

1434
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,420
Yeah, Take Two owns 2K games.

1435
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:44,980
They also own Rockstar.

1436
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:49,220
Basically buying this would have EA would have a monopoly on those sports games.

1437
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,620
I was going to say, if that happened, EA would have a sports monopoly.

1438
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,260
That's crazy talk.

1439
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,660
No, that's EA talk.

1440
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,060
I mean, it's not surprising to hear about all these murders.

1441
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,260
Our games may not be great, but you have no other choice.

1442
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,140
I think it's interesting that Take Two just said, no.

1443
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,140
That's not good.

1444
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,220
When your companies look at being bought like that, though, sometimes it's not good.

1445
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,220
I mean, I don't know.

1446
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,220
Well, it was unsolicited.

1447
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,540
I mean, you know, they weren't saying, hey, who wants to buy us?

1448
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:21,940
EA is just like, hey, we've got $2 billion.

1449
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:24,540
We want to buy you because Grand Theft Auto is awesome.

1450
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,940
But, see, that's the thing.

1451
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:32,780
I think 2K and Take Two, they may have had financial trouble earlier, but I think they're

1452
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,100
going to make a turnaround, especially with Grand Theft Auto IV.

1453
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,100
They're going to make all sorts of money with that shit.

1454
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,820
I don't know.

1455
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,540
This reminds me of the whole Microsoft Yahoo thing that's been going on the past couple

1456
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:45,700
of weeks, where apparently Microsoft's been trying to buy Yahoo, but Yahoo's been kind

1457
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,220
of saying no, or the stockholders have been saying no.

1458
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,220
Very interesting stuff.

1459
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,060
It's like just because you have the money doesn't mean they're going to sell to you.

1460
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,220
I mean, it's true.

1461
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:59,020
If I was Take Two, I'd be like, fuck you, I'm not going to sell my company $2 billion.

1462
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:03,380
Well, in other news, though, Orange Lounge Radio is up for sale for the highest bidder.

1463
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,200
We will take $2 billion, trust each.

1464
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,200
I don't care.

1465
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:12,020
We'll put EA presents EA's Orange Lounge Radio by EA.

1466
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,020
I really don't care.

1467
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,540
We would sell out like that.

1468
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:18,300
I will talk, hell, presented by Madden, Madden's Orange Lounge Radio.

1469
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,620
I don't give a crap.

1470
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,860
$2 billion, man.

1471
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:23,500
I do whatever they want with this show.

1472
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,500
I quit.

1473
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:30,660
Can you imagine Madden's Orange Lounge Radio?

1474
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,180
I'd be foaming at the mouth.

1475
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:36,180
Featuring the gay guy, the angry man, and the woman who...

1476
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,020
We'll build a room of money.

1477
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:44,020
Who I love and adore.

1478
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,320
You want to know what sucks is that I wasn't thinking about what all to spend that much

1479
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,320
money on.

1480
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,540
I was thinking about, well, technically I was, but I was thinking pay off credit cards,

1481
01:18:52,540 --> 01:19:00,820
pay off student loans, buy a house, and then move to Europe.

1482
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:05,860
Act Deaf has made the first bid for Orange Lounge Radio at $2.

1483
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,500
We need more money.

1484
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,620
Let's sell the station on eBay.

1485
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,860
That would be fun.

1486
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,900
Dude, you want to?

1487
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:17,900
When we're ready to just call it quits, which, you know, we've been doing this six years.

1488
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,300
Who knows when it's going to happen?

1489
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:23,140
When we finally decide to call it quits, I say we sell it all on eBay to the highest

1490
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:33,260
bidder and just have a good...spend all the money on a goodbye party with crack and hookers.

1491
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:40,340
We should do random eBay stuff because it's like, I don't know if you know when they were

1492
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:45,820
having all this stuff on the Gorillaz website, they actually sold 2D shoes on eBay.

1493
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,820
Nice.

1494
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,100
So we could do stuff like that.

1495
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,100
Like I have...

1496
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,340
Okay, I need to say something.

1497
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,420
Chat room, knock it off.

1498
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,820
We didn't say the station is actually for sale, so bidding is not up to $50, okay?

1499
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,820
Shut up.

1500
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,820
I'll sell a date.

1501
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,820
I'll go out with somebody.

1502
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,820
You're married.

1503
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:03,500
So my husband will be fine with it.

1504
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,180
I get free food and we get money.

1505
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,180
What's bad about that?

1506
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:12,780
I'll tell you what, Rob, because you know how that one Guitar Hero controller or Guitar

1507
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:18,060
Hero game or whatever was sold for like thousands of dollars because some father took it away

1508
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,180
from his pot smoking son, supposedly?

1509
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:26,180
Well that copy of Bookworm Adventures, that copy was stolen from the President of the

1510
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,820
United States.

1511
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,820
From his secret bunker where he's holding Bin Laden.

1512
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,620
I think that we should put that on eBay and see how much money we can get.

1513
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,780
And there's an image of the Virgin Mary in the plastic.

1514
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,260
Oh yes, there is.

1515
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:47,660
By the way, just so that you know, there's a chance that we may have Dan next week.

1516
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,660
Nice.

1517
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,660
Dan the man.

1518
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,660
Yes.

1519
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,660
Have we even...

1520
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,860
My God, in the six year history of the show, has Dan ever been on it?

1521
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:54,860
Once.

1522
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:55,860
Yes he has.

1523
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,860
Once.

1524
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,860
I wasn't there.

1525
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:58,860
Once.

1526
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,860
I wasn't there when it happened.

1527
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,860
I think you were.

1528
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,860
No, it was a week that you...

1529
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:02,980
I was gone and the show turned...

1530
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,700
This is way back in the day before the podcast.

1531
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,920
This is the day of the apartment.

1532
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,880
This was when you guys, you guys did the show from your apartment and you ended up watching

1533
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,300
a biography of Ron Jeremy while the show was going on.

1534
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:17,300
No, Dan was at your guys' old place.

1535
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,180
Dan was at your guys' old place before.

1536
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,900
Oh, he did come to the show once there.

1537
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,900
That's right.

1538
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,060
Because we have the picture from the webcam.

1539
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,060
I remember that.

1540
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,060
I remember that.

1541
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,060
That's true.

1542
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,580
The Ron Jeremy thing was great because we were like, dude, the stories are just not

1543
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,580
all that great.

1544
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:31,580
Let's just watch porn.

1545
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,300
Or watch, you know, porn documentary.

1546
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,740
Oh, the days.

1547
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,700
The good old golden days of Orange Lounge Radio.

1548
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,380
Rastiel Ute says, Loki, we know that's bullshit.

1549
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,100
W.A. doesn't know what a book is, much less bookworms.

1550
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,860
Yes, but see, you know, it's cute and he likes cute things, so...

1551
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:49,260
Hey, dates don't mean you have to go get nookie or anything.

1552
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,260
Chat room.

1553
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,260
Pervs.

1554
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,900
All right, let's get to the mailbag segment of the show.

1555
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,200
I'm sure the mailbag's very full after not having a show last week, so Dark Soccer's

1556
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,860
had to be super selective in what she picks out to read tonight.

1557
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,900
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

1558
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:20,800
Hi, so that Lucky Nuts guy emailed me back, the one who I was kind of upset with for my

1559
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,740
comments about physics.

1560
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:31,540
So he said he was sorry for making me angry and they were just poking some fun.

1561
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,960
I was just, I'm just going to let you know that I go on PMS-related tangents quite regularly

1562
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,140
and if you're going to deal with women, you've just got to get used to it.

1563
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:49,900
We have that going on, although I have to say that it was more or less of a WTF moment,

1564
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,940
so don't worry about it, whatever.

1565
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,940
So next actual email.

1566
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:58,100
Hi, O.L.R. team.

1567
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,100
We're a team now?

1568
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,100
Yes.

1569
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,100
Okay.

1570
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,820
We put the EA in team.

1571
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:07,060
Does that mean that we have to go on team buildings and have the company pay for lunch?

1572
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,060
Maybe.

1573
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,060
We don't have a company.

1574
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,060
We're lunch money.

1575
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,060
Yeah, we do.

1576
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,060
Anyway.

1577
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,660
I have been listening to the podcast since sometime last year when I discovered it while

1578
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,580
browsing for websites that were formatted for the PSP.

1579
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,220
Yeah, Lucky, another one.

1580
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:27,060
I won't go into a long dribble here, but suffice to say, I really enjoyed listening to you

1581
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:31,060
rambling on about games, the Olive Garden, and Moist Cake.

1582
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:34,740
Since I travel a lot doing my job, it's hard to play all the games or even to keep up with

1583
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:39,560
what's going on, what's coming out all the time, knowing that I'm missing out on something

1584
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:46,060
but not knowing what is worse than listening to O.L.R. and hearing how great Burnout Paradise

1585
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,220
and COD4 must be.

1586
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,320
So thanks Ego++ to you.

1587
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,900
The last few weeks, I have been riding a daily ferry from Margarita Island in Venezuela to

1588
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,420
Coach Island where I'm teaching.

1589
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:03,260
I'm a kiteboarding instructor, and that's when I usually get to listen to the podcast

1590
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,740
on my PSP.

1591
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:09,680
Since I work in Spain during the summer months, I can't listen to O.L.R. live due to the time

1592
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:15,620
shift, but if my internet connection doesn't fail on me this weekend, I might make it to

1593
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,020
listen to you live this Sunday.

1594
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,620
After all, Venezuela is at least on the same side of the globe.

1595
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,020
Finally, a short question.

1596
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:25,220
You've already mentioned Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once, and I was wondering if you

1597
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:29,580
could maybe get him over to the Skyline to drop in for a quick chat.

1598
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:33,000
His video reviews are a weekly highlight for me, and I would love to see O.L.R. chat with

1599
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
him for a while.

1600
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I doubt it.

1601
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
He's in Australia.

1602
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Yeah.

1603
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And busy.

1604
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Yeah.

1605
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It is.

1606
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Thanks and keep up the independent, informative, and very funny show.

1607
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,940
And this is from MVH808.

1608
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,940
That was very nice.

1609
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,940
Thank you.

1610
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,940
Next email.

1611
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,500
Hey folks, at the O.L.R. headquarters.

1612
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,140
I've got two quick questions here.

1613
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,140
First is for Loki.

1614
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:58,020
I know this show doesn't condone shady topics, but bear with me.

1615
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,980
I originally purchased a Wii key for my Wii because people in my home like to mall discs,

1616
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,100
and I'd rather have backup copies lying around than $50 discs.

1617
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,580
So what is your thoughts on this mod chip?

1618
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:14,380
Well, which Wii mod chip do you use, and how hard is it to install one of these because

1619
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:17,260
I have not the slightest experience in soldering?

1620
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:21,860
Also, how many Subway sandwiches with white bread would I have to bribe you with to install

1621
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:22,860
mine?

1622
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,100
Do you use ham and cheese?

1623
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,100
No.

1624
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,100
No.

1625
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,100
I have a Cyclo-Wiz.

1626
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:32,540
I think it's Cyclo-Wiz V2, I don't know.

1627
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:36,900
Whatever the second series, V version 2, I think, is what it was.

1628
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:42,180
They're really friggin' tiny, and it was kinda scary trying to solder it.

1629
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:48,060
But the thing about the soldering, though, is it actually, the one I have, it has a thing

1630
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:53,100
called quick solder, and basically there's two points on the board that you fill up these

1631
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,100
holes with solder.

1632
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,320
Of course, you have to put flux on the board because the solder didn't want to stick to

1633
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,380
it at first.

1634
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,020
And then once you've got that on there, the chip is basically on there, and what you can

1635
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:10,020
do is you tin two wires and solder them onto three really, really, really tiny points on

1636
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:13,860
the board and connect it to the chip.

1637
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:21,100
It wasn't easy at all, and I got lucky, I guess, that it worked just fine.

1638
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,420
Just be careful, I guess.

1639
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,740
But don't electrocute yourself.

1640
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,860
You're not going to electrocute yourself.

1641
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,500
And remember, you're going to void your warranty.

1642
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:34,380
Yeah, you will void your warranty, but to be honest, I wouldn't worry too much.

1643
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:40,500
Just worry about bridging stuff that you shouldn't, like, those three points on the board that

1644
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,780
you would be soldering wires to are really close together, so if you put too much solder

1645
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:49,500
on there, they will bridge each other, and it just won't work, but, you know, you can

1646
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:56,960
always take the solder off there and also make sure you don't lift any of the traces

1647
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,820
on there as well by putting too much heat on there.

1648
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:07,940
Just be careful, use really, really, really small gauge wire, like, I think I used 30

1649
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:12,340
gauge wire, I think, I can't remember, really, really tiny stuff.

1650
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:13,340
And then...

1651
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,620
An YR fan in chat confessed, I electrocuted myself once.

1652
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,620
Be careful.

1653
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,660
Just, yeah, be careful with that stuff.

1654
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:23,540
I love the CycloWiz, I mean, they're the only ones that were running, you know, at

1655
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:29,300
initially Smash Brothers, so I was able to import Smash Brothers that way, and also they

1656
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,740
were one of the first to be able to use Super Mario Galaxies, so I like them.

1657
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:38,060
Weeki's pretty good, I guess, because I was going back and forth between Weeki and CycloWiz,

1658
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:43,940
but I ended up, you know, with a CycloWiz, so, you know, like I said, just be careful,

1659
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,660
also if you don't own one yet, you're going to need a tri-wing screwdriver, so be sure

1660
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:50,900
to buy one of those.

1661
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:55,100
We know about Nintendo and having specially assembled stuff.

1662
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:59,100
Yep, they love the tri-wing, I don't know why.

1663
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,860
Well, the next question says, second question is a show related one.

1664
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:08,740
I liked Puppy in studio last week when he actually spoke and enjoyed another perspective.

1665
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:12,020
I wondered as a permanent part of the show if you guys had ever thought about having

1666
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,460
a fourth chair with a rotating guest.

1667
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:18,340
I mean, one person wouldn't always be relied on to be there and you'd always have a fresh

1668
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,620
perspective from someone.

1669
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:23,460
I just thought it was a really cool idea and figured I would pitch it over there to sit

1670
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,460
on.

1671
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:30,980
Well, we do have guests fairly regularly, but...

1672
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:36,140
Okay, my mic's been totally off that whole time.

1673
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,900
Probably been able to hear me a little bit.

1674
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:39,900
Shit, where was I?

1675
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,900
Oh, yes, I was saying, I think the door is like already kind of open for people to come

1676
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:48,460
in and, you know, have that, and I think the reason why we don't add a fourth guest permanently

1677
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:52,260
is it just makes the kind of, like the credits and everything that goes in the show, it just

1678
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,340
kind of makes it too long, you know what I mean?

1679
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:59,100
And plus, you know, Loki and Dark Sakura have kind of, and myself, we've made this part

1680
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,340
of our routine.

1681
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:03,660
I mean, to have somebody else give up their Sunday, I mean, that's a lot.

1682
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,860
Every Sunday just about, I mean, give or take, obviously we weren't here last week, but give

1683
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:10,500
or take every Sunday for the past six years, that's a huge commitment that not many people

1684
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,500
can take.

1685
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:17,020
So it's hard to say we want to, you know, add somebody on a very permanent basis, but

1686
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:21,820
the door's always open to our guests and I remember back in the day there were some people

1687
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,500
that it seemed like they were here every week for a while.

1688
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,500
Yeah.

1689
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,740
I want to say like DDR Angel was here at least every other week for a while and when he was

1690
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:36,980
here, Shane was here every week, you know, just depends on what's going on that week.

1691
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,700
It's more or less the, do I have anything else going on?

1692
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,700
Let's go to OLR.

1693
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:44,540
I've been trying to get other people to come on though, that's why I'm really hoping Dan

1694
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:50,180
makes it next week because it'll be cool to kind of fuss at him, I think, inside into

1695
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,940
my bizarre marriage, but anyway.

1696
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,780
Love the show guys, hope Sakura is feeling better and this came from J-Rod and thank

1697
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:59,540
you, I am feeling much better two weeks later.

1698
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:04,100
I was feeling like crap the other week, it was not pretty and also because I have to

1699
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:08,260
read it, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and

1700
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,260
breadsticks.

1701
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,260
Nice.

1702
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,260
Shall I move on?

1703
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,260
Sure.

1704
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:17,260
Hello, Rob, Jamie and Loki.

1705
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:21,660
Just thought I would chime in with my thoughts about the game you played last week, one versus

1706
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,660
the chat room.

1707
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,540
That was the week you weren't here, Jamie.

1708
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,540
I understand that.

1709
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:29,060
Just thought I'd fill that in.

1710
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,060
Okay.

1711
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:33,060
It was badass and officially my favorite game of the show.

1712
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,660
It allows all the live listeners a chance to play and win, not just the caller.

1713
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,220
For podcast people, it's fun too just because trivia gets you thinking.

1714
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:44,040
By the way, I agree with that person who said there should be a Bimani edition.

1715
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,140
Also three random thoughts.

1716
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:49,460
One, I laughed so hard at Rama's little loop.

1717
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:53,020
Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video remix.

1718
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,020
Okay.

1719
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:58,520
Two, every time you guys spot a fly in the studio, you should all give a girly squeal

1720
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,340
on the count of three just for shits and giggles.

1721
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,260
It hasn't been that bad lately, actually.

1722
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,260
This one's for me.

1723
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,940
It says you should call your mom and talk about the Wii with her on the show just because

1724
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,460
Rob's talk with his mom a while back was hilarious.

1725
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:10,460
All right.

1726
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,460
Enough with this email.

1727
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,460
I'll be live soon.

1728
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:13,460
That's from Osprey.

1729
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:19,620
Well, I would say we should call my mama, but it's a quarter to ten right now in Alabama.

1730
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,980
Well, actually, I think my mom would be awake, but she would be winding down.

1731
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,300
Now, let's save it for Mother's Day.

1732
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,300
Ooh, yeah.

1733
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,020
Let's call my mom on Mother's Day.

1734
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,740
It'd be, hi, mom.

1735
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,740
I'm in jail.

1736
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,740
Wait.

1737
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,860
I'm in Rob's garage.

1738
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,020
Which is kind of like jail.

1739
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,180
Only more comfy with better insulation and computers.

1740
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,780
Even Gold Banjo in chat says I missed that one versus the chat room game.

1741
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:42,780
I hope you guys do it again.

1742
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:43,780
We'll come back.

1743
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,100
The reception was very, very positive.

1744
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,220
We will do that game again.

1745
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,220
Next email.

1746
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:49,220
With more music, of course.

1747
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:51,620
Yes, with more variety of music next time.

1748
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,620
Next email?

1749
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,620
Yes.

1750
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,620
Hey, OLR crew.

1751
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:58,900
I just wanted to say thank you guys for keeping this show, specifically the live show, going.

1752
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:02,420
Sometimes I have horrible weekends, and this show for me is a nice escape from reality

1753
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:06,260
and whatever fail comes my way during the weekend.

1754
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:11,500
I never have anything to do on Sunday nights, so this show helps keep me from getting bored.

1755
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,840
I also want to give a shout out to DMN.

1756
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,840
Great show.

1757
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,840
Keep it up, too.

1758
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,300
The screwiness and the chat room cage match definitely brighten up my Wednesday nights.

1759
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:23,980
Even though you borderline abusively kick me, SacraMax and some other listeners, said

1760
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,700
kicking only makes the show even better.

1761
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,540
Dude, I'll kick you if you want.

1762
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,540
You're in the chat room, aren't you?

1763
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,540
Yeah.

1764
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,540
Give me a kick.

1765
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,540
I will in a minute.

1766
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:32,540
I'm going to finish.

1767
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,340
I'm at least going to read the email, and then I'll kick you so you can brace for it.

1768
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,340
Okay.

1769
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:36,980
Because this is GS68, by the way.

1770
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,420
Unless you want to do the honors.

1771
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,420
Sure, I'll kick them.

1772
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,420
Okay.

1773
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:45,300
Finally, I would just like to give a shout out to the Orange Lounge chat room for being

1774
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,020
the best friends I've ever met.

1775
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,740
I mean, yeah, you guys get crazy sometimes, but it's that craziness that keeps me distracted

1776
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:53,620
from whatever is depressing me.

1777
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,700
And if the depression is too big, it's nice to have an outlet for that.

1778
01:32:56,700 --> 01:33:00,520
Hell, even when there's no show, I lurk in the chat room just to see who's inside and

1779
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,980
join in whatever's getting discussed.

1780
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:06,020
I just want to say that you guys, and girls, are a great bunch in makeup, a good 60 to

1781
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:09,140
70 percent of the fun during the live show, and that I love you all.

1782
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,140
Aww, sweet.

1783
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,140
Aww.

1784
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,140
That's nice.

1785
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,140
Violin music.

1786
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,140
Violin music.

1787
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:17,100
You guys are what set the difference between listening to this show live and listening

1788
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,100
to it via podcast.

1789
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:23,140
Here's to many more episodes of hilarious chat room moments, and then in, it says, takes

1790
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,740
a shot of water, I guess.

1791
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,020
I'm running out of non-alcoholic drink ideas.

1792
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:32,580
Anyway, great show, O-L-R-N-D-M-N, and thank you, PoundOrangeLounge, for keeping me sane

1793
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:34,100
through the Sunday and Wednesday nights.

1794
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,100
Love, GS68.

1795
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,940
That was a very sweet email.

1796
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:42,700
You know, comments like that, and the little groupies we have in Orange Lounge, our chat

1797
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,700
room and everything.

1798
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:47,060
Just, you know, keep us going, and let us know we're not wasting our time here, that

1799
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:51,300
we really are, you know, letting people have a good time on Sunday nights.

1800
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,820
It's just about having fun.

1801
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:53,820
It's awesome.

1802
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:54,820
Okay.

1803
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:56,820
Well, next email?

1804
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:57,820
Sure.

1805
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,060
Hi, Sky Dark Sakura, and last but definitely least, Loki.

1806
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,300
Sorry I had to say that.

1807
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,860
I love you too.

1808
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:10,100
I live in Australia, and I don't know if you've noticed over there, but I've become very irritated

1809
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:15,660
at the fact that the Japanese gaming companies such as Square Enix see fit-to-release games

1810
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:22,460
like Kingdom Hearts, and a few months later think to themselves, hey, I know how we can

1811
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,060
rip off some people and piss off foreigners, and then release something like Kingdom Hearts

1812
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,940
Final Mix.

1813
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:32,540
I don't know if they realize it, but not only are they missing out on an incredibly large

1814
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:36,620
fan base, but they're leaving a great big gaping hole in plots for us.

1815
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:40,360
I understand that they may be busy, but really, think of the children.

1816
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,420
That was in bold text, by the way.

1817
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:46,660
Also, I'd like to point out that I'm trying to spread the word to every online community

1818
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:51,460
I'm in so that we can reach our goal with eye of judgment, or as it's more commonly

1819
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,700
known, that piece of trash would rather burn.

1820
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,820
Thank you all for something to keep me laughing on the bus in the morning with numerous strange

1821
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:05,380
looks, and as I'm listening to the podcast on my PSP, I shall try to get on the chat

1822
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,300
room one morning and join in on the fun.

1823
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,340
You're sincerely one-winged angel.

1824
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,060
All righty.

1825
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:15,300
I'm glad to hear we're making the wheels on the bus go round and round.

1826
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,300
We have more.

1827
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,300
Okay.

1828
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:21,780
But this one's actually a poem.

1829
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,140
Oh, yay, Poetic Emails.

1830
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,420
By Strip Majong.

1831
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,380
I love that name.

1832
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,380
That's great.

1833
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,380
Okay.

1834
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:33,380
This is called The Lay of OLR, or Damn It I Wish I Had Remembered to Upload Some Extra

1835
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:36,220
Podcasts Last Night.

1836
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:40,940
I sit and stare at my computer screen and eat my workday lunch of fine cuisine.

1837
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:46,020
I browse through my podcast list, which grows thin, wondering where my OLR has been.

1838
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,260
Is it Thursday already?

1839
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:52,700
Far too long since last I heard that OLR theme song, or the classic Game of the Week segment.

1840
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,700
No F's either.

1841
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,420
At traffic, none vent.

1842
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:59,820
I direct my browser to the website and am reminded of why I'm in this plight.

1843
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:05,020
The OLR crew could not meet Sunday, for that real-life thing had to get in their way.

1844
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,900
I sit back in my chair and give a sigh, longing for this show on which I rely, to help ease

1845
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:15,140
the pain of a boring job, and yet no anger I can feel at Rob, DarkSakura, or Loki, since

1846
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:18,860
these three give us so much entertainment for free.

1847
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:25,460
And so to next week's show I now look toward, but for the moment, damn, I'm freaking bored.

1848
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,460
Aww.

1849
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,340
Well, here we are.

1850
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,340
We're back.

1851
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,340
Hi.

1852
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,340
Heart, heart, heart.

1853
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,460
And then someone wants us to put a song in rotation.

1854
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,260
What song's that?

1855
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:40,860
The Elder Scrolls IV intro song.

1856
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:41,860
Guess what?

1857
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,860
It's already there.

1858
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,860
It's already in rotation.

1859
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:47,900
It's just that you're probably not listening quite long enough to actually hear it.

1860
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,140
So it's actually there.

1861
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:55,020
But does that mean they want to hear it on the show, or do they want to hear it in the

1862
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,340
24-hour rotation that's on the station when we're not here?

1863
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:02,540
I'm thinking in the rotation, because, I mean, just suggesting a song to put in is what it

1864
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:03,540
looked like.

1865
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:06,140
And then the mailbox just went down, so that's the last one I'm going to read.

1866
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,140
Well, here, I'll give you a little taste.

1867
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:13,460
There you go, that's all you get.

1868
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:18,260
All right, wonderful, yeah, it sounds like the Wi-Fi might be down in studio again.

1869
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,260
It just came back.

1870
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,820
That's the perfect time for that to happen.

1871
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,820
All right.

1872
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,900
And finally, the computer that broadcasts out the signal for Live 365 and all that stuff

1873
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,900
is wired.

1874
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,700
We actually have a ginormous wire that runs all the way out here into the garage just

1875
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,380
for this computer so that we don't have those types of problems on here.

1876
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:40,140
So anyhow, one more story for you guys, and we're going to open up the Skype line, and

1877
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:43,420
that has to do with Guitar Hero 3.

1878
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:47,740
Activision is going to be offering refunds for the Wii version of Guitar Hero 3, yes,

1879
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,060
all over that whole sound issue.

1880
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:54,300
Remember about how the sound was a mess, it wasn't actually the surround sound or whatever,

1881
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:58,020
it was all mono sound or what have you?

1882
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:03,140
Activision is offering refunds for that, so if you do not want to actually replace your

1883
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:06,500
disk, you can actually replace the disk with money.

1884
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,060
You can get a refund.

1885
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:13,060
So if that's something that interests you, check Activision's site for more details.

1886
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:19,100
Although, seriously, just stick with the game, the game's fine.

1887
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:22,580
But I understand, some of y'all have those big sound systems and things like that you

1888
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,660
don't want to cut back on all that.

1889
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:30,680
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for your telephone calls.

1890
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:37,000
The number to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1891
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,380
The phones are open now, I just turned them on.

1892
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,980
So go ahead and give us a call, and we will talk to you.

1893
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:46,980
We're going to take a couple calls tonight, not a whole lot of them, but I'm sure some

1894
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:51,140
of our listeners have some things to say about things like DJ Hero, maybe the XNA, I'm really

1895
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,020
curious to see what you guys have to say about that.

1896
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:56,380
Meanwhile, while we wait for the buffer and for folks to get the phone number and call

1897
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:58,580
in, do we have any last minute stories?

1898
01:38:58,580 --> 01:38:59,580
Yes.

1899
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:05,460
Magic the Gathering is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox Live Arcade.

1900
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:10,180
So suck it, I have judgment.

1901
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:15,620
Microsoft of course and Epic announce Gears of War 2 coming November 2008.

1902
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:19,740
No word on the details of what's going to be in that, but of course the Unreal 3 engine

1903
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:22,060
has been enhanced and all fun stuff like that.

1904
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,620
All right, let's go to a call.

1905
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,620
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1906
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,620
Who's this?

1907
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,620
Hello, this is RossDielUT.

1908
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:31,900
Well, hello RossDielUT, what is on your mind?

1909
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:35,100
Not much, not much, just a few things.

1910
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,960
First off, yes, I was going to mention the whole EA deal.

1911
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:49,340
I was incredibly relieved to hear that they rejected the EA's offer.

1912
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:54,120
I think we all know that it's basically they're trying to get rid of the NBA 2K franchise

1913
01:39:54,120 --> 01:40:00,460
because the NBA has so far been resistant towards exclusivity talks and this is pretty

1914
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:02,740
much all they have left.

1915
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,960
I agree.

1916
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,060
What better way to get rid of your competition than buy them out?

1917
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:14,260
Yeah, but it's good to see that Take-Two realizes that sticking around and keeping their company

1918
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:17,180
is going to make them more money in the long run.

1919
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:23,340
They already had a hit with Bioshock, they're going to have an enormous hit with GTA 4,

1920
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:35,300
and NBA 2K is doing amazingly well, so there's really no reason to jump ship just yet.

1921
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:40,540
I just think EA creates such a monopoly out there in the marketplace.

1922
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,660
We're starting to get to this point where you've got EA, Activision, Nintendo, Sega,

1923
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:50,980
Namco, Konami, and there's less than ten at this point, you know what I mean?

1924
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:52,460
It seems like back in the day there were a million.

1925
01:40:52,460 --> 01:41:00,100
It hasn't gotten that bad yet, but that is the direction we're going and it is sort of

1926
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:06,380
sad because you see that happen and pretty much innovative game ideas would be impossible

1927
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,380
under that environment.

1928
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:16,100
We all saw what EA did to Origin, Bullfrog, and Westwood.

1929
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:22,900
People just have to remember that they also don't have to buy Madden every single year.

1930
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:26,980
The thing is, I don't think it's gamers who buy Madden, it's sports fans.

1931
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:32,060
They probably don't buy anything else, which is why EA doesn't really have to try.

1932
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,700
I think you're absolutely right.

1933
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:38,420
I think that's the whole reason an Xbox 360 core edition exists is for those people.

1934
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:43,300
There are people that bought an Xbox 360 for Madden and that's it, you know what I mean?

1935
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,340
And that's it, and that's not going to be a market for third parties, and I think most

1936
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:53,220
third parties realize that, because that's probably what, two million people?

1937
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:59,660
That's what Madden sells, are you like one million and a half, two million every year?

1938
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:02,460
I don't think the only people that buy Madden are those type of people.

1939
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:05,060
It's probably a certain percentage.

1940
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:08,380
Probably there's a percentage of that million that buy nothing but Madden and maybe the

1941
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:14,180
other occasional sports game like the basketball game or the street or underground editions

1942
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:16,780
and racing games here and there, that's it.

1943
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:21,100
But yeah, that's clearly not the majority of the gaming audience and I would really

1944
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:25,820
hate to see the entire industry screwed up by that.

1945
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:33,340
Although I do see a silver lining, we all saw what happens when the actual talent leaves

1946
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,860
and they rebrand.

1947
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:39,900
If I remember correctly, Molyneux was part of Origin originally, if I remember correctly,

1948
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,700
and then he went on to form Lionhead.

1949
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:44,260
I think you are correct.

1950
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:50,160
So I think we're going to see that eventually, especially with a lot of studios like BioWare.

1951
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:55,060
They don't do a lot of sequels, they might just stick around to complete Mass Effect

1952
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,500
and then be out, just pack up and rebrand.

1953
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,420
You see that a lot in this industry.

1954
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:02,580
That's very true, you do see a lot of guys getting up and leaving.

1955
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,300
Especially for EA.

1956
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:09,500
Anything else you want to comment on on tonight's show?

1957
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,620
Just a personal note about the show itself.

1958
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:17,540
I do enjoy the show, but I do have to say this.

1959
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:27,000
I do wonder why we get so much into the mod talk, like the letter segment.

1960
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,860
That guy was making a flimsy excuse, we all know he wants to steal Wii games.

1961
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:39,580
I don't see why you guys have to serve, basically, thieves.

1962
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:45,260
That always troubled me and as much as I like the show, that always sort of tugged at me

1963
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,140
a little bit.

1964
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:51,660
I think from our perspective, this show is about the gaming community and all the things

1965
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:56,520
that are going on in the community, the good stuff and the stuff behind closed doors.

1966
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,260
So whether that guy was being honest or not, I suppose we'll never know.

1967
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:05,740
But I think it is important sometimes to talk about what goes on in the whole dark side

1968
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:13,100
and gaming and all that stuff to see how the companies respond to that or how they don't.

1969
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:17,340
For instance, I find this whole thing back and forth with Sony and the people that hacked

1970
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:21,340
the PSP back and forth, I find that whole thing hilarious, honestly.

1971
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:26,460
In a way, I shouldn't say hilarious, but I find it fascinating how constantly Sony patches

1972
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,580
it and somebody breaks it.

1973
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,340
That whole is so interesting to me.

1974
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:32,340
But certainly...

1975
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,340
I can certainly see where someone would find that interesting.

1976
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:40,300
I just find it disgusting because you see the turnaround, PSP software doesn't sell

1977
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:44,220
as well as it should, at least until recently.

1978
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:47,100
There are good PSP games and they don't do well.

1979
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:52,580
And now you see the same thing is going to start happening with the DS as the R4 gets

1980
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:56,740
more popular.

1981
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,620
Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer.

1982
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,380
Well, I think at the same time, though, us not talking about it is not going to make

1983
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,380
it go away.

1984
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:11,660
Oh, it's not going to make it go away, but the last thing anyone needs to be doing is

1985
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:15,380
giving tips of all things.

1986
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:18,020
At that point, you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

1987
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,020
All right.

1988
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:22,740
Well, we've heard your opinion and hopefully you've heard ours, so thanks so much for the

1989
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:23,740
call as always.

1990
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,740
All right.

1991
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:25,740
Have a good night, buddy.

1992
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,740
All right.

1993
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,740
Bye-bye.

1994
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,740
Take care.

1995
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:29,740
All right.

1996
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:36,740
Thank you so much for the call, and we'll see you next time.

1997
01:45:36,740 --> 01:46:02,220
Bye-bye.

1998
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:09,220
Bye-bye.

1999
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:39,220
Bye-bye.

2000
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:09,220
Bye-bye.

2001
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:39,220
Bye-bye.

2002
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:09,220
Bye-bye.

2003
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:39,220
Bye-bye.

2004
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:09,220
Bye-bye.

2005
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:39,220
Bye-bye.

2006
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:10,220
Bye-bye.

2007
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:39,220
Bye-bye.

2008
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:09,220
Bye-bye.

2009
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:39,220
Bye-bye.

2010
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:10,220
Bye-bye.

2011
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:40,220
Bye-bye.

2012
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:09,220
Bye-bye.

2013
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:39,220
Bye-bye.

2014
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:09,220
Bye-bye.

2015
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:39,220
Bye-bye.

2016
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:09,220
Bye-bye.

2017
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:39,220
Bye-bye.

2018
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:10,220
Bye-bye.

2019
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:39,220
Bye-bye.

2020
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:10,220
Bye-bye.

2021
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:38,220
Bye-bye.

2022
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:05,220
All right.

2023
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:12,220
Well, anyway, we just could not end the show if we did not have an opportunity to respect our elders by paying tribute to a classic game as we do every week here on the program.

2024
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:16,220
It's time for Dark Sakura to bring in her classic game of the week.

2025
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:27,220
The classic game of the week is one that I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on.

2026
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:39,220
It's definitely one of the top games in the side-scrolling shooter genre, and that is none other than R-Type.

2027
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:43,220
R-Type is great.

2028
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:52,220
In fact, I'd have to say that R-Type is probably my favorite shooter, even though I'm not all that great at it.

2029
01:58:52,220 --> 01:59:00,220
This music is like the best ever. The first level music is so much my favorite in the game.

2030
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:03,220
So what sets this shooter apart from other games, Dark Sakura?

2031
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:07,220
This particular shooter has a very unique weapon system.

2032
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:15,220
You get this item called the Force, which is, since you're watching the clip, you see that ball that's right in front of it.

2033
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:25,220
You can pick up different power-ups for ones that make it grow based on different types of energy power-ups you pick up.

2034
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:34,220
You have a red one that's a counter air laser. That's the one that's on right now, the blue and red sort of spiral-looking laser.

2035
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:40,220
You also get a rebound laser that shoots these thin beams that bounce off the walls.

2036
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:43,220
Certain weapons are better for certain stages.

2037
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:50,220
You also get the counter ground laser, which is basically like a flamethrower that goes out on the ceiling and on the ground.

2038
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:55,220
Which is a very, very, very good thing to have for the third boss.

2039
01:59:55,220 --> 02:00:00,220
Well, actually for the third level, because the entire level is the boss battle.

2040
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:13,220
The other various things that you can get are these little spheres that will float above and below your ship that will shoot missiles for you.

2041
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:19,220
The other cool thing about the Force attachment is that you can move it around.

2042
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:31,220
By the way, the ship one is the third level. You can fire it off and have it sort of hang in mid-air, although it will try to reattach itself.

2043
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:38,220
But you can have it attached to the back of your ship and fire the weapon from the back and you can have it attached to the front.

2044
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:46,220
In fact, a lot of the bosses are supposed to be really hard, but they all have a trick to them.

2045
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:55,220
Like the first one, there's one place where nothing will hit you and you just fire off the Force thing and it will just kill the thing for you.

2046
02:00:55,220 --> 02:01:10,220
One of the stages is you fight this heart of this creature and there's a place where you can nestle your ship in and fire off the Force thing by the place where the little heart of it pops up.

2047
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:19,220
You don't get hit, you kill off all the tentacles and otherwise it's a really intensely long, annoying battle.

2048
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:29,220
The game is so hard. I mean, I have often completely died in the first level. I am not the best R-Type player.

2049
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:37,220
But I have, however, seen my husband beat this game on one credit and that is hardcore.

2050
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:43,220
And on top of that, I've seen someone beat it in the arcade on an actual single quarter.

2051
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:51,220
I notice our chat room is in a little bit of a Gradius versus R-Type debate. Care to comment? Is there room for both games or is one better than the other?

2052
02:01:51,220 --> 02:02:07,220
It's all a matter of what you prefer because Gradius is a different style of shooter, I think. Honestly, and this is again just my opinion, I think it takes a more skilled player to play through R-Type.

2053
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:14,220
I really think it takes a lot more skilled and patient of a player to play R-Type.

2054
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:29,220
And of course, we've had many sequels since then. We've had, if I am correct in order, after this came, we had R-Type 2 and then, God, there was some other game.

2055
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:40,220
Let's see, Super R-Type came out, R-Type Leo, R-Type 3, R-Type Delta, R-Type Final and there's recently been an R-Type Tactics game which still completely boggles me.

2056
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:47,220
That's coming out over here in April. R-Type Command. There's still a lot of love for R-Type out there.

2057
02:02:47,220 --> 02:03:09,220
But this is put out by Iron which, I'm sorry, this is still my favorite game. I actually have the versions of this, the home versions. My favorite version is the TurboGrafx one because it is probably the closest apart from playing it on PlayStation that you'll get to the arcade version.

2058
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:21,220
It came out on two HuCards and a little bit of trivia is that when on the Japanese Virtual Console, you actually still have to download R-Type in both parts as opposed to one.

2059
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:33,220
And they came out with an R-Type Complete or something that was a PC Engine duo combination that had the entire thing uncut.

2060
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:50,220
Also, other games that were rumored to have been spawned by R-Type though were Polestar, although Polestar actually dates back to the very early 80s, but a lot of the gameplay in Polestar is a lot like R-Type.

2061
02:03:50,220 --> 02:04:04,220
Also, a game called Resnon that came out in 91, very similar. A Magic series core, the game called Magic Dragon that was supposed to be almost everything exactly like R-Type with redone sprites.

2062
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:18,220
We haven't seen that before in Super Mario 2. Also, for the game Turrican 2, you actually can see the force in a hangar and the third level of that game is based on R-Type.

2063
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:30,220
And another game, and this is actually, I almost picked this as my classic game, but it's a little on the obscure side. It's a game called, if I'm pronouncing it right, Zexes, which is just spelled X-E-X-E-X.

2064
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:42,220
And we got it in America as Orius, it's a Konami game. And it's also that same type of shooter game. So, very, very classic. Very good game.

2065
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:49,220
Alright. I have my love for Gradius, especially Gradius 2, don't get me wrong, but R-Type.

2066
02:04:49,220 --> 02:04:56,220
There you have it. Your classic game of the week is R-Type, which you can check out a version of that on the Virtual Console if you are so inclined.

2067
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:59,220
And I believe that's available in all the different regions.

2068
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:03,220
I do believe so. Just remember, if you are in Japan, you have to pay for two of them.

2069
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:12,220
Alright. Well, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for tonight's short show, although it wasn't much of a short show. We've been here for over two hours, so it's almost like just doing one long show with no break.

2070
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:18,220
So, you can't say you got ripped off this week, but I am definitely spent. I am done. I'm ready to go rest.

2071
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:23,220
So, we're going to wrap it up and go around and give everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?

2072
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:31,220
I'm going home and hopefully going to be able to play some Lost Odyssey since everything tonight's reruns, except for the Food Network. They have new stuff on there.

2073
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:38,220
My final thought is medication. Menthol. Cough drops. Hooray. Dark soccer, your final thought?

2074
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:43,220
Let's have tea will kill me if I don't say it, so reject false icons.

2075
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:48,220
There you have it. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

2076
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:53,220
It's your guys' support that keeps us going. Thank you guys so much week after week for your support.

2077
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:59,220
And that's all there is until next week. I'm Rob. She's Jamie. He's Loki. We'll see you then.

2078
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:07,220
