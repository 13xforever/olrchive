00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, February 24th, 2008, community games come to Xbox Live and Zune, Microsoft officially abandons HD DVD, and Nintendo reveals that there is much more in store for the Wii Balance Board.

2
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:36,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Hi everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games.

4
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:42,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we are back from an unexpected vacation last week.

6
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:50,952
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll tell you more about what's going down in just a little bit, but it wouldn't be a show if I couldn't introduce my lovely co-hosts.

7
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:55,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Over there is the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:56,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo.

9
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:58,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm satiated.

11
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:00,319
[SPEAKER_04]: You're satiated?

12
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:00,940
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

14
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a mostly unsatisfactory day as far as things to dine on.

15
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

16
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:08,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a

17
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Power Bar, and Ice Cream.

18
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:42,109
[SPEAKER_14]: That's also pretty nasty.

19
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:45,412
[SPEAKER_14]: McDonald's, it's nasty, but in smaller portions.

20
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:50,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Burger King, that's the only fast food that's not so nasty.

21
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had Burger King in a long time.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,943
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one really, really good thing that they would occasionally have on their menu.

23
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:57,543
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

24
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,704
[SPEAKER_10]: That I actually miss.

25
00:01:59,005 --> 00:01:59,325
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

26
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Those chicken sandwiches that were on the long buns.

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,101
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

28
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:20,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello to everybody in our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com.

29
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we're live on Justin.TV with our webcam, and they have a chat room as well.

30
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:25,073
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to keep an eye on it.

31
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: It's justintv.com slash orangelongeradio.

32
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It always has the video archive of our shows.

33
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:35,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see our smiling faces, or tonight, according to one of our chatters, frowning face.

34
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a comment from a NYR fan in chat.

35
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orangelongeradio.com says, Rob sounds sad this week.

36
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sad, I'm just sick.

37
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,341
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not one thing, it's another.

38
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, last week we weren't here with the show.

39
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened is that I was in Long Beach.

40
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,746
[SPEAKER_04]: William and I were away for the weekend.

41
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to the Star Trek tour in Long Beach.

42
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:58,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, don't laugh, it was awesome.

43
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:02,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But what wasn't awesome was my car breaking down over the grapevine on the way there.

44
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:09,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had to find a mechanic in Long Beach Saturday morning, paid him like $450 to fix my car, but they did do a lot on my car.

45
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as I was driving home,

46
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:13,212
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the stinking lights came on again.

47
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's wrong with something in the oil.

48
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I would explain it, but it would bore you to tears.

49
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably told like 50 different people about what's going on.

50
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So needless to say, I couldn't rush home on Sunday and I made it back late.

51
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, we didn't have a show on Sunday.

52
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And now this week, I'm sick.

53
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's not one thing, it's another.

54
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:31,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're starting late tonight.

55
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, podcast listeners, you guys don't hear a difference.

56
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:40,500
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those listening live tonight, we're about 15 minutes late because the Wi-Fi in studio wasn't working and some of our computers couldn't get online.

57
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just February is broken.

58
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:43,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a refund.

59
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie wasn't here two weeks ago.

60
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:46,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, February is just broken.

61
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:47,904
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because I was sick.

62
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:48,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

63
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nasty, too.

64
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're up against the Oscars tonight.

65
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck them.

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Oscars suck.

67
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about the Oscars?

68
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even a good name.

69
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:59,184
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of stuck-up people sucking each other's... Anyway.

70
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do they call it the Oscars anyway?

71
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:01,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's Oscar?

72
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:05,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the award, but it's actually the Academy Awards.

73
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could probably read it on Wikipedia.

74
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did they name it after somebody named Oscar?

75
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's short for something.

76
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:12,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Oscar is short for something?

77
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:13,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

78
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just talk about our gaming week, shall we?

79
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:16,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

80
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be better than those Oscars.

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,650
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

82
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: What games would you give an Oscar to this week, DarkSakura?

83
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Played some Half-Life 2 and lots of Ragnarok.

84
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Now have another character over 100.

85
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:32,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebirth, by the way.

86
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:32,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

87
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

88
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:42,554
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played... I looked at my copy of Imagine Babies, laughed, and put it back up.

89
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:50,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, although it spawned an interesting conversation about whether or not you could raise them like Pokemon.

90
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:54,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought it was kind of silly.

91
00:04:56,688 --> 00:05:05,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was also some more burnout going on in my house, but I think that Dan's getting tired of it.

92
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:12,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it'd be cool, though, if you could raise them like Pokemon and then have them fight in underground baby cage matches.

93
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:14,243
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

94
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be like cockfighting but with babies.

95
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:18,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Put little razor blades on their feet.

96
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:24,851
[SPEAKER_10]: But babies couldn't actually fight because they don't have any motor coordination when they're that little.

97
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:29,074
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you hop them up on crack and then, you know.

98
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,076
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a one-year-old battle when they're old enough to walk.

99
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:32,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

100
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:39,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I played Wedding the Game, which was me just sitting there going, how much more can I drink?

101
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's about it.

102
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:46,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, this week I played a few things.

103
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:50,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I got around to playing some Lost Odyssey, and that game is pretty awesome.

104
00:05:51,109 --> 00:06:00,155
[SPEAKER_14]: It reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy VIII, just not necessarily, well, I guess a little bit like the gameplay, but more of just the environment reminds me of Final Fantasy VIII.

105
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,276
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's good, and I like the game.

106
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:09,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And I played more Burnout Paradise because it's available, and I don't know.

107
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's allergic to your job.

108
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:46,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I had these screws in it that were too large so it was causing the board to bend too much.

109
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So I replaced them with some different stuff.

110
00:06:49,244 --> 00:07:01,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I did a 12 volt mod on the fan and also put heat sinks on different chips in there and made heat sinks out of pennies and aluminum tape for the bottom of the board.

111
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:04,657
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully with all that stuff done, it should work.

112
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:08,459
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I've already soldered in a fan connector for additional fans.

113
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:15,362
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just found my Dremel today, so I can cut the case open to put a 120mm fan on it.

114
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:17,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things I've been playing...

115
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:25,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually was trying out, and we'll get to some of this stuff later, the X and A community games.

116
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,537
[SPEAKER_14]: And they had a few that were pretty cool, some that really sucked.

117
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,139
[SPEAKER_14]: One of which that was pretty cool was The Dishwasher.

118
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it would be The Dishwasher.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,722
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute I played that game, I was like, this is Loki's dream game right here.

120
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:43,744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not my dream game, but it totally could be a TV series or something like that.

121
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,225
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just really, really cool.

122
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Something you would see on Adult Swim.

123
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,825
[SPEAKER_14]: But absolutely bloody game.

124
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:53,347
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of reminds me actually a little bit also of Alien Hominid or something like that.

125
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the exact same thing I thought.

126
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.

127
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,770
[SPEAKER_14]: But less shooting, more slashing with swords and stuff.

128
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things I tried.

129
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:07,012
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried Gummy Car or Jelly Car, whatever the fuck it was called.

130
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:09,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It was okay.

131
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:12,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really... I mean, it was a neat idea, but...

132
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Not executed too well?

133
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what makes Jelly Car hilarious?

134
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:21,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Is when you realize that all the noises are some guy doing it at his microphone.

135
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

136
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's great.

137
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:26,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

138
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I laughed my ass off playing Jelly Car.

139
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:32,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very customizable with its little completely different looks.

140
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can play the blueprint-looking things.

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,300
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of completely change the look of the game and the options.

142
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:37,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

143
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't even play with the options.

144
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:39,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

145
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,682
[SPEAKER_04]: You can mess with the options and make the game look completely different.

146
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,042
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

147
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:42,642
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool.

148
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, other than that, it was alright.

149
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the levels, though, seemed kind of broken, but whatever.

150
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, then there was Culture, which was neat.

151
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:54,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's an interesting, like, puzzle game, I guess.

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,900
[SPEAKER_14]: With flowers.

153
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty flowers.

154
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:00,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, um, gosh.

155
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:04,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I played that, was it, uh, Little Gamers, I think it was called?

156
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:05,648
[SPEAKER_14]: That was okay.

157
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:08,770
[SPEAKER_14]: That's actually just based off of a webcomic, I guess.

158
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was...

159
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:16,631
[SPEAKER_14]: It was okay, but it just reminded me a lot of, like, there wasn't a lot of movement or dodging you can do.

160
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,794
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just kind of shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, you know, and very bloody.

161
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:21,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But, hey, that's cool.

162
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, I don't know.

163
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,599
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty much it, though.

164
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:35,965
[SPEAKER_14]: There were some games that they showed off at Game Developers Conference that I wish were on there, like Ice Sheep, or, um, what was it?

165
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:39,508
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a dancing one, like a breakdancing thing.

166
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:47,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, wait a minute, did you, and I'm sorry, I ran in the house and you were talking about your game of the week, but I didn't hear anything about N. Didn't you play N this week on Xbox Live?

167
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you loved that game.

168
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:59,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I love N, but I haven't gotten a chance to download it, and I really, I mean, it's, I've played it before, so, you know, it's not, it's not like I'm, I don't know, I don't know what it is.

169
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, finally, I was going to say I played Space Invaders Extreme.

170
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:06,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually was playing that this afternoon, and awesome game.

171
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Really needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game or something like that.

172
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,734
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's coming out the DS and on PSP as well.

173
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:15,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely cool.

174
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,076
[SPEAKER_14]: All the stuff in the game kind of goes with the music.

175
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Like when you're firing and stuff, it's all in time with the music.

176
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:23,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And stuff kind of remixes a little bit.

177
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:25,739
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little like Mizuguchi and stuff.

178
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,379
[SPEAKER_14]: They have little bonus things that go in there.

179
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus the backgrounds are all really flashy and stuff.

180
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,740
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be cool.

181
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely worth picking up when it comes out.

182
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're all done with your gaming week?

183
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:36,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes.

184
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:43,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I will move on to mine, because I just wanted to say, I did play M this week on Xbox 360, and it was kind of cool.

185
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least I should clarify, I only played the demo, I didn't play the full version.

186
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give a false impression or anything.

187
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:55,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But I played the demo of M, because I remember Loki spoke very highly of this game, and I remember playing it a little bit on the free web thing or whatever.

188
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX LIVE COMMUNITY GAMES

189
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:25,505
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, and it's kind of fun, I just think $800 is the wrong price point.

190
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think $400 would have been a little more appropriate.

191
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:28,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably would have bought it for $400.

192
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when you consider it's based off a free web game.

193
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Just... I don't know.

194
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:37,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've played a lot of free games on the web like it.

195
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:41,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there's a certain sense of humor to end that I think is really funny.

196
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I like watching little stick guy get blown to bits.

197
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And it certainly has a very, you know, kind of action pace.

198
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I just...

199
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:47,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

200
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,310
[SPEAKER_04]: In this day of those microtransactions, you really kind of think about every point, and I just don't think it was worth 800.

201
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:58,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that was money well spent, I am madly in love with Lost Odyssey.

202
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the game I have totally been waiting for on the 360, and I know, you know, I'm going to admit it, I am kind of biased, well, I don't want to say I'm biased, but I definitely have a preference towards Japanese RPGs.

203
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:09,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no big secret.

204
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the type of games I like.

205
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't play a lot of sports games.

206
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I like these type of games.

207
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,101
[SPEAKER_04]: and so, you know, the Xbox 360 has been sorely lacking in this department.

208
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:23,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had Blue Dragon, which was, it was okay, but it wasn't great.

209
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good game, not a great game.

210
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had Enchanted Arms.

211
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:28,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

212
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:29,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Decent.

213
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think better than a lot of people gave it credit for, but it started to get a little monotonous towards the end.

214
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost Odyssey, I'm loving it.

215
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Like,

216
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:44,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tearing me away from WoW, which is saying something, you know, because you hear about how much I've been playing World of Warcraft lately and doing this stuff.

217
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot put down Lost Odyssey.

218
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny because I've been reading reviews because I'm kind of curious.

219
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually don't read a lot of reviews on the internet, but I was kind of curious what the critics think of Lost Odyssey, and I was very surprised to see on Metacritic that the game only has like a 76 or something like that.

220
00:12:58,401 --> 00:12:59,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I am shocked.

221
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:06,203
[SPEAKER_14]: This is like an old school RPG, you know, it's so old, you know, everyone's complaining that it's like

222
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,011
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

223
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,787
[SPEAKER_14]: They really didn't change much between each other.

224
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,048
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to innovate on something.

225
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:19,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't try to reinvent it if it's good in the first place.

226
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a comment in chat I have to respond to.

227
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.NormalNationalCenter.com Ross Steel UT says, so Sky likes games that are all the same.

228
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:29,296
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's your perception of these types of games.

229
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:30,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at sports games.

230
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at these Madden games and I go, they're all the same to me.

231
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:34,979
[SPEAKER_04]: These games are all the same.

232
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the story that go along with it.

233
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not necessarily the combat and stuff.

234
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,422
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just kind of, yeah, it's fun.

235
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:47,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, it's grinding or whatever, but... You know, and I've heard people say it's reminded them too much of Final Fantasy.

236
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:55,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll admit, there's a lot in this game that reminds me of Final Fantasy X. I wouldn't call it Final Fantasy VIII because it has a good combat system, unlike VIII.

237
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But Final Fantasy X, it really reminds me of.

238
00:13:58,075 --> 00:13:59,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the combat system.

239
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it innovates it on it enough where, like, I love the ring thing because it makes you pay attention to kind of what's going on.

240
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

241
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:35,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we have games like this to hold us over.

242
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:43,023
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you enjoy Japanese RPGs in the slightest, you are doing yourself a disservice by not at least checking out Lost Odyssey.

243
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't listen to reviewers, because their big complaints are they don't like these type of games in the first place, which, fine.

244
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,809
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is not going to win you over to the Japanese RPG world.

245
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:55,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, so, you know.

246
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,837
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like the Final Fantasy games, you're not going to like this.

247
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:02,803
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why they have places that rent games.

248
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:07,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because one guy doesn't like it doesn't mean you should base your opinion on that one guy.

249
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these reviews I read are just like,

250
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, this game's been done so many times, that's why I hate it.

251
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:14,293
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

252
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:15,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, who cares?

253
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:16,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Action movies.

254
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it's an action movie with guns in it.

255
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, should I not go see it?

256
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this one had guns too.

257
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just beautiful to watch.

258
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:28,918
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate, who doesn't play a lot of games, the game he's been playing a lot lately is Cold Step Saga.

259
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one game he's been getting really into lately, because he likes the more puzzle-type games.

260
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's been watching me play Lost Odyssey, and he's always kind of appreciated the Final Fantasy games too, and he's just like,

261
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:39,503
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

262
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I will kind of put this out there as a disclaimer.

263
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only about eight hours in.

264
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a chance to really fully immerse myself.

265
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be one of those games that gets shitty and monotonous as it goes on.

266
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a possibility.

267
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:15,235
[SPEAKER_04]: But for right now, I'm saying it's money well spent, and I've fully enjoyed the eight hours I've put in so far, which is more than some games I've dropped six months off.

268
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:23,277
[SPEAKER_14]: My only gripe in the game is these dreams that you have, which are basically reading a bunch of text, and there's no real cutscene.

269
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,718
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think with a game that is...

270
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,970
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought the writing was amazing.

271
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,900
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,774
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have appreciated it more like that.

273
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:23,335
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't even have to be anything.

274
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,856
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be just still pictures or whatever.

275
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:27,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a little bit more effort put into it other than just having text.

276
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:31,579
[SPEAKER_04]: One more fangasm over this game and then I promise I'll shut up.

277
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can send your emails about what a fanboy I am.

278
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,442
[SPEAKER_04]: The voice acting in this game is actually really good.

279
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm using the English soundtrack.

280
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:41,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Shock and awe.

281
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:44,084
[SPEAKER_04]: English voice acting in these games is usually pretty terrible.

282
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:48,026
[SPEAKER_04]: But I actually think it's very well voice acted so far.

283
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I am...

284
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, just shocked.

285
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And my roommate said the same thing.

287
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,121
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, wow, the voice acting is actually pretty good.

288
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: The comic relief guy especially is pretty funny.

289
00:17:58,183 --> 00:18:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the way the cutscenes are done, all the comic books start.

290
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:05,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I could sit here for an hour and have a fangasm about how wonderful I think Lost Odyssey is.

291
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:09,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to play it more, and I'll let you know if it starts sucking, okay?

292
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep an open mind about it, but...

293
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

294
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those games that's really hard to put down.

295
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, rounds in Cold Step Talk can go on for like an hour and a half.

296
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:43,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

297
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:44,649
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm having a good time.

298
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll do it for my gaming week.

299
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:48,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot else to share.

300
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:53,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So, then let's get to tonight's housekeeping.

301
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to formally apologize for last week's show, or lack thereof.

302
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what can we say?

303
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:00,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You get what you pay for.

304
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a free show, so sorry.

305
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're here tonight, and actually I gotta admit,

306
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight we're only going to do a short show.

307
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do just one part.

308
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:11,007
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not going to be part A, part B, just because of the fact that I'm sick.

309
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a hard time being here.

310
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:14,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other week, probably wouldn't.

311
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:15,377
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

312
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:40,849
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not consistent, then people will go look elsewhere.

313
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not that that's necessarily a bad thing because there's lots of great independent shows out there, but that's how you lose listeners, is that if you're inconsistent, then people look elsewhere to fill in time.

314
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:52,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hate, I hate missing a show, but it had to be done.

315
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:53,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that.

316
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:58,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, you can join our MySpace community at Orange Lounge Radio.

317
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Facebook community is the OLR Army, and our live journal community is Orange Lounge.

318
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,142
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing I want to plug.

319
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely has nothing to do with video games, but it's another passion of mine.

320
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:19,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I've been getting into over the past six months is these ORGs, these online reality games, where people play games based on reality shows on web forums, if that makes sense.

321
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of strategy involved.

322
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:28,308
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into the strategical thinking that goes behind a lot of shows, such as Survivor and Big Brother and all those types of shows that are on TV...

323
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:30,829
[SPEAKER_04]: SurvivorLJ.livejournal.com So, there you go.

324
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:00,365
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,206
[SPEAKER_04]: That Netflix is soon going to be streaming to the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

326
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:32,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is based off some type of survey that Netflix has been conducting recently.

327
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:43,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question that was in the survey was this, quote, If as part of your Netflix membership you could instantly watch movies and TV episodes on your TV with your PS3 or Xbox 360, how likely would you or anyone in your household be able to do that?

328
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:46,059
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

330
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: EA is rumored to be working on The Sims 3 and this is actually not a rumor because that's according to The Sims Studio creative director Rod Humble and this was on a forum called Quarter to Three.

331
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,858
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, Rod Humble says there will be new information

332
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,820
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

333
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet another way to kill Sims.

334
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see if Sims 3 comes to light, maybe some type of link between the PC and the consoles.

335
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:01,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

336
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:09,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's just the console fan in me, because The Sims is kind of at heart a PC game, even though they've had all those spin-offs on systems and such.

337
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims is kind of a PC game.

338
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll be kind of neat.

339
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about connectivity between all the crap I have and my friends have.

340
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:23,128
[SPEAKER_04]: One other story we missed last week, which I think is kind of funny, there's some filmmakers that are going to be producing a documentary about

341
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:24,693
[SPEAKER_04]: E.T.

342
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:25,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Landfill

343
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:31,307
[SPEAKER_04]: A quote from the Auburn University students who are putting this together.

344
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:34,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, we are proud to announce our upcoming documentary, E.T.'

345
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:34,849
[SPEAKER_04]: 's March.

346
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:40,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the course of a week this March, we will go on a road trip from Auburn, Alabama to El Paso, Texas.

347
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:47,455
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, we will take the actual path of those 14 trucks took that faithful day into the heart of Alamogordo, New Mexico.

348
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:50,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Along the way, we will take in the video game culture of our great country.

349
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:54,979
[SPEAKER_04]: The documentary will be released for free via the internet this summer.

350
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost went to school there.

351
00:23:57,405 --> 00:24:01,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of interesting that they're going to make a whole documentary about this.

352
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:05,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, video game documentaries, King of Kong did very well.

353
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The DVD should be out now, I think.

354
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It is out.

355
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't seen it.

356
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:10,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't seen it.

357
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:11,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to borrow it.

358
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:13,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting watch.

359
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Netflix it or something.

360
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:15,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to see it.

361
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:17,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I'm totally missing something.

362
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:17,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll loan it.

363
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:18,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

364
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll also loan you this other one I have that's really stupid.

365
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,143
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about the first... They claim they're the first ever internet...

366
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like an internet radio show about games.

367
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's uber stupid.

368
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:34,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually watched the game review show.

369
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,850
[SPEAKER_14]: It's lame.

370
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:36,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hmm.

371
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:36,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

372
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to this week's news.

373
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I really want to touch on from last week.

374
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:51,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, ironically enough, was a little bit of a slow news week because this week we started getting into Game Developers Conference and some big bombshells dropped at GDC, correct?

375
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:51,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

376
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:59,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, this year they didn't have keynotes from a bunch of other people like Nintendo and Sony and stuff like that, but Microsoft was there and they were doing their keynote.

377
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Their big thing they announced, of course, was the Xbox Live Community Arcade.

378
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be kind of a

379
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:07,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

380
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:34,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Tons and tons and tons of stuff out there.

381
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:38,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, they said now 10 million people on Xbox Live get to play your game.

382
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,824
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's all user-created content.

383
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:52,752
[SPEAKER_14]: They put up a brief sampling of about nine games or so on there, including some of the way you talked about Jelly Car and Dishwasher and stuff like that.

384
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:58,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So pretty cool stuff and very exciting, especially if you're into game development and stuff.

385
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,518
[SPEAKER_14]: And XNA, as far as I'm aware, I think,

386
00:26:01,284 --> 00:26:02,364
[SPEAKER_14]: The software is free.

387
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:05,385
[SPEAKER_14]: All you have to do is pay for the membership if you want to upload your games.

388
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:06,266
[SPEAKER_14]: $100 a year.

389
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,848
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're really interested in that stuff, I'm sure Bobby Blackwolf will probably all over this kind of thing.

390
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:17,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to recall he was creating some type of Crazy Eights game from what I was following on a show.

391
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But who knows?

392
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Now maybe that he'll be able to post it to the world.

393
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,391
[SPEAKER_04]: He might finish that up.

394
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:21,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

395
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to ask him.

396
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:23,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't talked to him in a little while.

397
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:25,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And then...

398
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:33,258
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, other things that they announced to go along with that is that you will finally be able to game on your Zune as well.

399
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:42,201
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to allow XMA games to come to the Zune and you'll be able to play them kind of similar to playing stuff on an iPod or something like that.

400
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:47,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, of course, XMA Zune games can also support custom soundtracks since it is an MP3 player.

401
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:52,465
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll be able to take your games from Windows to Xbox to Zune.

402
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:53,826
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

403
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:57,223
[SPEAKER_14]: You haven't really announced anything else additional to that.

404
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:00,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if it's just me, this news is fucking huge.

405
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: This news.

406
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:02,625
[SPEAKER_04]: This is huge.

407
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:15,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is like, I think a lot of us saw this coming, but I kind of see this as kind of a turning point in gaming, and I think this is what is going to set the Xbox 360 really apart from its competitors right now.

408
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:17,196
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

409
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:18,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is huge news.

410
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:26,624
[SPEAKER_14]: They said at the end of this year they're going to have a thousand games on Xbox 360 and that's not including the Xbox Live Community games.

411
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:27,725
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what this is?

412
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: This is YouTube but with video games.

413
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:36,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's YouTube of games that they were... And that's kind of what it's going to turn into.

414
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:42,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know people's opinions is that a lot of the user stuff is crap.

415
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of user-made stuff is crap.

416
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look on YouTube, and yeah, a lot of YouTube is crap.

417
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:48,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's these 14-year-old girls doing their blogs and shit.

418
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:49,156
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wants to watch that.

419
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:53,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that a lot of it's crap, but at the same time, I think these people are actually... I mean, YouTube is free.

420
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Any idiot with a camera can go and shoot something and throw it up on YouTube.

421
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:58,902
[SPEAKER_14]: This, you actually pay membership...

422
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,204
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to have the tools to develop the games and stuff like that.

423
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be somewhat intelligent to even do this.

424
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:07,967
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an easy thing to just throw something together and put it on there and stuff.

425
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be really interested to see this stuff on here because a lot of it is going to be independent games.

426
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:17,932
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have people that are developing some of these free web games to put it on there now and they can make a little bit of money off it and that kind of stuff.

427
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's great.

428
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:24,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And also at the same time, it's something that Sony or Nintendo doesn't have that they can –

429
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,574
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

430
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and for those that say that the user-created games are crap, fucking go check out that Dishwasher game and the Jelly Car game.

431
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:10,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it next to some of the things that they're actually charging money for on Xbox Live Marketplace.

432
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the, you know, they got some crappy games on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

433
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there is certainly some good stuff that can come of this.

434
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

435
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:20,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of great independent games that, you know...

436
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:29,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, yeah, there's going to be a lot of crap that you're going to have to weed through, but I think this whole community kind of aspect of it where it's the peer review, I think that's kind of a smart way to kind of weed it out.

437
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Not everything independent is crap either.

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, look at, you know, N Plus started off as an independent game.

439
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:37,023
[SPEAKER_14]: You have Tamiki Fighters.

440
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:38,924
[SPEAKER_14]: That started off as an independent game.

441
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:40,505
[SPEAKER_14]: You have, you know, Everyday Shooter.

442
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:47,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a ton of stuff out there that, you know, was independent stuff that is now becoming mainstream and

443
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:48,836
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not bad.

444
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:58,782
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you know, a lot of times it costs a lot of these people a lot of money to develop these games, and if they don't have a lot of money to put into them, they can't get a wide release for them.

445
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:15,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Now this is allowing people that may not have the funds to advertise their game or do anything like that to do a lot smaller scale and advertise their stuff on websites and that kind of thing, and then throw it on this community arcade and have a lot of people actually get to play their game instead of just not ever hearing about it.

446
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: and I do think that the fact that these games are going to be playable on Zune I think that's huge too because I think Microsoft can really be positioning themselves to do a game handheld if they want imagine if Microsoft releases a portable gaming handheld not necessarily a Zune but something that is more along you know as strictly a gaming machine imagine they release it and they support XNA on this handheld boom this thing comes out it instantly supports thousands of games

447
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:44,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what I think is big.

448
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of see, like, this could be Microsoft positioning the chess pieces and kind of seeing how much this takes off.

449
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,378
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do this and put this on their Zune?

450
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: How many kind of get into this whole thing?

451
00:30:56,979 --> 00:31:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of think this is big news, and we're really looking down the next couple years of gaming.

452
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:09,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm, you know, running around screaming like a lunatic cultist, which is fine, but I think this is huge.

453
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look forward to seeing some of the games that are going to come out from this.

454
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:17,343
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think they would call it if they did a Microsoft handheld?

455
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: A Microsoft handheld system?

456
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:21,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

457
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Xbox, but the Xbrick?

458
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:25,966
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

459
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:26,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

460
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:28,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Xgame.

461
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

462
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,569
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be like the Xpaper.

463
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper, rock, scissors?

464
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:36,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

465
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:39,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox says Frisbee.

466
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:40,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, make it sound like a Mac product.

467
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

468
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:43,159
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd sell it.

469
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:44,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

470
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,680
[SPEAKER_04]: What about something like Xbox Go?

471
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Something really quick to the point.

472
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:52,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Go.

473
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:56,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that kind of have the ring of, hey, it's an Xbox product, but you go and you take it places.

474
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:58,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a fine name.

475
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,024
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to trademark that name right now so Microsoft can't use it.

476
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

477
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:06,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have some interesting news.

478
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:11,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, everybody, well, for the most part, loves Portal.

479
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:19,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a big, big internet phenomenon, especially with that psychotic song at the end of the game that's so funny.

480
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:23,389
[SPEAKER_10]: But that song, Still Alive, is going to be in a rock band.

481
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,211
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

482
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a triumph.

483
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:31,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got to get Moe back.

484
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

485
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You realize we've got to download this song.

486
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: See, we've got a whole band going right here.

487
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki can play the drums.

488
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:39,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You enjoy bass, right?

489
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play bass.

490
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:41,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play whatever guitar.

491
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:43,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you should play the drums when we play at the house.

492
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you two can fight over it.

493
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:46,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care.

494
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play regular guitar.

495
00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:48,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just not singing.

496
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:50,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mo can sing because she's got a pretty voice.

497
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:51,495
[SPEAKER_04]: She can do the singing.

498
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll have ourselves a little OLR house band.

499
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

500
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:56,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

501
00:32:56,356 --> 00:33:00,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe by the time that comes out, we'll have the rock band stage kit.

502
00:33:00,518 --> 00:33:02,118
[SPEAKER_14]: We can have the smoke and the lights.

503
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:03,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah.

504
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:04,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob almost snorted his coffee.

505
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you really wasting money on that stage?

506
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to get it because it sounds so stupid that I have to get it.

507
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:10,771
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of those things.

508
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,852
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I'm not spending money on it.

509
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll use store credit, you know, obviously.

510
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:18,534
[SPEAKER_14]: But that is money that you could spend on something more better.

511
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:19,875
[SPEAKER_04]: More better.

512
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:20,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, more better.

513
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:21,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

514
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:24,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick.

515
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave me alone.

516
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,318
[SPEAKER_14]: I spend money on stupid things, though.

517
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:29,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

518
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:30,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to look at it to see what it is.

519
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if it's something really retarded...

520
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the chat room is up in arms.

521
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:36,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki must sing.

522
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:36,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki must sing.

523
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:37,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki must play vocals.

524
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:38,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you may.

525
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

526
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:46,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was also stated, though, that they've confirmed that another portal is in the works.

527
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:51,748
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, the words Portal 2 were actually used.

528
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:58,109
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news, Madden 2010, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts 3, and all these other games confirmed.

529
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:02,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's the thing about, you know, the Portal 2 thing.

530
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:06,613
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of like, you know, her comment was, oh, I think that they've announced this already.

531
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,794
[SPEAKER_14]: She didn't say that, you know, they have.

532
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,675
[SPEAKER_14]: But obviously they're going to make a Portal 2, duh.

533
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, oh my god, sequel to a game that made a lot of money?

534
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:14,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

535
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I always think it's funny that it was a throwaway to begin with, pretty much, wasn't it?

536
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was more of a nod to an old project.

537
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:22,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

538
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's because we all know it's coming.

539
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

540
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:34,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Portal, little game with not that big a budget, I don't think, has humongous success and practically a cult following.

541
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,069
[SPEAKER_04]: God's gonna have a sequel.

542
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of last year's Katamari Damacy.

543
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:44,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just hope they don't run it into the ground like they did Katamari.

544
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,413
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my only concern.

545
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Can too much Portal be too much of a good thing?

546
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

547
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:52,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, too much Portal when you're intoxicated is too much of a good thing.

548
00:34:54,508 --> 00:35:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully support Portal 2, but when we start getting Portal DS, Portal PSP, Portal your brain out.

549
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you imagine Portal DS?

550
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:05,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be all sorts of lame.

551
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:12,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I just stick to the formula that works, make little improvements as you need to.

552
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:13,499
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

553
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,500
[SPEAKER_04]: How about multiplayer Portal?

554
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:16,345
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

555
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be kind of fun.

556
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:21,087
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a processing nightmare.

557
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Just put a giant knife on the end of the portal gun.

558
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:24,469
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

559
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:25,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

560
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:26,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Portal deathmatch.

561
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Giant bayonet.

562
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:31,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine what a portal deathmatch would be like.

563
00:35:33,012 --> 00:35:34,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Confusing as hell.

564
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,633
[SPEAKER_10]: With no actual weapon.

565
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the comparison between Portal and Katamari leads AJ Mix in our chatroom to say, me and my portal.

566
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:43,944
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cute.

567
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:46,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of Dad says, Portal 5, Disney Edition.

568
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, lordy.

569
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:53,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

570
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:57,108
[SPEAKER_04]: A game that I'm kind of looking forward to, strangely enough, Fable 2.

571
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:00,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the first one kind of lost interest in everyone.

572
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:00,969
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all over this game.

573
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I am all over some of these more recent announcements.

574
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is great.

575
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the huge things that they announced in Fable 2, co-op play.

576
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,281
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty big for a somewhat role-playing adventure game.

577
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:15,542
[SPEAKER_04]: You get co-op play.

578
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:23,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you and someone else own Fable 2, you can suddenly go into their single-player world, do your thing, and then leave.

579
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Just spread rumors about them?

580
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the same idea like in Crackdown.

581
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:30,206
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody's playing the game, you just kind of hop in and join.

582
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:31,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, and leave.

583
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:39,129
[SPEAKER_14]: In the demo that they showed, actually, Jamie, Peter's character, who is a woman,

584
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:40,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

585
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:15,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I have very high hopes, so I'm hoping I'm not let down, but I am a little bit worried.

586
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:21,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you have the little doggy companion that follows you and all that good stuff.

587
00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:28,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, this is big, Xbox Live minigame that will interact with the full Fable 2 game.

588
00:37:29,432 --> 00:37:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

589
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,211
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

590
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:12,558
[SPEAKER_14]: or you can do 50-50, so that's kind of neat.

591
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: What would happen, though, if a really high-level advanced character came into your world and gave you an uber sword?

592
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:21,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything to safeguard the game from essentially cheating like that?

593
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:30,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about that, but, you know, if it's like some Final Fantasy games, you have to be a certain level before you can use, you know, X sword, but yeah, I mean, sure, why not?

594
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to think back to the first Fable, it's been so long.

595
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:39,397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we did in Crackdown, you know, someone would come in with a rocket launcher and give it to you, and there you go, now you have a rocket launcher, it makes the game a hell of a lot easier, so.

596
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:45,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm looking forward to this game and checking it out.

597
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

598
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny, the whole Xbox Live connection.

599
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:50,645
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what it reminds me of?

600
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of the Pocket Station.

601
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Chocobo Breeding?

602
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't Chocobo Breeding.

603
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:02,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some type of Razor Chocobo, like a Tamagotchi type thing that you could have on a little Pocket Station for Final Fantasy VIII?

604
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:03,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

605
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:08,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that, but instead of something in your pocket on the go, it's Xbox Live.

606
00:39:09,744 --> 00:39:10,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

607
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the comparison I get in my mind.

608
00:39:11,464 --> 00:39:19,866
[SPEAKER_14]: The great thing about the Pocket Station game is it'll play itself, so all you have to do is just leave it on a PlayStation system and just leave it running for days at a time.

609
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:20,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom!

610
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:22,947
[SPEAKER_14]: You come back and you have thousands of items.

611
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:24,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

612
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:25,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

613
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:26,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm looking forward to Fable 2.

614
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:30,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Another game that's coming out here pretty soon in the U.S.

615
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:31,588
[SPEAKER_14]: will be Wii Fit.

616
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:33,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo has officially announced a date for it.

617
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:34,929
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be coming out May 19th.

618
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:41,234
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, around the same time, the WiiWare service will be launching in the U.S.

619
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:43,075
[SPEAKER_14]: May 12th.

620
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And they did have a press release and stuff.

621
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:52,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, this game is insanely popular in Japan right now.

622
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Just absolutely selling millions of copies, and I'm sure it will do the same over here.

623
00:39:58,502 --> 00:39:58,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Just...

624
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:03,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to keep Wii Mania alive in soccer moms' households.

625
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:04,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Just need them to announce another.

627
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,214
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I knew this was coming out this time.

628
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:12,437
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I know when some other games are coming out, but I can't say that.

629
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:19,842
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, Wii Fit's going to be doing awesome, and there'll be some other games before it that'll be even more awesome.

630
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:24,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking in the chat room, and let's see, who called it Wii Fat?

631
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:25,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody called it Wii Fat.

632
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was GS68.

633
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:28,829
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be like an eating game.

634
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:29,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

635
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: uh eat as much as you can then get on the balance board uh and then um I'm very happy that we finally have a date for WiiWare finally kind of after all this speculation oh it's gonna be out last Christmas oh I guess first quarter oh second quarter now we have a date so that's finally when Nintendo will kind of be

636
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:52,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Get on board with what everyone else has been doing for years already.

637
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's something else that they're enacting.

638
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:56,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a payment service called Wii Connection Pay and Play.

639
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that you can buy the WiiWare stuff with Wii Points.

640
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:19,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's kind of interesting.

641
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:22,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they said there's already, you know... We've got that with the virtual console, pretty much.

642
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,329
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a little different, though.

643
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,011
[SPEAKER_14]: This is actually for online play in certain games.

644
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,692
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to pay with Wii Points.

645
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's for download content and that kind of thing.

646
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:34,456
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was getting to.

647
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.

648
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:36,357
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

649
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:37,398
[SPEAKER_11]: We've pretty much already said it.

650
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard this concept...

651
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:52,518
[SPEAKER_04]: said before for what Xbox Live should have done, is that especially for these retro arcade titles that you play them once and you're kind of done, wouldn't it be nice if you actually only played a quarter to play Tron?

652
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:53,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's a great example.

653
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:58,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Tron, but Disks of Tron, that game gets old a little bit fast for me.

654
00:41:58,962 --> 00:42:03,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it was one of those games that's better left in my memories of being a seven-year-old, is Disks of Tron.

655
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:10,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wish I could have only paid 25 cents to play it once and then be done with it.

656
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:11,321
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

657
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:45,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo in chat asks a good question, says, but Rob, isn't that what the demos are for?

658
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm, kinda, but what if you can get really far on one quarter?

659
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's how the old school arcades work.

660
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:52,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you're really good at a game naturally, you know?

661
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:54,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I took this news as something totally different.

662
00:42:54,806 --> 00:43:11,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that this was going to be, like, extended services that they're going to be adding to, like, we say, for example, voice chat or something in a game, and you would have to pay extra for that kind of thing, because they were saying that, I thought they were saying that this was actually going to be used in disc-based games as well as,

663
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:36,757
[SPEAKER_14]: um you know the WiiWare games and stuff but I guess I read that wrong I don't know because I was understanding you know okay their service kind of sucks right now as far as what they have available online and so some stuff they were going to add later on or in order to finance that they were going to charge for some of the services like say for example you know leaderboards or friends lists or something like that online similar like live services but

664
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,939
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the other things I was going to bring up is that

665
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:47,267
[SPEAKER_10]: There is the whole Nintendo channel.

666
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:56,615
[SPEAKER_10]: We're supposed to be getting that over here and in Europe, which will let you get to screenshots, videos of new games, play demos of DS titles.

667
00:43:57,996 --> 00:44:01,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after you've played for an hour, you can rate it.

668
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,600
[SPEAKER_10]: But you only, of course, do that through the Nintendo channel.

669
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:10,546
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll keep track of what you play, what you use to find new games.

670
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's basically...

671
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:13,011
[SPEAKER_10]: TVO, SD Cards

672
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:38,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get manuals online, too, from the Wii Shop channel.

673
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:43,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can check them out so that you know what you're paying for before you do it.

674
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:49,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can only get them, of course, through your Wi-Fi connection.

675
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're, again, going to be based on what you like.

676
00:44:53,288 --> 00:44:57,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing that they're launching in Japan that we're probably not going to get is...

677
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:05,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Another type of channel that shows TV program listings so that you can see what you want to watch.

678
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:09,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again, we basically already have that already built into cable.

679
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:11,055
[SPEAKER_04]: TV Guide Channel.

680
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:12,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the TV Guide Channel.

681
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:20,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't really say anything else about that, but they're saying that they're not going to bring it out anywhere else yet.

682
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:22,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

683
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

684
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:27,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I doubt we're going to get that since I think it's all for Japanese channels anyways.

685
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:30,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless we really care what's on Japanese TV, I don't know.

686
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, between everything Jamie's saying here about what's coming to the Wii and what we were talking about earlier with the XNA Creators Club, this is going to be a really big year for digital distribution.

687
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:43,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if the Netflix thing turns out to be true, this is a big, big year for download stuff.

688
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:44,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the way everything's going.

689
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've all known that for quite some time.

690
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:48,101
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of interesting.

691
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:49,402
[SPEAKER_10]: To see it actually happen?

692
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:50,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yeah.

693
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:50,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

694
00:45:50,963 --> 00:45:54,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one thing to talk about, and it's one thing to see how it plays out, if that makes sense.

695
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:55,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

696
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm also curious to see how the Wii Balance Board plays out.

697
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:06,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé, over 10 Wii Balance Board games are in development.

698
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:11,098
[SPEAKER_04]: The most common problem with a peripheral, they come out, there's only one or two games for it.

699
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:13,839
[SPEAKER_04]: If that game fails, the whole damn peripheral fails.

700
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody that bought it feels like they wasted their money.

701
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it seems like, you know, when these peripherals come out, companies are throwing a lot of money behind it to try and make them take off.

702
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's certainly one thing that they're doing with the Wii Balance Board.

703
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:30,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the fact that it's already done so well in Japan helps, who knows.

704
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But Reggie Fils-Aimé commented in something he was speaking to with IGN.

705
00:46:34,764 --> 00:46:38,525
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, quote, there are over 10 games in development that take advantage of the balance board.

706
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:44,647
[SPEAKER_04]: All we know so far would be Wii Fit and then the skiing game that Namco's putting out, but who knows what else.

707
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:49,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it be that the other Wii balance board games are some of these download titles that you'll be able to play?

708
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:51,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Or another WarioWare game.

709
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I bet a WarioWare game's a given, actually.

710
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:55,631
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good thought.

711
00:46:57,637 --> 00:47:13,043
[SPEAKER_14]: To kind of go back to that last story we were talking about, Nintendo's Takashi Aoyama, actually they were saying his description of the service was that Nintendo will begin collecting fees for some services that will allow us to adapt flexibility.

712
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:19,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So in other words, it's subsidizing additional services like new channels and stuff like that.

713
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:22,147
[SPEAKER_14]: And it will be something that's on boxes.

714
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:26,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they said, it's going to be an orange logo that's going to be right next to the Wi-Fi Connect logo.

715
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,592
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is something additional.

716
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:36,137
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just like an arcade kind of format where you pay X amount of Wii points to play a game or something like that online.

717
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:38,759
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

718
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,640
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to see when it finally comes out.

719
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,743
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Why couldn't anyone bring back the Sega Activator?

720
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:48,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of peripherals that didn't do so hot.

721
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:55,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's another reason why games like Parapar didn't really take off either.

722
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:58,003
[SPEAKER_14]: They had similar type of peripherals.

723
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:00,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an activator.

724
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:05,267
[SPEAKER_14]: I had one, and I disassembled it because I was going to turn it into a Parapar controller.

725
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:06,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that ironic?

726
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:11,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no time in my life that I owned an activator.

727
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:18,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, so another game that of course we're looking forward to pretty soon is Mario Kart Wii.

728
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:27,244
[SPEAKER_14]: and luckily the rest of the world knows when it's coming out, except the US.

729
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:28,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that ironic?

730
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:39,077
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently though, Mario Kart Wii will be hitting Japan on April 10th, also coming to Europe the day after on the 11th.

731
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty awesome.

732
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:47,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, it's going to be bundled with the Wii wheel, a piece of plastic crap that you're going to stick the remote in.

733
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:50,105
[SPEAKER_14]: However, you do not need to use that to play the game.

734
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,067
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, you'll have as many control options as Smash Bros.

735
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:53,347
[SPEAKER_14]: did.

736
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:56,809
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's awesome, including GameCube and classic controllers.

737
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:04,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if I use Logic, if it's coming out the same week in Japan and Europe, wouldn't it be logical to say that's going to be the same time frame we get it here?

738
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:06,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be my guess.

739
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:11,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have some fun news and stuff that, uh,

740
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:41,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I can say when it's coming out because it already has.

741
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:45,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is our UK virtual console.

742
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:52,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is pretty cool because this is actually, speaking of the Activator, this is a game that I bought with my Activator.

743
00:49:53,863 --> 00:49:54,884
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Eternal Champions.

744
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:56,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

745
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Eternal Champions.

746
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:00,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I love Eternal Champions CD a lot more.

747
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really good transition.

748
00:50:04,491 --> 00:50:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just saying from the Activator to the Eternal.

749
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:09,573
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really good transition, that's all.

750
00:50:09,913 --> 00:50:10,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

751
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:12,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to take time out to acknowledge that really good transition.

752
00:50:12,434 --> 00:50:12,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rob.

753
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:13,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

754
00:50:13,415 --> 00:50:16,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel very confident now in my announcing skills.

755
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:19,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

756
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:23,579
[SPEAKER_04]: As if an endorsement from me is what's needed.

757
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:24,399
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll shut up.

758
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ruining the show.

759
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,120
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're not.

760
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Eternal Champions is like one of those, like,

761
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,392
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have wanted violence in video games, this is what did it.

762
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:42,574
[SPEAKER_10]: You had your overkills, how each level would have this super destructive, violent move.

763
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:46,195
[SPEAKER_10]: You had people from all over the world and all through time.

764
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:50,096
[SPEAKER_10]: You had a robot kickboxer and a caveman.

765
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:55,337
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your face that had the really cool snake-looking dress thing?

766
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:56,498
[SPEAKER_10]: She was really cool.

767
00:50:56,758 --> 00:50:57,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play it.

768
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any Sega CD games that have come out on Wii?

769
00:50:59,369 --> 00:50:59,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Sega CD?

770
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I can think of.

771
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're getting Turbo Duo games, and why can't we get... Night Trap on virtual consoles?

772
00:51:38,415 --> 00:51:42,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Please say we can have... Or, dude, I want Criss Cross to make your own video.

773
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:43,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob?

774
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:44,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

775
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:45,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that game.

776
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:48,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantasy Star 2

777
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:20,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is... It's another 800 Wii Points game.

778
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:26,796
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's actually, I'd have to say, probably tops to me in the series because it had Ney in it and she was really cool.

779
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:31,539
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight in chat would like you to know the girl's name was Jetta Max.

780
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:32,320
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it.

781
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:32,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

782
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:37,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And I should have remembered that because my favorite character on Gem was Jetta.

783
00:52:38,023 --> 00:52:38,824
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's another story.

784
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:41,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus it's a pretty cool car.

785
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:44,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

786
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:45,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

787
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:46,009
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um...

788
00:52:47,902 --> 00:53:09,624
[SPEAKER_10]: for the Phantasy Star games, it was like you had your different viewpoint where you played from behind the characters and could attack for your different scenes and your little dungeon crawl areas it was really cool, I'd have to say the story wasn't all that great, but it was just a fun game to play

789
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:29,535
[SPEAKER_10]: and moving forward we also have Street Gangs that was a Nintendo NES game for 500 points and it's not worth and actually the cool thing about this is you want to know what's super cool about it?

790
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:29,975
[SPEAKER_04]: what?

791
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:39,377
[SPEAKER_10]: River City Ransom is what it is ah okay yep which the Japanese name of it was Hot Blooded Downtown Story

792
00:53:40,011 --> 00:53:42,312
[SPEAKER_04]: When the guys die, did they actually say, BARF!

793
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,086
[SPEAKER_10]: They make more punch noises.

794
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:11,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they?

795
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:12,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, ooh.

796
00:54:13,107 --> 00:54:15,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's all I remember is in the NES one.

797
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:17,411
[SPEAKER_04]: When he killed people, they'd go, barf!

798
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:28,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I will have to, if you would like, I would have to find my burn of the PC Engine Duo ones that you can see.

799
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:29,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

800
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:30,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Psychic Storm

801
00:54:57,475 --> 00:55:00,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And this game has a subtitle.

802
00:55:01,538 --> 00:55:02,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan calls it, I Get Pissed Off.

803
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:10,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when they say Psychic Storm, they say it in a very thick accent, and Dan thinks they're saying, I Get Pissed Off.

804
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:21,171
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's another one that I'm going to have to get from a friend of mine that I think I've talked about on the show before, that's called Sylphia, where it's a shooter game with fairies.

805
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:23,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

806
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:32,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be, actually, like, maybe we could do something where, like, we bring in a whole stock of games, and, like, we'll play each game for an hour, and we let the chat vote on which game we'll play next or something.

807
00:55:32,493 --> 00:55:34,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know it's going to be over as soon as I put Dracula X in?

808
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:35,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you won't get me off that game.

809
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:38,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe save that for last.

810
00:55:38,075 --> 00:55:38,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

811
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,035
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

812
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:45,057
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, the last game on the list is Adventure Island for 500 Wii points.

813
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And Adventure Island is just, it's classic.

814
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:50,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's...

815
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:52,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonder Boy Monsterland

816
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island Super Adventure Island

817
00:56:37,205 --> 00:56:46,208
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, though, I would really, really like to see... I haven't seen, at least as far as I've paid attention, I haven't seen any of the Alex Kidd games.

818
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:50,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someday.

819
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:53,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I would personally like to see Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

820
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,251
[SPEAKER_04]: You seem to bring that up every chance you get.

821
00:56:57,271 --> 00:56:58,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You want Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

822
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,271
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these days it's going to be my classic game.

823
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:01,192
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

824
00:57:01,512 --> 00:57:02,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Not anytime soon.

825
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:04,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan

826
00:57:13,735 --> 00:57:20,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on February 28th, Call of Juarez and the Idolmaster live for you on the Xbox 360.

827
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:25,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Idolmaster is pretty big over in Japan, and so it's a pretty big title coming out this week for them.

828
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:30,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, nothing!

829
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,284

00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:08,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3 Takedown comes out.

834
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a price reduction, though.

835
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's actually a new release.

836
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:18,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Approach 2, First Priority comes out from one of my favorite companies, Princess Soft comes out there.

839
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like fun.

840
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds so emo.

841
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Denial of the world.

842
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:34,672

00:58:55,826 --> 00:58:56,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy that.

846
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:57,247
[SPEAKER_04]: But no games.

847
00:58:59,529 --> 00:58:59,849
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

848
00:59:00,345 --> 00:59:02,246
[SPEAKER_14]: The US is getting quite a few things.

849
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:08,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Pot of Pawn on the PSP, it's a pretty cool rhythm game, also a bit of action thrown in there.

850
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:16,796
[SPEAKER_14]: On the 360 and PC, no PS3 version for this, Frontlines Fuel of War, another military first person shooter.

851
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:23,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Lost Viadomus coming to Xbox 360, PC and PS3, good spin off of this show.

852
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Turning Point Fall of Liberty on 360 PC and PS3, kind of an alternate World War II shooter game.

856
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:57,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Blast is only $39.99, so pretty good price for a game that came out a year ago.

857
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:01,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed for the Wii.

01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:03,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks awesome.

859
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Love the Destroy All Humans series.

860
01:00:05,783 --> 01:00:07,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Mazes of Fate DS.

861
01:00:08,244 --> 01:00:12,787
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an RPG, kind of a traditional one for the DS there.

862
01:00:13,467 --> 01:00:16,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Agatha Christie's, and then there were none for the Wii.

863
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:18,911
[SPEAKER_14]: An adventure game.

864
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:20,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

865
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Arma, Gold Edition for PC.

866
01:00:24,394 --> 01:00:27,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Heavenly Guardian for PlayStation 2.

867
01:00:27,455 --> 01:00:30,615
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of an anime-style 2D shooter game.

868
01:00:31,536 --> 01:00:33,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Puzzle Guzzle for the PSP.

869
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:38,257
[SPEAKER_14]: That's another... Puzzle Guzzle?

870
01:00:38,337 --> 01:00:39,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Guzzle.

871
01:00:39,537 --> 01:00:41,498
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the dumbest name I've ever heard for a game.

872
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:43,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to the makers of Puzzle Guzzle, whoever you are.

873
01:00:43,658 --> 01:00:44,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Age Tech.

874
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a bad name.

875
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a bad name.

876
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Some GameStop-exclusive stuff.

877
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Fantasy Aquarium...

878
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:56,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you can raise all sorts of different fish and sea life, including dolphins.

879
01:00:58,361 --> 01:00:58,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Seaman 3.

880
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:01,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, can you raise a seaman?

881
01:01:02,643 --> 01:01:04,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you can.

882
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:07,345
[SPEAKER_14]: This actually is also coming out, not a GameStop exclusive.

883
01:01:07,385 --> 01:01:09,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Block is Portable SteamBot Championship.

884
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:17,669
[SPEAKER_14]: This is actually a game that was in that SteamBot Chronicles game, which I thought was very niche anyways, and now you can play it away from the game.

885
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, I guess.

886
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:21,191
[SPEAKER_14]: And

887
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:27,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, Bubble Bobble Double Shot on the DS, hopefully with level 30 as well.

888
01:01:31,756 --> 01:01:32,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I see what you did there.

889
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:34,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

890
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:40,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Brain Assist, that's coming out on the DS from Sega, yet another brain training game.

891
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Sega Bass Fishing for the Wii.

892
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:49,963
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not necessarily using the Dreamcast fishing rod, but you can pretend with the Wii Remote.

893
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:59,279
[SPEAKER_14]: and Spitfire Heroes Tales Royal Air Force for the DS by Destineer because they put out a lot of shit.

894
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that's it.

895
01:02:04,423 --> 01:02:08,167
[SPEAKER_14]: But I like this title that's coming out next week though.

896
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,810
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a horse riding sim.

897
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:15,453
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you say the name of the title a little bit, it sounds weird.

898
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:17,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's Ride Friends Forever.

899
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:26,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say that out loud really fast, because that sounds really, really bad.

900
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:31,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and Tigers, or Pets, Wild Animals, Tigers game.

901
01:02:31,945 --> 01:02:33,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, because now you can raise tigers.

902
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:35,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and Bratz Super Babies.

903
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:36,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot about that.

904
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:38,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jamie.

905
01:02:38,987 --> 01:02:40,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ride friends forever.

906
01:02:42,268 --> 01:02:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Only friends let friends ride friends.

907
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:48,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

908
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:52,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, is that it for US releases?

909
01:02:53,342 --> 01:03:00,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, yeah, and this isn't really a game, but, uh, the extra guitars for Guitar Hero 3 are coming out for PS3 and the Wii now, so, um... Wii.

910
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:03,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you're looking for extra guitars.

911
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:07,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a copy of Bejeweled I'm seeing on the table over there?

912
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:12,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually already been given away, I just haven't gotten to the post office yet, so... I was like... Oh, it was the week you weren't here.

913
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:15,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm baffled by that, but that's okay.

914
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:17,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Bejeweled 2, even better.

915
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:17,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

916
01:03:17,414 --> 01:03:18,515
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I thought, um,

917
01:03:18,936 --> 01:03:20,337
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys were talking about obscure games.

918
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:22,578
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't really obscure, but I guess it's obscure now.

919
01:03:22,978 --> 01:03:23,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Commander Keen.

920
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:25,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh!

921
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:26,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Play some of that.

922
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:26,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember those.

923
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Bunch of EGA-colored games.

924
01:03:30,662 --> 01:03:31,202
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be fun.

925
01:03:31,442 --> 01:03:33,943
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what other game, though, I was thinking about just the other day?

926
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Jazz Jackrabbit.

927
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:38,666
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Jill of the Jungle?

928
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that game.

929
01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:40,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It was rad.

930
01:03:40,847 --> 01:03:41,927
[SPEAKER_10]: How about our UK releases?

931
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:42,748
[SPEAKER_04]: How about them?

932
01:03:43,228 --> 01:03:43,908
[SPEAKER_10]: You know me, though.

933
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:46,329
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite PC game is so super obscure right now.

934
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:47,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway...

935
01:03:49,395 --> 01:03:51,557
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 28th, we have Lost on PC.

936
01:03:53,419 --> 01:03:54,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

937
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:01,026
[SPEAKER_10]: 29th, we have 8 Ball All-Stars on DS.

938
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:05,170
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Asterix at the Olympic Games comic series.

939
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:11,797
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have a French version, I think, because the title's in French.

940
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:23,364
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Beautiful Katamari on the 29th on Xbox 360, Blacksite Area 51, Bleach, Shattered Blade, and the Blade of Fate, Wii and DS respectively.

941
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:39,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed, Fish Tycoon, Frontlines Fuel of War on Xbox 360 and PC, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core on Wii,

942
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:59,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamster All-Stars, King of Clubs, Lost Odyssey, Lost Planet Extreme Condition, Namco Museum on DS, Persona 3, Spongebob Atlanta Squarepants, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empire, and Zoo Hospital.

943
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds like an exciting week over there.

944
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long wait for beautiful Katamari.

945
01:05:08,814 --> 01:05:09,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say so.

946
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:13,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Epic and Apogee are 3D Realms now.

947
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:17,195
[SPEAKER_14]: They really need to go back and remake a lot of their older games like Shareware.

948
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:17,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

949
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:21,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some IPs that need to be gone and revisited.

950
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:22,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

951
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't want a new Jill of the Jungle 3D shooter or something?

952
01:05:27,502 --> 01:05:30,324
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, people are looking for that good female heroine.

953
01:05:30,945 --> 01:05:41,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, speaking of new IPs, based on old ideas, possibly, Activision apparently has filed a trademark for a game name called DJ Hero.

954
01:05:42,537 --> 01:05:44,419
[SPEAKER_14]: You just couldn't stop there, could you?

955
01:05:44,479 --> 01:05:45,580
[SPEAKER_14]: You just had to go and

956
01:05:46,212 --> 01:05:53,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think a lot of us have seen this coming for a long time, and of course the reason why a lot of us... Remember, Orange Lounge Radio, hello, look at our name.

957
01:05:53,456 --> 01:06:00,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We started a long time ago as a station dedicated to music-based video games, and one of them specifically was Beatmania.

958
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of us called this a long time ago when we started seeing Guitar Hero's success.

959
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:05,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a matter of time.

960
01:06:05,802 --> 01:06:11,265
[SPEAKER_04]: If Konami's going to sit on it and not do anything with it, somebody else is going to pick it up and run with it, and I think that's what we're going to see happen.

961
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:16,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure Konami is going to license the rights for their controller type design and that stuff.

962
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:17,903
[SPEAKER_14]: But they've already done one here.

963
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:24,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So we know that they have trademarks and copyrights in place for stuff like that, like Beatmania.

964
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:30,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Sega does also have the Kraken DJ-1 licensed over here too.

965
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:32,488
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's what I'm wondering though with this is,

966
01:06:33,218 --> 01:06:44,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, really all they're doing, and I mean this isn't that big of a surprise because most buying games are like that too, all they're really doing is just swapping out a guitar for, you know, a turntable and buttons.

967
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if that's what they're going to be doing with this.

968
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:53,526
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really whoring that Guitar Hero franchise and kind of running it into the ground, I think.

969
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:57,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

970
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be a clone of Beatmania.

971
01:06:59,229 --> 01:07:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're not going to do that, but

972
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:04,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to see kind of what happens with it, what they decide to change.

973
01:07:05,736 --> 01:07:10,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're going to see something like frequency amplitude, but with a different type of controller.

974
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:12,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it's going to be, but we'll see.

975
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope.

976
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope it's something different.

977
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:18,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking this is going to be announced at E3 this year.

978
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:20,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait for it.

979
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:24,525
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

980
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:25,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nothing.

981
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:25,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

982
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:30,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So Microsoft is officially, well, along with everyone else...

983
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:58,161
[SPEAKER_14]: They will, of course, still warranty the product and stuff like that, but they're no longer manufacturing them.

984
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:06,664
[SPEAKER_14]: In other news, and this hasn't really made it out there that well other than a rumor, they have dropped the price to $50.

985
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,085
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's official.

986
01:08:10,225 --> 01:08:16,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can actually get one so I can hang it with my LaserDisc player and the Betamax in our closet.

987
01:08:16,567 --> 01:08:18,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're looking for something cheap...

988
01:08:19,488 --> 01:08:20,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

989
01:08:49,451 --> 01:08:49,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

990
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God I have Stardust.

991
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:52,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that movie.

992
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And Batman Begins.

993
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I hope that that comes out.

994
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:59,816
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I think if you can get a hold of one of these for pretty dirt cheap, I mean, just hold out.

995
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,076
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like UMDs, man.

996
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:04,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Those UMD movies, they're dirt cheap because no one wants them.

997
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:10,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And people start trying to get rid of these things, and I think you'll be able to find them pretty cheap.

998
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:17,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus, I mean, there's no real difference between those and Blu-ray movies anyways as far as image quality goes.

999
01:09:17,303 --> 01:09:19,104
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think you're going to notice.

1000
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:30,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about some of you guys, but me, as somebody who picked up an HD DVD player, I'm mad that it's all over, and that makes me angsty, and that means it's time for the FUs of the Week.

1001
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:54,340
[SPEAKER_10]: My FE of the week goes towards this stupid, clearly compensating for something man driving a truck.

1002
01:09:56,102 --> 01:09:58,044
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a very, very rainy day.

1003
01:09:58,164 --> 01:10:00,606
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very rainy, very windy, kind of nasty.

1004
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:12,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's this one particular turn where it's a little sharper than I think that it needs to be to turn, and it's pretty much a two lane left turn.

1005
01:10:13,582 --> 01:10:17,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, this one guy was in the inside lane and I was in the outside lane.

1006
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:23,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we turned in, he basically cut me off in the middle of the turn.

1007
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Which isn't, you know, just rude.

1008
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:30,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It's incredibly dangerous.

1009
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:32,267
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that only an idiot would do.

1010
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:35,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So he cuts me off and then he starts to spin out.

1011
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:42,329
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I start to spin out because I was trying to, you know, avoid the tail end of these

1012
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:45,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Retarded, you know, small penis truck.

1013
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:56,519
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in his spinning out and me losing control, and I actually, you know, steered into it, managed to get myself straightened out.

1014
01:10:56,899 --> 01:11:10,703
[SPEAKER_10]: By the time I got my car, you know, back lined up and everything was fine, he swung out again, and if I hadn't stopped when I did, then he would have pretty much taken off my bumper.

1015
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:11,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1016
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:22,267
[SPEAKER_10]: The other really kind of scary part about this is that, you know, there's that, well, I'm sure those of us in the room know, there's that ditch on the side, and I didn't want to go in that ditch.

1017
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:25,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have got my car dirty.

1018
01:11:25,409 --> 01:11:37,739
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was just really the fact that there are people who should have to take psychological exams before they are permitted to drive.

1019
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,701
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I have to say.

1020
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:50,817
[SPEAKER_10]: This person driving this truck was clearly of poor judgment, very, very poor driving skills, and substandard intelligence.

1021
01:11:51,097 --> 01:11:53,998
[SPEAKER_10]: So, F you to stupid people who drive.

1022
01:11:56,519 --> 01:11:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: My F yous ought to be pretty obvious this week.

1023
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:08,822
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to being sick, F you to my car not working completely right when I pay a lot of money for my car, and F you to the Wi-Fi here not working, and just F you to February.

1024
01:12:09,882 --> 01:12:10,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1025
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:16,945
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to my 360 sort of working, or at least playing games with me.

1026
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:23,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Once I think it's working, I've tested it extensively, I take it to work, it starts up, 10 seconds later it freezes.

1027
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:28,132
[SPEAKER_14]: It really fucking pisses me off because I can't figure out what's wrong with it.

1028
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:35,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I'm getting close to where there's nothing more I can fix on it, so I'm going to have to cut a hole in the side of it.

1029
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:38,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because I think that's necessary that I get the Dremel out.

1030
01:12:39,918 --> 01:12:40,639
[SPEAKER_14]: And it'll look cool.

1031
01:12:42,202 --> 01:12:47,525
[SPEAKER_14]: As it is, it sounds like a jet coming out of that thing now that I've, you know, 12-volt modded the fans.

1032
01:12:50,406 --> 01:12:51,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, is that it?

1033
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:54,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I broke an intercooler too because I took it apart.

1034
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:55,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1035
01:12:56,049 --> 01:12:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but... That's fine.

1036
01:13:01,512 --> 01:13:02,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's keep moving on with the news.

1037
01:13:02,973 --> 01:13:06,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for supposedly being a short show tonight, I don't think we're going to be that short of a show.

1038
01:13:06,695 --> 01:13:07,015
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1039
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of like one long show.

1040
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1041
01:13:10,196 --> 01:13:11,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun, right, Jamie?

1042
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:12,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun?

1043
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:14,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fun.

1044
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:15,763
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having fun, right?

1045
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:17,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I have fun the more drunk I am.

1046
01:13:17,424 --> 01:13:17,844
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1047
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:18,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1048
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:23,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we're fans of the Commodore 64, wouldn't you say?

1049
01:13:23,629 --> 01:13:24,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yes, we are.

1050
01:13:24,549 --> 01:13:25,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Commodore 64.

1051
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,691
[SPEAKER_10]: By we, I mean Rob.

1052
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:31,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The Commodore 64 was my first gaming system, okay?

1053
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:35,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I had an Atari 2600, but I played tons of games on Commodore 64.

1054
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the C64.

1055
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,461
[SPEAKER_10]: My first one makes me cry.

1056
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the Odyssey.

1057
01:13:42,862 --> 01:13:43,702
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make me cry too.

1058
01:13:44,783 --> 01:13:45,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1059
01:13:46,763 --> 01:13:50,884
[SPEAKER_10]: The Commodore 64 is coming to the European Virtual Console later this year.

1060
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:56,966
[SPEAKER_10]: The first two games to be out are Iridium and International Karate.

1061
01:13:57,986 --> 01:14:04,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So it looks to me like they're also going to be charging for them 500 Wii Points.

1062
01:14:06,389 --> 01:14:07,009
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a...

1063
01:14:07,851 --> 01:14:12,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Any kind of notice as if we're going to be getting them over here.

1064
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the other thing that they've recently announced is Master System Games.

1065
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:18,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1066
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope some of the classic Commodore 64 games come out.

1067
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:31,195
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I think about it, and a lot of the games I played on Commodore 64 were like ports of arcade games and things that are out in various other types of ways now.

1068
01:14:31,275 --> 01:14:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1069
01:14:32,255 --> 01:14:35,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were some like old C64 games that were kind of fun.

1070
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:36,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of them required a keyboard.

1071
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:37,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want Impossible Mission, okay?

1072
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:38,558
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

1073
01:14:38,858 --> 01:14:39,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want more than anything.

1074
01:14:44,181 --> 01:14:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel.

1075
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it?

1076
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:50,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest Galactrix Puzzle Quest Galactrix

1077
01:15:17,955 --> 01:15:18,996
[SPEAKER_04]: or what the deal is.

1078
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:19,877
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Galactrix.

1079
01:15:19,977 --> 01:15:20,878
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Hexic.

1080
01:15:21,459 --> 01:15:22,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It's clearly different.

1081
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently now it has a whole sci-fi theme as opposed to a fantasy theme.

1082
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:28,707
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1083
01:15:30,329 --> 01:15:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1084
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to withhold judgment until I play it.

1085
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:35,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look like it has spells and all that good stuff from the old one, but...

1086
01:15:35,802 --> 01:15:37,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they say about too much of a good thing.

1087
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:43,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't oversaturate the market with all these, you know, subpar puzzle games that you slap the name Puzzle Quest on or you're going to be in trouble.

1088
01:15:43,903 --> 01:15:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I think.

1089
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:45,124
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1090
01:15:45,184 --> 01:15:47,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, this game might be kind of fun.

1091
01:15:48,084 --> 01:15:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

1092
01:15:48,964 --> 01:15:50,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Bookworm Adventures is rad.

1093
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:52,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be knocking Bookworm Adventures.

1094
01:15:52,745 --> 01:15:53,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, it's two different people.

1095
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking PopCap games.

1096
01:15:55,145 --> 01:15:55,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else.

1097
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:59,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That apparently likes to take PopCap games and remake them.

1098
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:01,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Puzzle Quest was just like Bejeweled.

1099
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's the only reason Nelly plays it.

1100
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1101
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob with two B's in chat says, I want Puzzle Quest Pirate's Booty.

1102
01:16:09,142 --> 01:16:11,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a good pirate puzzle game.

1103
01:16:11,223 --> 01:16:12,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, we have Puzzle Pirates.

1104
01:16:13,244 --> 01:16:17,626
[SPEAKER_14]: So EA, being the pompous asses that they are, decided, hey, we're fucking EA.

1105
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,107
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to try to buy Take-Two.

1106
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:22,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to offer you two billion dollars.

1107
01:16:23,489 --> 01:16:31,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, of course, you know, Take-Two looked at it and said, no, sorry.

1108
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:34,334
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1109
01:16:34,602 --> 01:16:35,823
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why I think this is interesting?

1110
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Take-Two own 2K Games?

1111
01:16:38,544 --> 01:16:40,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Take-Two owns 2K Games.

1112
01:16:40,365 --> 01:16:43,426
[SPEAKER_14]: They also own Rockstar.

1113
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:49,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, buying this would have EA would have a monopoly on most sports.

1114
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:52,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, if that happened, EA would have a sports monopoly.

1115
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy talk.

1116
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:56,272
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's EA talk.

1117
01:16:58,459 --> 01:16:59,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not surprising to hear about all these murders.

1118
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:02,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, listen, our games may not be great, but you have no other choice.

1119
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's interesting that Take-Two just said, no.

1120
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:07,521
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not good.

1121
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:10,982
[SPEAKER_04]: When your companies look at being bought like that, though, sometimes it's not good.

1122
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

1123
01:17:12,082 --> 01:17:13,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was unsolicited.

1124
01:17:13,543 --> 01:17:16,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, they weren't saying, hey, who wants to buy us?

1125
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:20,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, EA is just like, hey, we've got $2 billion.

1126
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:24,545
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to buy you because Grand Theft Auto is awesome.

1127
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:25,886
[SPEAKER_14]: But see, that's the thing.

1128
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:26,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, like, you know,

1129
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:34,847
[SPEAKER_14]: 2K and Take-Two, they may have had financial trouble earlier, but I think they're going to make a turnaround, especially with Grand Theft Auto 4.

1130
01:17:34,927 --> 01:17:36,768
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to make all sorts of money with that shit.

1131
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:38,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1132
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This reminds me of the whole Microsoft-Yahoo thing that's been going on the past couple weeks, where apparently Microsoft's been trying to buy Yahoo, but Yahoo's been kind of saying no, or the stockholders have been saying no.

1133
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting stuff.

1134
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,911
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like just because you have the money doesn't mean they're going to sell to you.

1135
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:52,451
[SPEAKER_14]: It's true.

1136
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:55,365
[SPEAKER_14]: If I was to take two, I'd be like, fuck you!

1137
01:17:56,245 --> 01:17:58,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to sell my company for $2 billion.

1138
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other news, though, Orange Lounge Radio is up for sale for the highest bidder.

1139
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We will take $2 billion.

1140
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust... Each.

1141
01:18:06,492 --> 01:18:07,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

1142
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:11,055
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll put EA presents EA's Orange Lounge Radio by EA.

1143
01:18:11,155 --> 01:18:13,096
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I really don't care.

1144
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:14,457
[SPEAKER_14]: We would sell out like that.

1145
01:18:14,677 --> 01:18:16,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I will talk... Hell, presented by Madden.

1146
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:18,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Madden's Orange Lounge Radio.

1147
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,261
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't give a crap.

1148
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:20,301
[SPEAKER_14]: $2 billion, man.

1149
01:18:20,341 --> 01:18:20,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I...

1150
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Do whatever they want the show.

1151
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:24,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I quit.

1152
01:18:26,286 --> 01:18:30,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine Madden's Orange Lounge Radio?

1153
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:32,113
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be foaming at the mouth.

1154
01:18:32,153 --> 01:18:37,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Featuring the gay guy, the angry man, and the woman who... We'll build a room of money.

1155
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Who I love and adore.

1156
01:18:43,955 --> 01:18:45,476
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to know what sucks?

1157
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:48,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't thinking about what I'll spend that much money on.

1158
01:18:49,537 --> 01:18:54,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically I was, but I was thinking pay off credit cards, pay off student loans, buy a house.

1159
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And then move to Europe.

1160
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft has made the first bid for Orange Lounge Radio at $2.

1161
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:06,563
[SPEAKER_11]: We need more money!

1162
01:19:07,063 --> 01:19:08,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's sell the station on eBay.

1163
01:19:08,783 --> 01:19:09,363
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

1164
01:19:10,264 --> 01:19:10,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to?

1165
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:14,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do random eBay stuff because...

1166
01:19:36,866 --> 01:19:45,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, I don't know if you know, when they were having all this stuff on the Gorillaz website, they actually sold 2D shoes on eBay.

1167
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:46,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1168
01:19:46,674 --> 01:19:47,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So we could do stuff like that.

1169
01:19:48,036 --> 01:19:50,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I need to say something.

1170
01:19:50,197 --> 01:19:51,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, knock it off.

1171
01:19:51,398 --> 01:19:53,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't say this station is actually for sale.

1172
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So bidding is not up to $50.

1173
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:56,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, shut up.

1174
01:19:56,483 --> 01:19:57,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll sell a date.

1175
01:19:57,383 --> 01:19:58,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go out with somebody.

1176
01:19:58,725 --> 01:19:59,365
[SPEAKER_10]: You're married.

1177
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:00,046
[SPEAKER_10]: So?

1178
01:20:00,886 --> 01:20:02,107
[SPEAKER_10]: My husband will be fine with it.

1179
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I get free food and we get money.

1180
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:08,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I'll tell you what, Rob.

1181
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:20,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know how that one Guitar Hero controller or Guitar Hero game or whatever was sold for thousands of dollars because some father took it away from his pot-smoking son, supposedly?

1182
01:20:21,101 --> 01:20:27,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that copy of Bookworm Adventures, that copy was stolen from the President of the United States.

1183
01:20:28,702 --> 01:20:32,303
[SPEAKER_14]: From his secret bunker where he's holding Bin Laden.

1184
01:20:33,023 --> 01:20:34,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we should put that on eBay.

1185
01:20:35,592 --> 01:20:36,533
[SPEAKER_14]: and see how much money we can get.

1186
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an image of the Virgin Mary in the plastic.

1187
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:39,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, there is.

1188
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,903
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, just so that you know, there's a chance that we may have Dan next week.

1189
01:20:47,624 --> 01:20:47,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1190
01:20:48,785 --> 01:20:49,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan the man.

1191
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:53,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we even... My God, in the six-year history of this show, has Dan ever been on it?

1192
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, he has.

1193
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:54,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Once.

1194
01:20:55,172 --> 01:20:55,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there.

1195
01:20:56,213 --> 01:20:57,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there when it happened.

1196
01:20:57,814 --> 01:20:58,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you were.

1197
01:20:58,874 --> 01:20:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1198
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was at your guys' old place before.

1199
01:21:19,237 --> 01:21:19,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he did.

1200
01:21:19,797 --> 01:21:20,898
[SPEAKER_04]: He did come to the show once there.

1201
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:21,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1202
01:21:21,178 --> 01:21:22,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have the picture from the webcam.

1203
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:23,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1204
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1205
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1206
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:30,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ron Jeremy thing was great because we were like, dude, the stories are just not all that great.

1207
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:33,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just watch porn or watch, you know, porn documentary.

1208
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:36,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the days, the good old golden days of Orange Lounge Radio.

1209
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:39,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Ross DLUT says, Loki, we know that's bullshit.

1210
01:21:39,734 --> 01:21:42,076
[SPEAKER_14]: WA doesn't know what a book is, much less bookworms.

1211
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:44,767
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1212
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So that lucky nuts guy emailed me back.

1213
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:22,131
[SPEAKER_10]: The one who I was kind of upset with for my comments about physics.

1214
01:22:23,691 --> 01:22:29,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So he said he was sorry for making me angry and they were just poking some fun.

1215
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:36,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to let you know that I go on PMS-related tangents quite regularly.

1216
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:41,755
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're going to deal with women, you just got to get used to it.

1217
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:42,775
[SPEAKER_10]: We have...

1218
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:44,465
[SPEAKER_10]: That going on.

1219
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:49,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I have to say that it was more or less of a WTF moment.

1220
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:51,407
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't worry about it.

1221
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:52,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1222
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:54,208
[SPEAKER_10]: So next actual email.

1223
01:22:56,028 --> 01:22:57,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, OLR team.

1224
01:22:57,989 --> 01:22:58,689
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a team now?

1225
01:22:59,349 --> 01:22:59,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1226
01:22:59,869 --> 01:23:00,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1227
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:02,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We put the EA in team.

1228
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:06,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean that we have to go on team buildings and have the company pay for lunch?

1229
01:23:07,211 --> 01:23:07,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1230
01:23:07,611 --> 01:23:08,331
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have a company.

1231
01:23:09,411 --> 01:23:09,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Or lunch money.

1232
01:23:10,712 --> 01:23:11,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we do.

1233
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:11,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1234
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:19,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been listening to the podcast since sometime last year when I discovered it while browsing for websites that were formatted for the PSP.

1235
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Loki, another one.

1236
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:29,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't go into a long dribble here, but suffice to say, I really enjoy listening to you rambling on about games, The Olive Garden, and Moist Cake.

1237
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:37,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I travel a lot doing my job, it's hard to play all the games or even to keep up with what's going on, what's coming out all the time.

1238
01:23:37,953 --> 01:23:41,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Knowing that I'm missing out on something but not knowing what is worse than listening

1239
01:23:41,957 --> 01:23:44,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks Ego++ to you.

1240
01:24:00,771 --> 01:24:04,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's when I usually get to listen to the podcast on my PSP.

1241
01:24:04,593 --> 01:24:17,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I work in Spain during the summer months, I can't listen to OLR live due to the time shift, but if my internet connection doesn't fail on me this weekend, I might make it to listen to you live this Sunday.

1242
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:19,600
[SPEAKER_10]: After all, Venezuela is at least on the same side of the globe.

1243
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, a short question.

1244
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:29,144
[SPEAKER_10]: You've already mentioned Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation once, and I was wondering if you could maybe get him over to the skyline to drop in for a quick chat.

1245
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:33,682
[SPEAKER_10]: His video reviews are a weekly highlight for me and I would love to see OLR chat with him for a while.

1246
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:34,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I doubt it.

1247
01:24:34,263 --> 01:24:35,084
[SPEAKER_14]: He's in Australia.

1248
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:35,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1249
01:24:35,764 --> 01:24:36,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And busy.

1250
01:24:36,565 --> 01:24:36,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1251
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:41,011
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, Thanks and keep up the independent, informative, and very funny show.

1252
01:24:41,071 --> 01:24:42,633
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is from MVH808.

1253
01:24:42,653 --> 01:24:45,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was very nice.

1254
01:24:46,237 --> 01:24:46,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1255
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:48,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

1256
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey folks at the OLR headquarters.

1257
01:24:51,559 --> 01:24:52,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got two quick questions here.

1258
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,820
[SPEAKER_10]: First is for Loki.

1259
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:57,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this show doesn't condone shady topics, but bear with me.

1260
01:24:58,224 --> 01:25:03,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I originally purchased a Wii key for my Wii because people in my home like to maul discs.

1261
01:25:03,428 --> 01:25:06,350
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd rather have backup copies lying around than $50 discs.

1262
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:09,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is your thoughts on this mod chip?

1263
01:25:10,113 --> 01:25:16,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Which Wii mod chip do you use and how hard is it to install one of these because I have not the slightest experience in soldering?

1264
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:22,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, how many Subway sandwiches with white bread would I have to bribe you with to install mine?

1265
01:25:22,347 --> 01:25:23,567
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have ham and cheese.

1266
01:25:26,269 --> 01:25:27,930
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I have a CycloWiz.

1267
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's CycloWiz V2.

1268
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:31,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1269
01:25:32,452 --> 01:25:33,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever the second series.

1270
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:35,573
[SPEAKER_14]: V version 2, I think, is what it was.

1271
01:25:36,774 --> 01:25:38,455
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really freaking tiny.

1272
01:25:39,415 --> 01:25:41,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was kind of scary trying to solder it.

1273
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:44,018
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing about the soldering, though, is...

1274
01:25:45,043 --> 01:25:53,967
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually, the one I have, it has a thing called quick solder and basically there's two points on the board that you fill up these holes with solder.

1275
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:58,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, you have to put flux on the board because the solder didn't want to stick to it at first.

1276
01:25:59,249 --> 01:26:12,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And then once you've got that on there, the chip is basically on there and what you can do is you tin two wires and solder them onto three really, really, really tiny points on the board and connect it to the chip.

1277
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:15,138
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't easy at all.

1278
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:19,420
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got lucky, I guess, that it worked just fine.

1279
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:22,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Just be careful, I guess.

1280
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:25,204
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't electrocute yourself.

1281
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:26,865
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to electrocute yourself.

1282
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:29,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, you're going to void your warranty.

1283
01:26:29,861 --> 01:26:34,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you will avoid your warranty, but to be honest, I wouldn't worry too much.

1284
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:37,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Just worry about bridging stuff that you shouldn't.

1285
01:26:38,804 --> 01:26:47,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Those three points on the board that you would be soldering wires to are really close together, so if you put too much solder on there, they will bridge each other, and it just won't work.

1286
01:26:48,448 --> 01:26:53,129
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can always take the solder off there and also make sure you don't lift any of the...

1287
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:00,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Traces on there as well by putting too much heat on there.

1288
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, you know, be careful.

1289
01:27:03,324 --> 01:27:05,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Use really, really, really small gauge wire.

1290
01:27:05,806 --> 01:27:09,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I think I used 30 gauge wire, I think.

1291
01:27:09,709 --> 01:27:10,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't remember.

1292
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:11,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, really tiny stuff.

1293
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:15,254
[SPEAKER_04]: NYR fan in chat confessed, I electrocuted myself once.

1294
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:16,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.

1295
01:27:16,555 --> 01:27:18,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, yeah, be careful with that stuff.

1296
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:19,857
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the Cyclo Wiz.

1297
01:27:20,138 --> 01:27:23,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they're the only ones that were running, you know, at

1298
01:27:23,598 --> 01:27:24,839
[SPEAKER_14]: We know about Nintendo and having especially...

1299
01:27:53,757 --> 01:27:56,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Assembled Stuff Yep, they love the tri-wing.

1300
01:27:57,459 --> 01:27:57,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why.

1301
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:19,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, one person wouldn't always be relied on to be there and you'd always have a fresh perspective from someone.

1302
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:23,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it was a really cool idea and figured I would pitch it over there to sit on.

1303
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:35,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do have guests fairly regularly, but... Okay, my mic's been totally off that whole time.

1304
01:28:35,869 --> 01:28:39,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You've probably been able to hear me a little bit.

1305
01:28:39,132 --> 01:28:39,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, where was I?

1306
01:28:40,093 --> 01:28:42,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, I was saying, I think the door is already kind of open.

1307
01:28:43,157 --> 01:28:43,899
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1308
01:28:54,232 --> 01:28:54,933
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1309
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:18,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But the door's always open to our guests.

1310
01:29:18,372 --> 01:29:24,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember back in the day, there were some people that it seemed like they were here every week for a while.

1311
01:29:24,436 --> 01:29:24,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1312
01:29:25,176 --> 01:29:27,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say like DDR Angel was here at least every other week for a while.

1313
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:30,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he was here, Shane was here every week.

1314
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just depends on what's going on that week.

1315
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:39,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more or less the, do I have anything else going on?

1316
01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:40,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to OLR.

1317
01:29:41,072 --> 01:29:43,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Olive Garden, Home of the NeverEnding Salads, and Breadsticks

1318
01:30:12,133 --> 01:30:12,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1319
01:30:12,713 --> 01:30:13,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Shall I move on?

1320
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:14,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1321
01:30:15,395 --> 01:30:16,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Rob, Jamie, and Loki.

1322
01:30:17,097 --> 01:30:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Just thought I would chime in with my thoughts about the game you played last week, one versus the chat room.

1323
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the week you weren't here, Jamie.

1324
01:30:24,982 --> 01:30:25,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that.

1325
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:28,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thought I'd fill that in.

1326
01:30:29,045 --> 01:30:29,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1327
01:30:29,826 --> 01:30:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It was badass and officially my favorite game of the show.

1328
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It allows all the live listeners a chance to play and win, not just the caller.

1329
01:30:36,616 --> 01:30:39,717
[SPEAKER_10]: For podcast people, it's fun, too, just because trivia gets you thinking.

1330
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:43,219
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I agree with that person who said there should be a Bimani edition.

1331
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:45,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, three random thoughts.

1332
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,260
[SPEAKER_10]: One, I laugh so hard at Ranma's little loop.

1333
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:51,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun with video, fun with video, fun with video remix.

1334
01:30:53,042 --> 01:30:53,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1335
01:30:54,443 --> 01:31:00,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Two, every time you guys spot a fly in the studio, you should all give a girly squeal on the count of three just for shits and giggles.

1336
01:31:00,717 --> 01:31:02,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been that bad lately, actually.

1337
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:02,839
[SPEAKER_10]: This one's for me.

1338
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:09,525
[SPEAKER_10]: It says you should call your mom and talk about the Wii with her on the show just because Rob's talk with his mom a while back was hilarious.

1339
01:31:10,206 --> 01:31:11,347
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, enough with this email.

1340
01:31:11,407 --> 01:31:12,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be live soon.

1341
01:31:12,608 --> 01:31:13,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That's from Osfer.

1342
01:31:13,849 --> 01:31:19,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I would say we should call my mama, but it's a quarter to ten right now in Alabama.

1343
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:24,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, I think my mom would be awake, but she would be winding down.

1344
01:31:24,258 --> 01:31:25,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll save it for Mother's Day.

1345
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:27,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, yeah, let's call my mom on Mother's Day.

1346
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:29,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Mom!

1347
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:30,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in jail!

1348
01:31:30,712 --> 01:31:31,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait.

1349
01:31:31,872 --> 01:31:33,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in Rob's garage.

1350
01:31:33,753 --> 01:31:34,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of like jail.

1351
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:38,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Only more comfy, with better insulation and computers.

1352
01:31:39,014 --> 01:31:41,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Gold Banjo in chat says, I missed that one versus the chatroom game.

1353
01:31:41,755 --> 01:31:42,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys do it again.

1354
01:31:42,695 --> 01:31:43,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It will come back.

1355
01:31:43,535 --> 01:31:45,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The reception was very, very positive.

1356
01:31:45,056 --> 01:31:45,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do that game again.

1357
01:31:46,976 --> 01:31:47,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email!

1358
01:31:47,616 --> 01:31:48,697
[SPEAKER_04]: With more music, of course.

1359
01:31:48,797 --> 01:31:50,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, with more variety of music next time.

1360
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:51,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email?

1361
01:31:52,218 --> 01:31:52,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1362
01:31:53,098 --> 01:31:53,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OLR Croop.

1363
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:54,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1364
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:33,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm at least going to read the email and then I'll kick you so you can brace for it.

1365
01:32:34,502 --> 01:32:35,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is GS68, by the way.

1366
01:32:36,962 --> 01:32:37,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you want to do the honors.

1367
01:32:38,482 --> 01:32:39,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'll kick him.

1368
01:32:40,283 --> 01:32:46,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, I would just like to give a shout out to Orange Lounge chat room for being the best friends I've ever met.

1369
01:32:47,084 --> 01:32:52,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, you guys get crazy sometimes, but it's that craziness that keeps me distracted from whatever is depressing me.

1370
01:32:53,556 --> 01:32:56,377
[SPEAKER_10]: and if the depression is too big, it's nice to have an outlet for that.

1371
01:32:56,837 --> 01:33:01,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, even when there's no show, I lurk in the chatroom just to see who's inside and join in whatever's getting discussed.

1372
01:33:01,998 --> 01:33:08,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say that you guys, and girls, are a great bunch and make up a good 60-70% of the fun during the live show and that I love you all.

1373
01:33:09,201 --> 01:33:10,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww, that's sweet.

1374
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:11,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww, that's nice.

1375
01:33:11,581 --> 01:33:12,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Violin music, violin music.

1376
01:33:13,562 --> 01:33:18,083
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are what set the difference between listening to this show live and listening to it via podcast.

1377
01:33:18,563 --> 01:33:20,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's to many more episodes of Hilarious Chatroom Moments.

1378
01:33:21,903 --> 01:33:24,705
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it says, takes a shot of water, I guess.

1379
01:33:24,785 --> 01:33:26,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm running out of non-alcoholic drink ideas.

1380
01:33:27,766 --> 01:33:29,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, great show, OLR and DMN.

1381
01:33:29,527 --> 01:33:33,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Pound Orange Lounge, for keeping me sane through this Sunday and Wednesday nights.

1382
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:34,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Love, GS68.

1383
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very sweet email.

1384
01:33:36,971 --> 01:33:47,777
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, comments like that and the little groupies we have in Orange Lounge, our chat room and everything, just, you know, keep us going and let us know we're not wasting our time here, that we really are...

1385
01:33:49,008 --> 01:33:51,310
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, letting people have a good time on Sunday nights.

1386
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just about having fun.

1387
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:53,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

1388
01:33:54,112 --> 01:33:54,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1389
01:33:55,473 --> 01:33:56,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, next email?

1390
01:33:57,255 --> 01:33:57,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1391
01:33:58,316 --> 01:34:02,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Sky, DarkSakura, and last but definitely least, Loki.

1392
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:03,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry I had to say that.

1393
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:03,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you, too.

1394
01:34:05,962 --> 01:34:16,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I live in Australia, and I don't know if you've noticed over there, but I've become very irritated at the fact that the Japanese gaming companies such as Square Enix see fit-to-release games like Kingdom Hearts and a few...

1395
01:34:18,482 --> 01:34:26,609
[SPEAKER_10]: and a few months later think to themselves, hey, I know how we can rip off some people and piss off foreigners and then release something like Kingdom Hearts Final Mix.

1396
01:34:28,011 --> 01:34:36,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they realize it, but not only are they missing out on an incredibly large fan base, but they're leaving a great big gaping hole in plots for us.

1397
01:34:36,859 --> 01:34:39,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that they may be busy, but really, think of the children.

1398
01:34:40,282 --> 01:34:41,583
[SPEAKER_10]: That was in bold text, by the way.

1399
01:34:42,848 --> 01:34:53,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I'd like to point out that I'm trying to spread the word to every online community I'm in so that we can reach our goal with eye of judgment, or as it's more commonly known, that piece of trash would rather burn.

1400
01:34:54,558 --> 01:35:06,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for something to keep me laughing on the best in the morning with numerous strange looks, and as I'm listening to the podcast on my PSP, I shall try to get on the chat room one morning and join in on the fun.

1401
01:35:07,248 --> 01:35:08,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You're sincerely, One Winged Angel.

1402
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:11,632
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1403
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:15,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear we're making the wheels on the bus go round and round.

1404
01:35:15,271 --> 01:35:15,832
[SPEAKER_10]: We have more.

1405
01:35:16,172 --> 01:35:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1406
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:21,514
[SPEAKER_10]: But this one's actually a poem.

1407
01:35:22,755 --> 01:35:24,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yay, poetic emails.

1408
01:35:24,095 --> 01:35:25,216
[SPEAKER_10]: By Strip Mahjong.

1409
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:27,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that name.

1410
01:35:27,257 --> 01:35:27,777
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1411
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:34,300
[SPEAKER_10]: This is called The Lay of OLR, or Damn It, I Wish I Had Remembered to Upload Some Extra Podcasts Last Night.

1412
01:35:36,241 --> 01:35:40,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I sit and stare at my computer screen and eat my workday lunch of fine cuisine.

1413
01:35:41,127 --> 01:35:45,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I browse through my podcast list, which grows thin, wondering where my OLR has been.

1414
01:35:45,992 --> 01:35:47,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Thursday already?

1415
01:35:47,134 --> 01:35:52,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Far too long since last I heard that OLR theme song or the classic Game of the Week segment.

1416
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,481
[SPEAKER_10]: No FUs either.

1417
01:35:54,642 --> 01:35:55,843
[SPEAKER_10]: At traffic, none vent.

1418
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:59,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I direct my browser to the website and reminded of why I'm in this plight.

1419
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:01,570
[SPEAKER_10]: The OLR crew could not meet Sunday.

1420
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:04,751
[SPEAKER_10]: for that real life thing had to get in their way.

1421
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:17,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I sit back in my chair and give a sigh longing for this show on which I rely to help ease the pain of a boring job and yet no anger I can feel at Rob, DarkSakura, or Loki since these three give us so much entertainment for free.

1422
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:24,664
[SPEAKER_10]: And so to next week's show I now look toward but for the moment damn I'm freaking bored.

1423
01:36:26,025 --> 01:36:26,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

1424
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:27,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Well here we are.

1425
01:36:28,286 --> 01:36:28,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back.

1426
01:36:28,887 --> 01:36:29,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1427
01:36:29,207 --> 01:36:29,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Heart, heart, heart.

1428
01:36:30,508 --> 01:36:32,309
[SPEAKER_10]: And then someone wants us to put a song in rotation.

1429
01:36:33,393 --> 01:36:33,913
[SPEAKER_04]: What song's that?

1430
01:36:35,214 --> 01:36:39,877
[SPEAKER_10]: The Elder School's 4 intro song.

1431
01:36:40,817 --> 01:36:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

1432
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already there.

1433
01:36:42,638 --> 01:36:43,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already in rotation.

1434
01:36:43,839 --> 01:36:46,641
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that you're probably not listening quite long enough to actually hear it.

1435
01:36:47,861 --> 01:36:48,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually there.

1436
01:36:50,043 --> 01:36:57,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But does that mean they want to hear it on the show, or they want to hear it in the 24-hour rotation that's on the station when we're not here?

1437
01:36:57,307 --> 01:37:02,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking in the rotation, because, I mean, just suggesting a song to put in is what it looked like.

1438
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mailbox just went down, so that's the last one I'm going to read.

1439
01:37:06,102 --> 01:37:07,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here, I'll give you a little taste.

1440
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:13,348
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, that's all you get.

1441
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,530
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, wonderful.

1442
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:18,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like the Wi-Fi might be down in studio again.

1443
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:18,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It just came back.

1444
01:37:18,832 --> 01:37:20,193
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a perfect time for that to happen.

1445
01:37:20,994 --> 01:37:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1446
01:37:22,529 --> 01:37:27,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, the computer that broadcasts out the signal for Live 365 and all that stuff is wired.

1447
01:37:27,954 --> 01:37:34,599
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a ginormous wire that runs all the way out here into the garage just for this computer so that we don't have those types of problems on here.

1448
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:39,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line.

1449
01:37:39,809 --> 01:37:42,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has to do with Guitar Hero 3.

1450
01:37:43,231 --> 01:37:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision is going to be offering refunds for the Wii version of Guitar Hero 3.

1451
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, all over that whole sound issue.

1452
01:37:49,835 --> 01:37:52,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember about how the sound was a mess?

1453
01:37:52,356 --> 01:37:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't actually the surround sound or whatever.

1454
01:37:54,418 --> 01:37:56,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all mono sound or what have you.

1455
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:00,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision is offering refunds for that.

1456
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:03,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do not want to actually replace your disc...

1457
01:38:04,443 --> 01:38:06,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually replace the disc with money.

1458
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a refund.

1459
01:38:08,046 --> 01:38:12,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if that's something that interests you, check Activision's site for more details.

1460
01:38:13,511 --> 01:38:16,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, seriously, just stick with the game.

1461
01:38:16,614 --> 01:38:17,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's fine.

1462
01:38:19,036 --> 01:38:19,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand.

1463
01:38:19,656 --> 01:38:21,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of y'all have those big sound systems and things like that.

1464
01:38:22,519 --> 01:38:26,402
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to cut back on all that.

1465
01:38:26,892 --> 01:38:30,533
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for your telephone calls.

1466
01:38:30,653 --> 01:38:36,935
[SPEAKER_04]: The number to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1467
01:38:36,976 --> 01:38:38,616
[SPEAKER_04]: The phones are open now.

1468
01:38:38,676 --> 01:38:39,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I just turned them on.

1469
01:38:40,317 --> 01:38:42,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and give us a call, and we will talk to you.

1470
01:38:42,938 --> 01:38:50,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a couple calls tonight, not a whole lot of them, but I'm sure some of our listeners have some things to say about things like DJ Hero, maybe the XNA.

1471
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about that.

1472
01:38:53,174 --> 01:38:57,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, while we wait for the buffer and for folks to get the phone number and call in, do we have any last-minute stories?

1473
01:38:58,097 --> 01:38:58,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1474
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:04,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Magic the Gathering is coming to PC, Mac, and Xbox Live Arcade.

1475
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:09,504
[SPEAKER_14]: So suck it, I have judgment.

1476
01:39:10,164 --> 01:39:14,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft, of course, and Epic announced Gears of War 2 coming November 2008.

1477
01:39:15,607 --> 01:39:21,911
[SPEAKER_14]: No word on the details of what's going to be in that, but of course the Unreal 3 engine has been enhanced and all fun stuff like that.

1478
01:39:22,705 --> 01:39:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to a call.

1479
01:39:23,605 --> 01:39:24,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

1480
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:24,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1481
01:39:26,287 --> 01:39:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, this is Rostio UT.

1482
01:39:28,288 --> 01:39:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, Rostio UT.

1483
01:39:29,548 --> 01:39:30,209
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind?

1484
01:39:31,769 --> 01:39:33,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much, not much.

1485
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,771
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just a few things.

1486
01:39:34,851 --> 01:39:37,632
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, yes, I was going to mention the whole EA deal.

1487
01:39:38,212 --> 01:39:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I was incredibly relieved to hear that they rejected EA's offer.

1488
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:50,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we all know that it's...

1489
01:39:51,002 --> 01:40:01,290
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's basically they're trying to get rid of the NBA 2K franchise because the NBA has so far been resistant towards exclusivity talks and this is pretty much all they have left.

1490
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1491
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: What better way to get rid of your competition than buy them out?

1492
01:40:07,574 --> 01:40:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's good to see that Take-Two realizes that sticking around and keeping their company is going to make them more money in the long run.

1493
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:18,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They already had a hit with Bioshock

1494
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,562
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have an enormous hit with GTA 4.

1495
01:40:23,683 --> 01:40:26,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And NBA 2K is doing amazingly well.

1496
01:40:26,846 --> 01:40:29,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's really no reason to jump ship just yet.

1497
01:40:33,012 --> 01:40:34,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just worried that... I'm sorry?

1498
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, I just think EA, it just creates such a monopoly out there in the marketplace.

1499
01:40:39,178 --> 01:40:39,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1500
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're starting to get to this point where you've got EA, Activision, Nintendo...

1501
01:40:45,433 --> 01:40:50,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega, Namco, Konami There's less than 10 at this point, you know what I mean?

1502
01:40:50,935 --> 01:41:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like back in the day there were a million It hasn't gotten that bad yet, but that is sort of the direction we're going and it is sort of sad because you see that happen and pretty much innovative game ideas would be impossible under that environment We all saw what EA did to Origin, Bullfrog and Westwood

1503
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:18,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, people just have to remember that they also don't have to buy Madden every single year.

1504
01:41:21,255 --> 01:41:25,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is, I don't think it's gamers who buy Madden.

1505
01:41:25,658 --> 01:41:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just sports fans.

1506
01:41:26,938 --> 01:41:28,139
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably don't buy anything else.

1507
01:41:29,019 --> 01:41:31,301
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, which is why EA doesn't really have to try.

1508
01:41:32,661 --> 01:41:33,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're absolutely right.

1509
01:41:33,722 --> 01:41:38,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the whole reason an Xbox 360 Core Edition exists is for those people.

1510
01:41:38,324 --> 01:41:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people that bought an Xbox 360 for Madden and that's it.

1511
01:41:41,826 --> 01:41:42,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1512
01:41:42,467 --> 01:41:42,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1513
01:41:43,228 --> 01:41:47,652
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's it and that's not going to be a market for third parties and I think most third parties realize that.

1514
01:41:50,314 --> 01:41:52,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's probably what, two million people?

1515
01:41:52,695 --> 01:41:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Madden sells every year, like a million and a half, two million every year?

1516
01:41:57,565 --> 01:42:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the only people that buy Madden are those type of people.

1517
01:42:02,386 --> 01:42:04,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a certain percentage.

1518
01:42:04,747 --> 01:42:15,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably there's a percentage of that million that buy nothing but Madden and maybe the other occasional sports game like the basketball game or the street or underground editions and racing games here and there.

1519
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1520
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:24,732
[SPEAKER_06]: That's clearly not the majority of the gaming audience and I would really hate to see the entire industry screwed up by that.

1521
01:42:25,768 --> 01:42:27,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I do see a silver lining.

1522
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:34,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We all saw what happens when the actual talent leaves and they rebrand.

1523
01:42:35,837 --> 01:42:41,161
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember correctly, Molyneux was part of Origin originally, if I remember correctly, and then he went on to form Lionhead.

1524
01:42:41,862 --> 01:42:42,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you are correct.

1525
01:42:44,244 --> 01:42:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're going to see that eventually, especially with a lot of the studios like Bioware.

1526
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:51,130
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do a lot of...

1527
01:42:52,173 --> 01:42:52,773
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of sequels.

1528
01:42:52,813 --> 01:42:55,715
[SPEAKER_06]: They might just stick around to complete Mass Effect and then be out.

1529
01:42:56,195 --> 01:42:57,436
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just pack up and rebrand.

1530
01:42:57,476 --> 01:42:58,837
[SPEAKER_06]: You see that a lot in this industry.

1531
01:42:59,237 --> 01:42:59,977
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.

1532
01:43:00,037 --> 01:43:05,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You do see a lot of guys getting up and leaving.

1533
01:43:05,841 --> 01:43:07,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you wanted to comment on on tonight's show?

1534
01:43:09,302 --> 01:43:12,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a personal note about the show itself.

1535
01:43:12,844 --> 01:43:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I do enjoy the show, but I do have to say this.

1536
01:43:16,346 --> 01:43:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I do... I do wonder why...

1537
01:43:22,659 --> 01:43:26,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we get so much into the mod talk, like the letter segment.

1538
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:28,422
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that guy was making a flimsy excuse.

1539
01:43:28,482 --> 01:43:30,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know he wants to see a Wii Games.

1540
01:43:30,703 --> 01:43:36,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't see why you guys have to serve, basically, thieves.

1541
01:43:37,807 --> 01:43:38,108
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

1542
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:45,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That always troubled me, and that always, you know, as much as I like the show, that always sort of tugged at me a little bit, you know?

1543
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:56,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I think from our perspective, this show is kind of about the gaming community and all the things that are going on in the community, the good stuff and the stuff kind of behind closed doors.

1544
01:43:56,482 --> 01:43:59,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether that guy was being honest or not, you know, I suppose we'll never know.

1545
01:44:00,083 --> 01:44:07,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it is important sometimes to talk about what goes on in the whole, you know, dark side and gaming and all that stuff.

1546
01:44:07,472 --> 01:44:12,333
[SPEAKER_04]: to kind of see how the companies respond to that or how they don't.

1547
01:44:12,673 --> 01:44:21,275
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, for instance, I find this whole thing back and forth with Sony and the people that hack the PSP back and forth, I find that whole thing hilarious, honestly.

1548
01:44:21,335 --> 01:44:27,756
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way, I shouldn't say, like, hilarious, but I find it fascinating how constantly Sony patches it and somebody breaks it.

1549
01:44:27,796 --> 01:44:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just that whole... It's so interesting to me.

1550
01:44:31,237 --> 01:44:35,298
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly... I can certainly see where someone would find it interesting.

1551
01:44:35,358 --> 01:44:37,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find it disgusting because...

1552
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,002
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the turnaround.

1553
01:44:39,042 --> 01:44:44,126
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP software doesn't sell as well as it should, at least until recently.

1554
01:44:44,146 --> 01:44:46,348
[SPEAKER_06]: There are good PSP games, and they don't do well.

1555
01:44:47,028 --> 01:44:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you see the same thing is going to start happening with the DS as the R4 gets more popular.

1556
01:44:56,536 --> 01:45:00,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, you know?

1557
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:06,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think at the same time, though, us not talking about it is not going to make it go away, so...

1558
01:45:07,123 --> 01:45:14,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not going to make it go away, but the last thing anyone needs to be doing is giving tips of all things.

1559
01:45:15,345 --> 01:45:17,726
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

1560
01:45:18,286 --> 01:45:18,626
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1561
01:45:18,786 --> 01:45:21,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've heard your opinion, and hopefully you've heard ours.

1562
01:45:22,027 --> 01:45:23,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks so much for the call, as always.

1563
01:45:24,827 --> 01:45:25,047
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1564
01:45:25,087 --> 01:45:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, buddy.

1565
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:26,908
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1566
01:45:26,928 --> 01:45:27,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1567
01:45:27,308 --> 01:45:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1568
01:45:28,528 --> 01:45:28,868
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1569
01:45:29,288 --> 01:45:33,889
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1570
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:35,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1571
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:35,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1572
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Gear68.

1573
01:45:37,008 --> 01:45:37,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's on your mind?

1574
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:43,793
[SPEAKER_05]: About DJ Hero, I'm pretty... Yes, about DJ Hero.

1575
01:45:44,813 --> 01:45:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling it's going to succeed pretty well.

1576
01:45:46,414 --> 01:45:50,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Guitar Hero took off pretty well.

1577
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:54,040
[SPEAKER_05]: The drum part of Rock Band is getting a bit of attention.

1578
01:45:55,521 --> 01:45:57,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm pretty sure it's going to go for DJ Hero.

1579
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:00,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there potential there?

1580
01:46:00,424 --> 01:46:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would say.

1581
01:46:01,805 --> 01:46:04,747
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm waiting to see the official E3 announcement.

1582
01:46:05,014 --> 01:46:05,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1583
01:46:05,435 --> 01:46:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.

1584
01:46:06,397 --> 01:46:09,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Assuming that it's going to be the Beatmania spinoff that we're all thinking it is.

1585
01:46:10,645 --> 01:46:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Which it may not be.

1586
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:17,082
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a distinct possibility this is not the Beatmania clone people think it is.

1587
01:46:17,762 --> 01:46:21,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be more along the lines of Kraken DJ, which if you've played that game is drastically different.

1588
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I realize both games involve turntables, but the play between them is so, so different.

1589
01:46:26,307 --> 01:46:26,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows?

1590
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:29,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there is no controller that comes with this game.

1591
01:46:29,869 --> 01:46:31,310
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a lot of speculation.

1592
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:38,074
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are thinking, oh, well, they stole, quote unquote, I'm using that term loosely, they stole Guitar Freaks, so they're going to steal Beatmania now.

1593
01:46:38,114 --> 01:46:38,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know for sure.

1594
01:46:39,015 --> 01:46:42,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have a damn good reason to believe that to be true, but we don't know for sure.

1595
01:46:45,237 --> 01:46:47,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, there's a chance that it might flop.

1596
01:46:47,758 --> 01:46:49,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me, look at Beat Media US.

1597
01:46:49,518 --> 01:46:50,499
[SPEAKER_05]: That failed horribly.

1598
01:46:51,379 --> 01:46:52,079
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

1599
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually didn't.

1600
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:58,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of folks say that, you know, Beat Media, oh, they saw it on the clearance shelves and all that stuff.

1601
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:02,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you, it met Konami's expectations of what the game was going to sell.

1602
01:47:02,604 --> 01:47:04,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Why they didn't make a sequel, your guess is as good as mine.

1603
01:47:05,745 --> 01:47:13,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought for a while there, from what I, you know, just observe at different things, I thought Konami was planning a sequel here in the US for whatever reason they chose not to do it.

1604
01:47:15,578 --> 01:47:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, too bad the original came in limited releases, so now we can't find an American Beatmania controller.

1605
01:47:24,102 --> 01:47:34,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I tried one over at E3, I mean, Final Mate, sorry, and the controller was like light years ahead of the Japanese one.

1606
01:47:35,307 --> 01:47:38,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they made improvements on it on its way over, so, and, you know, for a lot of the...

1607
01:47:38,882 --> 01:47:47,768
[SPEAKER_04]: and hardcore Bomani community fans, the whole reason to buy Beatmania US was it was sort of a greatest hits with a better controller for a decent price.

1608
01:47:50,711 --> 01:47:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's kind of a bummer they never did release a sequel here in the US, but at the same time, I would hope maybe they have bigger and better things planned, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

1609
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:02,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1610
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that guitar revolution pattern that they came up with last year or the year before.

1611
01:48:10,731 --> 01:48:14,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they follow a patent, then there's got to be some use for it.

1612
01:48:14,835 --> 01:48:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Where there's smoke, there's fire?

1613
01:48:15,996 --> 01:48:16,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1614
01:48:16,897 --> 01:48:17,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1615
01:48:18,499 --> 01:48:25,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hope that Konami's going to surprise us, but I've said this to Konami indirectly on this show before, and I'll say it again.

1616
01:48:25,726 --> 01:48:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not going to do it, someone else will, and I think this whole trademark thing just kind of goes to show that.

1617
01:48:30,812 --> 01:48:32,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Konami should be...

1618
01:48:33,148 --> 01:48:44,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe there's people that go, oh, this wouldn't do well in the U.S., and then it's going to do well because they didn't innovate it for the U.S., I guess is what I'm saying.

1619
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:45,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1620
01:48:45,099 --> 01:48:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've had this conversation a million times on the program, so that's all.

1621
01:48:49,442 --> 01:48:51,925
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, GS68?

1622
01:48:51,945 --> 01:48:53,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I finally got Apollo Justice this week.

1623
01:48:54,187 --> 01:48:54,587
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

1624
01:48:55,811 --> 01:48:56,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good so far.

1625
01:48:56,812 --> 01:49:10,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the perceived system, which is basically where you, during a witness's testimony, you look at their, you look at their, you find nervous habits during their testimony and point them out.

1626
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:14,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because, you know, when they lie, they make those kind of habits and such.

1627
01:49:16,444 --> 01:49:20,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of good things about Apollo Justice, but right now I'm too busy with Lost Odyssey, but I will check it out at some point.

1628
01:49:21,328 --> 01:49:23,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read the, like, the...

1629
01:49:24,278 --> 01:49:25,919
[SPEAKER_05]: The cases aren't written very well.

1630
01:49:26,019 --> 01:49:39,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, case two wasn't... I thought, though I kind of disagree, the first case was pretty good, and the third one too, and I'm partway through the fourth one, but second case, eh.

1631
01:49:39,888 --> 01:49:44,510
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, every Ace Attorney game has its crappy cases.

1632
01:49:44,651 --> 01:49:45,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's hit and miss.

1633
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:46,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hit and miss.

1634
01:49:46,352 --> 01:49:46,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

1635
01:49:47,092 --> 01:49:49,153
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as overall you have fun, that's what it's all about.

1636
01:49:49,494 --> 01:49:53,016
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, GS6TO, we've got to let you go to get to a couple other calls, but thanks so much for calling.

1637
01:49:53,036 --> 01:49:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1638
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:54,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1639
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:54,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1640
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:56,271
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1641
01:49:56,311 --> 01:49:58,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take one more call if anybody wants to call in.

1642
01:49:58,412 --> 01:50:00,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype or our username.

1643
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:04,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That is our username on Skype or our phone number.

1644
01:50:04,235 --> 01:50:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1645
01:50:06,736 --> 01:50:07,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we got one more call.

1646
01:50:08,437 --> 01:50:09,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1647
01:50:09,237 --> 01:50:09,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1648
01:50:10,558 --> 01:50:12,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt.

1649
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind, my friend?

1650
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I want to call about two things.

1651
01:50:17,521 --> 01:50:20,303
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I want to talk about the XNA Club.

1652
01:50:20,683 --> 01:50:21,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's up?

1653
01:50:23,055 --> 01:50:24,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great idea.

1654
01:50:26,436 --> 01:50:36,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy that these big companies are starting to go all toward user-created content and all that.

1655
01:50:36,718 --> 01:50:41,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what's going to change the gaming industry pretty soon.

1656
01:50:41,919 --> 01:50:42,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1657
01:50:42,379 --> 01:50:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is something big.

1658
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,741
[SPEAKER_01]: To tell a personal story, I have a friend who's currently working on an XNA game.

1659
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:55,159
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it in his spare time.

1660
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,440
[SPEAKER_01]: He has his own job.

1661
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:02,622
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a computer engineer, and he kind of wants to get into the business.

1662
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:07,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think doing this is going to kind of get him into the business.

1663
01:51:08,064 --> 01:51:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: That is absolutely a way to get noticed.

1664
01:51:10,084 --> 01:51:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be some great talent discovered from this.

1665
01:51:12,245 --> 01:51:15,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I think this is the beginning of a new chapter in gaming.

1666
01:51:15,786 --> 01:51:18,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to keep talking this up, but I think this really is that big.

1667
01:51:19,007 --> 01:51:19,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

1668
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It will play out that big.

1669
01:51:21,601 --> 01:51:23,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like independent movies.

1670
01:51:25,022 --> 01:51:28,583
[SPEAKER_01]: The greatest things are not necessarily the most known things.

1671
01:51:29,043 --> 01:51:31,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.

1672
01:51:32,264 --> 01:51:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And to say that all user-created content is garbage, I cannot agree any less with that.

1673
01:51:42,607 --> 01:51:46,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last topic I wanted to bring up was, I'm not sure if you guys saw this, but...

1674
01:51:48,266 --> 01:51:51,929
[SPEAKER_01]: ESPN has signed a deal with Major League Gaming.

1675
01:51:52,609 --> 01:51:54,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody linked me to that earlier.

1676
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, tell us a little more about that.

1677
01:51:57,953 --> 01:52:00,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a quick glance at it.

1678
01:52:00,555 --> 01:52:02,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Knight sent me the link.

1679
01:52:02,136 --> 01:52:04,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I just glanced at it.

1680
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:06,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1681
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:08,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just getting a little ridiculous.

1682
01:52:09,561 --> 01:52:17,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this will bring up the whole debate about whether or not gaming is an actual sport and all that, but

1683
01:52:17,904 --> 01:52:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about in the way it's portrayed, I think.

1684
01:52:20,806 --> 01:52:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the way it's kind of handled and the way it's done.

1685
01:52:23,568 --> 01:52:26,970
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a little bit too sensationalistic, then it's going to be crap.

1686
01:52:27,351 --> 01:52:31,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they take it somewhat seriously, I think it'll be kind of cool.

1687
01:52:32,154 --> 01:52:32,454
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1688
01:52:32,574 --> 01:52:41,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I've always kind of, I don't want to say this, I feel embarrassed to say, but I always kind of saw DDR was, in a sense, a sport.

1689
01:52:41,881 --> 01:52:42,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1690
01:52:43,269 --> 01:52:50,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a long time ago that they were talking about bringing DDR to the X Games, but nothing came of that.

1691
01:52:52,095 --> 01:52:52,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1692
01:52:52,455 --> 01:52:54,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's a little ridiculous.

1693
01:52:54,517 --> 01:53:08,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a sports fan, I'm kind of annoyed that we're going to be able to see kids talk trash with Halo, and meanwhile we can't see hockey games on ESPN.

1694
01:53:08,726 --> 01:53:09,847
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's...

1695
01:53:10,948 --> 01:53:12,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Only, that's, it's only with me.

1696
01:53:12,749 --> 01:53:14,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this will be delegated to the Ocho.

1697
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:15,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1698
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1699
01:53:17,711 --> 01:53:17,991
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1700
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:20,392
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt, thanks so much for your call.

1701
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:22,413
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to wrap it up, so have a good one, okay?

1702
01:53:22,433 --> 01:53:23,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what?

1703
01:53:24,374 --> 01:53:25,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I said have a good one.

1704
01:53:26,054 --> 01:53:26,414
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1705
01:53:26,554 --> 01:53:27,175
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye-bye.

1706
01:53:27,815 --> 01:53:28,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try.

1707
01:53:29,156 --> 01:53:33,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm definitely starting to feel the weight of the show carrying down.

1708
01:53:33,157 --> 01:53:35,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's time to start to wrap up so I can take more drugs.

1709
01:53:35,878 --> 01:53:38,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, drugs, los drogas.

1710
01:53:38,739 --> 01:53:39,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All legal ones, of course.

1711
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:41,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Dayquil.

1712
01:53:41,915 --> 01:53:43,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be thinking I'm into that shady stuff.

1713
01:53:44,277 --> 01:53:45,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, any other last minute stories?

1714
01:53:45,758 --> 01:53:47,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Ninja Gaiden 2.

1715
01:53:47,559 --> 01:53:50,842
[SPEAKER_14]: That's scheduled now for June 3rd in the US.

1716
01:53:50,982 --> 01:54:03,411
[SPEAKER_14]: It will also have a cool new feature where you can do basically record your action or killing of things so you can play them back and I'm assuming upload them to friends and that kind of thing.

1717
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:05,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool.

1718
01:54:06,413 --> 01:54:10,116
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a neat little feature that they're adding into this game

1719
01:54:11,156 --> 01:54:13,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom Blocks, that's that first game by Spielberg.

1720
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:29,332
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to have a head tracking option in there where you can use the second Wii Remote to basically track your head movements much like that demonstration that we saw online.

1721
01:54:29,372 --> 01:54:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking, that YouTube thing that guy did.

1722
01:54:31,274 --> 01:54:31,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1723
01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:32,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

1724
01:54:32,611 --> 01:54:41,094
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll need to have, of course, some sort of visor with two infrared lights on it or a wireless sensor bar or something that you use in that sense.

1725
01:54:41,514 --> 01:54:44,755
[SPEAKER_14]: That you have to build yourself, but it will support it, though.

1726
01:54:45,215 --> 01:54:47,236
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of a nifty little Easter egg.

1727
01:54:48,197 --> 01:54:53,198
[SPEAKER_14]: A game that really wants me to get back into playing MMOs.

1728
01:54:54,099 --> 01:54:57,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Real Time World showed off a game during GDC called All Points Bulletin.

1729
01:54:59,093 --> 01:55:00,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Just fucking awesome.

1730
01:55:00,513 --> 01:55:04,015
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row, the MMO.

1731
01:55:04,655 --> 01:55:06,295
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's kind of weird, though.

1732
01:55:06,575 --> 01:55:08,756
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no leveling or anything in the game.

1733
01:55:08,936 --> 01:55:16,539
[SPEAKER_14]: You either, of course, play on the side of the law or the criminal side, and you have to do organized crime.

1734
01:55:17,379 --> 01:55:20,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, you start off the game wearing normal clothes and stuff.

1735
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:27,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And they had a pretty cool game that they made up, the Geek Squad or whatever, with Miyamoto in there, and that was kind of funny.

1736
01:55:28,414 --> 01:55:32,436
[SPEAKER_14]: But it has a really cool character creator and that kind of stuff.

1737
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:36,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want to play this game, but I don't like it very much.

1738
01:55:36,578 --> 01:55:36,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

1739
01:55:38,679 --> 01:55:40,760
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of a little bit of controversy here.

1740
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:47,303
[SPEAKER_14]: British Magazine is unveiling Xbox Live's GoldenEye info this week.

1741
01:55:47,543 --> 01:55:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that was debunked, that it was a concept thing that they were going to be showing.

1742
01:55:51,885 --> 01:55:53,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't the real deal.

1743
01:55:54,066 --> 01:55:57,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out later that it was bogus.

1744
01:55:58,106 --> 01:55:59,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks cool either way.

1745
01:55:59,467 --> 01:56:00,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

1746
01:56:01,468 --> 01:56:05,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely fueling the fanboy flames of our GoldenEye desires on 360.

1747
01:56:07,733 --> 01:56:08,273
[SPEAKER_04]: No surprises.

1748
01:56:09,654 --> 01:56:10,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1749
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:13,597
[SPEAKER_14]: This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we're getting Triggerheart Accelia.

1750
01:56:15,498 --> 01:56:20,081
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those bullet hell games that should be coming out for 800 Microsoft points.

1751
01:56:20,441 --> 01:56:21,302
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty exciting.

1752
01:56:22,237 --> 01:56:29,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on Rock Band, we're getting a Nine Inch Nails three-pack, including March of the Pigs, The Collector, and The Perfect Drug.

1753
01:56:29,723 --> 01:56:32,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, if you'll remember, that was actually one of the packs that was supposed to be coming in March.

1754
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:35,347
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1755
01:56:35,367 --> 01:56:36,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Dates get moved around sometimes.

1756
01:56:36,808 --> 01:56:36,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1757
01:56:37,649 --> 01:56:50,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, some weird company, Shenzhen Nodging Technology Company Limited, made a Famicom cart for Final Fantasy VII.

1758
01:56:53,046 --> 01:57:01,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's fully playable and they've got all sorts of stuff from the game and of course done in the Final Fantasy looks like two or three graphics.

1759
01:57:01,929 --> 01:57:03,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Has this been ROMed yet?

1760
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:06,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1761
01:57:06,671 --> 01:57:09,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably like those Tekken on the NES cartridges.

1762
01:57:09,571 --> 01:57:13,053
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like Final Fantasy, like one of the older Final Fantasy games.

1763
01:57:14,133 --> 01:57:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1764
01:57:15,873 --> 01:57:16,614
[SPEAKER_04]: What a waste of time.

1765
01:57:17,494 --> 01:57:17,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1766
01:57:19,294 --> 01:57:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there really that big of a market for more

1767
01:57:21,385 --> 01:57:22,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Games on the NES.

1768
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:31,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess those consoles still exist in some households, but most people, at least in these parts, are still having to... This is specifically Advent Children, isn't it?

1769
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:35,130
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's Advent Children, but yeah.

1770
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:37,071
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be cool.

1771
01:57:37,691 --> 01:57:38,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1772
01:57:39,072 --> 01:57:39,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1773
01:57:39,492 --> 01:57:41,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody probably just stole the logo off the wrong thing.

1774
01:57:42,133 --> 01:57:43,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Without bothering to Photoshop it.

1775
01:57:44,414 --> 01:57:44,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1776
01:57:45,454 --> 01:57:45,834
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1777
01:57:46,475 --> 01:57:47,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um...

1778
01:57:47,751 --> 01:57:51,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if DarkSakura doesn't have any last-minute stories, I don't have any either.

1779
01:57:51,894 --> 01:57:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is one more thing we just could not finish the show if we did not do.

1780
01:57:55,497 --> 01:57:56,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a last-minute story.

1781
01:57:56,818 --> 01:57:57,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do?

1782
01:57:57,579 --> 01:57:58,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, then let's take it.

1783
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a milkshake.

1784
01:57:59,861 --> 01:58:00,581
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a story.

1785
01:58:01,302 --> 01:58:01,942
[SPEAKER_11]: It's news to me.

1786
01:58:02,223 --> 01:58:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1787
01:58:02,523 --> 01:58:12,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, we just could not end the show if we did not have an opportunity to respect our elders by paying tribute to a classic game, as we do every week here on the program.

1788
01:58:12,851 --> 01:58:16,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for DarkSakura to bring in her classic game of the week.

1789
01:58:22,759 --> 01:58:27,002
[SPEAKER_10]: The classic game of the week is one that I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on.

1790
01:58:28,543 --> 01:58:34,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely one of the top games in the side-scrolling shooter genre.

1791
01:58:35,047 --> 01:58:38,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is none other but R-Type.

1792
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:41,051
[SPEAKER_10]: R-Type is great.

1793
01:58:44,013 --> 01:58:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I'd have to say that R-Type is probably my favorite shooter, even though I'm not all that great at it.

1794
01:58:52,816 --> 01:58:54,297
[SPEAKER_10]: This music's like the best ever.

1795
01:58:55,158 --> 01:58:57,360
[SPEAKER_10]: The first level music is so much my favorite in the game.

1796
01:59:00,703 --> 01:59:03,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So what sets this shooter apart from other games, DarkSakura?

1797
01:59:03,425 --> 01:59:06,888
[SPEAKER_10]: This particular shooter has a very unique weapon system.

1798
01:59:07,309 --> 01:59:14,695
[SPEAKER_10]: You get this item called the Force, which is, since you're watching the clip, you see that ball that's right in front of it?

1799
01:59:15,532 --> 01:59:23,863
[SPEAKER_10]: You can pick up different power-ups for ones that make it grow based on different types of energy power-ups you pick up.

1800
01:59:25,005 --> 01:59:28,309
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have a red one that's a counter-air laser.

1801
01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:33,216
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one that's on right now, the blue and red sort of spiraled-looking laser.

1802
01:59:34,493 --> 01:59:42,999
[SPEAKER_10]: You also get a rebound laser that shoots these thin beams that bounce off the walls, which is actually, certain weapons are better for certain stages.

1803
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: You also get the counter-ground laser, which is basically like a flamethrower that goes out on the ceiling and on the ground, which is a very, very, very good thing to have for the third boss.

1804
01:59:55,989 --> 01:59:59,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually for the third level, because the entire level is the boss battle.

1805
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:00,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1806
02:00:01,441 --> 02:00:12,887
[SPEAKER_10]: The other various things that you can get are these little spheres that will float above and below your ship that will shoot missiles for you.

1807
02:00:13,648 --> 02:00:18,590
[SPEAKER_10]: The other cool thing about the Force attachment is that you can move it around.

1808
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:23,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, the ship one is, I think, the third level.

1809
02:00:23,717 --> 02:00:31,139
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, you can fire it off and have it sort of hang in midair, although it will try to reattach itself.

1810
02:00:31,779 --> 02:00:37,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can have it attached to the back of your ship and fire the weapon from the back, and you can have it attached to the front.

1811
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And have it, of course, fire to the front.

1812
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, a lot of the bosses are supposed to be really hard, but they all have a trick to them.

1813
02:00:46,742 --> 02:00:47,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the first one...

1814
02:00:49,291 --> 02:01:14,580
[SPEAKER_10]: there's one place where nothing will hit you and you just fire off the force thing and it will just kill the thing for you one of the stages is you fight this heart of this creature and there's a place where you can nestle your ship in and fire off the force thing by the place where the little heart of it pops up and you don't get hit you kill off all the tentacles and you

1815
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:16,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is hardcore.

1816
02:01:16,351 --> 02:01:16,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1817
02:01:38,567 --> 02:01:42,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, I've seen someone beat it in the arcade on an actual single quarter.

1818
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:46,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I notice our chatroom is in a little bit of a Gradius versus R-Type debate.

1819
02:01:47,491 --> 02:01:48,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Care to comment?

1820
02:01:48,232 --> 02:01:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is there room for both games, or is one better than the other?

1821
02:01:55,595 --> 02:02:01,458
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all a matter of what you prefer, because Gradius is a different style of shooter, I think.

1822
02:02:02,098 --> 02:02:07,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, and this is, again, just my opinion, I think it takes a more skilled player to play through R-Type.

1823
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:14,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I really think it takes a lot more skilled and patient of a player to play R-Type.

1824
02:02:15,185 --> 02:02:17,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, we've had many sequels since then.

1825
02:02:18,387 --> 02:02:37,561
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had, if I'm correct in order, after this came, we had R-Type 2, and then, god, there was some other game, let's see, Super R-Type came out, R-Type Leo, R-Type 3, R-Type Delta, R-Type Final, and there's recently been an R-Type Tactics game, which

1826
02:02:38,086 --> 02:02:38,426
[SPEAKER_10]: R-Type Command

1827
02:03:06,903 --> 02:03:08,684
[SPEAKER_10]: That you'll get to the arcade version.

1828
02:03:08,764 --> 02:03:11,025
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan, though, it came out on two HuCards.

1829
02:03:11,925 --> 02:03:19,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And a little bit of trivia is that when on the Japanese Virtual Console, you actually still have to download R-Type in both parts.

1830
02:03:20,749 --> 02:03:21,630
[SPEAKER_10]: As opposed to one.

1831
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:33,155
[SPEAKER_10]: And they came out with an R-Type Complete or something that was a PC Engine Duo combination that had the entire thing uncut.

1832
02:03:34,555 --> 02:03:35,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, other games, though, that were...

1833
02:03:37,168 --> 02:03:41,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Rumored to have been spawned by R-Type, though, were Polestar.

1834
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:50,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Although Polestar actually dates back to the very early 80s, but a lot of the gameplay in Polestar is a lot like R-Type.

1835
02:03:51,294 --> 02:03:55,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a game called Resonant that came out in 91, very similar.

1836
02:03:55,075 --> 02:04:03,799
[SPEAKER_10]: A Magic Series core, the game called Magic Dragon that was supposed to be almost everything exactly like R-Type with redone sprites.

1837
02:04:04,179 --> 02:04:05,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we haven't seen that before in Super Mario 2.

1838
02:04:08,907 --> 02:04:18,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, for the game Turrican 2, you actually can see the force in a hangar, and the third level of that game is based on R-Type.

1839
02:04:18,692 --> 02:04:25,155
[SPEAKER_10]: And another game, and this is actually, and I almost picked this as my classic game, but it's a little on the obscure side.

1840
02:04:25,175 --> 02:04:30,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game called, if I'm pronouncing it right, Zexys, which is just spelled X-E-X-E-X.

1841
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:33,139
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it in America as Oreus.

1842
02:04:33,179 --> 02:04:33,839
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Konami game.

1843
02:04:34,961 --> 02:04:37,923
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's also that same type of shooter game.

1844
02:04:38,584 --> 02:04:41,125
[SPEAKER_10]: So, very, very classic.

1845
02:04:41,485 --> 02:04:42,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good game.

1846
02:04:43,147 --> 02:04:43,487
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1847
02:04:44,567 --> 02:04:49,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my love for Gradius, especially Gradius 2, don't get me wrong, but R-Type.

1848
02:04:49,671 --> 02:04:50,071
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

1849
02:04:50,091 --> 02:04:56,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week is R-Type, which you can check out a version of that on the virtual console if you are so inclined.

1850
02:04:57,076 --> 02:04:58,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that's available in all the different regions.

1851
02:04:59,477 --> 02:05:00,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe so.

1852
02:05:00,138 --> 02:05:02,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Just remember, if you were in Japan, you have to pay for two of them.

1853
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:03,760
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1854
02:05:04,403 --> 02:05:08,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for tonight's short show, although it wasn't much of a short show.

1855
02:05:08,685 --> 02:05:11,907
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been here for over two hours, so it was almost like just doing one long show and no break.

1856
02:05:12,307 --> 02:05:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't say you got ripped off this week, but I am definitely spent.

1857
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:16,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I am done.

1858
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:17,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to go rest.

1859
02:05:18,291 --> 02:05:20,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to wrap it up and go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1860
02:05:21,513 --> 02:05:22,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

1861
02:05:23,354 --> 02:05:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going home and hopefully going to be able to play some Lost Odyssey since everything tonight reruns, except for the Food Network.

1862
02:05:29,437 --> 02:05:30,318
[SPEAKER_14]: They have new stuff on there.

1863
02:05:31,158 --> 02:05:32,439
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is...

1864
02:05:33,274 --> 02:05:35,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Medication, menthol, cough drops.

1865
02:05:35,856 --> 02:05:36,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

1866
02:05:37,097 --> 02:05:38,098
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1867
02:05:38,498 --> 02:05:40,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's have tea will kill me if I don't say it.

1868
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So reject false icons.

1869
02:05:43,462 --> 02:05:44,083
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

1870
02:05:44,683 --> 02:05:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

1872
02:05:50,608 --> 02:05:52,970

1873
02:05:53,571 --> 02:05:55,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all there is until next week.

1874
02:05:56,073 --> 02:05:56,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rob.

1875
02:05:56,633 --> 02:05:57,274
[SPEAKER_04]: She's Jamie.

1876
02:05:57,334 --> 02:05:57,914
[SPEAKER_04]: He's Loki.

1877
02:05:58,034 --> 02:05:58,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you then.

1878
02:06:01,764 --> 02:06:03,965
