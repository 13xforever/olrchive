00:00.000 --> 00:20.920
Today, February 10th, 2008, Xbox HD DVD gets a price cut, old favorites are revealed for

00:20.920 --> 00:29.920
Street Fighter IV, and is an Oscar-nominated movie soon becoming a video game?

00:29.920 --> 00:35.840
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
Radio.

00:36.840 --> 00:42.120
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:42.120 --> 00:43.660
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.640
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:45.640 --> 00:50.000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, is the one and only Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Summers.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.900
She is unfortunately out with sickness.

00:52.900 --> 00:59.640
She's been having, you know, just the sickness, the plague and stuff, so she can't be here

00:59.640 --> 01:02.400
tonight because she's worried she's contagious and doesn't want to give it to us.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.760
So of course we understand, and we're kind of thankful that she's not here to spread

01:05.760 --> 01:07.080
it to us.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.000
But she will be back next week.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.040
Meanwhile, we do have the one and only Loki, tech master, one and only.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.040
Yeah.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
How you doing?

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
Good.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
Good.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.040
Eating a sandwich.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.080
But the problem is Subway was out of white bread, and I had wheat, and wheat tasted like

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
corn.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Oh, no.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.360
Subway was out of something?

01:24.360 --> 01:25.680
Wheat tastes like cardboard.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.000
It's not that bad.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Bread is bread.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.280
Yeah, but it's not even really wheat bread.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.320
It's like they took white bread and kind of dyed it brown.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.000
Well, it is Subway.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.760
I wouldn't expect huge differences.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.320
Does your cat scratch you or something?

01:41.320 --> 01:42.800
I see big old claw marks.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
Yes, that's my cat.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:44.800 --> 01:50.800
Well, that's because once she gets up in her tube sometimes, she starts to freak out, but

01:50.800 --> 01:53.240
she's playing and stuff, so what do I try to do?

01:53.240 --> 01:55.880
I try poking at her all the time.

01:55.880 --> 01:59.920
I try petting her on her head, but then she just grabs her claws and she kind of catches

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
me sometimes.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
Gotcha.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.920
And she did.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.280
It looks a lot more painful than it actually was.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.000
All right, well, also joining us tonight, you might have heard his voice there just

02:08.000 --> 02:12.640
a minute ago, it's Puppy, also known as Black Lab, or Ryan, depending on whatever we want

02:12.640 --> 02:13.640
to call him.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.640
How are you, Puppy?

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
I am tired.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.640
Tired?

02:16.640 --> 02:23.800
I had some insomnia this week, and kind of capped it off with getting woken up at 2.30

02:23.800 --> 02:26.040
in the morning last night by gunfire.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.880
Oh, fun!

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
Sorry to hear about the gunfire.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.280
Were your neighbors fighting or something?

02:30.280 --> 02:33.520
I don't know, it was probably something in the mall parking lot.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.560
Okay, I gotcha.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
Interesting.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.680
You know, it's been just a crazy week in everybody's neighborhood.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.360
There was gunfire in your neighborhood, and the house across the street from the studio

02:44.360 --> 02:48.080
here burned down a couple days ago.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.680
On the outside, it makes Rob's house much easier to find to get here.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.160
That's unfortunate for those that affected.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.040
I didn't even notice it, because that house was so run down to begin with, it's like,

03:00.040 --> 03:01.040
really?

03:01.040 --> 03:02.040
It burned down?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.040
Couldn't tell.

03:03.040 --> 03:08.920
All right, well, anyhow, let's not talk about neighborhood drama, let's talk about our gaming

03:08.920 --> 03:09.920
weeks.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.600
We'll start it off with how was your gaming week, and we'll go ahead and start off with

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
Loki tonight.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
How was your gaming week?

03:13.600 --> 03:18.040
First off, I'd like to say I have brought back the Ever360, it is back to life again.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
Hooray!

03:19.040 --> 03:21.400
The trick was I needed more heat.

03:21.400 --> 03:28.280
I didn't stop until I got to about 850 degrees to 1,000 degrees, and sure enough, that worked!

03:28.280 --> 03:30.800
So now I have six working 360s, hooray!

03:30.800 --> 03:34.120
You're just loaded, aren't you?

03:34.120 --> 03:39.280
And then, let's see, I played this week more Smash Bros. Brawl, and that's pretty awesome.

03:39.280 --> 03:45.280
I actually got to dive in a little bit to the subspace emissary mode, and it's pretty

03:45.280 --> 03:46.280
fun.

03:46.280 --> 03:53.920
They have some really crazy-looking enemies in the game, just some weird stuff, but it's

03:53.920 --> 03:55.120
pretty cool.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.960
And then I've unlocked Rob the Robot, we went through the challenge, but I actually took

03:58.960 --> 04:02.600
off work half a day to go visit one of my customers who really wanted to play the game,

04:02.600 --> 04:07.840
so I took it down there and we played it for five hours.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
He went through all the...

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
It didn't get old after five hours.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.360
No, no, I didn't play it for the full five hours, I just kind of watched him for a little

04:14.360 --> 04:18.080
bit, but we played through the challenges and trying to unlock some of that stuff, and

04:18.080 --> 04:22.640
doing two-player co-op in the subspace emissary stuff.

04:22.640 --> 04:29.080
But I don't know, the challenges weren't that hard, because we actually figured out what

04:29.080 --> 04:35.320
to do without reading, obviously, because it's all in Japanese, but I don't know.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.800
It's pretty cool.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.320
I think, though, if I play through the entire subspace emissary stuff and then finish all

04:42.320 --> 04:44.760
the other crap, I might get bored with the game a little bit.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.620
So I actually need to play some people.

04:47.620 --> 04:52.360
Other than Smash Brothers, I also played Silent Hill Origins, actually, on the PSP.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.480
I went back to try that again.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
And pretty cool.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.240
I actually am looking forward to it coming out on PlayStation 2, because I just don't

05:00.240 --> 05:04.920
like being tethered to my TV with a little cable, so it might be a little bit better

05:04.920 --> 05:09.080
if I have a little bit more room to play.

05:09.080 --> 05:16.660
And then, I also played a lot of Burnout Paradise, still trying to knock people off of the leaderboards

05:16.660 --> 05:19.340
for the Showtime rankings.

05:19.340 --> 05:24.320
I love how listeners will add us on Xbox Live, because they enjoy the show and so on, they

05:24.320 --> 05:29.080
just kind of want to play a game with us occasionally, or what have you, whereas Loki makes it his

05:29.080 --> 05:33.400
mission to dominate our listeners in whatever game he's playing.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.880
He's like, oh no, I can't get beat by no listener.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.040
I've got to control the Burnout map.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.840
Right now I have about 26 of the roads, so I still have a ways to go.

05:44.840 --> 05:51.040
But let's see, other than that, I played a little bit more DotStream on the Game Boy

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
Advance.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
Pretty fun.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.920
And I think that's pretty much it.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.560
Oh, I tried playing Crysis again.

05:58.560 --> 06:03.240
I actually uninstalled Crysis, reinstalled Crysis, tried to get that last level to fucking

06:03.240 --> 06:05.760
work again, and sure enough, it does not work.

06:05.760 --> 06:10.040
Still, I can't pass that last level in the game because it glitches out, and it stops

06:10.040 --> 06:11.040
working.

06:11.040 --> 06:18.440
So, I am sick of Crysis, although I did load up the physics little custom map that someone

06:18.440 --> 06:21.720
made to play the physics of the game.

06:21.720 --> 06:28.000
They actually released a new version of the map last week, and that was fun, because you

06:28.000 --> 06:34.400
can slingshot barrels and the people and stuff, and catapult things, and you gotta love that.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.340
But other than that, though, I fucking hate the last level of Crysis.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.640
Did they not test it at all?

06:39.640 --> 06:44.480
I mean, it's just really broken, which is bad, because the rest of the game is pretty

06:44.480 --> 06:48.880
cool, but it's just that last level, right as you're about to finish the game and kind

06:48.880 --> 06:51.440
of get the payoff for playing through the entire thing.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.460
Oh no, you can't do that.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.020
That would be too easy.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.560
So I don't know.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.040
I know you check out a lot of the new Xbox games that come out.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.640
Did you check out Poker Smash this week?

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
Nope.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
No.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.800
I like a NYR fan in our chatroom, his description.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.080
Of course, I haven't introduced the chat yet, but it's chat.orangelandradio.com.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.600
We tape live on Sunday nights at our website, orangelandradio.com.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.240
So remember, you are listening to live radio.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.960
It's NYR fan, and chatroom says, Poker Smash is like Planet Puzzle League, but you make

07:19.960 --> 07:21.120
poker hands.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
That's kind of true.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
Did you play Puppy?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
Any Poker Smash?

07:24.120 --> 07:27.960
No, it never really got any interest from me.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.240
I thought it was going to be kind of lame, but it's actually kind of a unique sort of

07:31.240 --> 07:32.240
puzzler.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.060
I guess that's a good description of it.

07:34.060 --> 07:37.760
It's like Planet Puzzle League, but the whole poker element kind of makes you think on two

07:37.760 --> 07:39.840
different levels, which is very scary.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.360
And I got thrown off by the colors when I first started playing, but then I realized

07:43.360 --> 07:48.600
that the colors were just another way of designating the pink ones or queens, the yellow ones or

07:48.600 --> 07:50.120
tens and so on.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.160
But you still have to consider the suits of what you're dropping, so I know it makes it

07:54.160 --> 07:59.000
sound really complicated, but it's easy to get easy combos, but it's much harder to get

07:59.000 --> 08:00.800
the more difficult combos, if that makes sense.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.400
I was kind of surprised.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
Anyway.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
Sorry.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.440
Puppy, how was your gaming week?

08:06.440 --> 08:11.620
Most of my week has been involved with Call of Duty 4 since I finally got a hold of it.

08:11.620 --> 08:16.040
Even though I rented it through Gamefly, I'm probably going to end up keeping it anyways,

08:16.040 --> 08:18.960
because I found that it's much better than Halo 3.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.780
Even with the updates that Halo 3 finally added and are going to add in the near future,

08:23.780 --> 08:26.000
I still will be playing Call of Duty 4 instead.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.120
That's a pretty bold statement, that it's better than Halo 3.

08:29.120 --> 08:36.240
I actually found it much more enjoyable than Halo, just because there's a lot more reality

08:36.240 --> 08:43.600
to it, as opposed to, oh, armored space guys punching each other in a grossly malformed

08:43.600 --> 08:45.100
way.

08:45.100 --> 08:50.840
And then, other than Call of Duty 4, I sadly have fallen back into my puzzle pirate habit.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
Sucker.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Yeah.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.480
Well, how has Puzzle Pirates changed?

08:54.480 --> 08:57.360
Because you were last addicted to the game, what, about two years ago?

08:57.360 --> 09:03.360
Yeah, well, I stopped playing it about a year ago, because I didn't have the time to anymore.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.480
And then, apparently a lot of stuff changed in that year.

09:06.480 --> 09:12.720
They brought back, they brought a bunch of new puzzle games in, and added some new player

09:12.720 --> 09:19.320
versus environment stuff, and it's getting popular, and I just found out, they just made

09:19.320 --> 09:24.120
an announcement that they're selling game cards at Target now, so they must be making

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
it big or something.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
Nice.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.680
I'm noticing with the facial hair that you're starting to sprout here, you're starting to

09:28.680 --> 09:30.760
look like a pirate a little bit.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.320
This was much longer earlier this week, though.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.320
I see.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.560
But, yes, I could just throw on an eyepatch for a party.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.880
It's great radio, too, to talk about Puppy's look.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.440
Yeah, because I mean, even-

09:41.440 --> 09:43.520
He's got a little facial growth that makes him look like a pirate.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.440
I don't know if they can see it on Justin.TV, because you're blonde.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.480
I could probably, well, yeah, I could probably stand right in front of the camera and they

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
wouldn't see it.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
Yeah, why don't you go give them a nice close-up when you're done, then?

09:50.480 --> 09:51.480
Yeah.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
Go give them a nice close-up of your mug there.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.480
Give them a nice little mug shot there, you know, side view.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
Yeah.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
All right.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

09:59.480 --> 10:03.280
Um, uh, rez, uh, various board games, and-

10:03.280 --> 10:04.640
Isn't rez incredible?

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
Of course it is.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
I love rez.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.720
I really wish that I had a high-def TV to play it on.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.720
Oh.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.720
I do, and it's sexy.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.760
I hate to rub it in, but yeah, yeah, you really do want one.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.920
You need to have surround sound, too, when you're playing it.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
That's true.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.000
I seriously almost dug up my old surround sound system that's kind of crappy.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.160
It's actually hooked up here in the garage.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.960
I almost brought that into the house just to play rez HD with, but I'm going to get

10:23.960 --> 10:26.080
a new sound system when I get my tax refund.

10:26.080 --> 10:31.400
Yeah, I thought about getting a better TV with my tax refund, but I've got other stuff

10:31.400 --> 10:32.920
that I need to pay for first.

10:32.920 --> 10:33.920
Gotcha.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
All right.

10:34.920 --> 10:35.920
Now go supermodel for the camera.

10:35.920 --> 10:36.920
I'll talk about my gaming week.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.440
First, I want to mention in chat room, because this didn't come up earlier, Tiger Claw says,

10:40.440 --> 10:44.280
Sky, I just realized, OLR is competing against the Grammys.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.280
Who cares?

10:45.280 --> 10:46.280
Seriously.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.080
I mean, the Grammys, I don't know.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.800
I find them to be incredibly irrelevant, and I think, like, did you see that article on

10:52.800 --> 10:56.400
Digg earlier this week about the biggest Grammy snubs of all time?

10:56.400 --> 10:57.400
It's pretty interesting.

10:57.400 --> 11:02.160
It shows how, like, there's all these big name artists that always get snubbed by the

11:02.160 --> 11:04.640
Grammys when there's people that were more deserving.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.640
Well, whatever.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.760
Forget it.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.080
And I brought up tax refunds earlier.

11:08.080 --> 11:13.000
I'm curious in our chat room, those that are getting tax refunds, if there's anything in

11:13.000 --> 11:16.240
gaming that you're contemplating spending your tax refund on.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.360
So let us know in our chat room, chat.orangewormsrated.com.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.520
I'll read those in just a little bit.

11:19.520 --> 11:24.640
But first, my gaming week, mostly spent, besides Poker Smash, playing a couple different games.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.000
World of Warcraft, of course.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.600
I know I talk about that a lot here on the program, but it has been a lot of my gaming

11:28.600 --> 11:29.720
week recently.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.280
And it really went to the next level this week.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.560
I don't know how many hardcore WoW addicts we have that listen to the game.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.920
But tonight, or I'm sorry, yesterday marked our first 10-man raid into Karazhan, which

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
is...

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
Oh, you're just moving on.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.920
I know.

11:42.920 --> 11:43.920
It's weird.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.840
Like, I've never done endgame content in an MMO before, because Final Fantasy XI, oh my

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
God.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.320
I mean, it just takes forever to get there, and WoW it does, too.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.540
But I don't know, I guess more people I know play WoW for whatever reason.

11:57.540 --> 12:01.280
So we finally got to the endgame content in that game, and it's something else.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.280
It's just a whole other challenge.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.640
Enjoy it while you can, because...

12:05.640 --> 12:08.560
When Wrath of the Lich King comes out, then all that stuff gets antiquated, I know.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.560
Oh, of course.

12:09.560 --> 12:13.420
So, and we only have 10 people in our guild that can even do it.

12:13.420 --> 12:17.060
So I notice it's tough to really arrange the times to go in there, but we did an awesome

12:17.060 --> 12:19.160
job for anybody that does know WoW.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.880
We killed Attuneman, we killed Moros, and we killed Maiden today.

12:23.880 --> 12:28.040
So in our first weekend, we killed three of the bosses in Karazhan, which is pretty awesome,

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
and apparently is...

12:29.040 --> 12:31.720
You know, I'm sure there's lots of people out there that go, whoa, my guild killed four

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
bosses, so fuck you.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
Fuck you.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.720
My guild clearly all in one night.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.920
For us, when we were mostly casual players, it was pretty awesome.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.900
So good times.

12:40.900 --> 12:45.220
Just wait until you try to move on to 25-man content, and you've got three different groups

12:45.220 --> 12:47.960
going to Karazhan at once, and they're like, oh, we don't want to split up, we don't want

12:47.960 --> 12:50.520
to go all together, and then you'll end up breaking apart, and...

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
Oh, no.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.520
Drama, drama, drama.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.520
No, we don't want drama.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.520
We're all...

12:54.520 --> 12:57.640
Most of us actually live here in the area, in our guild-less form, mostly from real-life

12:57.640 --> 12:58.640
people.

12:58.640 --> 13:03.800
Like, my boyfriend is in the guild, and Irene is in the guild, but she's not level 70 yet.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.520
Some of the other people you've heard on this show are in the guild, and yeah, good times.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.520
So we're finally doing that stuff.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.520
Let's see.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.940
Looking at chat room, seeing what folks are saying they're gonna spend their tax refunds

13:13.940 --> 13:17.000
on here.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Let's see.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.520
SSJ100Matt says, my tax rebate is going towards an HD camera.

13:23.520 --> 13:29.840
GS191 says, I'll probably spend my welfare, I mean, stimulus package check on a new PC.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
That's right.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
Yeah.

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
After that thing was passed.

13:32.840 --> 13:37.520
I'm already spending that on a new computer, because I need something at home that doesn't...

13:37.520 --> 13:38.520
That can run AutoCAD.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.520
Nice.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
All right.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.440
Oh, DMN's gonna use his refund to come visit the show.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.000
He's coming back to Sacramento.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Scary.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh, boy.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
We'll use that refund to move.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Hide the pets and the children.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
All right.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
No, just kidding.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.440
Also, okay, there's other games I've been playing besides MMO.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.040
I also picked up a game on the Xbox 360.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.280
I can't remember if I've talked about this previously on the show, but it's a game called

13:58.280 --> 14:03.880
Cold Step Saga, and it's the sequel to a PlayStation 2 game that was simply called Cold Stepped,

14:03.880 --> 14:05.960
and I think I did mention this once on the show.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.320
I love this description of the game I've read on the internet.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.680
It's Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.960
I think that's the best way to describe the game.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.840
You basically have a deck of cards, and you can customize them, and you move around this

14:15.840 --> 14:20.720
board, and you lay down your creatures, and basically laying down a creature is kind of

14:20.720 --> 14:25.920
like owning property in Monopoly, and you can level up the square, which is like buying

14:25.920 --> 14:29.560
houses or a hotel, and you make your creatures more powerful, but when an opponent lands

14:29.560 --> 14:32.340
on your square, it's not that they just have to pay rent.

14:32.340 --> 14:35.740
They can choose to battle your creature with one from their hand, and then there's all

14:35.740 --> 14:39.320
these enhancements cards that'll increase your strength, your defense.

14:39.320 --> 14:43.840
So it's kind of a game where you really have to think before you play, and it's a lot of

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
fun.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.320
I think it's a very unique concept.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.900
It's kind of interesting to see it on the Xbox 360.

14:48.900 --> 14:53.000
For me, they didn't really change a lot from the first game, and the animations are not

14:53.000 --> 14:59.480
really anything to jump and scream about in this new age of gaming or whatever you want

14:59.480 --> 15:02.680
to call it with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.680
You look at the Eye of Judgment, and there's very intricate battles that happen.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.120
For all the shit we give that game on this show, the battles look kind of cool when the

15:10.120 --> 15:11.480
cards do battle.

15:11.480 --> 15:16.160
Here in Coldsept, it's like, you know, if a monster attacks with the claws, you see

15:16.160 --> 15:18.640
big claw marks go across the cards.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.680
So it's basically like Pokemon, just in high definition.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.520
Well, like, literally the cards do battle.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.880
It's kind of amusing.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.080
And there's incredible Engrish in the game.

15:28.080 --> 15:32.080
I think one of the lines is something like, I had to escape the poverty, or something

15:32.080 --> 15:38.080
I don't remember, like very literal translations in some of the cutscenes, but it's cool.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.880
I mean, for me, I think this game is mostly a second chance for people who missed it on

15:42.880 --> 15:46.120
the PlayStation 2, because it's not a full-price Xbox game.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
It's like that middle tier.

15:47.120 --> 15:52.080
It's $39.99, so it's not quite as much as you pay for a brand new Xbox 360 game.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.400
It's a pretty good deal.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.360
I actually didn't own Coldsept on PlayStation 2.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.280
One of my friends a couple years ago did.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.560
That's how I got exposed to it the first time.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.900
We spent a lot of nights just playing Coldsept.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.320
By the way, just like in Magic, as you go through and battle monsters, you get to keep

16:06.320 --> 16:08.800
some of their cards and build them into your deck.

16:08.800 --> 16:14.120
So it's a pretty intricate game, and of course the Xbox One also has the new Xbox Live mode.

16:14.120 --> 16:21.080
Yes, and apparently poor ol' Jeevan finally got his Xbox 360, and that's one of the games

16:21.080 --> 16:25.280
he's been playing all the time now, after he got rezzed, of course.

16:25.280 --> 16:30.000
Looking at Portal Combat in our chatroom says, Coldsept is the only game you can play while

16:30.000 --> 16:31.920
reading Entertainment Weekly.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.400
I don't think the game's that boring.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.120
I mean, it's not a fast-paced game.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.920
You read Entertainment Weekly.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
I know.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
What the hell's wrong with you?

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
You read Entertainment Weekly?

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
Oh, I'm kidding.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.840
All right.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
That's it for my Gaming Week.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.080
Anything else anyone wants to share with their Gaming Week?

16:49.080 --> 16:51.080
There's people out there that actually paint cats.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
I'm sorry.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.880
What does that have to do with games?

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
Anything?

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
That's creepy.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.760
What do you do during this program?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.360
Do we pay you to surf the internet?

17:00.360 --> 17:01.360
Yes.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.660
Yeah, we don't pay you at all.

17:03.660 --> 17:06.240
Tonight's housekeeping, obviously, there's no Jamie here tonight.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.240
Sadness.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.400
We're going to try to give her a call a little later in the show so she can participate in

17:09.400 --> 17:15.740
one of her regular segments, but the good news is tonight we have a brand new game.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.120
We've never played on the show before.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.840
It's something brand new.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.440
Here's the cool thing.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.300
You might remember last week we had a copy of Res HD that we were unable to give away

17:24.300 --> 17:28.880
on the show because the person who won it didn't have an Xbox 360, whatever, didn't

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
want it.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.880
It's back in the prize pool tonight.

17:31.880 --> 17:37.440
Tonight, everybody that is in our chat room at chat.orangehontraded.com and listening

17:37.440 --> 17:40.440
to the show has a chance to win.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.800
Everybody can play this game tonight.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.200
That's the cool thing about it.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.760
I'm really looking forward to it.

17:45.760 --> 17:51.040
I'll be coming up in Part B, so stick around and make sure you're in our chat room.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.820
Other than that, just the usual plugs for us on MySpace at Orange Honch Radio, our live

17:55.820 --> 17:59.640
journal at Orange Lounge, we have a Facebook community called the OL Army, so search us

17:59.640 --> 18:00.640
out there.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.960
Help us spread the word about independent radio and independent podcasting, and that's

18:04.960 --> 18:05.960
it.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.200
Now, Loki, do you think you can take some time away from Painted Cats to read us some

18:08.200 --> 18:09.440
news stories?

18:09.440 --> 18:14.000
I think I can.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.280
We've had this for a while now, the Xbox 360 arcade model, the one replacing the core.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.560
Well, now Japan's going to get a chance to have it as well.

18:23.560 --> 18:29.240
They're going to get theirs March 6th, and of course, the arcade system is the one that

18:29.240 --> 18:37.040
features no hard drive, but it has a memory unit, as well as five Xbox Live arcade games.

18:37.040 --> 18:45.280
It's going to actually cost 27,800 yen, which is about $20 less than what we paid for it

18:45.280 --> 18:47.000
in the United States.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.320
Hopefully, that will help drive more Xbox 360 sales, because right now they're hurting.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.160
But this is the one that doesn't have a hard drive, right?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.760
No, it doesn't have a hard drive.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.120
I would think all the games that people are interested in playing in Japan probably require

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
that hard drive.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.120
Probably.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
I mean, like Blue Dragon.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.640
Well, I guess Blue Dragon doesn't require a hard drive.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.680
It's just, you know, for game saves and stuff, it's got to, you know, have a game.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.680
Lost Odyssey.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.120
I'm trying to think of the more Japanese-centered game.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.360
Well, I don't think Lost Odyssey requires a hard drive.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.360
I guess not, or Devil Might Cry.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.680
I guess none of those games do.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.800
No, that's just PlayStation 3.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.160
They require the hard drive for that.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.160
All right.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.160
I don't know.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.160
I guess that's true.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.240
I keep thinking Final Fantasy XI as well, which is really probably the first Japan-centric

19:26.240 --> 19:30.280
game that I can think of, anyway, to come out on the Xbox 360 on both shores, even though

19:30.280 --> 19:33.440
it was an already existing game, so it wasn't that hard to get out here, I'm sure.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.600
They've tried all sorts of bundles, though, in Japan, and so far hasn't really helped.

19:36.600 --> 19:41.720
I mean, they've only sold, like, what, a quarter-million yen last year, so...

19:41.720 --> 19:46.200
Pika Uno in our chat room actually lives in Japan and is quick to point out some of the

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
facts.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.560
The Blue Dragon bundle that they actually sold over there was a core pack.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.480
He says all bundle packs in Japan are cores, so...

19:53.480 --> 19:57.240
Which is kind of ironic, because it was the original core that didn't even have a memory

19:57.240 --> 20:01.160
unit or anything, so it's like, oh, Blue Dragon, oh, but you gotta buy a memory unit.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.160
Oh, darn.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
Oh, hey, it's just like the PS2 was.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.760
Oh, hey, look, I want to play a game.

20:05.760 --> 20:10.760
Oh, wait, I can't save unless I buy a card.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
Dope.

20:11.760 --> 20:17.200
RossdielUT in chat says, if a series of top-notch Japanese games don't do it, this won't.

20:17.200 --> 20:22.360
I guess that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff coming out that's kind of, you

20:22.360 --> 20:26.360
would think, appeals, and you really have to generalize to say a lot of this, too, really

20:26.360 --> 20:30.120
appeals to the Japanese audience, you know, like Lost Odyssey, but I hear that game didn't

20:30.120 --> 20:31.560
do so well over there.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.280
It didn't get very good reviews over there, but, you know, I don't know if...

20:35.280 --> 20:41.040
When I was at GameStop getting cult-stepped, the guy who was actually thinking of buying

20:41.040 --> 20:43.760
cult-stepped, actually, he was holding it up when I walked up to the counter reading

20:43.760 --> 20:47.600
the back of the box, and I told him that was the game I wanted, but he told me he was excited

20:47.600 --> 20:49.720
about Lost Odyssey, as well, so there is a little bit of a bug going on.

20:49.720 --> 20:54.560
I am excited about Lost Odyssey, although I have low expectations for it.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.480
I only see it as probably going to be slightly better than Enchanted Arms.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.800
Well, we will see.

21:02.800 --> 21:09.340
Meanwhile, also in Xbox 360 news, there are some new classic video games making their

21:09.340 --> 21:15.140
way to the Xbox Live Classic downloads very soon.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.360
I think there might be some type of tie-in.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.080
I think the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game must be coming out soon, because some of the

21:21.080 --> 21:26.360
games that have been announced to the Xbox originals, Pirates, as well as Ninja Gaiden,

21:26.360 --> 21:31.880
so more Ninjas and Pirates jokes abound, but also another Xbox classic, Black, and I know

21:31.880 --> 21:33.340
a lot of people are really into this game.

21:33.340 --> 21:34.980
Black is also coming out for the Xbox originals.

21:34.980 --> 21:37.600
Black for Black History Month.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
I don't know about that.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.920
I am just trying to find you.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.400
You are trying to be funny and failing miserably.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.400
I am not trying to be funny.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.400
That was a little...

21:46.400 --> 21:47.560
I don't know.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Somebody might think that...

21:48.560 --> 21:50.520
Wouldn't that be weird if they did try to tie it in that way?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.680
Would that be more insulting to the game or to Black History?

21:53.680 --> 21:54.680
Black History.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.920
Are you saying the game was not that great?

21:55.920 --> 21:59.200
It was good, but it has nothing to do with Black History Month.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.200
All right.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.560
It would just be like, huh, Black, huh.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
I don't know.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.560
I am just trying...

22:05.560 --> 22:08.560
Just being your normal crazy self.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
I am just trying to figure it out.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.560
Always controversial, Loki.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
I don't know what I am talking about.

22:11.560 --> 22:16.520
So we are getting some download content for Mass Effect coming March 10th.

22:16.520 --> 22:21.640
It's a brand new, I don't know, set of missions called Bring Down the Sky.

22:21.640 --> 22:27.640
It has actually a brand new race that they are introducing as well in there, and I guess

22:27.640 --> 22:29.520
they are calling it the Batarians.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.520
The Batarians.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
Yeah.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.520
Batarians.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.520
Batarians.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.520
Whatever.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.520
They look like an ant.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
I mean, sort of.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.040
They've got like a bunch of eyes and a weird little bat nose.

22:42.040 --> 22:48.360
Actually they look like a quasi-bat ant thing, I don't know, whatever.

22:48.360 --> 22:56.240
So you'll be able to, you know, go to the colony and actually be able to save them and

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
stuff.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
Yeah.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.520
Gigantic space bats, I guess that's what they are saying.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.400
It's only going to be 400 Microsoft points or $5, so that's not bad, and it's going to

23:04.400 --> 23:09.080
add about 90 minutes to the game, and also there's going to be 50 achievement points

23:09.080 --> 23:11.880
you can earn from it as well.

23:11.880 --> 23:16.360
One thing, though, I remember reading about this, though, is it's midway through the game,

23:16.360 --> 23:20.800
so if you have a save that's kind of towards the end of the game, you might already have

23:20.800 --> 23:25.560
passed the ability to play this so you have to start a new game, which kind of blows,

23:25.560 --> 23:32.320
but if you had just one save file to begin with, you're already failing at RPG.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.040
RastioUT in our chat room makes a good comment, he says he will wait for the special edition

23:36.040 --> 23:41.280
of the game with all the download content included, since we all know it's coming.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.280
But for how long?

23:42.280 --> 23:46.040
We don't know how much DLC is coming for Mass Effect.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.600
In other words, it could be two years until that edition is released, right?

23:48.600 --> 23:51.920
It'll probably be a year, because that's what they've done with some of the other ones,

23:51.920 --> 23:55.400
although I haven't really noticed Microsoft games doing that, where they come out with

23:55.400 --> 23:58.840
content, because you didn't see Perfect Dark come out with another Perfect Dark Zero or

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
something like that.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
But there have been others.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.720
PCN, Marvel, there's a few.

24:04.720 --> 24:11.240
Marvel and Call of Duty, that's all Activision, so they tend to do that, but Microsoft does

24:11.240 --> 24:12.240
not.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.640
Would that be Bioware's decision?

24:16.640 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, it would be their decision.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.920
I would just say, buy it.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.280
If you're really desperate for download content, otherwise save that $5 for a new game, huh?

24:28.280 --> 24:30.340
That's what I'm saying.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.840
Put that $5 down towards ResHD.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.840
Exactly.

24:32.840 --> 24:37.060
Do you want to spend $5 on 90 minutes of entertainment, or do you want to spend $5 on an Xbox Live

24:37.060 --> 24:38.060
Arcade game?

24:38.060 --> 24:44.160
That could end up being a lot more fun, or at least, I don't know, not many Xbox Live

24:44.160 --> 24:48.200
Arcade games that are 400 Microsoft points, but still, it'd be a lot more fun than 90

24:48.200 --> 24:49.200
minutes.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.760
I'd spend it on food.

24:50.760 --> 24:56.400
Well, you could also put that $5 towards a brand new Xbox 360 HD DVD player, and you

24:56.400 --> 25:03.120
know what, thanks to this recent news, that $5 gets you one-twenty-sixth of the way there.

25:03.120 --> 25:10.800
For you math whizzes, that means the HD DVD player is now costing $130, so the HD DVD

25:10.800 --> 25:14.680
player has been dropped to $130 in the US and Canada.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.380
Actually, it was even cheaper if you looked on Amazon a couple days ago.

25:18.380 --> 25:22.380
Amazon was running an $80 deal for a little while, probably trying to clean out their

25:22.380 --> 25:28.580
inventory in recent HD DVD versus Blu-ray news not looking good for HD DVD, and I'm

25:28.580 --> 25:31.300
sure this is just another fallout of that.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.880
If you can't beat the news, you've got to drop the price, right?

25:34.880 --> 25:38.480
This is how they're going to make this look that much more attractive.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.660
So of course, as you all know, HD DVDs have been kicked, punched, and everything this

25:42.660 --> 25:47.880
year thanks to all the Blu-ray news, so this is certainly a welcome kick in the pants for

25:47.880 --> 25:51.900
HD DVD owners, hopefully to drive some more sales and therefore more software.

25:51.900 --> 25:57.140
I own an HD DVD player, I have for quite a while, and I kind of think it's over and I'm

25:57.140 --> 25:58.140
kind of sad.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.460
I think I bought the wrong one this time.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.540
I wanted one just for Matrix, but I'll wait.

26:03.540 --> 26:09.860
Well, if inevitably Blu-ray wins in a year or so, and I don't mean these preemptive Blu-ray

26:09.860 --> 26:10.860
wins.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.020
Blu-ray wins when HD DVD folds, you know what I mean?

26:14.020 --> 26:16.780
If that happens in a year or whatever, then Matrix will come out on Blu-ray.

26:16.780 --> 26:17.780
You know it will.

26:17.780 --> 26:18.780
Oh, it will.

26:18.780 --> 26:19.780
Of course.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.340
Then the Star Wars movies will all come out too.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.740
Everything, just like in DVD.

26:23.740 --> 26:28.860
I mean, just, I think we're at a point where like everything is out on DVD, right?

26:28.860 --> 26:31.760
Is there any movies, like big, big movies, maybe Chad's going to have to help me here.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.380
Any big, big movies that are not out on DVD at this point?

26:34.380 --> 26:39.220
I mean, I was reading some article earlier this week that one of the companies, I don't

26:39.220 --> 26:45.460
know if it's Universal or what, has sold their entire back catalog to some company to make

26:45.460 --> 26:46.460
custom DVDs.

26:46.460 --> 26:51.220
So in other words, if you want a movie made at any point in time by, I want to say it

26:51.220 --> 26:55.300
was Universal, this company will make a DVD for you, even if it's some obscure ass movie

26:55.300 --> 26:58.780
from the 60s that didn't do very well.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.380
Rad is a non-DVD.

27:00.380 --> 27:01.380
What is it?

27:01.380 --> 27:02.380
Rad.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.380
Rad?

27:03.380 --> 27:04.380
Rad was awesome.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.380
What is Rad?

27:05.380 --> 27:06.560
Rad is a BMX bike movie.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.500
It's one of those, you know, fight for the underdogs thing.

27:09.500 --> 27:14.500
They had an entire sequence where they did a musical dance number using BMX bikes at

27:14.500 --> 27:18.180
a school prom or homecoming or something like that.

27:18.180 --> 27:19.180
It was awesome.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.900
Is Cop Rock out on DVD?

27:20.900 --> 27:21.900
I don't know.

27:21.900 --> 27:22.900
That needs to be out on DVD.

27:22.900 --> 27:23.900
That was a TV show.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.780
But Rad and Gleaming the Cube is another one that was pretty cool.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.660
Oh, I gotta love the 80s movies.

27:28.660 --> 27:30.060
Gleaming the Cube, I remember.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.060
Gotta love the 80s movies.

27:31.060 --> 27:33.060
You know how I know Gleaming the Cube?

27:33.060 --> 27:37.340
Because there's a trailer for it on Pump Up the Volume.

27:37.340 --> 27:39.780
That's how I know that.

27:39.780 --> 27:43.460
Which as an independent radio person, you know that's one of my favorite movies ever,

27:43.460 --> 27:44.460
is Pump Up the Volume.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.220
But anyway, that's for another time.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.680
Monster Squad, Rad, and Gleaming the Cube.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.140
Do yourself a favor, watch them.

27:50.140 --> 27:55.020
I know they were really cool back in the 80s and they're not so cool now, but hey, it's

27:55.020 --> 27:56.020
nostalgia.

27:56.020 --> 27:58.860
Hey, Josie16's got a good point.

27:58.860 --> 27:59.860
The Wizard?

27:59.860 --> 28:00.860
Is The Wizard out on DVD?

28:00.860 --> 28:01.860
Yes, it is.

28:01.860 --> 28:02.860
I think I've seen it.

28:02.860 --> 28:03.860
I think they did finally come out.

28:03.860 --> 28:04.860
They were released in August or something.

28:04.860 --> 28:05.860
It took them a while.

28:05.860 --> 28:07.740
It took them a while, but it finally did.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.740
I don't own it.

28:08.740 --> 28:11.020
I need to put that on my birthday wish list.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.020
Hey, wait until High Def.

28:13.020 --> 28:14.020
High Def Wizardry.

28:14.020 --> 28:15.020
That's true.

28:15.020 --> 28:20.820
High Def Super Mario 3 or whatever that is.

28:20.820 --> 28:23.060
Remember the lame announcer?

28:23.060 --> 28:32.820
Yes, I want to be able to have, you know, He Touched My Breaths in 7.1.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.420
Moving on.

28:34.420 --> 28:38.140
So another game getting some download content, Project Gotham Racing 4.

28:38.140 --> 28:42.260
It's going to bring some brand new cars as well as some new modes and of course, more

28:42.260 --> 28:44.580
achievements.

28:44.580 --> 28:46.780
Of the downloads, they're going to have one that's free.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.640
It's called the Free Challenge Pack.

28:48.640 --> 28:56.980
It has a playable hydrogen-powered pergo-flux car, I guess, tourist mode where you just

28:56.980 --> 29:01.540
drive around the city and admire the scenery with no goal whatsoever, and free roam cat

29:01.540 --> 29:02.540
and mouse mode.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.300
See, the free roam stuff is pretty cool.

29:04.300 --> 29:10.820
They're taking a little page from Burnout Paradise and of course, seven unlockable achievements.

29:10.820 --> 29:15.340
The Premium Challenge Pack, which is going to be $5 or 400 Microsoft points, includes

29:15.340 --> 29:24.260
700 new cars including the 1987 BMW M3 E30 DTM and the World Challenge Arcade mode with

29:24.260 --> 29:30.140
20 new events in three themed chapters and three more unlockable achievements.

29:30.140 --> 29:34.660
And these will be available on Valentine's Day.

29:34.660 --> 29:40.060
Because nothing says love like a downloadable hydrogen car.

29:40.060 --> 29:44.740
Hey, that's the love for the environment, okay?

29:44.740 --> 29:49.140
Maybe if, you know, ladies want to get something for their husbands, not to be stereotypical,

29:49.140 --> 29:51.420
I'm sure there's a lot of girl Project Awesomeers out there.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.420
I got you this free download content.

29:53.420 --> 29:54.420
Oh, thanks.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.420
Thank you.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.100
If Nellie bought you the content, you'd be happy, wouldn't you?

29:58.100 --> 29:59.100
No, I wouldn't.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.100
I'd be like...

30:00.100 --> 30:01.100
You're a bad husband.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.800
All right, she wouldn't touch the 360.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.380
She doesn't know how to do that stuff.

30:06.380 --> 30:11.220
She can't even figure out how to play a DVD on there.

30:11.220 --> 30:17.860
All right, let's see, also, I want to go back and read some comments from chat.

30:17.860 --> 30:19.620
I forgot about this DVD release.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.820
This is a big DVD release that came out this week.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.060
A NYR fan says, I saw the King of Kong the other day.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.060
Yeah.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.060
Did you see King of Kong yet?

30:27.060 --> 30:29.060
Did you get that DVD?

30:29.060 --> 30:31.480
Nope.

30:31.480 --> 30:35.180
But they made me buy Donkey Kong for a week because they were going to do this big King

30:35.180 --> 30:37.620
of Kong contest thing.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.140
Never fucking paid me for it.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.940
And then they ended up not doing it.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.060
So we decided not to do it.

30:42.060 --> 30:46.060
I'm like, where's my five bucks?

30:46.060 --> 30:47.060
Sorry about that.

30:47.060 --> 30:50.060
I'm like, thanks, bastards.

30:50.060 --> 30:51.060
Nice.

30:51.060 --> 30:52.060
Let's see.

30:52.060 --> 30:58.080
Oh, joshi16 in chat says, about the wizard coming out in high def someday, so much batter

30:58.080 --> 30:59.080
in HD.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.080
Exactly.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.380
That's what they should call it, the it's so batter edition.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.500
Oh my God, it needs to be in 3D.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
That'd be awesome.

31:06.500 --> 31:14.500
Hey, you know they're doing that with a lot of old Disney movies, at least, are coming

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
back out in 3D.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.740
Toy Story, all those are going to come out in 3D.

31:17.740 --> 31:21.740
Toy Story is easy because they just have to render it with two camera angles.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.140
That's simple stuff.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.140
Sorry.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.140
Child's Play.

31:25.140 --> 31:29.180
In fact, Loki's going to go home and make Toy Story 3D for all of you.

31:29.180 --> 31:36.300
I'll make a sequel, I can crap it out in a sec.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.540
Let's see, moving on.

31:37.540 --> 31:40.620
Something else that's going to be making its way to Xbox very soon.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.460
Now this, here you go.

31:42.460 --> 31:43.780
Here's a movie that needs to be in HD.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.900
I don't think this is out in HD yet.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.900
Tron.

31:46.900 --> 31:47.900
That'd be cool.

31:47.900 --> 31:48.900
Tron is winner.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.900
Of course.

31:49.900 --> 31:55.100
Tron, of course, the original Tron, that game is already out on the Xbox Live Marketplace,

31:55.100 --> 31:58.000
but we all knew this game was coming, Disks of Tron.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.300
That's right, the other Tron arcade game.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.420
That is going to be coming out on Xbox Live and it makes its way when?

32:03.420 --> 32:04.740
Why this week.

32:04.740 --> 32:07.900
February 13th is the big day for Disks of Tron.

32:07.900 --> 32:10.540
Now how would you feel if Nellie got you Disks of Tron for Valentine's Day?

32:10.540 --> 32:11.540
That would be much cooler.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.540
I fucking hate Disks of Tron.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.540
What?

32:13.540 --> 32:17.700
I don't like the Tron games, I'm sorry.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.700
Disks of Tron is awesome.

32:19.700 --> 32:23.260
Disks of Tron was, I'm trying to think of a game that it was very much like.

32:23.260 --> 32:26.540
It's kind of like, it's really just an over glorified pong.

32:26.540 --> 32:30.020
And if you've seen the movie, you remember that disc thing they would play, they did

32:30.020 --> 32:32.620
that little dance and they'd throw the disc in the air and it would bounce off the wall

32:32.620 --> 32:35.580
or whatever and hit the platform and make part of it disappear.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.300
And ultimately you're trying to make your opponent disappear.

32:37.300 --> 32:38.860
It's like that, but a real game.

32:38.860 --> 32:45.500
They should have that at Disneyland, like actual Disks of Tron, wouldn't that be cool?

32:45.500 --> 32:50.640
They could do it with some sort of motion capture stuff where you're in black lights,

32:50.640 --> 32:54.100
one person's on the other side and you make the motion like you're throwing a disc and

32:54.100 --> 32:58.140
it makes the image of a disc go, I mean, that'd be kind of cool.

32:58.140 --> 32:59.140
Good times.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.140
They could do it.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.140
I don't know.

33:01.140 --> 33:04.020
They just need to make sure the platform actually falls off from underneath you.

33:04.020 --> 33:06.860
And then you fall to your untimely death at the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean.

33:06.860 --> 33:10.020
And then you become a slave at Disneyland.

33:10.020 --> 33:11.020
The end.

33:11.020 --> 33:14.620
No, it could be like that, you remember that game show they had on Game Show Network?

33:14.620 --> 33:15.620
Nick Arcade.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.620
No, no, no.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.620
Russian Roulette.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.620
Oh, I remember that.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.380
On the Game Show Network where they have that show.

33:21.380 --> 33:26.820
Directed by Mark L. Wahlberg, which is like, how do you describe Mark L. Wahlberg?

33:26.820 --> 33:31.180
He's the total, like, just, what's a word to describe him?

33:31.180 --> 33:33.780
You know, he hosts that Moment of Truth show now, douche.

33:33.780 --> 33:39.740
Like if you ever need like a total asshole to host your game show, like, Mark L. Wahlberg's

33:39.740 --> 33:40.740
the guy to call.

33:40.740 --> 33:43.260
And so he was awesome on, and I mean that as a compliment.

33:43.260 --> 33:46.380
So he hosted Russian Roulette and you would pull, and I know we have an international

33:46.380 --> 33:49.340
audience, so maybe not everybody has heard of this show, although they probably stole

33:49.340 --> 33:50.700
it from another country.

33:50.700 --> 33:54.980
You would, basically, you know, as people missed questions, lights would light up on

33:54.980 --> 33:59.140
the ground, including one that you were standing under, and you had to pull the lever and spin

33:59.140 --> 34:04.300
the lights, and if the light landed on you, then the floor would open and you fell.

34:04.300 --> 34:08.020
Now obviously in the game show you just fell a few feet onto some padding.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.020
Yeah.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.020
Yeah.

34:10.020 --> 34:11.020
I wish.

34:11.020 --> 34:12.020
We'd like to believe that.

34:12.020 --> 34:13.020
How awesome would that be?

34:13.020 --> 34:20.140
In my mind, they fell through wood chipper, but that's, you know.

34:20.140 --> 34:21.140
Alright.

34:21.140 --> 34:22.140
You win $100!

34:22.140 --> 34:23.140
Oh, I want the money!

34:23.140 --> 34:24.140
Yeah, fuck you!

34:24.140 --> 34:25.140
You're going through the floor!

34:25.140 --> 34:28.140
I'm keeping the $100!

34:28.140 --> 34:30.060
Sorry to get off track here.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.220
Grand Theft Auto IV!

34:31.220 --> 34:35.580
The website's actually been relaunched for the game, including some new video footage

34:35.580 --> 34:37.420
that they have of it.

34:37.420 --> 34:44.140
One is a mock commercial for a wireless communications company, including where they say that there's

34:44.140 --> 34:48.940
no drop calls and they have reliable handsets, where the guy throws a handset at someone's

34:48.940 --> 34:49.940
head and stuff.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.100
It's pretty fun.

34:51.100 --> 34:57.980
Also, if you want, there is a Lovemeat.net quiz, which is going to be the fictional kind

34:57.980 --> 35:04.060
of eHarmony or whatever website that's going to be in the game for dating people.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.180
You can take your quiz and figure out what personality type you have.

35:08.180 --> 35:14.220
I know we did this at work and we came up with pervert, so that was kind of funny.

35:14.220 --> 35:18.460
And I'm assuming they're going to be adding some more content to the website as the weeks

35:18.460 --> 35:20.340
go along.

35:20.340 --> 35:25.540
We're coming up on the April 29th date, which is when the game comes out.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.660
Can't wait!

35:26.660 --> 35:28.540
Some other stuff has come out about it as well.

35:28.540 --> 35:33.980
Some leaked information, apparently, about the multiplayer details, including some of

35:33.980 --> 35:40.820
the deathmatches that they have planned, co-op, team-based head-to-head battles, online races.

35:40.820 --> 35:47.440
They had some names for them as well, Cops & Crooks, Bomb the Base, and Hangman's Noose.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.820
The site that was running Destructoid was actually going to have a list of the achievements

35:50.820 --> 35:56.940
as well until Rockstar said, uh-uh, don't put those up there.

35:56.940 --> 36:00.360
So they wouldn't be threatened by lawyers, they decided not to put the content up there

36:00.360 --> 36:03.460
and kind of retracted their original articles.

36:03.460 --> 36:10.460
I'm glad a large, well-established, respectable website like Destructoid will also run away

36:10.460 --> 36:12.620
with their tail behind their legs when threatened.

36:12.620 --> 36:19.140
And yes, I'm referring to a year-old drama, but face it, that's a history of this show

36:19.140 --> 36:20.380
that will never be let down.

36:20.380 --> 36:24.620
Sorry to interrupt, I just had to work that in there.

36:24.620 --> 36:30.620
And I think also to their defense, you probably wouldn't want to put that stuff up anyway

36:30.620 --> 36:32.700
because it would spoil a lot of the game.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.860
They basically said, hey, in respect for this game coming out in a few months here, just

36:36.860 --> 36:41.260
not put this up yet because that will spoil a lot of the story for the game.

36:41.260 --> 36:43.140
You don't want to spoil a game like this, it's going to be awesome.

36:43.140 --> 36:45.320
Oh, there's also some minigames you can play in it as well.

36:45.320 --> 36:51.780
Some of them, they mentioned Darts, you'll be able to play Pool, and some other game.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.020
I don't know.

36:53.020 --> 36:57.020
You know what though, here's the thing, if they got that list of achievements from a

36:57.020 --> 37:01.100
press copy of the game or something, then I'd say they have no right to post them up

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
on the internet.

37:02.100 --> 37:08.140
But if they're extracting them from the Xbox.com website or whatever because one of the Rockstar

37:08.140 --> 37:12.020
employees went on with this copy of the game or something, I don't know.

37:12.020 --> 37:15.340
I'm sure that's what's happened before with some other games.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.980
I'm sure this stuff would be on PartnerNet or something like that.

37:17.980 --> 37:18.980
Right.

37:18.980 --> 37:22.020
I would say if it's out there on the public internet, it's free information put up.

37:22.020 --> 37:26.700
No, this is from an insider that works at Rockstar or something else on the internet.

37:26.700 --> 37:30.180
Yeah, can't do that.

37:30.180 --> 37:35.940
If it's public information, they have nowhere to complain, but if it's an actual leak like

37:35.940 --> 37:39.180
this, then yeah, they kind of have the right to take it down.

37:39.180 --> 37:43.300
DMN is anticipating there will be a 15 gamer score achievement called Bitch Better Have

37:43.300 --> 37:44.300
My Money.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.300
Who knows.

37:45.300 --> 37:51.500
DMN also predicts a 30 gamer score for Luke Warm Coffee.

37:51.500 --> 37:55.040
I hope there is an achievement that pokes fun at hot coffee, there really, really should

37:55.040 --> 37:56.040
be.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.260
Like there should be an achievement like hot coffee, and it's actually you go buy coffee.

37:59.260 --> 38:01.500
You actually do buy hot coffee.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.500
Coffee from here.

38:02.500 --> 38:06.500
You blow up a Starbucks or whatever they call it in Grand Theft Auto, a little parody name

38:06.500 --> 38:07.500
or something.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.500
That'd be funny.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.500
Very cool.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.820
Well, I know you must be looking forward to the multiplayer in this game.

38:11.820 --> 38:12.820
Oh, fuck yeah.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.420
We're going to own the world in this game.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.420
I'm telling you, we...

38:16.420 --> 38:19.260
Is this something you're looking forward to dominating the listeners on your season?

38:19.260 --> 38:20.260
Oh, yeah.

38:20.260 --> 38:23.980
I'm telling you, because we at work, we've been playing Grand Theft Auto, at least on

38:23.980 --> 38:28.180
the PSP and multiplayer, for two years now, and now we've switched to Saints Row to kind

38:28.180 --> 38:32.820
of bring ourselves up to speed on, you know, 360 multiplayer games and stuff, like Grand

38:32.820 --> 38:33.820
Theft Auto.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.220
But as soon as Grand Theft Auto comes out, man, we're playing this twice a day for fifteen

38:37.220 --> 38:41.580
minutes each, and we're getting live in our work here pretty soon, so...

38:41.580 --> 38:45.020
How much do you think you can kill in fifteen minutes?

38:45.020 --> 38:46.700
I can kill quite a few people.

38:46.700 --> 38:52.460
Usually in like Saints Row, I can rack up a score of twenty or more if we're playing

38:52.460 --> 38:53.460
just rockets.

38:53.460 --> 38:59.820
It's just all out, we usually end up being around, you know, ten to fifteen kills, but

38:59.820 --> 39:04.940
if we do teams, like six man teams, oh man, we're going to own everybody, seriously, because

39:04.940 --> 39:09.260
we have so much experience in this game, and we'll learn all the little nuances, it's just

39:09.260 --> 39:11.180
not even going to be fun.

39:11.180 --> 39:16.500
But you know, I don't think anyone's actually going to want to play online during our breaks.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.220
I'll force them to, though.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.700
I will be up to that challenge.

39:19.700 --> 39:23.580
Well, I don't know how y'all feel about this, but I don't know.

39:23.580 --> 39:27.540
As cool as Grand Theft Auto is, it's not really my kind of game, but this is one I could definitely

39:27.540 --> 39:30.300
play a lot of online, it's Street Fighter IV.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.720
And this is going to be a fun one, I bet to play online pretty soon, although it's really

39:33.720 --> 39:38.160
no replacement for the arcade, and I think we all need to remember that, because sadly

39:38.160 --> 39:41.780
arcades are dying and they're turning into ticket-spitting machine heaven.

39:41.780 --> 39:46.160
But you know, Street Fighter IV, like it or not, it will be online, and what makes it

39:46.160 --> 39:51.420
very cool is that, in a way, you're going to get to relive the past, because it was

39:51.420 --> 39:55.900
announced this week that all the old Street Fighter II characters are coming back in Street

39:55.900 --> 39:56.940
Fighter IV.

39:56.940 --> 40:01.540
So it's not just Ryu, it's not just Ken, it's not just Chun-Li, as they originally said,

40:01.540 --> 40:08.380
but you're also getting Guile, Blanca, Zangief, Dalsium, E. Honda, they're all back, the original

40:08.380 --> 40:11.900
eight fighters in Street Fighter IV, and there's some scans from Famitsu Magazine that actually

40:11.900 --> 40:14.420
show them in their new art style, and it's pretty rad.

40:14.420 --> 40:18.180
And then there's even some more stuff with Crimson Viper, so it's not just the original

40:18.180 --> 40:21.940
eight are going to be in Street Fighter IV, there's more, the family's growing.

40:21.940 --> 40:24.780
Someone did post the achievement list, I guess, on Destructoid.

40:24.780 --> 40:31.160
Oh wow, so uh, well then I retracted everything I said.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.860
They have an achievement for demolishing 20 buildings using only your rocket launcher?

40:34.860 --> 40:36.820
Wait, how do you know it's legit?

40:36.820 --> 40:39.180
That's my next question.

40:39.180 --> 40:41.340
That's someone's blog, I guess.

40:41.340 --> 40:45.300
Okay, well I could be, so take with a grain of salt, in my opinion.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.300
Yeah.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.220
You want to say any others?

40:49.220 --> 40:55.580
Let's see here, out of town, stay hidden for six days, that's one of the achievements.

40:55.580 --> 40:59.660
Let me see if there's anything real quick for the hot coffee, I don't see anything on

40:59.660 --> 41:01.540
here.

41:01.540 --> 41:08.300
Let's see here, yeah it's probably not going to be in there, but it's a nice thought.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.900
I like the hooker one on there.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.700
I don't know if this is legit or not.

41:13.700 --> 41:18.940
See, I'm saying when it shows up on somebody's little blog, I'm not saying that it's necessarily

41:18.940 --> 41:22.020
a lie, but you do kind of have to take it with a grain of salt, because there are people

41:22.020 --> 41:27.260
out there that want to lie, and especially probably because of the lulls that people

41:27.260 --> 41:30.260
are having over the whole, well they know the list but they can't spoil it, you know

41:30.260 --> 41:31.260
what I mean?

41:31.260 --> 41:34.220
I wonder if there would be a lot more achievements in that there too.

41:34.220 --> 41:37.340
Because there's an achievement that says I get it, and I'll read the first letter of

41:37.340 --> 41:44.340
each achievement name, yeah it's fake, it says you're stupid for believing it, yeah

41:44.340 --> 41:48.300
you suck donkey cock, yeah that's what it says, nice, okay, although that would be cool

41:48.300 --> 41:53.500
if that was real, like Rockstar really should do that, like that's their hidden thing to

41:53.500 --> 41:57.500
piss off the senators, like you know, when you take the first letter of each word it

41:57.500 --> 42:02.640
says you know, senators are all gay or something, you know, I don't know, yeah you suck donkey

42:02.640 --> 42:07.280
cock, don't trust anything, yeah, nice, nice, okay, nice touch there, yeah look you got

42:07.280 --> 42:13.440
pwned, I didn't get pwned, oh my god it's legit, going back to Street Fighter 4 for

42:13.440 --> 42:20.100
a minute, something we do know a little more about, RossdielUT in chat asks, oh no Cammy,

42:20.100 --> 42:24.260
no not at this time, only the classic 8 Street Fighter 2 characters have been announced,

42:24.260 --> 42:27.660
that doesn't even include boss characters, but honestly I don't know, if I were a betting

42:27.660 --> 42:31.620
man I would think you're going to get all your 2 characters, all the super characters

42:31.620 --> 42:37.840
meaning the bosses and Cammy and all them as well, I don't know, they might cut, did

42:37.840 --> 42:42.640
anybody really use T-Hawk, I don't know, I think they might cut T-Hawk, the characters

42:42.640 --> 42:47.060
nobody really used, I bet some of the Street Fighter 3 characters are going to be in this

42:47.060 --> 42:50.220
too, oh of course, I think it's going to be epic, I think it's going to have a ton

42:50.220 --> 42:53.420
of fighters, there's plenty of room for everybody, and if they don't put Dan in it

42:53.420 --> 42:57.980
there's going to be a riot, there will be a riot, yeah, Tigerclaw says I wouldn't

42:57.980 --> 43:03.620
be surprised if Akuma is in Street Fighter 4, absolutely, and of course, Shang Long has

43:03.620 --> 43:08.940
to be in it, because you must beat Shang Long to stand a chance, anyway, forget it.

43:08.940 --> 43:14.240
Well one game, which we thought for a second there, we thought, oh my god, hell froze over,

43:14.240 --> 43:22.700
but Duke Nukem Forever, apparently there was an interview for the Dallas Business Journal,

43:22.700 --> 43:27.340
where 3D Realms president Scott Miller confirmed all sorts of stuff, including that Duke Nukem

43:27.340 --> 43:32.580
Forever was coming in 2008, and that Duke Nukem 3D was going to be coming to Xbox Live

43:32.580 --> 43:37.440
Arcade, and some of the stuff that he said, we haven't officially announced any platform

43:37.440 --> 43:44.660
for Duke Nukem Forever, but of course, hitting the big three makes most sense, PC, PS3, and

43:44.660 --> 43:50.540
360, and he said 3D Realms is negotiating with Microsoft to get a release window of

43:50.540 --> 43:59.380
some time this year on the title, and that's of course for Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Arcade,

43:59.380 --> 44:04.620
and he confirmed that Duke Nukem Forever would be coming out in 2008 to home consoles, but

44:04.620 --> 44:10.340
shortly after he was claimed to have said all this stuff, 3D Realms was like, uh-uh,

44:10.340 --> 44:20.380
we never said that, and apparently, which they said, the George Bressard of 3D Realms

44:20.380 --> 44:24.540
said, in what appears to be an unfortunate turn of events, there seems to have been some

44:24.540 --> 44:29.860
confusion between what was off the record and what was not. I suppose we're used to

44:29.860 --> 44:36.400
dealing with the gaming press and not mainstream press. Lesson learned. So, I don't know if

44:36.400 --> 44:41.340
that means that, uh, yeah, it is actually coming out in 2008, but shhh, we never said

44:41.340 --> 44:47.180
that, you know, that type of thing, or... I think they're more afraid of the, uh, the

44:47.180 --> 44:51.420
space-time continuing damage that would come from actually confirming this game. They basically

44:51.420 --> 44:57.620
said the release date is still when it's done and will be until that appropriate moment.

44:57.620 --> 45:03.460
Platforms have not been finalized or announced. You can... It'll be done when it's done and

45:03.460 --> 45:06.940
stop asking. But here's the question, though. Anyone still... Just put that on a big piece

45:06.940 --> 45:12.260
of paper and fax it to any website. Granted, this will be an instant purchase for me, but,

45:12.260 --> 45:16.980
I mean, do I really care anymore about... I mean, this isn't like some huge epic game

45:16.980 --> 45:23.460
anymore, just kinda, eh, whatever. It's limping along to the finish line. You'd buy it just

45:23.460 --> 45:26.900
to see how terrible it actually turns out to be. Oh, it's not gonna be... I mean, it's

45:26.900 --> 45:33.540
gonna be borderline terrible. Like, Duke Nukem 3D was borderline terrible, but, um, it'll

45:33.540 --> 45:37.700
be awesome. Wait a minute, Duke Nukem 3D was kinda rad. It was rad, but see, it had the

45:37.700 --> 45:42.260
cops shooting hookers. It had the B movie, like, it's cool for the same reason Evil Dead

45:42.260 --> 45:44.860
is cool. Yeah, that's what I meant. Let's put it that way. Well, it's also cool because

45:44.860 --> 45:49.980
they use a lot of lines from Evil Dead as well. True, true, true. Alright. I don't know.

45:49.980 --> 45:54.420
Well, one thing that's not cool is, uh, going down and burning things down. And, uh, what's

45:54.420 --> 45:59.980
even not cool, er, what's even more not cooler is to brag about it on the internet. And,

45:59.980 --> 46:06.500
uh, so you know for this, we've gotta give out another one of these. That's right, it's

46:06.500 --> 46:12.540
another Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award. The Orange Lounge Radio Stupid Award this

46:12.540 --> 46:22.180
week goes to a user on Game Facts. And their name is Jedi Knight 12345. Jedi Knight 12345,

46:22.180 --> 46:27.100
uh, made a post in the current events section of the Game Facts forums. And what he was

46:27.100 --> 46:33.820
doing is he was asking the folks on the forums if he should burn down a school and a church.

46:33.820 --> 46:42.020
And what happened a little later in the town of Palmyra, Missouri? He burned down a church.

46:42.020 --> 46:46.700
And so this boy was arrested on, uh, suspected arson charges. We don't know his real name

46:46.700 --> 46:51.380
because he is under the age of 18 and they withhold that kind of stuff. Uh, so we can't

46:51.380 --> 46:55.140
give out the stupid award by his real name but he certainly, if he's over the age of

46:55.140 --> 47:00.220
like 4, he's old enough to know better. You know what I mean? Even at that age you should

47:00.220 --> 47:04.540
know better. Do we really need more reason not to go on the Game Facts forums? Seriously.

47:04.540 --> 47:09.580
I feel bad for Game Facts because everybody's just using this as a reason to attack them

47:09.580 --> 47:13.460
like, you know, well that's what he gets for going to Game Facts, hahaha. You know, I'm

47:13.460 --> 47:19.940
like okay, haha. Their community was terrible long before anyone cared. Well, seriously

47:19.940 --> 47:24.660
though, this idiot could have been out there anywhere, you know, on any website. I swear,

47:24.660 --> 47:29.460
if any of our listeners ever do anything this stupid, I will find you and beat you up myself

47:29.460 --> 47:33.260
and it will not be pleasant. Do not do, don't do stupid things and if you're thinking about

47:33.260 --> 47:37.540
doing something stupid, please call someone and ask for help. Yeah, how long is it going

47:37.540 --> 47:40.140
to be before someone actually cleans? And don't log onto the internet and post on a

47:40.140 --> 47:46.100
forum. Pick up the phone and call 911 and turn yourself in. Seriously. But that, then

47:46.100 --> 47:51.660
they wouldn't be anonymous like they are on the internet. Can't catch me, I'm on Game

47:51.660 --> 47:58.940
Facts. Amaze Satsuma says 12345, how did you know the combination for my briefcase? By

47:58.940 --> 48:03.340
the way, Jedi, as if even just asking about it wasn't bad enough, it should also be noted

48:03.340 --> 48:10.440
that Jedi Knight 12345 went back to the forum and bragged that he had in fact burned a church

48:10.440 --> 48:17.440
and schooled down and he posted pictures of it on Game Facts. Now, to the users of Game

48:18.580 --> 48:23.800
Facts credit, other forum posters immediately went and found the local news station in this

48:23.800 --> 48:27.980
area and contacted them and the authorities and all that, you know, contacted people that

48:27.980 --> 48:32.340
could do something about it and turned this guy in basically. So, hooray to the Game Facts

48:32.340 --> 48:36.560
users that turned this guy in, you are exempt from the stupid award this week. However,

48:36.560 --> 48:42.860
Jedi Knight 12345, it's your stupid award. Congratulations, you're stupid. There you

48:42.860 --> 48:49.860
have it. In fact, this is just like a really stupid, stupid thing to do and this just makes

48:50.420 --> 48:54.700
me mad that now, you know, he's probably going to come back and it's going to get somehow

48:54.700 --> 48:58.940
tied back into the fact that he was a gamer. Oh, of course. You know, oh, he played too

48:58.940 --> 49:02.420
much. What's a game where you set fire to things? Is there a game where you set fire

49:02.420 --> 49:05.060
to things? There's got to be. Grand Theft Auto. He played too much Grand Theft Auto.

49:05.060 --> 49:11.060
Too much Crackdown? Molotov Cocktage. He played too much Crackdown. He played too much Dracula,

49:11.060 --> 49:15.220
throwing, or Castlevania, throwing the holy fire and learned how to start fires. So, playing

49:15.220 --> 49:22.220
too much WoW as a mage. Geez. So, the complete idiocy of this guy makes me angsty. He fires

49:22.220 --> 49:36.180
a magic missile into the darkness. You know this brings on the FUs of the Week. Loki,

49:36.180 --> 49:40.420
your FUs of the Week, please. My FUs of the Week goes to a headache that's coming on right

49:40.420 --> 49:46.220
about now and that sucks. I fucking hate getting headaches on Sundays and it's always on Sundays,

49:46.220 --> 49:52.700
but not having anything to do with this show, of course. It's just I get headaches on Sundays.

49:52.700 --> 49:57.820
Maybe you're allergic to Sunday. I'm allergic to the holy day, I guess. Sorry to hear that.

49:57.820 --> 50:03.620
Puppy, do you have any FUs you'd like to give this week? FUs to Insomnia, letting me get

50:03.620 --> 50:10.620
about ten hours of sleep over the course of four nights, and FUs to the charger from my

50:10.620 --> 50:17.620
laptop for going up and now my laptop is running on battery power until it eventually dies.

50:19.540 --> 50:23.540
My FUs of the Week goes to Sears. I don't want to give too many details about purchases

50:23.540 --> 50:28.740
I made a while ago, but oh my god, I had to go back to the store twice in one day to clear

50:28.740 --> 50:35.740
up this issue that I was having that wasn't even my fault with Sears. Ugh, horrible. Sears

50:35.740 --> 50:41.140
is on my shit list this week. I had to speak to like five different people, three on the

50:41.140 --> 50:45.140
phone, two in the store. It was horrible. But the last person I spoke to, it doesn't

50:45.140 --> 50:49.420
always go this way, the last person I spoke to could have fixed everything the very first

50:49.420 --> 50:56.420
time if I talked to that person first. Freaks. Let's move on with more news. Well, if I told

50:56.460 --> 51:02.180
you that an Oscar-nominated game was coming, or a game based off an Oscar-nominated movie

51:02.180 --> 51:09.180
coming out soon, you probably wouldn't guess Juno as the game being... I don't know. Why

51:10.340 --> 51:13.620
would they make a game based off of Juno? I don't understand it. Teaching little girls

51:13.620 --> 51:19.660
about pregnancy adventures? I haven't seen Juno, but I hear it's about teenage pregnancy

51:19.660 --> 51:23.700
or whatever. I'm not exactly sure how that makes a game. Did they make a game out of

51:23.700 --> 51:30.700
Napoleon Dynamite? I'm not sure how they'd make a game out of that either. Juno to me

51:30.700 --> 51:34.820
feels like it might be this year's Napoleon Dynamite. It's really funny now, but when

51:34.820 --> 51:40.820
it comes out on video, there's going to be a big backlash against it. Just do wait. So,

51:40.820 --> 51:46.980
I don't know. Apparently, there is a panel at DICE, the summit going on in Las Vegas

51:46.980 --> 51:53.980
right now, during the intellectual property migration specialists. It says people are

51:53.980 --> 52:00.980
making a game based off Juno just to cater to the casual market. And they didn't specify

52:01.980 --> 52:08.980
really anything about the game, but apparently it was... I don't know. He said it was probably

52:10.740 --> 52:17.740
going to be following Nexon's free-to-play business model. So, I don't know. So it would

52:17.740 --> 52:23.740
be like little mini-games for free or something? I'm sorry. This is probably going to be about

52:23.740 --> 52:30.740
as good as that Dirty Dancing game that came out, or possibly the Princess Bride. Ryoma

52:32.260 --> 52:38.300
in our chat room says, Skye, Juno is a lot less stupid than Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't

52:38.300 --> 52:43.260
seen Juno, so I thought Napoleon Dynamite was funny. I didn't think it was the most

52:43.260 --> 52:47.780
hilarious movie ever made, but I did find some things very amusing in that movie, like

52:47.780 --> 52:53.860
the grandma especially, you know? Make me another Questadilla. And when she got in the

52:53.860 --> 52:59.180
dirt bike accident, it was really funny. Forget it. Forget it, forget it. Let's talk about

52:59.180 --> 53:03.220
some other games that are coming out around the world and will start tonight in the UK,

53:03.220 --> 53:07.740
because usually Jamie does those dates, but she can't tonight. So I will be doing UK dates

53:07.740 --> 53:13.700
for you guys this week. Coming out in Europe, Battalion Wars 2 makes its way to the Wii

53:13.700 --> 53:19.020
on the 15th, along with 8-Ball All-Stars and the DS. Castlevania, the Dracula X Chronicles

53:19.020 --> 53:21.740
is a big game that came out here a little while ago. Europe, you're finally getting

53:21.740 --> 53:26.820
it on the PSP on the 15th, as well as Coded Arms Contingent, also on the PSP. Cooking

53:26.820 --> 53:31.340
Mama 2 finally comes out on the Nintendo DS for you guys. Not as bad of a delay, though.

53:31.340 --> 53:36.840
We just got it here about a month ago. Cruis'n makes its way to the Wii. I'm sorry. Dragon

53:36.840 --> 53:42.940
Ball Z, Budokai Tekenshi 3 comes out on the Wii. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Elements

53:42.940 --> 53:49.260
comes out on the Xbox 360. Coming out on the DS, a big title, Final Fantasy XII Revenant

53:49.260 --> 53:54.140
Wings, which Loki was kind enough to get me for Christmas, and I still haven't played.

53:54.140 --> 53:57.940
I'm very sorry, Loki. But I feel like I need to finish Final Fantasy XII on console first.

53:57.940 --> 54:04.380
I will. Soon. Multi-platform wise, you got a game called Jumper coming out on PlayStation

54:04.380 --> 54:12.340
2 and the Xbox 360. NBA 08 on the PlayStation 3, coming out on the Wii as well. The Destiny

54:12.340 --> 54:18.880
of Zorro. That sounds like it could suck. Lastly, but certainly not leastly, where would

54:18.880 --> 54:24.420
you Naruto fans be without a release for you? Naruto Ninja Destiny in the UK on the DS on

54:24.420 --> 54:33.420
the 15th of February. In the US, we're getting quite a few things coming out, including Lost

54:33.420 --> 54:39.780
Odyssey, that we've been seeing some pretty strange commercials for on TV. It makes it

54:39.780 --> 54:44.180
look like some sort of hippie game, I don't know. I fast-forward all commercials, so what

54:44.180 --> 54:49.580
makes it look so horrible? It's the music that they picked for. Yeah, I don't remember

54:49.580 --> 54:53.880
what the name was. I don't know, it's just... But it's something about White Knight talking

54:53.880 --> 55:00.660
backwards. Huh. Interesting. God, I wish I remembered the name of that song. I don't

55:00.660 --> 55:04.740
wish I remembered the name of that song. It's horrible. Anyways, so that's... Now you know

55:04.740 --> 55:11.820
I gotta look it up on YouTube, so... So that's coming out in the US on the 360. Today, actually,

55:11.820 --> 55:17.540
Professor Layton and the Curious Village made its way out onto the DS. Also this week, Conflict

55:17.540 --> 55:27.580
Denied Ops on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. On the PC, Penumbra, The Black Plague.

55:27.580 --> 55:33.860
That's coming out. Jumper, a Griffin story on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and the Wii. It's

55:33.860 --> 55:38.900
kind of a side story to the movie, which I hear the movie sucks, by the way, so... Why

55:38.900 --> 55:47.220
am I not surprised? Dungeon Explorer, Warriors of the Ancient Arts for PSP and DS. Dark Messiah

55:47.220 --> 55:56.000
of Might and Magic Elements on Xbox 360. Space Force Captains on PC. There's also a new episode

55:56.000 --> 56:02.380
of the Sam & Max game, Episode 203, The Night of the Raving Dead. That's, of course, on

56:02.380 --> 56:13.100
PC. Carrier Strike Force on PC. 13th Century Death of Glory. Wipeout Pulse on the PSP.

56:13.100 --> 56:19.100
Innocent Life of Futuristic Harvest Moon, Special Edition on PlayStation 2. Yay! Futuristic

56:19.100 --> 56:27.940
Harvest Moon. Yeah, it was on PSP before. RPG Maker VX on PC. And finally on PlayStation

56:27.940 --> 56:35.780
2, and they moved it up quite a bit from March. Ratchet and Clank Size Matters on PlayStation

56:35.780 --> 56:42.540
2. It moved up a whole friggin' month. Here's what I love about live radio. We've got YouTube

56:42.540 --> 56:45.920
right up here. We've got the chat room to help us find things on YouTube. Here's a little

56:45.920 --> 56:50.300
piece of the Lost Odyssey TV commercial. And that funny, I mean, obviously, what horrible

56:50.300 --> 57:08.020
radio, but Loki's talking about the strange audio. Oh, these are classic songs. Oh, this

57:08.020 --> 57:21.060
is Jefferson Airplane. That was pretty rad. White Rabbit, my Jefferson Airplane. There

57:21.060 --> 57:27.580
it is, right there on the side. Sorry, I am not up on my Jefferson Airplane. Okay. Also,

57:27.580 --> 57:31.740
this week, or next weekend, I want you to go get some CDs. I want you to get Jefferson

57:31.740 --> 57:38.900
Airplane. I want you to get Fog Hat. I want you to get some Pink Floyd, and Journey for

57:38.900 --> 57:45.700
good measure, because you know I can't go get some Clean's Clearwater Revival. I want

57:45.700 --> 57:51.740
you to smoke a big bonk. Just kidding, we don't endorse that. Some other fun stuff,

57:51.740 --> 57:56.140
of course, this is the scraping the bottom of the barrel stuff, but oh, I forgot to mention

57:56.140 --> 58:05.100
also the cobalt blue and black DS that came out today as well. Anyways, Go Diego Go Safari

58:05.100 --> 58:12.740
Rescue 1 PlayStation 2, and the Wii. Got to pick that one up. There was also a Dora the

58:12.740 --> 58:17.700
Explorer game coming out, but I don't really care what that is. Bloom Pop on the Wii. What

58:17.700 --> 58:22.540
was that parody of Dora the Explorer they had on Saturday Night Live? I don't remember

58:22.540 --> 58:27.820
that. I think I, like, wet myself laughing. It was so freaking hilarious, because, you

58:27.820 --> 58:34.060
know, forget it. I'll save that for another show. Anyways, Bloom Pop for the Wii. It's

58:34.060 --> 58:39.980
a really cheap puzzle game, so that's kind of neat. Rock Band, they're getting the stand-alone

58:39.980 --> 58:44.780
drum sets. They're supposed to be coming out this week as well, so look for those. $90

58:44.780 --> 58:52.940
peripherals. There's $80 peripherals. I thought it was $90 for the drum sets. No, $80. It's

58:52.940 --> 59:01.860
still expensive, though. Yeah. And that's it. Sorry. Alright, let's move on to Japanese

59:01.860 --> 59:10.620
release dates. Coming out in Japan on the 14th of February on the Xbox 360, WWE Smackdown

59:10.620 --> 59:14.900
vs. Raw 2008. I don't know how popular Rasslin' is over in Japan. I think they have their

59:14.900 --> 59:19.040
own wrestling league over there, because I've seen some YouTubage. But if you want to experience

59:19.040 --> 59:22.900
the American version, there you go. It's also coming out on PlayStation 3, by the way, and

59:22.900 --> 59:26.660
appears to be one of the bigger releases this week in Japan. There's not a lot else. It's

59:26.660 --> 59:30.580
also coming out on the Wii. But if you're not a Rasslin' fan, you can get Medal of Honor,

59:30.580 --> 59:33.820
Heroes 2. It does come out on the Nintendo Wii. By the way, there's also a bundle with

59:33.820 --> 59:40.740
the Wii Zapper making its way to Japan. On the PlayStation 2, Decapo! The Origin comes

59:40.740 --> 59:48.980
out. Another Pachinko game, Jisen Pachislot, Hisoho Selection, Salomon Kintaru, Slaughter

59:48.980 --> 59:53.780
Kintaru, Oreno Sora. Yes, that's one name. It's another Sega Pachinko game. That's all

59:53.780 --> 01:00:00.680
you need to know. Kimikiz comes out as well. Poison Pink. That sounds like it could be

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:08.260
kind of fun. And another Rasslin' game, Wrestle Angels Survivor. Good price. It might be a

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.820
price reduction on that. I don't know about that one. Interesting. Let's see what's coming

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:18.580
out on the handhelds on the Nintendo DS. Digimon Championship. A game called Happy, Happy Clover

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:28.060
comes out as well. And just in time for Valentine's Day, Otomeki Koikakume Love Revo DS comes

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:32.180
out as well. Let's take a quick look at the PSP, see if there's anything of note for you

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:37.540
guys over in Japan. Medal of Honor as well coming on the Sony PSP, Medal of Honor Heroes

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:43.540
that is. And where would your life be without another Gundam game? Mobile Suit Gundam, Giren

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:49.060
no Yabu, Axis no Koei comes out. Oh, that's a Korean date actually. It must have already

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:56.620
come out in Japan. There you have it. Your Japanese release dates. Sweet. Well, if you're

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:02.840
a little bit late to, say, returning your books to a library, if you happen to be in

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:08.900
this neck of the woods here, of the story here, you actually can play DDR to possibly

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:16.940
avoid late fees. Apparently, the story is of a librarian's annual patron appreciation

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:23.860
day, where he lets attendees to avoid overdue fines by donating non-perishables to a local

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:31.020
soup kitchen or playing a quick game of DDR. And the exact pay-for-play system, they didn't

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:36.680
really discuss that, but a 16-year-old who was apparently in the article needed a C grade

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:44.820
on her dance performance to erase a $14 fine from a record. So, that's pretty cool. Yeah,

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:51.180
I wonder how high they would go for late fees to be erased. Even though I never actually

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:56.860
went to a library in my life. That just proves that library late fees are stupid. Look, you

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:02.620
maybe ought to go volunteer to do some DDR for people's late fees. Fuck that. I don't

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.740
even know where this is. I'm not going to go there and play DDR for their late fees.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:13.260
It's fucking paying me money for that. It's certainly a creative method. I'll give it

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:22.460
that, I guess. Also, a pretty creative game. There was a lot of people that loved Myst

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:27.340
Online. Unfortunately, they don't have much longer to love this game because GameTap will

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.900
be shutting down Myst Online in 60 days. They made the difficult decision earlier this week

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:39.020
that Myst Online Uro Live will be going down in 60 days, so that's somewhere in April when

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:44.220
the game will be coming down. And what's really cool is Rick Sanchez, who has actually been

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:48.420
on our show before. He was on, I want to say about a year and a half ago. He actually posts

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:53.180
on the GameTap forums and kind of had to make that very difficult post because, you know,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:58.760
like any MMO, there's rabid fans. And, you know, Myst Online is no exception. It had

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.100
its share of rabid fans. And they're not happy to hear about the game going. People want

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:09.300
refunds and so on and so on. MystOnline.com will stay active, you know, as a tribute to

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:14.780
what was in the game. And, you know, in Rick's post, he said they were looking at, quote,

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:19.460
a wide variety of possibilities for maintaining the game. He swears up and down they're not

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.860
just a bunch of evil corporate types who do nothing but count pennies and wear Brooks

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.340
Brothers suits. So, you know, and honestly, I don't know how many of you guys have played

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.300
Myst Online. I checked it out a couple months ago for the sake of reviewing it on the show.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:37.580
And what I noticed about the game is that there are real live people that play the game

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:42.700
in a, you know, making the story work type of capacity. For instance, if you were a new

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:48.300
person, you could go to these classes in Myst Online to learn about the world of Myst. And

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.700
it wasn't an automated thing. There was actually someone there. Like when I went in there,

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.140
the person said, you know, hello, Sky, are you, because that's the online name I use

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.660
as most of you know. The person said, hello, Sky, are you here for the class today? And

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.460
I was like, yes. And they're like, okay, just take a seat over there. We'll get started

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.660
soon. You know, like it's crazy. They actually have people in and I imagine that's got to

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:12.260
be very expensive thing to maintain. So I say kudos to GameTap for giving it a try.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.300
And if the rest of you are pissed off, be pissed off at the fact that people didn't

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.940
play it. That's why it shut down. If your MMO doesn't have enough people playing it

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:27.200
to keep it, you know, running, it shuts down. In the end though, the rabid fans will find

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:37.180
a way to maintain it. I've had that experience before when I played Myth a long time ago

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:48.100
and when Bungie finally shut down the servers for Myth 2. It wasn't more than a month before

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.740
players had brought up their own servers that Bungie actually endorsed and said, hey, you

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.580
know, you're free to go ahead and play these servers now.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:02.580
We'll turn the other cheek for this one. Let's see. Josie16 in chat, chat at orangeonshooter.com

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.660
says, Myst online was well thought through. Too bad to see it go. The problem with Myst

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:12.140
online, even though they had the class and everything, I found it very hard to just get

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:16.660
in and go. You know, like I think the reason why WoW, like one reason WoW is so fucking

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.180
popular is that I don't know how many of you have sit down to play it, you know, despite

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.420
how you feel about the game, but you can get up and running in World of Warcraft relatively

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.820
quickly. You know, there's kind of a learning curve as you level from levels 1 to 10. You

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.700
know, that's why people are like, oh, you can get to level 10 in an hour. That's because

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:35.460
level 1 to 10 is really the learning curve for noobs and it really walks you through

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.340
the game. You know, and I have the same bitch as Final Fantasy XI. I think if Final Fantasy

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.580
XI didn't have the Final Fantasy name in front of it, that was a very hard game to

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.500
just get up and running in, you know, to kind of figure out. Remember when we first bought

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.780
Final Fantasy XI, Loki, we bought it like the day it came out on the PC. It was back

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:55.700
when we were living together. We were so lost the first day. I didn't realize that the

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.700
world extended beyond the first like little area. I was like, when I went there and there

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:04.380
was like a whole like, you know, the plat, was it the Lathine Plateau or whatever. I'm

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.540
like, holy crap. And then like later on when you're playing the game, you're like, oh

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.900
wow, this world's even bigger. I'm gonna kill bunnies for the rest of my life. This

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:18.340
is fun. And then like you go, then you go into, what's the thing after, it's Ronfro

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.300
is the first area. Then you go into Lathine Plateau and you go into Lathine Plateau and

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:26.820
you try to kill a bunny there and they just murder you. You're like, I just got raped

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:33.340
by a bunny. Why do you hate me so much? Oh, now I remember. That's right. I'm so glad

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:41.860
I didn't have to deal with that. That game was fun. I miss it. But not really. Alright.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:47.420
One game I'm probably not gonna miss either is Midway's brand new, this is Vegas. And

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:53.340
apparently if you're too, I don't know, poor to go to Vegas to be a whore or to gamble,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:59.220
you can do it in this game. So that's awesome. They didn't really say what it was that you

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:04.500
would be doing in this. Apparently you would be able to live out your fantasies in Vegas

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:12.420
by fighting, gambling, driving, and partying. Strangely no mention of hookers. Well, I don't

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:20.100
know, in the trailer though, there was hooker-like people. But yeah, so this is Vegas coming

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:27.620
to Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. You know, I'm just, I'm wondering if people are going to start

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:37.660
doing this is spot on. This is Vegas. I'm sure it's somewhere on YTMND already. I'm

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:43.340
sure it's already there. I don't know. It's a weird idea for a game, but... Well, here's

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:48.480
something that will be coming out soon, and this is really not a surprise to anyone who

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.380
has played the game Puzzle Quest or one of its thousand ports. It's out on every freaking

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.600
system out there. But it is a great game. I mean, really, it kind of took a great idea,

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.380
which is like, you know, bejeweled, and just put a whole new spin on it that made it even

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:08.620
better. Puzzle Quest is just great, and Puzzle Quest is going to be getting a sequel. It

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.740
was a press release put out this week from D3. It was mentioning the forthcoming sequel

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.460
to the game. Here's the quote from the press release. The company will also be releasing

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:24.660
video games based on Artiman's popular Shaun the Sheep character in 2008, alongside the

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:29.820
eagerly awaited follow-ups to the best-selling Ben 10 and Puzzle Quest. Now, see, I don't

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:36.340
know what I'm more excited about. Sequel to Puzzle Quest or Shaun the Sheep? I've never

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.660
fucking heard of it, but that sounds pretty awesome, I gotta say.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:44.140
Sheep. And I don't remember Ben 10 being that popular, but okay.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:49.340
Well, apparently it was popular enough for me to make a live-action movie about, even

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:52.380
though the only reason I know that is because I watch too much Cartoon Network.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:57.180
Maybe something that's more popular in another country, I don't know. But I've never heard

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.460
of it personally, so there you go.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.500
Who knows what 12-year-olds are watching these days, other than Hannah Montana?

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:09.300
Okay. I'm sure this, don't get me started on how fucking nuts it is that like, the theaters

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.700
are like packed with little girls and their moms, soon to see Hannah Montana. Like, you

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.940
know that movie is like crushing everything. And I hear people talking about it at work

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.940
all the time.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.620
It's not a movie, it's a recording of a concert.

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:22.700
I know, it's crazy.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.700
It's not a movie.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.700
We want to talk about how the DS prints money. Dude, Miley Cyrus has money coming at her

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.700
ass, okay?

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:37.020
That's it. I wonder when she's going to do a cover of her dad's achy breaky heart, or

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020
duet.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.020
Nice.

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:47.460
I'm sure this is pure coincidence that I have this story, but apparently Mastiff has licensed

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:54.060
the rights to the Major League Eating, I didn't even know there was Major League Eating, but

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:58.540
apparently they're going to make a Major League Eating game. The game will play out like a

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:06.540
fighting game, and it will show people on screen eating. Using, you will have a mastery

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.820
of offensive defensive weapons, just like watching this show on Justin TV. You get to

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.820
watch people eat.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:21.820
Hey, I am having dinner, okay? Whatever. I'm not like, oh, it's the fish! Mmm, food good!

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.060
You should do that one day on the show, though.

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.060
You really should.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.980
So, you will have offensive and defensive weapons, including burps, belches, and mustard

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:30.980
gas.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.060
This sounds like the ultimate small power-up.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.980
This sounds like the ultimate, like, twelve-year-old boy game.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:38.980
Teehee fart!

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:45.860
You know, like, seriously, that was horrible. And, of course, the technical mastery necessary

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:51.900
to avoid emptying one's stomach in doodly colored reversals of fortune. As they like

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900
to put it.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900
Wow.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900
Yeah.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:59.100
There was this, I don't think it was worth the effort to even make that eloquent.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:03.380
Really, are you that desperate for licenses? Well, it is Mastiff, so, you know, I guess

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:11.500
so. I mean, they just came out with a Top Gun DS game, like, not too long ago. A little

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.500
late.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:18.300
So, last week we had Major Wee, and this week we have Major Eating. That's nice. You'd

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.340
think it would go the other way around. That's all I have to say.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.580
God damn, if this isn't a story that won't ever go away as, Apple's getting into gaming!

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.660
Oh my God, Apple's getting into gaming.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:34.260
Hey, Newsflash. Apple's kind of already, well, A, Apple went into gaming a long time ago

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:39.660
and didn't do Too Hot. Pippin, hello. Apple's already, like, they're getting their big toe,

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.580
like, they're putting their big toe in the water and saying, hmm, me with. Like, they've

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.680
got some pretty awesome games on the iPod now, like Pagle on the iPod. I don't know

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.020
if I've officially reviewed it on the show or whatever, but Pagle on the iPod's pretty

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.240
awesome. Like, that's the system that game was made for, you know. That's a pretty awesome

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.180
game on the iPod. And, Faze, you know, basically Guitar Hero for your iPod, you know, of sorts.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.540
Guitar Hero? What are you talking about?

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.540
Well, because, you know, you have to.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.020
It's not Guitar Hero, it's Amplitude.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.660
Okay, whatever, it's Amplitude. But, you know, sadly, more people probably know what I'm

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.780
talking about when I talk about Guitar Hero. So.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.500
When we need to educate them.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.300
Hitstun in chess is apparently the iPod version of Pagle is great. It really is. I think Pagle's

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:20.100
probably the best game you can get on the iPod right now, honestly. You know, and I

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.140
love Sonic the Hedgehog and all that stuff, too, but Pagle, just because of the nature

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:29.140
of, you know, how you rotate the gun to fire down the, it's like, imagine if Plinko was

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.460
a game. That's basically what Pagle is. And you can rotate the little gun with the dial.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.020
It works perfectly. So.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.620
We need a, like, online version of Price is Right the game. That would be awesome.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.620
That would be kind of rad. Anyhow.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.940
Use the touch wheel to spin the big wheel.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.180
Well, hold on. We got to rail. We went from Apple to talking about Price is Right. A trademark

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.580
apparently was filed on February 5th and now has the room rails going again because Apple

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:02.580
has updated its trademark to now include toys, games, and playthings, namely handheld units

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.460
for playing electronic games, handheld units for playing video games, stand-alone video

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:11.020
game machines, electronic games other than those adapted for use of television receivers

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:16.500
only, LCD game machines, electronic educational game machines, toys, namely battery-powered

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.940
computer games.

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:24.140
I seem to recall earlier this year I made a prediction on the show, or I should say

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:27.980
late last year, that somebody was going to step up and challenge Nintendo's dominance

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.260
in the handheld market and it wasn't going to be Sony or Nintendo. Of course at the time

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.580
I think I said it wasn't going to be Apple either, but two out of three ain't bad. This

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.620
could be. It could be.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.060
This is going to be such an abortion of a game system. It's not even funny. I mean,

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.020
seriously, this is from the guys that thought, you know what, having a CD-ROM drive in our

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:51.420
laptop, that would be stupid. What are we thinking? I mean, this is going to be a game

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.100
system that's not going to have a cartridge slot or anywhere to put the games in. You're

01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:01.700
going to have to download the Wi-Fi from your computer or some shit. Lame! They don't understand.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.060
They're just going to make it pink and pretty and stupid idiots will buy it.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.420
Brace yourself. Brace yourself.

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.660
Withholding justice.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:12.300
I am agreeing with Loki. Me of all people.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.420
And you are an Apple fanboy of the highest caliber.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:20.460
I do not think that Apple, I think they got lucky with the iPhone jumping into a completely

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:26.760
new market, but they, I think if they try to get into gaming, they're going to fail.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:32.900
I just don't, style and design is not going to win when it's the software that sells the

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:32.900
games.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.540
And I'm not necessarily talking about the MacBook Air and stuff like that, just that.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:44.240
I'm just saying they choose to go aesthetics over functionality for a lot of stuff. And

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.260
I don't know. I mean, that works for some people, I guess, but the problem is I don't

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:52.300
think it's going to work for a console system or it's going to work for a handheld system

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.260
because they're going to want to change it constantly. I mean, you know, the PlayStation

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:03.460
3 does the same damn thing, but still, you can't. It's just going to get confusing and

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.060
they're going to want to do a ton of different things. It's going to be like the PSP, but

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.900
they're going to change it a lot more.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:14.560
And it's not like you can release a new system like you can release a new version of an iPod

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.580
and it'll still have the same technology and functionality. Because they'll end up releasing

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:24.940
something new six months later and it won't be able to be backwards compatible with the

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:25.580
previous games.

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.340
And, you know, go ahead and try to take on Nintendo. I mean, sure, they need someone

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:35.220
to do it, but, you know, you had other people try, too, like Gizmondo. They thought that

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.580
they could take on Nintendo and that failed.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.660
This is all I'm going to say, is that I will withhold judgment until it comes out, like,

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.020
you know, a good critic will. You know, you can't really judge it, tell the final things

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:50.020
out. But I wouldn't be surprised if you see the iPod go a little further into gaming.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:53.420
Like, I could totally see them putting out, like, a controller or something that plugs

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420
into the iPod.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.180
That makes more sense, I don't think.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.900
But I think that's as far as it's going to go. I don't see them, like, releasing a whole

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:04.980
new thing. I see it as some type of extension or enhancement for an iPod. That's it.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:09.460
Yeah, and, I mean, the best stuff, the best games that will ever come out for an iPod

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:15.780
will probably be made by random people, not by Apple, that use, like, the iPod Touch's

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.100
touchscreen functionality.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:22.180
Which, apparently, PopCap might be it. Which makes sense, because the type of games that

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:26.300
PopCap puts out is perfect for the iPod audience, right? Am I right?

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.300
Yeah, casual stuff.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.780
Yeah. So there you have it.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:30.660
Puzzle Pirates on an iPhone, hmm.

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:35.260
All right. Anyhow, part A is about over and we're going to be getting into part B tonight,

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:38.460
which, by the way, if I haven't mentioned yet, in part B tonight, I've mentioned this

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.300
a lot, actually. We're going to be playing a brand new game we've never played before

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:47.220
here on the show. Everybody in chat can play and possibly win tonight. It's going to be

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.260
amazing. But before we get to that in part B, we have to do one more segment here in

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:57.580
part A. And for that, we have to bring somebody special on the line.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.180
Oh, caller, are you there on the line?

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180
Yo.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.140
Hey, Jamie, how are you feeling?

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.500
I'm feeling, um, stuff that I can't say on the air.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:11.860
I see. So you're just kind of feeling a little, uh, you know, a little sick this week, basically?

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.580
It's viral.

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.340
Ugh. That's never any fun. Well, sorry to hear that you're sick, but you'll be back

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.340
next week, right?

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:25.780
Yes, I will. I didn't want to, I just didn't want to get you guys sick. I don't care about

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780
my co-workers so much.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.780
Yeah.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.540
I'm just kidding. Because I got it from my co-workers, so.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:36.420
Oh, snap. So you're going to go back and get some more of them sick then, right?

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.060
No, I figured if they weren't going to get sick, they would have already gotten sick

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.060
from it.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.820
Alright. Well, anyway, Jamie, you know, we just couldn't do this segment without you.

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.660
We're at the end of part A, as you may know from listening or what have you. We've got

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.340
to do the Classic Game of the Week, so let's get in the music.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:18:00.140
And Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the listeners to celebrate this

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.140
week?

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:08.100
The Classic Game of the Week is one of my personal favorites. It's Ys III, where it's

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:15.100
from Ys, which is, you know, being Ys III, it is the third in the series. So this one's

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:19.580
actually different from the other two. I don't know if anyone else was a big fan of it. If

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:25.340
I'm right, this was out on MSX. It was, I got used to the Super Nintendo version, but

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:33.500
it was also out on PC Engine. In fact, I've actually got the Duo version of it somewhere.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.140
But the special thing about this one is that it's sort of a departure in gameplay from

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.140
the previous ones.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.140
Very cool.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.140
How?

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.140
Sorry, go ahead.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:50.620
Well, with this one is that the previous ones were the whole top-down, you know, old-school

01:18:50.620 --> 01:19:01.420
Zelda-style overhead view. And this one had primarily side-scrolling. You'd have to actually

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:06.580
mash a button to swing the sword and attack, and you also had rings that you could equip

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:12.220
for different special effects. So instead of having, like, magic, you would use your

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:17.940
ring power. And it was a pretty cool game. It was very, I thought, unique for the time

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:23.580
and the type of RPG that it was. But it also had, like, some really fantastic music. I

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:26.940
love this game a whole lot.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:35.980
Let's take a listen to the music real quick. Now, one thing I should say about this game,

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.900
a very common mispronunciation of the title, right, because it looks like Y's, because

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:41.980
it's just the letter Y.

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:42.980
It's Y's.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.980
Yeah, it's Y's. So.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:51.980
Yeah. In fact, if you actually look at the name, the Japanese title romanized, it says

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.980
Isu.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.980
So.

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.980
Very cool.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:55.980
Does that help?

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.700
Now, the most recent Y's game, if I'm not mistaken, because I think we brought it up

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:02.260
on a previous edition of the show, they ported, or I guess they made a new version of this

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.260
game for the PSP, right?

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:12.660
There's, if I'm right, I think it was Y's V, technically, the arc of Mappus, Mappus

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:20.140
3. And then there was a Windows one that was like a remake of Y's V, which was the arc

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.140
of Spelcona.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.140
Wow.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:27.020
It was more like an expansion of Y's V.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:30.980
I gotcha. So basically, you know, this game is so classic that it still continues to live

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980
on today in sequels.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:37.580
Pretty much. I mean, and anyone who's got, you know, Super Nintendo, if you can find

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.220
it and should be able to find it really cheap still, I recommend taking it up. It's a fun

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.220
game.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.260
All right. Maybe someday a virtual console? Who knows?

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.300
I would hope so, but we'd probably get Ys I and II before we got Ys III.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.340
I guess that's true. All right.

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.340
Yeah.

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:58.060
Well, there you have it, boys and girls, your classic game of the week, Wanderers from Ys,

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:01.940
the third game in the series. The music you were hearing was from the MSX version, but

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.660
you can find it also on Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx, if I'm not mistaken?

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.660
Yep.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.660
Very cool.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.660
Yep, it was a Turbo CD.

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.900
Well, Jamie, we look forward to having you back in the house next week. Rest up and feel

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.700
better and say hi to Dan for us.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.780
Oh, well, he's in there playing Smash Brothers.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.420
All right. Oh, you guys have the new Smash Brothers, right?

01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:26.820
Yeah. Well, we don't have it. A friend of ours brought it over and so they've been going

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:34.340
through the whole adventure mode in there with the amazingly compatible team of Samus

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.340
and Pikachu.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.340
Who would have thought?

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:45.740
What was it? Team Bishonen. They have the Bishonen Assault Squad, which is Pit and Link.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.140
Wow. That sounds kind of fun.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.100
And then the Fire Emblem team.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.260
So do you approve of Super Smash Brothers Brawl after seeing it last week in studio

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:55.460
and experiencing it at your own house this week?

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.460
I quite approve.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.620
All right. Very nice. There you have it. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, we're going to go

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:03.820
ahead and take our break and a brand new game for our listeners in Part B tonight. I'm sorry

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.540
you don't get to hear it, but we'll fill you in afterwards, okay?

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.540
Oh, I see how it is. You wait until I'm out and then you do the new stuff.

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.420
Well, because we have to fill time because you're not here to give us your viewpoint

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.260
and interrupt Loki when he's talking. Just kidding.

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.260
I'm just going to cry.

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:23.780
Aw, Dark Soccer, we love you. You should play in the game tonight. It would be funny if

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:24.780
you win.

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.940
I can't ever get the show to pull up on my laptop.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:31.380
Aw, that's a bummer. All right. Well, Dark Soccer, take care. We'll see you next week,

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.380
okay?

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.380
Okay. Bye.

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.380
All right. Bye-bye.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.380
Auf Wiedersehen.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:41.100
All right. That's going to do it for this Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio. We're

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.820
going to take a quick break, though, and we'll be back with plenty more. However, here's

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:50.660
the deal. I got to close all my chat windows here. We're going to be asking a qualifying

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:57.460
question to qualify for tonight's game in Part B. Basically, one contestant will be

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.380
coming in via the Skype line. So I'm going to give you a question, very similar type

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.500
of question you might hear in tonight's game.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.380
And if you think you know the answer, you're going to send me the answer in a private message

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:11.500
in the chat room. If you don't know how to send me a private message, ask somebody. And

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:15.860
you are going to send me your phone number. And by sending me your phone number, that

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.860
is consent that you approve of us calling you, please make sure you are by your phone

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.940
in the next hour or so, and that we don't get any surprises of Mommy or Daddy picking

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:28.820
it up. So don't submit an answer to this if you do not have control over your own phone.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.660
So here it is. This is the qualifier question. You're going to send me the correct answer

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:37.140
to this question, and then you are going to send me your phone number if you want to play,

01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:41.220
and we'll pick somebody randomly out of those that submit the correct phone number. So here

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:45.100
it is. And I'm putting this in the podcast because I felt those listening in the podcast

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:52.100
might want to play along. Here is the qualifying question. What game is this music from?

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:59.100
I wouldn't yell it out in chat or you are giving it away for everybody. Here are the

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.720
correct answers. I'm sorry, one of these is the correct answer. Here are the answers you

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:12.720
have to choose from. A. Nightmare on Elm Street. B. Halloween. C. Friday the 13th.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:19.720
Again, if you know the answer, A. Nightmare on Elm Street. B. Halloween. C. Friday the

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.160
13th. Send me a private message in chat with the correct answer and your telephone number.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.100
If you're listening on the podcast only and not live on Sunday night, sorry, but the game

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.480
has already ended and you're not eligible. We're taping live here on Sunday night, February

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.180

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.940
with us after tonight's break. So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.400
Lounge Radio.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.800
