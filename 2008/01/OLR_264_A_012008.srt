1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,510
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anything else you want to add to your gaming week, DarkSakura?

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Then let's go over to Loki.

4
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

5
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,272
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was fine.

6
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:19,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of Nitro Bike this week because I was anticipating it was going to be awesome and all that stuff for the Wii because they're kind of comparing it to Excite Truck.

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not even close to Excite Truck, and it's also not even close to being good.

8
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:26,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, it sucked.

9
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:27,699
[SPEAKER_05]: In what ways did it suck?

10
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:32,819
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucked because the tracks weren't really open enough like Excite Truck.

11
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:48,906
[SPEAKER_03]: The game itself wasn't very fun because you can do tricks in the air and stuff, but really there's no need to be doing any sort of variety of tricks because you can do the same trick over and over and get the same kind of bonus for it, which is more Nitro.

12
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:56,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact is the tracks aren't really straight enough anyways to where you would need the Nitro, so it was kind of dumb.

13
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:00,536
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried, and they failed.

14
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:19,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, though, that I do not like about a lot of these racing games is that unlike Excite Truck, which you hold the Wii Remote kind of parallel to the ground, a lot of these games will have it where you're holding it on its side so that you can use those really crappy plastic steering wheel controllers.

15
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hate having to hold it like that because it makes it really uncomfortable for...

16
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:28,553
[SPEAKER_03]: for your hands because you have to twist your whole wrist back and stuff.

17
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Sight Trucker is just awesome.

18
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:30,734
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

19
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:40,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, on purpose, I played Offroad Extreme Special Edition, which is a game that got reviewed on IGN, giving it a 1.5.

20
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:45,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's deserving of that.

21
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just really bad.

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, your vehicles in the game kind of control like crap.

23
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:53,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Very sluggish.

24
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,823
[SPEAKER_03]: and I had trouble staying on the track because of that.

25
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was fun to get to play it, I guess.

26
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:08,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, not so crappy games, I got to play Burnout Paradise, which I'm very surprised.

27
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:13,955
[SPEAKER_03]: The game, I didn't think it was going to be that good when I played the demo.

28
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:21,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't seem like something I would like, but playing the full version of the game, I was completely wrong.

29
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:21,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's

30
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:23,774
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:43,953
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,378
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:03:32,794 --> 00:04:02,482
[SPEAKER_03]: and in fact usually I notice a car will zoom past me and start driving crazy and I'm like okay that's one of the cars and so I'll chase after it and stuff but uh it's just pretty awesome and the races are pretty cool also the music in the game they have a great soundtrack in it although the only flaw they put Avril Lavigne's girlfriend in there so I guess there's gotta be something for everybody but it was a little weird driving and all of a sudden your girlfriend comes on it just felt strange but uh

34
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend the game.

35
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be playing this for a long time.

36
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:08,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

37
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually looking forward to picking up this game, too.

38
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:12,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Burnout games.

39
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:15,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not huge on a lot of racing games, but I like Burnout quite a bit.

40
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try the online, but the servers, I guess, are not up right now.

41
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, seeing as the game isn't totally out yet, that might make sense why.

42
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

43
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then product placement, there's a ton of it.

44
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,042
[SPEAKER_03]: There's vans driving around with, like, axe and, you know...

45
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: and all sorts of weird shit on there.

46
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:33,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Like manly ads.

47
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you can crash into them, which is great.

48
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's like, oh, product placement, destroy!

49
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:46,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be funnier if you got more points if you destroyed a Tampax billboard or something, you know what I mean?

50
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:48,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome, though.

51
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:52,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you drive really fast through the game, they'll have like stunt mode and stuff.

52
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:53,679
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

53
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like, it's like, you know, just crashing and stuff.

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's...

55
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

56
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try doing, like, your own custom soundtracks?

57
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you said you don't like Avril Lavigne or whatever that's in there.

58
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:10,414
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, when I played the last Burnout game on 360, I just used custom soundtracks all the time.

59
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:14,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I would basically use the music from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune to Burnout, and it was awesome.

60
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:18,019
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, I just, they have, you know, the EA tracks or whatever.

61
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go in there and shut off which songs you don't like.

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,623
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't like Avril Lavigne, you can just turn the track off and you'll never hear it again.

63
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:24,643
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good function.

64
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:28,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, actually what I did is I kept, and I make,

65
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:31,575
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had to find it from a cage match, but I may pick this song.

66
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:45,046
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a song in there remixed by Jason Nevins that I've been having on repeat because it was the song that they had in the trailer for, what was it, I want to say it was Taxi or something like that.

67
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: That really crappy movie with...

68
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:51,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Queen Latifah, and what's his name?

69
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:56,813
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cool song, though, but they had it in the trailer, and just racing to that song is pretty awesome.

70
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:01,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

71
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:15,256
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have two chat rooms now because we have the Justin TV chat, too, but I'm a little worse at being able to stay on top of that one, so we'll try to read both chats, but I'm looking at our main chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and some predictions from Son of Dad for the next Burnout game.

72
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:16,336
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Britney, bitch.

73
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll be on the soundtrack.

74
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:19,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

75
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be turned off as well.

76
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

77
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Britney songs are actually kind of fun to drive to.

78
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:29,747
[SPEAKER_01]: They do incite a lot of rage and the ability to crash into other cars.

79
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the online mode's going to be pretty fun.

80
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:38,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess you can just turn it on where people are just racing around with you and stuff, which would be cool.

81
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the game itself, I mean, just driving around is pretty fun.

82
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:43,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

83
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:44,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

84
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:45,073
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

85
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:47,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice Princess Alien Crush Good Taste Actraiser

86
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,330
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I play?

87
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Actraiser.

88
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Actraiser's so good.

89
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it have, like, the best music ever?

90
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:14,493
[SPEAKER_00]: It does!

91
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Yuzo Koshiro is the man.

92
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we have to get Devil's Crush, too.

93
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, that's up there now, too, huh?

94
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:28,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just remembered that we played a bit of Alien Crush at my house, and then we had to hook up the TurboGrafx and play Devil's Crush, but now that it's there, it's like, oh, yeah.

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, seriously, like, because Alien Crush is addictive, so.

96
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:38,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to 64 on my Orc Hunter, and wow, and whoop-de-doo.

97
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing super exciting, nothing new.

98
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,296
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are wearing a Silent Hill shirt.

99
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you excited for Silent Hill 5?

100
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:46,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

101
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumor is it's going to be out by summer.

102
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:48,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

103
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:49,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's true.

104
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:50,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it is, too.

105
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you check out Silent Hill Origins on PSP at all?

106
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:53,939
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't have a PSP.

107
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I figured maybe you stole someone else's.

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

109
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask William.

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought him one for his birthday.

112
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,281
[SPEAKER_01]: He never plays it.

113
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

114
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:01,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

115
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,562
[SPEAKER_01]: But also take note that Silent Hill Origins is coming out on the PlayStation 2 very soon.

116
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:06,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

117
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:08,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just play it on PS2.

118
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

119
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an idea.

120
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to play the other Silent Hill games.

121
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Nathan you're looking at?

122
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:17,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

123
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Nathan, care to defend yourself?

124
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe tell us a little bit about your gaming week?

125
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never played a Silent Hill in my life.

126
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played Resident Evil?

127
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:31,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say played so much as died a lot.

128
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:33,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

129
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Nathan?

130
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Alien Crush, a lot.

131
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:44,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the point of the game is besides points, but that's all that I care about is more points.

132
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,746
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to keep your ball alive is what you want to do.

133
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep as many balls as possible.

134
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,148
[SPEAKER_01]: In play at the same time?

135
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:51,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

136
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pinball.

137
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the point.

138
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you've been up to this week in the gaming world?

139
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Just today, my level 58...

140
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Torrin Warrior went to Outlands

141
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,330
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right, I don't.

142
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:03,286
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

143
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:40,110
[SPEAKER_05]: and Pirates Pinball and Spider-Man Pinball that just came out.

144
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:45,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you talking about this at one of the pinball shows you went to and I'm just curious if it ever came out but something I heard about

145
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:51,753
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to take a high-def TV and put it on its side and lay it down so it was like a pinball table.

146
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,494
[SPEAKER_05]: They had six of them there.

147
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Their Ultracade pinball is what they are.

148
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're very, very cool.

149
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say, because what I did is I went and played the virtual tables.

150
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:10,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went back to play the actual pins because a lot of them were there.

151
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're pretty close.

152
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:19,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The physics in them are very, very good, but there's just something not right.

153
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:25,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But each of them I think held like six tables, and I think there's a capacity for more.

154
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds interesting.

155
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:43,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very interesting, but you couldn't get like, you'd only be able to do like certain pins, like there's the standard two flipper, you know, start button, whatever, unless you had something equipped that had the other buttons mapped, like for things with double flippers, where you have to have two sets of flippers.

156
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:56,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Two controls for it, or like a special, like the Magna Ball, for example, on... One of those tables that we can't remember.

157
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:57,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it is.

158
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like one that you hit the button and it catches the ball before it drains.

159
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:08,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say, I know it's not on... I want to say that it was on... Whodunit had one.

160
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: But like...

161
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,118
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, things like that.

162
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a little bit more difficult.

163
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,239
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have to find a way to map it.

164
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:18,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the cannon button on Black Rose.

165
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read some other things in chat room right now.

166
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:27,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Not related to pinball, unfortunately, but something about the burnout.

167
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:33,126
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about the custom soundtracks and SSJ100 Matt said, I'm waiting for the next OLR listener to suggest Dragon Force.

168
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,888
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an amazing soundtrack to put as a custom soundtrack to a burnout.

169
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,548
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

170
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, we're about to get into the gaming news for the week.

171
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, a quick housekeeping.

172
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:49,874
[SPEAKER_01]: As many of the folks in our live chat are noticing, we have moved from Operator 11 to a new service called Justin.TV.

173
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So hello to all the Justin.TV people.

174
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:56,859
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing about Justin.TV is that we now are no longer limited to 40 minutes.

175
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

176
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:18,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

177
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So JustinTV, and our username on JustinTV, of course, is Orange Lounge Radio.

178
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:48,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to check out the cam right now, you just go to www.justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.

179
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,923
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's going to do it for housekeeping, so let's get into some gaming news.

180
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll start off tonight with Loki.

181
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:05,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'm sure this is going to come as a big shock to you, but there's a certain game out there that's going to be delayed one month.

182
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:12,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Nintendo finally came out and said that, guess what, Smash Brothers is delayed to March 9th.

183
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that's the first time that you've ever heard of that.

184
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

185
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:20,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky for the people in Japan, though, it is coming out the 31st of this month.

186
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Also lucky for me.

187
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all those people that import their games, they're...

188
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,789
[SPEAKER_01]: They are A-OK.

189
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,750
[SPEAKER_01]: But isn't it going to be very heavy on the Japanese?

190
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be able to navigate through the game?

191
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd be able to navigate through the game just fine.

192
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:36,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fighting game.

193
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

194
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:38,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be that complex.

195
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:40,195
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so many different modes.

196
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:46,518
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been watching what's going on on the dojo, there's so many different modes.

197
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:47,899
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it even easier, though.

198
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's going to even matter as much with that because...

199
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:55,249
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, half the time they put up the text, it's going to be in Hiragana.

200
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, either Hiragana or Katakana.

201
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:01,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's usually a language select anyway for different regions.

202
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:10,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their excuse for it is they said that development is taking slightly longer than expected, which is bullshit since it's coming out in Japan already.

203
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously development's done on it.

204
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's localization.

205
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:18,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either taking a long time or they can't press enough copies fast enough.

206
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of those.

207
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,840
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

208
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:33,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is it possible that maybe, well, I guess that's localization, I was thinking maybe translation and all that stuff, but people shouldn't read into this like, OMG, they went back and added a new character or something like that.

209
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:35,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not adding a new character.

210
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there might be any secret characters that they've been sitting on that they haven't announced yet?

211
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:40,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, yeah.

212
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:44,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the Eggplant Wizard's in it, because I love Kid Icarus.

213
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:47,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, look at, they didn't announce all the new characters.

214
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you laughing at the Eggplant Wizard, Nathan?

215
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of Captain N.

216
00:15:52,682 --> 00:16:03,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, you know, Captain N Captain N should be in it Game & Watch, or Mr. Game & Watch He was a secret character that they never talked about Yes, that's true You never know Mr. Game & Watch is awesome

217
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:15,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if Eggplant Wizard doesn't make it to Super Smash Bros., perhaps it will make it to the rumored, emphasis on rumored, Kid Icarus game that is being worked on by Factor 5 for the Nintendo Wii.

218
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:25,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumors are abounding this week, and GoNintendo is reporting that Factor 5 has been offered up the license from Nintendo to make a Kid Icarus game.

219
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:29,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Kid Icarus, however you want to pronounce it, because that was always a point of contention.

220
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:31,565
[SPEAKER_01]: People never knew exactly how to pronounce the game.

221
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:33,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Icarus?

222
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:38,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, regardless, Factor 5 made some previous games on the GameCube.

223
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:43,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they did Star Fox, right?

224
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:45,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they do the Star Fox game on GameCube?

225
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,083
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have.

226
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:46,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

227
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyhow, that would be very exciting.

228
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:50,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they do Fire Emblem?

229
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:51,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps.

230
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:52,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.

231
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

232
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,514
[SPEAKER_03]: But, well, Factor 5... No, not Fire... No.

233
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,096
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Fire Emblem wasn't Capcom.

234
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:01,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

235
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So Breath of Fire was Capcom.

236
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:11,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so anyhow, regardless, I am very excited at the potential of having a new Kid Icarus game out there.

237
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:14,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope they don't kind of like screw it up.

238
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:17,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I don't want it to be 3D or any of that stuff.

239
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,575
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of know that things are going to be inevitable.

240
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:22,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, chatroom saves the day when we forget things.

241
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:25,478
[SPEAKER_01]: ShadowNextGen says, Factor 5 did the Rogue Squadron games.

242
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,058
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

243
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:30,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

244
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:53,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news, for anybody who keeps up with the results of video game system sales, it has been pretty clear that the Wii and DS are outselling the Xbox 360 as far as units, but Microsoft is like, uh-uh, we made more money, so we win.

245
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:02,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in fact, they've made $4.8 billion compared to $3.5 billion on the Wii and $2.2 billion on PS3.

246
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:07,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you're just looking at money, yeah, PS3 does not have it.

247
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:15,177
[SPEAKER_05]: They also, for the Xbox 360, they've sold 4.62 million units.

248
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,097
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just pretty cool.

249
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 sold 3.97 million, PSP 3.82 million, and the PS3 sold 2.56 million for its first year.

250
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:35,689
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that money stuff has to do with the fact, though, that the Nintendo Wii, they make quite a bit of money off every sales of those, whereas Microsoft and Sony still lose money on every one.

251
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that, yeah, so I think that for...

252
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: If Microsoft is saying that they've made more money with what they lose in production, then overall, yeah, I'd have to say they're definitely having to move a lot more units.

253
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:59,056
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't see where the... But the Wii is clearly selling like crazy if they're having trouble stocking them.

254
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:02,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is only the numbers for 2007, too.

255
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Xbox 360 is still number one in the U.S., although...

256
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,875
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe it gave them a little bit more attention.

258
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they got any more than they would have normally gotten anyways.

259
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit, because I know that distribution didn't get as many Wii systems in January because of this whole rain check program, but

260
00:19:49,353 --> 00:20:02,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many people that affected, but I'm just kind of curious, because I remember throwing that story out there, and it was kind of like, well, what if Wiis are still really hard to come by in January, which it seems like they are.

261
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

262
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,680
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, it's...

263
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:10,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still hard to find, and it probably will be for a while.

264
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:11,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Chat room to the rescue yet again.

265
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Jvmon is in there.

266
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Chat on orangelaunchradio.com and says, Rob, I work at GameStop.

267
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:19,709
[SPEAKER_01]: We filled all the pre-orders already and already got extras to sell to people.

268
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:20,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

269
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,931
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the same amount we did November to December.

270
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,592
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still cranking them out there.

271
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:28,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as far as what the games did themselves, Halo 3 was at the top.

272
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It had 4.82 million, and Wii Play was right behind it.

273
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,189
[SPEAKER_05]: which I think was kind of funny.

274
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 4 followed that.

275
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 3 on PS2 was behind that.

276
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:46,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only reason Wii Play did so well is because it was like controller plus cheap games and that made it stand out.

277
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like Wii Sports and people love Wii Sports and for a while there it was hard to find remotes and that was the only way you could find it.

278
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So, win, win, win.

279
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Sneaky.

280
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:01,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually were at Fry's last week when I was having my computer drama

281
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:09,249
[SPEAKER_05]: and there was a lady there trying to decide whether or not to buy Trauma Center or buy Wii Play and she's like, wait, this has a controller with it and put it down Trauma Center.

282
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:10,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

283
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,331
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

284
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,692
[SPEAKER_01]: But Trauma Center is so awesome.

285
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:14,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

286
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the lowest common denominator.

287
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:18,415
[SPEAKER_03]: This is stupid.

288
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:18,895
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.

289
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:19,856
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is right there.

290
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:21,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's secret to success.

291
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:23,037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the lowest common denominator.

292
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:23,958
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.

293
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo deer hunting.

294
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,439
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

295
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll win.

296
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.

297
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:33,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo came out and announced a few dates of titles coming out.

298
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:36,017
[SPEAKER_03]: This is first and third party stuff.

299
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:44,582
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first half of 2008, some of which we probably already knew about, some I guess were surprising, I don't know.

300
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:49,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, one game that was rumored to be coming out soon was Okami on the Wii.

301
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been dated for the 25th.

302
00:21:53,028 --> 00:22:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Fit scheduled for quarter two, which that would coincide with the supposed rumor from 1UP that Wii Fit is supposed to come out May 2nd, or not 2nd, the 20th.

303
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:12,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, they're going to have some sequels coming out for that in quarter two as well.

304
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:16,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Crossword DS, Nintendo Crosswords, coming out May 5th.

305
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:26,939
[SPEAKER_03]: and Professor Layton and the Curious Village, the current number one selling DS title in Japan right now, coming out in the United States on February 10th.

306
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, some other fun stuff for the Wii.

307
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,822
[SPEAKER_03]: February 26th, The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors, the Dragon Quest Swords game.

308
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:42,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore.

309
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out the early part of February as well.

310
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:49,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see here.

311
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:53,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Apuna is scheduled to be coming out from Koei.

312
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:56,876
[SPEAKER_03]: That's supposed to be a pretty good role-playing game.

313
00:22:59,116 --> 00:22:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds dirty.

314
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:00,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

315
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:05,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm laughing over here like a three-year-old, but... Apunani.

316
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,477
[SPEAKER_01]: She can't contain herself either.

317
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically... It's hilarious.

318
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:15,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangely enough, though, in here, they have Nitro Bike from Ubisoft listed as March...

319
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they didn't realize it's already come out.

320
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get the memo on that.

321
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:31,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, April, we cannot forget Wild Earth African Safari from Majesco, the ripoff of Africa.

322
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cooking Mama Cook-Off 2 in June.

323
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know the first one controlled so well.

324
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,802
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cooking Mama on Wii was horrific.

325
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:42,483
[SPEAKER_01]: But the DS one's still cool.

326
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I say.

327
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:48,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Another cool game that's on the Nintendo DS is Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

328
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,884
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was pretty awesome on the Nintendo DS.

329
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:58,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And some screenshots, some rumored screenshots have leaked from a new Castlevania game, although we kind of emphasize this is only a rumor at this time.

330
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,588
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it would really not be a surprise.

331
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:04,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a no-brainer that Konami would probably make a follow-up game to this game.

332
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Portrait of Ruin

333
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:27,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unknown at this time.

334
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:34,345
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently there's some type of Wii menu item that's being seen in the screenshots on the screen.

335
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:40,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that imply that there's going to be a Wii Castlevania game coming out soon as well then?

336
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think.

337
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:43,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

338
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:43,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

339
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:47,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Castlevania is a good franchise.

340
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why.

341
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,661
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

342
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,069
[SPEAKER_01]: But isn't that, I mean, that would be cheesy, though.

343
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,350
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to have, like, you can actually whip.

344
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,292
[SPEAKER_04]: No one says that you... It's not cheesy at all.

345
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.

346
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:20,174
[SPEAKER_03]: No one says you can't have just a traditional game on the Wii system.

347
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:20,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

348
00:25:20,495 --> 00:25:28,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people just, for some reason, get it stuck in their heads that they've got to make some, you know, motion control crap and stuff to go along with it.

349
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to.

350
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at, uh, what is it, you know, Super Paper Mario.

351
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:38,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that didn't have too... I mean, it had some stuff, but it was pretty much a traditional game.

352
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Macman says in chatroom, Castlevania whip carnival games.

353
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:44,287
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

354
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:46,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't applaud that.

355
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:54,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Simon Belmont or whatever one of the Belmont crew has to tame lions or something like that.

356
00:25:56,717 --> 00:26:05,843
[SPEAKER_01]: GS68 in our chatroom speculates it's probably going to be Castlevania W of I because it has to say we.

357
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:08,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's suggesting Castlevania Wind of Illness.

358
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound Castlevania-esque to you?

359
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very Castlevania-y.

360
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:13,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Very Castlevania-esque.

361
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:18,792
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it have to be like a music, like Symphony, Rondo, Wind of Incontinence?

362
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones with the... Well... Sorry, JVS.

363
00:26:29,317 --> 00:26:38,902
[SPEAKER_05]: That really only applied to... Well, only applied to Dracula X. Because to be technical, Symphony of the Night slash Nocturne in the Moonlight

364
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:43,409
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the other ones after that were just Castlevania

365
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:02,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're talking!

366
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:03,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd buy that.

367
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'd buy?

368
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:06,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we're going to get into this a little bit later.

369
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:09,479
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably something Itagaki would be into as well, right?

370
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,079
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, yeah.

371
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,680
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd have to whip the cowboy hat off his head.

372
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:22,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

373
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:23,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

374
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:26,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew, this is a crappy game.

375
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:27,162
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

376
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:28,183
[SPEAKER_03]: From Namco.

377
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's listed as a game coming out in the summer.

378
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Active Life, Outdoor Challenge.

379
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I don't want to be active.

380
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:35,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to buy that game.

381
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:36,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I like being active.

382
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:37,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you need it.

383
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:41,271
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have different types of interactive games like that.

384
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:50,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, for our friends in the UK, there are a couple of things out for Virtual Console, and I'm very sorry for you all.

385
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:54,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, one of them was okay, but there's better.

386
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 1080 snowboarding from the Nintendo 64.

387
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:00,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's out.

388
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:00,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

389
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Riot Zone for TurboDuo.

390
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:09,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really sorry because it's not very good.

391
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry.

392
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, if you're feeling adventurous, you could just say, you know what, forget Jamie's opinion.

393
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:17,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to download it anyway.

394
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,843
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to download it and throw up, be my guest.

395
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:21,364
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

396
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:23,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, enjoy or don't.

397
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:29,106
[SPEAKER_03]: There is one game that's coming out on the WiiWare service at some point here

398
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually being scheduled for the second quarter of 2008.

399
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:39,938
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called Platinum, and it's kind of a mix between a shooter and a puzzle game.

400
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:44,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what I thought was interesting is they were talking about some of the stuff that it will support.

401
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:52,287
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, they have a price point on it, which is going to be 1,500 Wii points, so you can kind of expect a lot of these games to be around the $10, $20 range.

402
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:53,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Or $15 in that case.

403
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:55,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why that's a range, Robb.

404
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:03,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, it falls right in the middle of that range.

405
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I understand.

406
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:05,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Basic math.

407
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:05,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

408
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:06,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.

409
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:08,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You say 10 and 20, yet this game's going to be 15.

410
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:15,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just clarifying for our listeners who may not be following because they fell asleep during your report because they can't understand simple math.

411
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you insulting our listeners like that?

412
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,482
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would never.

413
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it's Nintendo strategy.

414
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowest common denominator, right?

415
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

416
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:29,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some interesting stuff though in it.

417
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play it with the Wii Zapper, although I don't know why.

418
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:38,947
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play it offline with up to 12 people at the same time.

419
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:48,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that would be one person uses a nunchuck, one person uses a remote, and then also the four, that's four controllers, and then four GameCube controllers.

420
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:49,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's craziness.

421
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even fit that many people in my living room.

422
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:59,222
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that once, remember WarioWare?

423
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:00,023
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 people.

424
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, but that was crazy.

425
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a workout because you had to run around.

426
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,307
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't enough room in that room for people.

427
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It supports DK Bongos.

428
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: We have finally another game that can utilize the DK Bongos.

429
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:24,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they're also planning a version Can you use the Guitar Hero 3 controller too?

430
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:26,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, why not?

431
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:28,885
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can use everything.

432
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Armat?

433
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:31,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

434
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:36,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm sure you probably could, since, you know, it's... That could be like the ultimate showdown.

435
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Twelve people.

436
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:39,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Twelve peripherals.

437
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,014
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ultimate WiiWare showdown.

438
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:49,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, I think that it's actually pretty funny, because for me, who likes to find however many different controllers will work on a different game...

439
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,456
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend was the one who invented Rod Caliber.

440
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:53,336
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, though.

441
00:30:53,877 --> 00:31:00,482
[SPEAKER_03]: This will have a ton of different multiplayer options and peripheral options, but what if the game sucks?

442
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:06,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, great, I can use all these controllers, but do we really want to play this game?

443
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:10,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you sure it's a 12-player game, or is it somewhere in the range of 10 to 14 players?

444
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's 12 players.

445
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, for support for 12 people.

446
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:15,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not say a range of...

447
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:18,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Developers Conference

448
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,811
[SPEAKER_01]: That would actually be a really smart place.

449
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:43,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It would make lots of sense.

450
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, now that I remember seeing this before, this was the first game that was announced for WiiWare at one time.

451
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:49,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it doesn't look that bad.

452
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird looking, though.

453
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know, how would you describe that?

454
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:56,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Abstract.

455
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:57,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Abstract.

456
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,315
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great radio.

457
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:02,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, describe this screenshot for our listeners.

458
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:03,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

459
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:04,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in space.

460
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,657
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got bejeweled stuff and a sun.

461
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: From over here, it looked like pizza.

462
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:10,902
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just hungry.

463
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:11,502
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to eat it.

464
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:12,262
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's it.

465
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:12,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.

466
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:16,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good idea, though.

467
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:22,405
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do the whole 12 people, 12 peripherals, one game, and have a showdown, and then laugh at how stupid we are.

468
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:23,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Power Glove wins.

469
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:25,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you?

470
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:28,747
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anyhow.

471
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:32,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's move on to another story.

472
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:34,336
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

473
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

474
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:17,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they've taken Mario and combined it with, what the hell else?

475
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:23,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got this game Fusion, and they've got, I guess, Kingdom Hearts all worked into one.

476
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a game called Super Mario Bros.

477
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:32,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion, but it combines Mega Man, Halo, they've got Ghosts and Goblins, Sonic the Hedgehog,

478
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a bunch of stuff.

479
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:44,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all made in this one GameMaker 7 program or whatever.

480
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But it plays like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros.

481
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:48,468
3.

482
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:51,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's like a Halo stage and we had a Mega Man stage.

483
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,551
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is there here?

484
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:53,811
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more Mega Man.

485
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they have the whole entire Bubble Man stage.

486
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:57,754
[SPEAKER_01]: That is craziness.

487
00:33:58,735 --> 00:33:59,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was really bored.

488
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's all we see is the Bubble Man stage now.

489
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:04,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can actually play the demo for it.

490
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:04,239
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

491
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,214
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw the bubbles.

492
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:12,656
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.

493
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:14,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

494
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,337
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very creative.

495
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:18,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got a lot of free time on their hands.

496
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually cooler than Asshole Mario.

497
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:22,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite a compliment.

498
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because Asshole Mario is really cool.

499
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny.

500
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really cool.

501
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:33,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Macman asks the question, Mario plus Kingdom Hearts plus Mega Man plus Halo plus Sonic equals Will It Blend?

502
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirates of the Burning Sea on the 22nd

503
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Advance Wars Dark Conflict and Burnout Paradise Cruisin' for Wii Donkey Kong Jet Race, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Imagination Invades on DS FDC World Darts Championship 2008 Fantasy Star Universe Ambition of Illuminus Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 Universe at War Earth Assault for PC

504
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: That it?

505
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:32,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

506
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:34,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't seem like that busy of a week over there.

507
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:35,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

508
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:37,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess it is January.

509
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:41,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess all the people who are addicted to PSU will be happy.

510
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:47,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not a very busy week over in Japan either, but I'm going out of turn.

511
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:48,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually supposed to be the U.S.

512
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:48,786
[SPEAKER_01]: states next.

513
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:49,146
[SPEAKER_01]: My bad.

514
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:50,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.

515
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:51,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I can wait.

516
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:56,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, in the U.S., we have a pretty good week of stuff coming out.

517
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,829
[SPEAKER_03]: My personal favorite, No More Heroes, is coming out for the Wii.

518
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth picking up.

519
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a Wii, maybe you'll like this for the DS.

520
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:07,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Advance Wars Days of Ruin looks pretty awesome.

521
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirates of the Burning Sea for the PC.

522
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:15,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnout Paradise coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

523
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,853
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for more of a casual game, Endless Ocean on the Wii.

524
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games on the DS.

525
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:28,517
[SPEAKER_03]: One Piece Unlimited Adventure on the Wii.

526
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:32,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Iridium Runners on PlayStation 2.

527
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a piece of crap.

528
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rainbow Islands Evolution on the PSP.

529
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:39,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

530
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:42,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully you'll be able to get past... Hooray!

531
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:50,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And exclusive to GameStop, I think it's hooray, Kawasaki Jetski, which is actually supposed to be like Wave Race.

532
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:51,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Wave Race is cool.

533
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:55,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But probably not going to be because it's put out by Destineer and every game that they make sucks.

534
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:56,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

535
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross our fingers, maybe someday their games won't suck.

536
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to say this about Rainbow Islands on the PSP.

537
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:08,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love Rainbow Islands, the original Rainbow Islands game, and that is where my love for the series ends.

538
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Because none of the games after that were really worth getting excited about.

539
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll go over to Japanese... What about Parasol Stars?

540
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,811
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different.

541
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:21,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could say all those games are in the Bubble Bobble universe, I suppose, but... Parasol Stars was great.

542
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Parasol Stars was pretty cool.

543
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, going over to Japanese release dates, not a lot on the Xbox 360, but you do have on the PlayStation 3 this week, Juice 2, which I think was delayed from last week, because it came out on all the other systems last week.

544
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:43,607
[SPEAKER_01]: There really isn't a lot to speak of otherwise on the next-gen systems, but on the current-gen systems, such as PlayStation 2, or I don't know, is it high time for us to start calling it last-gen now?

545
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:47,471
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 2 is really last-gen, and current-gen is, I guess, last-gen, who knows?

546
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:50,685
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we just call it PS2?

547
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,842
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another Mahjong game coming out on the DS as well.

548
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:23,624
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sims 2 Cast Away also comes out on the Nintendo DS.

549
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:27,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And The Prince of Tennis, Driving Smash Side King.

550
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:28,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting anime.

551
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:29,167
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

552
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:32,329
[SPEAKER_01]: You too can be the Prince of Tennis in the privacy of your own home.

553
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather be the Prince of the Cosmos.

554
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:43,314
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Sony PSP, not a whole lot of stuff, but you do have Winning Eleven, Ubiquitous Evolution 2008 coming out on the PSP.

555
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:46,156
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other games getting price reductions, such as Luminous 2.

556
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:49,625
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

557
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:52,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all happy and good.

558
00:38:53,186 --> 00:39:06,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of things that are happy and good, there was a... Well, I'm sure that people have heard about this by now, but there was a guy named Paxton Galvanek who rescued two victims from an overturned SUV in North Carolina.

559
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:15,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy's supposed to be pretty cool because he, you know, assessed the situation, treated their wounds like with perfect first aid, kept them alive.

560
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,722
[SPEAKER_05]: and his medical background consists of playing America's Army.

561
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:23,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

562
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:46,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's a classroom in there and part of the classroom area is basically all the stuff they go through in BASIC which is including a medic class so that you learn BASIC first aid and when he witnessed the accident he basically went right into that mode and the first person he treated was someone who had lost two fingers and so he

563
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:51,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Used a towel to stop the bleeding and held their hand over their head.

564
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a full first aid certification because I have to as a massage therapist.

565
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the first thing that you do.

566
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:03,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You see who's more injured and if they're bleeding, you hold their hand over their head and have them do that.

567
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also treated somebody for a head wound too.

568
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So that by the time someone arrived, which I think is kind of funny because it said it was a soldier that showed up to help them out, everybody was fine.

569
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:26,799
[SPEAKER_05]: and he actually, uh... I think it's pretty cool, though, if they're putting in, like, actual real first aid techniques in that game, then that's pretty cool.

570
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,820
[SPEAKER_01]: By chance, did he play Trauma Center as well?

571
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

572
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can learn a little bit from playing Trauma Center.

573
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we're not to cut people?

574
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:38,042
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stitch up somebody by, you know, waving furiously.

575
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:41,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also stop time, slow down time if you use your psychic powers.

576
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:44,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Star, you can totally, like, heal them completely.

577
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:45,104
Wow.

578
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so maybe America's Army is a little more practical.

579
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:58,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, that was the whole point of that game, though, is to show, you know, what it's supposed to be like to go through, you know, basic and be out, you know, on the field and everything.

580
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:03,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually think that's kind of cool that someone could just...

581
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

582
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be the medic!

583
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:55,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, they do.

584
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more of the be all you can be and going into the army can strengthen yourself.

585
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:01,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

586
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:14,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like when people are playing an MMO and they pick their class, it's like the same people who would pick a priest because they like to assist and heal people.

587
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my theory.

588
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:22,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course our chat room is breaking out into a chorus of heal please, heal please.

589
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:24,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever played America's Army?

590
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a rigorous training process just to start the game.

591
00:42:47,624 --> 00:42:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: They make you take tests before you get your gun, and then it jams.

592
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:53,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like fun.

593
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a lot of fun.

594
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:59,972
[SPEAKER_01]: LF-10000M, Iraq Instance, tank and healer needed, please send tell.

595
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:07,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if people are, you know, buying the game for the purpose of what it is, as a simulation, then it needs to be that in-depth.

596
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, really the game is just a marketing tool for the army anyway.

597
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but... And now this kid is going to be the poster child of that game.

598
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, see what America's Army can do?

599
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Now imagine what would happen if you joined the real military.

600
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just reading the thing over and saying, you know, when he was talking about what he did, and I was like, that is proper first aid.

601
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:31,502
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're supposed to do, so pay attention.

602
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to you.

603
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:35,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

604
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:40,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess you really can't stitch up somebody by going like this and flailing your arm about.

605
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I refuse to believe it, Rob.

606
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:43,825
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move on.

607
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:45,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

608
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:48,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Something along the same lines as America's Army.

609
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:50,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not.

610
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:56,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently the porn industry has dropped their backing for HD DVD.

611
00:43:57,283 --> 00:44:00,626
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

612
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:05,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And dozens of Xbox 360 owners cry out in pain all at once.

613
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:10,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put my HD DVD player on Craigslist tomorrow.

614
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if it's everybody, but one studio in particular, Digital Playground, has decided to abandon HDTV and stick solely with Blu-ray.

615
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them, I guess.

616
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,272
[SPEAKER_03]: But not every studio.

617
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:27,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every studio, as a lot of people are reporting.

618
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:29,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Digital Playground.

619
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:32,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't... Never mind, I'm not going to say it.

620
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't know.

621
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I... Let's...

622
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Irene and I are giggling like three-year-olds over here.

623
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:47,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Irene's all, you're just hoping it's not Falcon or Colt, huh?

624
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:51,358
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, it's one studio.

625
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:52,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many porn studios are out there?

626
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, there's a ton of them.

627
00:44:54,781 --> 00:45:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see what Digital Playground has to offer us, you know, because... Okay, I mean, seriously, let's see here...

628
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:11,269
[SPEAKER_03]: They're top-selling titles that you may be missing if you have an HD DVD and you want it in HD.

629
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:31,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack's Teen America 19, Mrs. Bee Haven, Jesse's Juice, Janikova and Blue, Forbidden Tales, Jack's Big Tits Show 4, Hush, and Jesse Jane's Scream.

630
00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Although...

631
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:37,658
[SPEAKER_03]: To their credit though, they did produce the Pirates film, and Pirates was hilarious.

632
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilariously bad.

633
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilariously bad.

634
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:48,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Macman suggested the PlayStation 3's newest games, Drake's Penis, Ratchet and Dick, and Heavenly Sword.

635
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:59,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing though, they may have stopped making HD DVDs, but they still sell them.

636
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:01,678
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have quite a bit of stuff on there.

637
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:06,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides, anyone that actually watches a lot of porn anyways, they don't buy their porn.

638
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, this is the internet revolution, you know.

639
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:12,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Who actually buys porn nowadays?

640
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find plenty of it in DivX out there.

641
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, your PlayStation 3 also plays DivX, and hopefully Xbox 360 will at some point soon.

642
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:21,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you can stream stuff.

643
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Xbox 360 is already playing DivX now after their last patch.

644
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:27,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so...

645
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

646
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:52,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

647
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,610
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

648
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So SingStar does not appear to be doing quite as well as people originally thought.

649
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:35,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they can under-deliver like normal.

650
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:38,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, however, to be fair, Sony did make a response a little later in the week.

651
00:47:38,863 --> 00:47:43,164
[SPEAKER_01]: SingStar Studios said that downloadable songs for SingStore are on the way.

652
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:45,985
[SPEAKER_01]: The original vision was supposed to be 350, but they missed the mark.

653
00:47:48,086 --> 00:47:53,147
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are going to put out 18 new tracks on January 18th, which should have already passed.

654
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:55,828
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 English songs and 3 Spanish ones.

655
00:47:56,328 --> 00:47:59,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Including David Bowie and Blur.

656
00:47:59,369 --> 00:47:59,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.

657
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:04,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And February 4th is supposed to see the launch of even more songs.

658
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

659
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They only missed the mark by 200 songs.

660
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:13,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and 15 of those are in English.

661
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:16,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're supposed to be updating it now twice a week.

662
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, not twice a week, twice a month.

663
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:19,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

664
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,033
[SPEAKER_03]: No one needs to be playing SingStar anyways.

665
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.

666
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:24,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed it.

667
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:28,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Karaoke is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of entertainment, okay?

668
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:29,295
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you really feel?

669
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:34,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus they have the ability to upload videos of yourself singing.

670
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:35,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would do that?

671
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:36,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lame.

672
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:39,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to tell you.

673
00:48:41,781 --> 00:48:45,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we do have a situation.

674
00:48:46,762 --> 00:48:47,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-oh.

675
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:50,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to call out the troops?

676
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:51,623
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

677
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:53,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to get a medic?

678
00:48:53,624 --> 00:48:53,884
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

679
00:48:56,165 --> 00:49:00,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry for all of our European listeners who are excited about Uncharted.

680
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:01,906
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in 1080i.

681
00:49:03,466 --> 00:49:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

682
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:10,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only added to the US version later in development, and the PAL version is not going to have it.

683
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:12,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God, I thought there was a real problem.

684
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:17,712
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that it would delay the game's release because they have to test it for QA.

685
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:19,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry!

686
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, game developers are QA-ing their games again?

687
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:22,855
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good news.

688
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:24,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be 480p.

689
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:31,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really have been out of shape about that, remember, PlayStation 3 games are region-free.

690
00:49:32,399 --> 00:49:37,762
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you really need your 1080i, to be honest, you're not going to tell the difference between... If you've got an HDTV...

691
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:41,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.

692
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:42,893
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it shouldn't.

693
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So get it!

694
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Import it!

695
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:47,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's your workaround.

696
00:49:48,554 --> 00:49:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

697
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Workaround!

698
00:49:51,154 --> 00:50:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of workaround, they finally released the custom firmware from DarkAlex, the guy behind all those wonderful PSP custom firmwares, or at least all the popular ones.

699
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: He has just released 3.80 M33

700
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:15,965
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will give you all the wonderful features of 3.8 including the streaming internet radio and all that fun stuff.

701
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus a bunch of new features as well.

702
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:37,801
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the cool things I liked about this actually is you can, once you've loaded 3.8 in there, any additional firmware updates that happen to come along from the custom firmware scene, you can actually update them over the internet just like you would your normal PSP firmwares.

703
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:45,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just, you know, download an update and update it right there, just like you would any official firmware.

704
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:48,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I did, and it was pretty cool.

705
00:50:49,140 --> 00:51:02,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's available right now for PSP Slims, and they also have one for the PSP Fat, I guess, that also has some of the stuff for the 1.5 firmware, so you can run your homebrew crap.

706
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But try as they may,

707
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:08,307
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

708
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:30,295
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that perhaps Dark Alex maybe wants to work on soon is solving the Dust problem on the PlayStation 3.

709
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:35,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, no, I'm not trying to make a joke that nobody's playing their PlayStation 3, so they're getting dusty.

710
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:39,479
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, remember, like, Dust killed somebody's PlayStation?

711
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:41,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Sony refused to do anything about it or something like that?

712
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,662
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy ended up getting a refund from the credit card company or something like that.

713
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:50,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust is obviously a huge issue for PlayStations.

714
00:51:50,703 --> 00:51:55,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that PS3 right there looks like someone put it under their sawhorse when they were cutting some wood or something.

715
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is ridiculous.

716
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:58,015
[SPEAKER_05]: They do collect dust, though, really easily.

717
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,197
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dust magnets.

718
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:00,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.

719
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:22,283
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

720
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:27,627
[SPEAKER_01]: So insert your dust cap joke here, but there is officially a dust cap coming for the PlayStation 3.

721
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:28,908
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually pretty cool.

722
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:30,970
[SPEAKER_05]: That company makes really good stuff.

723
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a couple of controllers that they put out.

724
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:37,875
[SPEAKER_05]: The GameCube ones back in the day.

725
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a mod that makes my PS3 smoke a cigarette.

726
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make it even cooler.

727
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:48,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could just not smoke next to your PlayStation 3 or put it in a well-fitting...

728
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a hit off this PS3, you'll love it.

729
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:56,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly your PlayStation 3 is glowing.

730
00:52:56,775 --> 00:52:57,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Wanna get high?

731
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:00,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the website though.

732
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:02,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you look at the ad for it?

733
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:03,679
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

734
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually pretty cool.

735
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:10,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at how all of this fits in, I think it's a very good idea.

736
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:13,346
[SPEAKER_01]: How it all pieces together?

737
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:18,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they said that it's charged with static to attract the dust.

738
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: You know like those static wipes?

739
00:53:21,377 --> 00:53:21,857
[SPEAKER_05]: for dusting.

740
00:53:22,517 --> 00:53:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same theory on there.

741
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,618
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually pretty cool.

742
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:25,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

743
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:28,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll link the ad in the chat room.

744
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:29,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

745
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the ad is available at Hori.jp.

746
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:35,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Just browse to their products for the Dusk Guard Kit 3.

747
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:39,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, um, I think that GameStop still carries a lot of Hori products.

748
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:42,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So, shouldn't have any problem.

749
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:42,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

750
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:43,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Dusk Cap 3.

751
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always hoping it would come to the US.

752
00:53:48,265 --> 00:53:49,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's move on with some more news.

753
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:51,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news.

754
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:54,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we said we weren't going to talk about this guy again.

755
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But he, who shall not be named, keeps reappearing.

756
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:02,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he opened the Chamber of Secrets this time?

757
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying.

758
00:54:03,757 --> 00:54:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to open up a can of drama is what he's doing.

759
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

760
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:10,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really.

761
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um...

762
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:16,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Thompson, The Butthead, Lord Voldemort

763
00:54:39,597 --> 00:55:08,679
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's quoted saying I was never interviewed about Buzz I never heard about it until I was quoted having allegedly said this about it and what he was quoted as saying is that video games have hurt far more people than they have helped and he said that what he would say well I'm just going to read his quote because he speaks in circles I would never say what I am quoted as saying in any context as the quotation regardless of what it is applied to is absurd on its face

764
00:55:09,326 --> 00:55:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: How in the world could anyone prove and or quantify that games have hurt more people than they have helped?

765
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds to me like he's lying.

766
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:24,115
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every time this guy opens his mouth, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

767
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:24,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get a little angsty?

768
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:25,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

769
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:26,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

770
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:27,017
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

771
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:34,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, I was just going to mention that Take-Two actually proactively sued him, so that's also going on right now, too.

772
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:40,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Loki cut me off, and that makes me even more angsty, so you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week!

773
00:55:54,225 --> 00:56:03,091
[SPEAKER_05]: An FU to my washing machine for not wanting to wash my hoodie by itself and imbalancing.

774
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I really wanted to wear my Jack hoodie tonight.

775
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: My Nightmare Before Christmas one.

776
00:56:10,127 --> 00:56:11,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't because it's still wet.

777
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:14,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really not very instant.

778
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

779
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:16,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

780
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to my cat for throwing up a hairball on my massage diploma.

781
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:25,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I have to go get a reprint of it.

782
00:56:26,377 --> 00:56:27,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And my transcripts.

783
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:28,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have to get reprints of those.

784
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:28,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you...

785
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:36,220
[SPEAKER_05]: to my folder from when I first started school because it has all my massage school receipts in it so that I can have myself one big fat tax write-off.

786
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:39,443
[SPEAKER_01]: All done.

787
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:40,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And?

788
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:42,825
[SPEAKER_05]: An FU to the company I work for for not claiming my W-2 yet.

789
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:44,667
[SPEAKER_01]: For real?

790
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:45,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I want money!

791
00:56:45,788 --> 00:56:46,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

792
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:48,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, your FUs.

793
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, FU to the theater that I went and saw Cloverfield in.

794
00:56:54,144 --> 00:57:03,788
[SPEAKER_03]: because the entire time the front left speaker was making a noise so it was really annoying the entire movie.

795
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:05,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure it wasn't just the monster?

796
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:06,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.

797
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went and complained to management and they're like, you know, a bunch of little kids running around trying to figure out how to fix the speaker.

798
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:15,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The monster didn't go have some fourth meal at Taco Bell?

799
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:16,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.

800
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:19,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it?

801
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:20,354
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

802
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:23,575
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes to the damn flies in here

803
00:57:24,056 --> 00:57:28,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Who have not been served yet with the swatter of justice Are they hiding right now?

804
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:38,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are I haven't seen one in a little while F you to the fact that the flies hide all week long And then they come out on Sunday, I hate that Anyhow, Rice Princess, Nathan, you guys have anything you want to add?

805
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:50,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Flies just like listening to the show, jeez F you to being sick and not being able to hear out of my left ear So I sound like an old woman like, eh?

806
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd you say that again, Shani?

807
00:57:53,652 --> 00:57:54,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it's annoying.

808
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:59,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also second the FU to Cloverfield audiences.

809
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, no, you just said the theater, right?

810
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:02,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The audio.

811
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:06,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I say FU to the audience, because they're stupid and immature.

812
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, like, yelling out what they thought of the movie at the end.

813
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,661
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't go see movies on opening weekend ever.

814
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:15,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of kids.

815
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were a bunch of kids.

816
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I went out and said, you know, my opinion on the movie, because I don't care to do that, but people do, and they're stupid, so...

817
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:25,410
[SPEAKER_04]: F.U.!

818
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: My only F.U.

819
00:58:29,912 --> 00:58:31,453
[SPEAKER_02]: is for Nintendo.

820
00:58:32,414 --> 00:58:43,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys, but you gotta really hurry up and make available on the virtual console Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.

821
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:45,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario RPG

822
00:58:46,866 --> 00:58:50,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people haven't played it and don't know how great it is.

823
00:58:56,752 --> 00:58:58,053
[SPEAKER_02]: My games look better.

824
00:58:58,073 --> 00:59:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

825
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:05,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you to know Guardian Legend either?

826
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:06,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Greatest 8-bit game of all time.

827
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:09,000
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been saying that for a long time on this show.

828
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:12,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do agree, Super Mario RPG would make a fine addition to Virtual Console.

829
00:59:14,044 --> 00:59:15,124
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't keep holding your breath.

830
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:16,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow.

831
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Loki, anyway.

832
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is kind of exciting, and hopefully this comes out in the Wii, because this would be one of those games that could utilize that whipping motion from the Wii Remote.

833
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:38,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But Leisure Suit Larry, box office bust, is coming to consoles and the PC fall of 2008.

834
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:43,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yes, if you don't remember Leisure Suit Larry, well...

835
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,812
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and Mobile Phones Team 17, The Worms Games

836
01:00:14,716 --> 01:00:15,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

837
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

838
01:00:17,398 --> 01:00:22,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And the script, I guess, is being penned by Happy Madison Productions' Alan Covert.

839
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:27,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison or something?

840
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:30,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Happy Madison is Adam Sandler's production group.

841
01:00:30,445 --> 01:00:31,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

842
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:43,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan Covert, he's done such wonderful movies as... I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, Grandma's Boy, Eight Crazy Nights...

843
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:51,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Deeds, Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo, Waterboy, pretty much every other Adam Sandler movie that's been out there.

844
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:52,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Gilmore.

845
01:00:54,796 --> 01:00:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

846
01:00:56,016 --> 01:01:01,718
[SPEAKER_03]: If only that game had Adam Sandler and the whole Happy Madison group doing the voices in there, that might be cool.

847
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:04,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Rob Schneider in that game, that could be cool.

848
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:05,479
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it!

849
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:06,859
[SPEAKER_03]: All night long.

850
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,200
[SPEAKER_03]: They should make a Leisure Suit Larry movie.

851
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Madison.

852
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:12,901
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

853
01:01:13,732 --> 01:01:16,374
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

854
01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:51,297
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the games I actually, one of my favorite games is Burning Rangers, which is also put out by Sonic Team, who can do no wrong.

855
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Sonic Team.

856
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:57,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the game is basically set in the future where...

857
01:01:58,624 --> 01:02:02,887
[SPEAKER_05]: The only few hazards remaining is one of them is fire.

858
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:09,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are futuristic firefighters who use their super sentai powers to extinguish flames and rescue people.

859
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:18,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And after you beat the game once, you actually have a random level generator that you can use to change the game each time you go play it.

860
01:02:19,618 --> 01:02:27,643
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the technical side of it, for people who were Saturn fans, you know that the Saturn was...

861
01:02:29,322 --> 01:02:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: ADX Audio Compression Fantasy Star Online

862
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:57,377
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a central dome fire swirl level where one of the main characters from Burning Rangers asked you to help them put out fires and help people.

863
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:03,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And had the music from the Japanese version of Burning Rangers, which was Angels with Burning Hearts.

864
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of the vocal songs were in Sonic Pinball Party.

865
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:14,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the theme song was in Samba de Amigo, if you remember, as one of the downloadable songs.

866
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:15,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Samba de Amigo

867
01:03:46,307 --> 01:03:47,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Burning Rangers is cool.

868
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:51,149
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it, your classic game of the week, Burning Rangers.

869
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:53,670
[SPEAKER_01]: A game I never played, but maybe I ought to.

870
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will bring that to the Saturn over one day.

871
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:57,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should.

872
01:03:58,392 --> 01:04:03,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's funny that it goes for bucks on eBay, and I got mine at a convention swap meet for 30 bucks.

873
01:04:04,034 --> 01:04:04,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

874
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:06,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you find little gems there.

875
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:07,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

876
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:12,519
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of our show.

877
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:25,993
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, Orange Lounge Radio is divvied up into two parts every week, so we will be right back after just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

878
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:30,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
