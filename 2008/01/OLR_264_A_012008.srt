1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Alright, anything else you want to add to your gaming week, DarkSakura?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,300
Nope.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,620
Then let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,700
My gaming week was fine.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,040
I played a little bit of

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,280
Nitro Bike this week because I was anticipating it was going to be awesome and

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,680
all that stuff for the week because, you know, they're kind of comparing it to Excite Truck.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,960
It is not even close to Excite Truck and it's also not even close to being good, so

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,680
unfortunately it sucked.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,000
And what ways did it suck?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,220
It sucked because the tracks weren't really open enough like Excite Truck.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,280
The game itself

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,400
wasn't very fun because you can do tricks

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,600
in the air and stuff, but

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,760
I mean really there's no need to be doing any sort of variety of tricks because you can do

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,360
the same trick over and over and get the same kind of bonus for it, which is more Nitro.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,000
But the fact is the

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,860
tracks aren't really straight enough anyways to where you would need the Nitro, so

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,240
it was kind of dumb.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,080
They tried and they failed. The other thing though that I do not like about a lot of these

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,700
racing games

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,720
is that unlike Excite Truck, which you hold the Wii Remote kind of, you know,

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,180
parallel to the ground,

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,080
a lot of these games will have it where you're holding it on its side so that, you know, you can

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,420
use those really crappy plastic

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,440
steering wheel controllers.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,560
And I really hate having to hold it like that because it makes it really uncomfortable

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,960
for your hands because you have to twist your whole wrist back and stuff.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,280
Excite Truck is just awesome, what can I say.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,760
Then on purpose I played Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, which is

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,040
a game that got reviewed on

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
IGN giving it a 1.5.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah, it's deserving of that. It was just really bad.

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,600
Basically your vehicles in the game kind of control like crap,

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,800
very sluggish, and I had trouble staying on the track because of that.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,960
But it was fun to get to play it, I guess.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,720
Then, not so crappy games, I got to play

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Burnout Paradise, which I'm very surprised,

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,780
the game

40
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,020
I didn't think was going to be that good

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,960
when I played the demo. It didn't seem like something I would like,

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,400
but playing the full version of the game, I was completely wrong.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Absolutely the best Burnout game in the series so far.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,160
Personally for me, number three was my favorite. This is very much like

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,600
number three. The takedowns are a little bit easier like three was.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Very fast, I like the ability to drive anywhere in the entire game. Plus,

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,860
the best part of the entire game is the Showtime mode, which basically,

48
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,280
for all those people complaining that there's no crash mode anymore, well you can

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,640
activate crash mode anytime you want. Just absolutely, you're driving down the street,

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
oh look, there's a bunch of cars, hit the buttons,

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,200
and you just roll, and you keep rolling, smashing through cars,

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,880
and you can travel like thousands and thousands and thousands of feet

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,720
down the street and just smashing into the stuff.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,320
It's absolutely fun.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,680
Now, is it just, the game's a little more like test drive, right? Where you're

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,420
kinda driving in this free world and then you can pull up to something to

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,240
start a race?

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,440
Sort of, not really. Can you pick up chicks too?

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,520
No. Like you couldn't test drive at all? No, but

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,160
the game, the only thing that's kind of weird though is you have to crash some of the,

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,480
or you have to take down certain cars if you want to unlock them, so you basically

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,920
unlock them, they'll drive around the city, and you have to find them.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,320
And a lot of times it's hard to find those cars, and in fact,

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,600
usually I notice, you know, a car will zoom past me and start driving crazy, and I'm like,

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
okay, that's one of the cars,

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,880
and so I'll chase after it and stuff, but it's just pretty awesome, and the races are

67
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,600
pretty cool.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Also the music in the game, they have a great soundtrack in it.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Although the only flaw, they put Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in there, so I

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
guess there's gotta be something

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,520
for everybody, but it was a little weird driving and all of a sudden your girlfriend

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
comes on, it just felt

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,880
strange. But I highly recommend the game.

74
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm going to be playing this for a long time. Very cool.

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm actually looking forward to picking up this game too, I like the Burnout games. I'm not huge on a

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,600
lot of racing games, but I like

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,720
Burnout quite a bit. I want to try the online, but the servers, I guess, are not up right now.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,160
Well, seeing as the game isn't totally out yet, that might make sense, why?

79
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah. Oh, and then Product Placement, there's a ton of it.

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
There's vans driving around with like Axe and

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
Gillette and all sorts of weird shit on them. Like manly ads.

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah, but you can crash into them, which is great.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
It's like, oh, Product Placement, destroy!

84
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,760
It would be funnier if you got more points if you destroyed a Tampax

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,440
billboard or something, you know what I mean?

86
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,760
It's awesome though. Seriously, you drive

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,840
really fast through the game, they'll have like Stunt Mode and stuff. It's cool.

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,640
I just like, it's like, hee hee hee, you know, just crashing and stuff. I don't know, it's

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,040
hee hee fire. Exactly.

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Did you try doing like your own custom soundtracks? Because you said you don't like Avril Lavigne or

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
whatever that's in there, but

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,440
like when I played the last Burnout game on 360, I just used custom soundtracks all the time.

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,760
I would basically use the music from Whangam Midnight Maximum Tune

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,960
to Burnout, and it was awesome. No, actually, I just, they have the EA tracks or whatever,

95
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,200
you can go in there and shut off which songs you don't like. So if you don't like Avril Lavigne,

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,760
you can just turn the track off and you'll never hear it again. That's a good function.

97
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,840
But, you know, actually what I did is I kept, and I may,

98
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,880
if I have to find it for my cage match, but I may pick this song. There's a song in there,

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
a remix by Jason Nevins that I've been having on repeat because

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
it was the song that they had in the trailer for and

101
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,160
it was, what was it, I want to say it was Taxi or something like that.

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,720
That really crappy movie with Queen Latifah and

103
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,120
Oh God, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, but it was a cool song though,

104
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,920
but they had it in the trailer and just racing to that song is pretty awesome.

105
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. We actually have

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,280
two chat rooms now because we have the Justin TV chat too,

107
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,560
but I'm a little worse at being able to stay on top of that one, so we'll try

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
to read both chats, but I'm looking at our

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,440
main chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and some predictions from Son of Dad for the

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,340
next Burnout game.

111
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,400
It's Britney, bitch. Maybe that'll be on the soundtrack.

112
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
Who knows? And that will be turned off as well.

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,440
I don't know, some Britney songs are actually kind of fun to drive to. They do

114
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,880
incite a lot of rage and the ability to crash into other cars.

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,720
I think the online mode is going to be pretty fun because

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,560
you know, I guess you can just turn it on where people are just racing around with

117
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
you and stuff which would be cool

118
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
because the game itself, I mean, just driving around is pretty fun.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,160
So, I don't know, I like it.

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,280
Rice Princess, I know you've said you've been playing a lot of WoW this week while

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,240
you're sick. Is that it or are there other games?

122
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,080
Well, I got my Wii back online finally

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,440
because I had the brilliant idea of taking it over to Nathan's where he has

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,200
like a wireless connection. So we downloaded Alien Crush and

125
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
really he's been playing that more than me. Good taste. Yeah.

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,200
I played more Actraiser. What else did I play? I love Actraiser.

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,920
I know, Actraiser is so good. Doesn't it have like the best music ever? It does.

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,400
Yuzo Koshiro is the man. Oh yeah, we have to get Devil's Crush too.

129
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Well, that's up there now too, huh? Well, I just remembered that we played a bit of

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,160
Alien Crush at my house and then we had to hook up the TurboGrafx and play Devil's

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,760
Crush but now that it's there it's like, oh yeah.

132
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,400
I know, seriously, like, because Alien Crush is addictive.

133
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,520
I got to 64 on my Ork Hunter and wow,

134
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,160
whoop dee doo. Nothing super exciting, nothing new.

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,800
But you are wearing a Silent Hill shirt. Are you excited for Silent Hill 5?

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Yes, I am. Rumor is it's going to be out by summer. Really? I hope that's true.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
I hope it is too. Did you check out Silent Hill Origins on PSP at all?

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
No, I don't have a PSP. I know, but I figured maybe you stole someone else's, I don't know.

139
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,360
Yeah, that's a good idea. Ask William. I bought him one for his birthday, he never plays it.

140
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Really? Yeah, but also, well, also take note that Silent Hill Origins is coming out on

141
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,680
the PlayStation 2 very soon.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Oh my. So you can just play it on PS2.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,360
Hmm, that's an idea. Decision, decision. Someone needs to play

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,520
the other Silent Hill games. Is that

145
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,200
Nathan you're looking at? Maybe. Oh, Nathan, care to defend yourself? Maybe tell us a

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
little bit about your gaming week?

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,600
I have never played a Silent Hill in my life.

148
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,960
Have you played Resident Evil? I wouldn't say played

149
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,600
so much as died a lot. Alright.

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,360
Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Nathan? Alien Crush

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,560
a lot. I don't even know what the point of the game is besides points,

152
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,960
but that's all that I care about is more. You just want to keep your ball alive

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,720
is what you want to do. I try to keep as many balls as possible.

154
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,960
In play at the same time? Sure. Alright. It's pinball.

155
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,360
It's the point. Anything else you've been up to this week in the gaming world?

156
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,880
Just today, my

157
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,800
level 58 Tauren Warrior went to Outlands.

158
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,160
Well, congratulations. Getting to Outlands is a really big deal for WoW nerds,

159
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,120
so congratulations. It's beautiful, really. Did you shed a tear a little bit when you

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,040
walked through the portal?

161
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,840
It's like your character's all grown up now? No, I just said woot.

162
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,560
Woot. Alright, good. Well, anyhow, feel free, you guys, to chime in

163
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
throughout the show as we talk about stories.

164
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,560
You know, your usual schtick, even though you're sick, Irene.

165
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,280
So, I do want to hear your opinion on things.

166
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,640
You're right, I don't. But I do want to hear the chat room opinion.

167
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,680
chat.orangelandradio.com

168
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,120
Let's see. Robert M says, I actually got both

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,440
Alien and Devil Crush, both very good video pinball titles.

170
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
You gotta get Sonic Spinball, too. I like that one for a pinball game. It's not as

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
good, but it's still fun.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
It's fun-ish. Why are you making a scrunchy I don't like you face, Irene?

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Whatever.

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,880
Just not your kind of game? I was trying to get the mic over you, it's not working.

175
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
Sorry. I'm tangling myself up. Alright.

176
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
Um, let's see.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
You know what they need to do? What? We need a

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,800
a new Williams pinball collection or we need a

179
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,200
a Stern pinball collection.

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,080
Because Stern has the, um, I think has the licensing rights to Big Bang Bar.

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,800
Well, it was just like my favorite pinball table.

182
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,760
You want a Big Bang Bar machine. And the Pirates pinball.

183
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,200
And the Spider-Man pinball that just came out. Whatever happened to,

184
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
I remember you talking about this at one of the pinball shows you went to, and I'm just curious if it ever

185
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,400
came out, but like something I heard about

186
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,160
where like they were going to take a high-def TV and put it on its side and lay it down so it was

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,680
like a

188
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,920
like a pinball table, like rectangular. They had six of them there. They're

189
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,600
their ultra-cade pinball is what they are.

190
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,720
And they're very, very cool, but I have to say, because what I did

191
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
is I went and played the virtual tables

192
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,400
and then I went back to play the actual pins, because a lot of them were there.

193
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,440
And they're pretty close.

194
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,920
The physics in them are very, very good.

195
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,360
But there's just something not right. But each of them, I think, held like six tables

196
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,560
and I think there's a capacity for more. Sounds interesting.

197
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,120
It was very interesting, but you couldn't get like, you'd only be able to do like

198
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
certain pins, like there's the standard two flipper,

199
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,960
you know, start button, whatever, unless you had something equipped

200
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,000
that had the other buttons mapped, like for things with double flippers

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,400
where you have to have two sets of flipper, two controls for it,

202
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,720
or like a special,

203
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,400
like the MagnaBall, for example, on...

204
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,400
One of those tables that we can't remember.

205
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,120
I know it is. It's like one that you hit the button and it catches the ball before it drains.

206
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,600
And I want to say, I know it's not on...

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
I want to say that it was on...

208
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,120
Whodunnit had one. But like,

209
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,600
things like that, it would be a little bit more difficult.

210
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,240
They'd have to find a way to map it. Or the cannon button

211
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,840
on Black Rose.

212
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,680
I want to read some other things in chat room right now. Not related to pinball,

213
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
unfortunately, but

214
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
something about the burnout. We were talking about the custom soundtracks and SSJ100 Matt

215
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,240
said,

216
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm waiting for the next OLR listener to suggest Dragon Force.

217
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,240
That would be an amazing soundtrack to put as a custom soundtrack to a burnout. We'll see what

218
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,680
happens.

219
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,120
Anyhow, we're about to get into the gaming news for the week, but first,

220
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,480
a quick housekeeping. As many of the folks in our live chat are noticing, we have moved

221
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,880
from operator 11 to a new service called Justin.tv. So hello to all the

222
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,560
Justin.tv people. The cool thing about Justin.tv is that we now are no

223
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,040
longer limited to 40 minutes

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,280
for a section of the show. We pretty much have unlimited. I am noticing some folks

225
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,580
already having problems. That's probably because the cam is running off the Wi-Fi

226
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,280
right now.

227
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,680
So until I get a splitter out here to run the regular

228
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,440
line through, it may be a little bit choppy, and I think it's causing

229
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,680
buffering or whatever. But

230
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,000
remember, the video isn't the main part of our show. We're trying to do a radio show.

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,800
So

232
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,240
audio is the most important part, and that way it gets out there to the podcast and all that.

233
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,600
But

234
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
the other cool thing about Justin.tv is it does archive everything, so you can kind of

235
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,400
go back and watch corresponding video to a show. So if something particularly

236
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
hilarious happens,

237
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,880
then actually what can happen is that one of our listeners can set it as a

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,600
highlight,

239
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,280
and then people can go back and watch just the highlights. So that's kind of

240
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
interesting. We'll have to see how that works out.

241
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,960
So Justin.tv, and our username on Justin.tv, of course, is OrangeLoungeRadio.

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,960
So if you want to check out the cam right now, you just go to www.Justin.tv

243
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,560
slash OrangeLoungeRadio. Alright,

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,080
that's going to do it for housekeeping, so let's get into some gaming news, and we'll

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
start off tonight with

246
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Loki. Anyways,

247
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm sure this is going to come as a big shock to you, but

248
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,560
there's a certain game out there that's going to be delayed one month.

249
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,280
So yeah, Nintendo finally came out and said that, guess what, Smash Brothers is

250
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,080
delayed to March 9th,

251
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,280
and I'm sure that's the first time that you've ever heard of that,

252
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,200
ever. Lucky for the people in Japan, though, it is coming out the 31st of this

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,640
month.

254
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,880
Also lucky for me. So for all those people that import their games,

255
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,960
they're going to be plenty successful. They are a-okay.

256
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,920
But isn't it going to be very heavy on the Japanese? Is it going to be, are you going to be able to navigate through the game?

257
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,280
I think you'd be able to navigate through the game just fine.

258
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,760
It's a fighting game. That's true. It's not going to be that complex,

259
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,960
but there's so many different modes. Like if you've been watching what's going on

260
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,520
on the

261
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,960
dojo, there's so many different modes. That makes it even easier, though.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,520
I don't think it's going to even matter as much with that, because

263
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,360
first of all, half the time they put up the text, it's going to be in hiragana,

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm sorry, either hiragana or katakana, and then there's usually a language select

265
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,000
anyway for different regions.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,080
Well, their excuse for it is they said that development is taking slightly longer than

267
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,920
expected,

268
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,040
which is bullshit, since it's coming out in Japan

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,080
already. So obviously development's done on it. It's localization.

270
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,480
It's either taking a long time, or they can't press enough copies fast enough, so

271
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,960
one of those.

272
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,040
Well, is it possible that maybe

273
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,360
there's, well, I guess that's localization. I was thinking maybe translation and all that stuff, but

274
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,840
people shouldn't read into this, like, OMG, they went back and added a new

275
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,200
character or something like that. No. They're not adding a new character.

276
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,480
So, do you think there might be any secret characters that they've been sitting on that they

277
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
haven't announced yet? I think so, yeah.

278
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,280
I hope the eggplant wizard's in it, because I love Kid Icarus.

279
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,840
Well, I mean, look at, they didn't announce all the new characters. Why are you

280
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,600
laughing at the eggplant wizard, Nathan? I'm thinking of Captain N.

281
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,840
Well, like, you know, Captain N,

282
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,880
Captain N should be in it! Game & Watch, or Mr. Game & Watch, he was a secret character,

283
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,720
that they never talked about before, so you never know. Mr. Game & Watch is awesome.

284
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,560
Well, if eggplant wizard doesn't make it to Super Smash Brothers, perhaps it will

285
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,040
make it to the rumored, emphasis on rumored,

286
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,520
Kid Icarus game that is being worked on by Factor 5

287
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,360
for the Nintendo Wii. Rumors are abounding this week, and Go Nintendo is

288
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
reporting that Factor 5

289
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,900
has been offered up the license from Nintendo to make

290
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,360
a Kid Icarus game, or Kid Icarus, however you want to pronounce it, because that was

291
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,920
always a point of contention that, you know, people never knew exactly how to

292
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,680
pronounce the game.

293
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,680
But, Icarus? Well, regardless, Factor 5 made some previous games on the

294
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,640
GameCube. I believe they did, um, they did

295
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,360
Star Fox, right? Didn't they do the Star Fox game?

296
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,640
They may have. I think so. So, anyhow,

297
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,960
I'll be very excited. Didn't they do Fire Emblem? Perhaps.

298
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,360
I don't remember. Yeah,

299
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,640
but, well, Factor 5 is not Fire Emblem. No.

300
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,560
No, Fire Emblem wasn't Capcom. Huh.

301
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,800
Are you thinking Breath of Fire? Breath of Fire was Capcom. Yeah.

302
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,440
Alright, so, well, anyhow, regardless, I am very excited at the potential of

303
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,840
having a new Kid Icarus game

304
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,400
out there. I just hope they don't kinda, like, screw it up.

305
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,320
I don't know. I don't want it to be 3D or any of that stuff. You just kinda know that

306
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,840
things

307
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,800
gonna be inevitable. Of course, Chat Room saves the day when we forget things.

308
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Shadow Next Gen says Factor 5 did the Rogue Squadron games. There you go.

309
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,680
Alright, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

310
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, in other news, let's see, wasn't that professional.

311
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,320
Um, for anybody who keeps up with the, um,

312
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,720
results of video game system sales, it has, uh,

313
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,400
been pretty clear that the Wii and DS

314
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,520
are outselling, um, the Xbox 360 as far as units,

315
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,800
but, um, Microsoft is like, uh-uh, we made more money, so we win.

316
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,320
So, um, in fact, they've made, uh, 4.8 billion compared to, uh, 3.5 billion on

317
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,800
the Wii

318
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,400
and, uh, 2.2 billion on PS3. So, if you're just looking at money, um,

319
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,720
yeah, PS3 does not have it. Um,

320
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,480
they also, for the Xbox 360, they've, uh, sold 4.62 million units. That's just

321
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,240
pretty cool.

322
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,600
Um, PS2, um, sold 3.97

323
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,720
million, uh, PSP 3.82 million,

324
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
and the PS3, uh, sold 2.56 million

325
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,020
for its first year. A lot of that money stuff has to do with the fact, though, that the

326
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,280
Nintendo Wii, they make

327
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,000
quite a bit of money off every sales of those, whereas, uh, Microsoft and Sony still

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,660
lose money

329
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,780
on everyone. Yeah, I think, I think that, yeah, so I think that for,

330
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,240
if they're saying that, if Microsoft is saying that they've made more money

331
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,280
with what they lose in production, then

332
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,220
overall, yeah, they are, I'd have to say they're definitely having to move a lot

333
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,960
more units,

334
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,620
but I don't see where the, but the Wii is clearly selling

335
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,000
the, like, crazy if they're having trouble stocking them. And this is only,

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,460
this is only the numbers for 2007, too. Obviously, you know,

337
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,160
Xbox 360 is still number one in the US, although,

338
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,540
worldwide, the Wii is number one. Are people still crazy about Wii? Are they

339
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,320
still hard to find? Yes, they're still hard to find. Wow.

340
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,880
What happened with the rain check program the GameStop was supposed to be doing?

341
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,320
Well, I don't know, I'm just kinda curious, like, I'm just kinda throwing it out there. I remember

342
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,200
they were gonna have all these systems

343
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,820
for these people who ordered rain checks, and now the system is still hard to get.

344
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,680
I still think that,

345
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,640
I mean, I'm sure that was successful for them, but, I don't know, maybe

346
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,460
gave them a little bit more attention. I don't think that they got any more than they

347
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,560
would have normally gotten

348
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,680
anyways. Maybe a little bit, because I know that,

349
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,520
you know, distribution didn't get as many Wii systems in January because of

350
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,720
this whole rain check program, but I don't think it's

351
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,040
a lot, you know, it's not like, dude, they're not like getting like four million systems.

352
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,600
Yeah, I don't know how many people that affected, but I'm just kinda

353
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
curious, because I remember throwing that story out there, and it was kinda like, well, what if

354
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Wii's are still really hard to come by in January,

355
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
which it seems like they are. I don't know, but,

356
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,480
yeah, it's still hard to find,

357
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,680
and it probably will be for a while. Chat Room to the Rescue, yet again, JV Mon is

358
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,960
in there, chat.orangelandradio.com, and says, Rob, I work at GameStop,

359
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,880
we filled all the pre-orders already, and are already got extras to sell to people.

360
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,080
So, there you go. We got the same amount we did November to December.

361
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,280
We're still cranking them out there. Well, as far as what the games did themselves, Halo 3 was at the top,

362
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,920
had 4.82 million, and Wii Play was right behind it,

363
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,240
which I think was kinda funny. Call of Duty 4

364
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,680
followed that. Guitar Hero 3 on PS2 was behind that.

365
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,840
I think the only reason Wii Play did so well is because it was like controller,

366
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,520
plus

367
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,160
cheap games, and that made it stand out. And it's like Wii Sports, and people

368
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,000
love Wii Sports, and for a while there, it was hard to find remotes, and

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,400
that was the only way you could find it, so win-win-win.

370
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,060
Sneaky. We actually were at Fry's last week when I was having my computer

371
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,560
drama,

372
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,160
and there was a lady there trying to decide whether or not to buy Trauma Center or

373
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,200
buy Wii Play,

374
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,320
and she's like, wait, this has a controller with it, and put it down Trauma Center.

375
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,720
That was it. But Trauma Center's so awesome.

376
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,800
I know. It's all about the lowest common denominator.

377
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,540
For real, there it is right there. Nintendo's secret to success. It's all

378
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,160
about the lowest common denominator.

379
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,520
For real. Nintendo deer hunting, that's all.

380
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,440
That'll win. Let's move on. Anyways, Nintendo came out and announced a few dates

381
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,120
of titles coming out, and this is first and third party stuff.

382
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,440
For the first half of 2008,

383
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,960
some of which we probably already knew about, some I guess were surprising, I don't know.

384
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,480
Anyways, one game that was rumored to be coming out soon was Okami on the Wii.

385
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,800
That's been dated for the 25th. Wii Fit scheduled for Quarter 2,

386
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,640
which that would coincide with the supposed rumor from 1UP that

387
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,360
Wii Fit's supposed to come out May 2nd, or not 2nd, the 20th.

388
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,760
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, they're going to have some sequels coming out

389
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,000
for that in Quarter 2 as well. Crossword DS,

390
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Nintendo Crosswords coming out May 5th,

391
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,100
and Professor Layton in the Curious Village, the

392
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,960
current number one selling DS title in Japan right now coming out

393
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,560
in the United States on February 10th.

394
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,440
Let's see, some other fun stuff for the Wii.

395
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,220
February 26th, The Masked Queen and The Tower of Mirrors, the Dragon Quest

396
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,680
Swords game.

397
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Karaoke Revolution presents American Idol Encore.

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,640
That's coming out in the early part of February as well.

399
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,960
Let's see here.

400
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,920
Looks like a Poona is scheduled to be coming out from Koei. That's supposed to be a pretty good

401
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,960
role-playing game.

402
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,360
It sounds dirty, I'm sorry, I'm laughing over here like a three-year-old, but...

403
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,840
Poona, I just can't contain herself either.

404
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,080
Ironic. That's hilarious.

405
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,000
Strangely enough though in here, they have Nitro Bike from Ubisoft listed as

406
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,320
March.

407
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,200
Apparently they didn't realize it's already come out, so...

408
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,040
They didn't get the memo on that. And then, of course, April, we cannot forget

409
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,480
Wild Earth

410
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,240
African Safari

411
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
from Majesco, the rip-off of

412
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,260
Africa.

413
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,360
And Cooking Mama Cook-Off 2

414
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,720
in June, because I know the first one controlled so well. The Cooking Mama on Wii

415
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,360
was horrific,

416
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,240
but the DS one's still cool.

417
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,960
Another cool game that's on the Nintendo DS is Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

418
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,080
That game was pretty awesome on the Nintendo DS.

419
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,360
And some screenshots, some rumored screenshots, have leaked from a new

420
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,040
Castlevania game, although we kind of emphasize this is only a rumor at this

421
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,520
time. However, it would really not be a surprise. It's kind of a no-brainer that

422
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,960
Konami would probably make a follow-up game to Portrait of Ruin at some point, a

423
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,340
new DS title. You might remember that the cool thing about Portrait of Ruin was

424
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,000
that you could use the Nintendo Wi-Fi service, but now it looks like that this

425
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,240
new Castlevania game, with some early screenshots that have been linked or to be

426
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,120
believed,

427
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,800
could possibly have

428
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,200
a Wii

429
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,520
connectivity feature built into it so that your DS interacts with your Wii

430
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
somehow. How?

431
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,920
Who knows?

432
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,900
It's unknown at this time, but apparently there's some type of Wii menu item

433
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,560
that's being seen in the screenshots

434
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,960
on the screen, so...

435
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
Would that imply that, you know,

436
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,600
there's going to be a Wii from Castlevania game coming out soon as well then?

437
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,480
I would think.

438
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,900
I hope so.

439
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,380
Because Castlevania is a good franchise, that's why.

440
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,240
I seem to remember, though, that the creator of Castlevania was not too

441
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,680
pleased with the Nintendo Wii when he first... You know, he didn't want it to be that

442
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,520
gimmicky,

443
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,320
oh, you're going to actually use the thing as a whip, oh, what the...

444
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,600
He fucking wears an ugly cowboy hat. I don't care. You know, he can suck it,

445
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,480
because

446
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,020
I would really like for one to be on the Wii.

447
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,280
But isn't that... I mean, that would be cheesy, though. They don't have to act like you can actually whip.

448
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,680
No one says that you... That's not cheesy at all. I would love that. No one says you can't have just a

449
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,120
traditional game on the Wii system. Exactly.

450
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,360
People just, for some reason, get it stuck in their heads that they've got to

451
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,460
make some, you know, motion control crap and stuff that go along with it.

452
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,040
You don't need to.

453
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,060
Look at, uh, what is it, you know, Super Paper Mario.

454
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,320
I mean, that didn't have two... I mean, it had some stuff, but

455
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,800
it was pretty much a traditional game.

456
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,840
Uh, MacMan, that says in chatroom, Castlevania whip carnival games.

457
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,660
There you go.

458
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,200
Why you don't applaud that?

459
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,800
First time in Belmont, or whatever, one of the Belmont crew has to, uh, tame lions or

460
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,880
something like that.

461
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,000
GS68 in our chatroom speculates,

462
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,840
uh, it's probably going to be Castlevania

463
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,920
W

464
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,840
of I, you know, because it has to be, you know, it's to say Wii, so he's suggesting

465
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,800
Castlevania Wind of Illness.

466
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,720
Does that sound Castlevania-esque to you? That's very Castlevania-esque. Very Castlevania-esque.

467
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,720
But does it have to be, like, a music, like, symphony, rondo, wind of incontinence?

468
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,480
The ones with the, with...

469
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Well...

470
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,280
Sorry, JB, yes?

471
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
That really only applied to, well,

472
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,600
only applied to Dracula X.

473
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,360
To be technical, Symphony of the Night slash Nocturne in the Moonlight

474
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,840
was part of the Dracula X series, and all the other ones after that were just

475
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,800
Castlevania.

476
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,560
Well, also not all the games have been that, because Portrait are ruined. Portrait's not a music thing, so...

477
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,040
They could have Dracula, or, you know, part of the

478
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,000
Dracula triple X series, you know, and then the whips and chains get, you know, that's a

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,280
whole different part of the game. Those could excite some of the people.

480
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Now you're talking!

481
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I'd buy that. You know what I'd buy?

482
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Well, I am sure we're going to get into this a little bit later. That's probably something Itagaki would be into, as well, right?

483
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,480
There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,480
You can have to whip the cowboy hat off his head, because, you know...

485
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,840
Uh, anyhow...

486
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,400
Ew, this is a crappy game!

487
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,720
What? From Namco? It's listed as a game coming out in the summer.

488
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,820
Active Life Outdoor Challenge?

489
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,740
I'm sorry, I don't want to be active.

490
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,400
I refuse to buy that game.

491
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,240
I like being active.

492
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,260
They should have different types of interactive games like that.

493
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,920
Anyway, for

494
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
our friends in the UK, there are a

495
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,680
couple of things out for Virtual Console, and I'm very sorry for you all.

496
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,740
Well, I mean, one of them was okay, but

497
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,980
there's better.

498
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,480
Like, 1080 Snowboarding

499
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,500
from the Nintendo 64.

500
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,160
Yeah, it's out. I'm sorry.

501
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,340
And then Riot Zone for Turbo Duo. I'm really sorry.

502
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,280
Because it's, um...

503
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,480
not very good. So, sorry.

504
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,240
Or, you know, if you're feeling adventurous, you could just say, you know what? Forget

505
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
Jamie's opinion. I'm going to download it anyway.

506
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
If you want to download it and throw up,

507
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,240
be my guest.

508
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
Well, enjoy, or don't.

509
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,600
There is one game that's coming out on the WiiWare service at some point here.

510
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,860
That's actually being scheduled for the second quarter of 2008.

511
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,820
It's a game called Plachin, and it's kind of a

512
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,240
mix between a shooter and a puzzle game.

513
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,800
Now, what I thought was interesting is they were talking about some of the stuff

514
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
that it will support.

515
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,240
One thing,

516
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,920
they have a price point on it, which is going to be 1,500 Wii points, so you can kind of

517
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,400
expect a lot of these games to be around the $10, $20 range

518
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,600
instead of... Or $15 in that case.

519
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,680
Well, that's why that's a range, Rob.

520
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,360
Which, you see, it falls right in the middle of that range.

521
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,600
Alright, I understand basic math. I get it. I'm just saying.

522
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,240
You say $10 and $20, yeah, this game's going to be $15.

523
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm just clarifying.

524
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,880
For our listeners who may not be following, because they fell asleep during your report because they

525
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,600
can't understand simple math. Are you insulting our listeners like that?

526
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,200
No, I would never.

527
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,440
Look, it's Nintendo's strategy, lowest common denominator, right?

528
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,080
I guess.

529
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,960
It's got some interesting stuff, though, in it. You can play it with the Wii Zapper,

530
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,080
although I don't know why.

531
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,920
You can play it offline with up to 12 people at the same time.

532
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,280
So I guess that would be one person uses a nunchuck, one person uses a remote,

533
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,100
and then also the four controllers, and then four GameCube controllers.

534
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,440
That's craziness.

535
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,280
I can't even fit that many people in my living room without breaking some type of fire hazard.

536
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,920
We did that once. Remember WarioWare? Eleven people.

537
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,320
That's right, but that was crazy. That was like a workout, because you had to run around.

538
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
There wasn't enough room in that room for people.

539
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
It supports DK Bongos.

540
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There's finally another game that can utilize the DK Bongos.

541
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,760
And, apparently, they're also playing a...

542
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,920
Can you use a Guitar Hero 3 controller, too?

543
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, sure. Why not?

544
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
If you can use everything...

545
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Maybe R-Mat?

546
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Maybe.

547
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

548
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,100
Actually, I'm sure you probably could, since, you know, it's...

549
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,640
That could be like the Ultimate Showdown. Twelve people. Twelve peripherals in the Ultimate

550
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,180
WiiWare Showdown.

551
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,820
Keep in mind, I think that it's actually pretty funny, because for me, who likes to find however

552
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,940
many different controllers will work on a different game? I mean, my friend was the

553
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,540
one who invented Rodcalibur.

554
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,600
But here's the thing, though. I mean, this will have, you know, a ton of different multiplayer

555
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,960
options and peripheral options, but what if the game sucks? You know, it's like, oh, great,

556
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,280
I can use all these controllers, but do we really want to play this game?

557
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,700
Now, are you sure it's a twelve player game, or is it somewhere in the range of ten to

558
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
fourteen players?

559
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,720
No, it's twelve players. It says, for support for twelve people, it does not say a range

560
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,420
of...

561
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,000
That's why they offer you different controller choices, so that you can change the nature

562
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,440
of the game. So, it's like, man, I hate playing it with the Zapper. I'm going to use the Bongo.

563
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,120
Hey, I like the Bongo. Then, those people are covered.

564
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,560
Anyways, I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about some of this

565
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,160
stuff, so hopefully that service launches pretty soon. I still think that they're going

566
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,200
to announce it at Game Developers Conference.

567
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,800
That would actually be a really smart place.

568
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,880
It would make lots of sense. Actually, now that I remember seeing this before, this was

569
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,480
the first game that was announced for WiiWare at one time. Actually, it doesn't look that

570
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,560
bad. It's kind of weird looking, though. It's like, I don't know, how would you describe

571
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
that?

572
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Abstract.

573
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Abstract?

574
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,520
This is great radio. Rob, describe this screenshot for our listeners.

575
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,640
I don't know. It's in space. It's got bejeweled stuff and a sun.

576
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,720
I can tell you from the distance it looked like a pizza. From over here, it looked like

577
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
pizza.

578
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
You're just hungry. You just want to eat it.

579
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Alright, that's it.

580
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,440
Let's move on.

581
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,800
I think that's a good idea, though. We need to do the whole twelve people, twelve peripherals,

582
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,840
one game, and have a showdown, and then laugh at how stupid we are. Paraglove wins.

583
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:33,740
Anyhow, anyway, let's move on to another story.

584
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,560
You might remember, you know, it's funny, these April Fools stories that run in Electronic

585
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Gaming Monthly have this really strange habit of turning into reality. Remember Mortal

586
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,360
Kombat? There was the rumor of the hidden character, Ermac, that it was the red sub-zero

587
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,120
or whatever, and then he actually showed up in a game later on. Well, years ago, I don't

588
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,480
remember how long it was, maybe it was last year, I don't remember, but there was supposedly

589
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,160
a game that was going to be made, it was their April Fools joke, Super Mario Fusion, I'm

590
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,520
sorry, it was Super Mario Kingdom Hearts, or something like that. It was the idea that

591
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,160
the Mario universe would be combined with Kingdom Hearts.

592
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,720
It was Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.

593
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,760
That's what it was, Mushroom Kingdom Hearts. Well, what's happened now is that someone

594
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,960
has taken, I guess, they've taken Mario and combined it with, what the hell else, they

595
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,840
got this game, Fusion, and they've got, I guess, Kingdom Hearts all worked into one.

596
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,720
It's a combined, it's basically a game called Super Mario Bros. Fusion, but it combines

597
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
like Mega Man.

598
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
What the hell? That's Mega Man.

599
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:40,320
Yeah, it combines Mega Man, Halo, they've got Ghosts and Goblins, Sonic the Hedgehog,

600
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,640
just a bunch of stuff, and it's all made in this one Game Maker 7 program or whatever,

601
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,920
but it plays like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros. 3.

602
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,120
Wow, that's like a Halo stage and we had a Mega Man stage. Who else is there here? That's

603
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
more Mega Man.

604
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,080
Yeah, they have the whole entire Bubble Man stage.

605
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,880
That is craziness. Somebody was really bored.

606
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,480
Yeah, I think that's all we see is the Bubble Man stage now.

607
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,080
But you can actually play the demo for it.

608
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
You can throw the bubbles.

609
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,400
That's pretty awesome. Very cool.

610
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
That's very creative.

611
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,680
Somebody's got a lot of free time on their hands, seriously.

612
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,080
That's actually cooler than Asshole Mario.

613
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
That's quite a compliment.

614
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,920
Yeah, because Asshole Mario is really cool.

615
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
And funny.

616
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
That's really cool.

617
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,560
Mega Man asks the question, Mario plus Kingdom Hearts plus Mega Man plus Halo plus Sonic

618
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
equals Will It Blend?

619
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,480
If you've ever visited that website, Will It Blend? Forget it. Forget it.

620
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,760
All right, anyhow, let's move on to Will It Come Out, talking about some new release dates

621
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,240
and what games are in your future. We'll start off with Europe.

622
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,600
Well, for our friends over there, there is some actually sort of cool stuff coming out.

623
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,920
There is, as soon as this works for me, there we go. We have Pirates of the Burning Sea

624
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:06,280
on the 22nd. We have Advanced Wars Dark Conflict and Burnout Paradise on the 25th. We have

625
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:13,000
Cruisin for Wii, Donkey Kong Jet Race, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Foster's Home for

626
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,780
Imaginary Friends, Imagination Invades on DS, FDC World Darts Championship 2008, Fantasy

627
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,280
Star Universe Ambition of Illuminus, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, and finally, Universe

628
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,360
at War Earth Assault for PC.

629
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
That it?

630
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeah.

631
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Doesn't seem like that busy of a week over there.

632
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:41,080
Well, I guess all of the people who are addicted to PSU will be happy.

633
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,600
Well, it's not a very busy week over in Japan either, but I'm going out of turn. It's actually

634
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
supposed to be the U.S. states next. My bad.

635
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I can wait. Anyways, in the U.S. we have a pretty good week of stuff coming out. My personal

636
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,320
favorite, No More Heroes, is coming out for the Wii. Definitely worth picking up. If you

637
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,060
don't have a Wii, maybe you'll like this for the DS, Advanced Wars Days of Ruin. Looks

638
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,060
pretty awesome.

639
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,920
Let's see, Pirates of the Burning Sea for the PC. We have Burnout Paradise coming out

640
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,840
in Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you're looking for more of a casual game, Endless

641
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,460
Ocean on the Wii. You can swim around with the fishies. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic

642
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:32,280
Games on the DS. One Piece Unlimited Adventure on the Wii. Iridium Runners on Playstation

643
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:41,280
2. It's a piece of crap. Rainbow Islands Evolution on the PSP. Hopefully you'll be able to get

644
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:52,600
past Kawasaki Jet Ski, which is actually supposed to be like Wave Race, but probably not going

645
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,760
to be because it's put out by Destiny and every game that they make sucks. But, cross

646
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,960
our fingers, maybe someday their games won't suck.

647
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm just going to say this about Rainbow Islands on the PSP. I do love Rainbow Islands, the

648
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,600
original Rainbow Islands game, and that is where my love for the series ends. None of

649
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,640
the games after that were really worth, you know, getting excited about.

650
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
Okay, now we'll go over to Japanese Re-

651
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
What about Paracel Stars?

652
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,360
That's different. I mean, you could say all those games are in the Bubble Bobble universe,

653
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
I suppose, but, you know.

654
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,520
Yeah, Paracel Stars was great.

655
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,420
Paracel Stars was pretty cool. Anyway, going over to Japanese release dates, not a lot

656
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,340
on the Xbox 360, but you do have on the Playstation 3 this week, Juice 2, which I think was delayed

657
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,720
from last week because it came out on all the other systems last week. There really

658
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,880
isn't a lot to speak of otherwise on the next gen systems, but on the current gen systems,

659
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,000
such as Playstation 2, or, I don't know, is it high time for us to start calling it last

660
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,160
gen now? The Playstation 2 is really last gen and current gen is, I guess, last gen.

661
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Who knows? Who cares?

662
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
How about we just call it the PS2?

663
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,620
How about we just call it the PS2? Coming to the PS2, a game called Lucky Star, also

664
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,400
a game called Tokka Race Driver 3 Ultimate Racing Simulator come out this week as well

665
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,720
on the Playstation 2. Going to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Daikokai

666
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,880
Jidai 4 Rota Nova moves in to the best hits from Koei, and that's a price reduction. The

667
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,100
only really new game that looks like it's coming out over there is you get Hijoguchi

668
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:22,280
Exit DS. There's another Mahjong game coming out on the DS as well. The Sims 2 Cast Away

669
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,480
also comes out on the Nintendo DS. And the Prince of Tennis Driving Smash Side King.

670
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,800
That's an interesting anime.

671
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
That's right. You two can be the Prince of Tennis in the privacy of your own home.

672
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,800
I'd rather be the Prince of the Cosmos.

673
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,000
On the Sony PSP, not a whole lot of stuff, but you do have a Winning Eleven Ubiquitous

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,120
Evolution 2008 coming out on the PSP. A couple other games getting price reductions, such

675
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:51,200
as Luminous 2. That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

676
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,960
That's all happy and good. Well, speaking of things that are happy and good, there was

677
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,200
a, well I'm sure that people have heard about this by now, but there was a guy named Paxton

678
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Galvanek, who rescued two victims from an overturned SUV in North Carolina. And this

679
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,420
guy's supposed to be pretty cool because he, you know, assessed the situation, treated

680
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:19,260
their wounds like with perfect first aid, kept them alive, and his medical background

681
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,080
consists of playing America's Army.

682
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Wow.

683
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,160
Apparently there's a classroom in there, and part of the classroom area is basically all

684
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,680
the stuff they go through in basic, which is including a medic class, so that you learn

685
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,080
basic first aid. And when he witnessed the accident, he basically went right into that

686
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:45,720
mode and, you know, he, the first person he treated was someone who had lost two fingers,

687
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,600
and so he used a towel to stop the bleeding and held their hand over their head, which

688
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,080
is, I mean, I've got a full first aid certification because I have to as a massage therapist,

689
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,880
and that's the first thing that you do. You see who's more injured, and you, you know,

690
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,040
if they're bleeding, you hold their hand over their head and, you know, have them do that.

691
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,800
And he also treated somebody for a head wound too, so that by the time someone arrived,

692
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,920
which I think is kind of funny because it said it was a soldier that showed up to help

693
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,920
them out, everybody was fine. And he actually, I think it's pretty cool, though, if they're

694
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,920
putting in, like, actual real first aid techniques in that game, then that's pretty cool.

695
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
By chance, did he play Trauma Center as well?

696
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
I don't think so.

697
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Because you can learn a little bit from playing Trauma Center.

698
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Like, we're not to cut people?

699
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,920
You can stitch up somebody by, you know, waving furiously, and then you can also stop time

700
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
and slow down time if you use your psychic powers.

701
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Star, you can totally, like, heal them completely, wow.

702
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Okay, so maybe America's Army is a little more practical, but...

703
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Well, I mean, that was the whole point of that game, though, is to show, you know, what

704
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,920
it's supposed to be like to go through, you know, basic and be out, you know, in the field

705
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,920
and everything. And I actually think that's kind of cool that someone could just pick

706
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,920
up from that and learn and use it actually in a real life situation.

707
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I think it's also very healthy for the video game scene to actually get a video game saves

708
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,920
life as opposed to stupid kid shoots his brother over a video game type news story, you know?

709
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,920
So, just, it's nice to have a change.

710
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Like, I was 28 years old.

711
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Who actually plays a medic in, like, America's Army?

712
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,920
I mean, seriously, it's like, I want to be the medic! Ooh!

713
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,920
You know what, it's required to have first aid training when you go in the Army.

714
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
It's a game!

715
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,920
There's a lot of people that go into the Army to study doctor type stuff, you know?

716
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Here at the end of America's Army 2, they all become rock stars and have tons of women

717
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,920
and, like, live in mansions, because that's what the military is supposed to do.

718
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
It's going to give you women in mansions.

719
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,920
I don't think so. I don't think that's how they advertise it.

720
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Yeah. Sure, they do.

721
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,920
I think it's more of the be all you can be and going into the Army can strengthen yourself.

722
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Whatever.

723
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I think it's like, Mike, yay.

724
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,920
I think it's like when people are playing an MMO and they pick their class, it's like

725
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,920
the same people who would pick a priest because they like to assist and, like, heal people.

726
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,920
That's my theory.

727
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,920
And, of course, our chat room is breaking out into a chorus of, heal please, heal please.

728
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I don't know.

729
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Good for him for actually, you know, being able to help them, although it's very coincidental

730
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,920
that he actually learned something from this game from, you know, because it's usually

731
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,920
it's like, okay, I hit A and then they heal. Okay, that didn't work right, you know.

732
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Have you ever played America's Army?

733
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
No, I have not played America's Army.

734
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,920
It is a rigorous training process just to start the game.

735
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Like, they make you take tests before you get your gun and then it jams.

736
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Sounds like fun. Sounds like a lot of fun.

737
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,920
LF-10,000M, Iraq instance. Tank and healer needed. Please send tell.

738
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Well, if people are, you know, buying the game for the purpose of what it is as a simulation,

739
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
then it needs to be that in depth.

740
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Because, I mean, really the game is just a marketing tool for the Army anyway.

741
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
It is, but.

742
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,920
And now this kid is going to be the poster child of that game.

743
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Look, see what America's Army can do?

744
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Now imagine what would happen if you joined the real military.

745
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,920
I was just reading the thing over and saying, you know, when he was talking about what he did

746
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,920
and I was like, that is proper first aid. That's what you're supposed to do.

747
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,920
So, pay attention. Kudos to you.

748
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Hooray. So, I guess you really can't stitch up somebody by going like this and flailing your arm about.

749
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
I refuse to believe it, Rob.

750
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Alright, let's move on.

751
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Anyways, something along the same lines as America's Army.

752
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,920
Okay, maybe not. But apparently the porn industry has dropped their backing for HD DVD.

753
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,920
No!

754
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,920
And dozens of Xbox 360 owners cry out in pain all at once.

755
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm going to put HD DVD player on Craigslist tomorrow.

756
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,920
I mean, I don't know if it's everybody, but one studio in particular, Digital Playground,

757
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,920
has decided to abandon HD DVD and stick solely with Blu-Ray.

758
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Good for them, I guess.

759
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
But not every studio.

760
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Not every studio, as a lot of people are reporting. It's just Digital Playground.

761
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
It wasn't... never mind, I'm not going to say it.

762
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,920
And, you know, I don't know.

763
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,920
To be honest, I... let's...

764
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Sorry, Irene and I are giggling like three-year-olds over here.

765
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Irene's all, you're just hoping it's not Falcon or Colt, huh?

766
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,920
No, I mean, it's one studio... I mean, how many porn studios are out there, seriously?

767
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
Billions!

768
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
There's a ton of them.

769
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,920
But let's see what Digital Playground has to offer us, you know, because...

770
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,920
Okay, I mean, seriously, let's see here.

771
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,920
They're top-selling titles that you may be missing if you have HD DVD and you want it in HD.

772
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,920
Jack's Teen America 19,

773
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Mrs. Bee Haven,

774
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Jessie's Juice,

775
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Jannikova and Blu,

776
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Forbidden Tales,

777
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Jack's Big Tit Show number four,

778
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Hush! and Jessie Jean's Scream.

779
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Although, to their credit, though, they did produce the Pirates film, and Pirates was hilarious.

780
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
Hilariously bad.

781
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:48,920
MacMan suggests that the PlayStation 3's newest games, Drake's Penis, Ratchet and Dick, and Heavenly Sword.

782
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,920
But here's the thing, though.

783
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,920
They may have stopped making HD DVDs, but they still sell them.

784
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
They still have quite a bit of stuff on there.

785
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,920
And besides, anyone that actually watches a lot of porn anyways, they don't buy their porn.

786
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,920
I mean, come on, this is the internet revolution, you know?

787
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
Who actually buys porn nowadays?

788
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,920
And you can find plenty of it in Divx out there.

789
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,920
And remember, your PlayStation 3 also plays Divx, and hopefully Xbox 360 will at some point soon.

790
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,920
Or you can stream stuff.

791
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
I believe Xbox 360 is already playing Divx now after their last patch.

792
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah, yeah.

793
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,920
Because I was watching, it wasn't porn, it was a legitimate television show,

794
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,920
but I was watching Cat House Girls that I downloaded from the internet in Divx on the Xbox 360.

795
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,920
So I'm pretty sure it supports Divx.

796
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
So crisis averted.

797
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Exactly.

798
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Anyhow, there's always Porn02 on your Wii, by the way.

799
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Not that we're telling you how to do that.

800
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Anyhow, if you don't want to use your PlayStation 3 to watch pirates or other types of porn,

801
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,920
you can use it for more legitimate purposes, such as playing SingStar.

802
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,920
However, apparently the SingStar SingStore is not that great.

803
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Remember when we first saw the SingStar SingStore at a previous E3

804
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,920
and it looked like every song ever made looked like it was going to be in there with all these videos and so on?

805
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Sony had promised 350 music tracks.

806
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Well, so far there are less than 100 songs, apparently, out there.

807
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Apparently the server keeps going down.

808
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,920
There really aren't a lot of updates in the SingStore news section.

809
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,920
So SingStar does not appear to be doing quite as well as people originally thought.

810
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
I'm glad they can underdeliver like normal.

811
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,920
Now, however, to be fair, Sony did make a response a little later in the week.

812
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,920
SingStar Studios said that downloadable songs for SingStore are on the way.

813
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,920
The original vision was supposed to be 350, but they missed the mark.

814
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,920
However, they are going to put out 18 new tracks on January 18th, which should have already passed,

815
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,920
15 English songs and three Spanish ones, including David Bowie and Blur.

816
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
Not bad.

817
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
I like Blur.

818
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,920
And February 4th is supposed to see the launch of even more songs.

819
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,920
That's okay. They only missed the mark by 200 songs.

820
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
Good thing they're looking at 18.

821
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,920
No, 15 of those are in English.

822
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,920
Well, they're supposed to be updating it now twice a week.

823
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Sorry, not twice a week, twice a month.

824
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,920
That's okay. No one needs to be playing SingStar anyways.

825
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,920
It's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.

826
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,920
Karaoke is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of entertainment, okay?

827
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
How do you really feel?

828
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
I enjoyed it.

829
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Plus they have the ability to upload videos of yourself singing.

830
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Who would do that? That's lame.

831
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,920
I don't know what to tell you.

832
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Well, we do have a situation.

833
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Uh-oh.

834
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Do I have to call out the troops?

835
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
No.

836
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,920
Do we have to get a medic?

837
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,920
No.

838
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,920
I'm sorry for all of our European listeners who are excited about Uncharted.

839
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,920
It's not in 1080i.

840
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,920
Sorry.

841
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,920
It was only added to the U.S. version later in development,

842
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
and the PAL version is not going to have it.

843
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Thank God. I thought there was a real problem.

844
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,920
They said that it would delay the game's release because they have to test it for QA.

845
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
So, sorry.

846
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Wait a minute. Game developers are QA-ing their games again?

847
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,920
That's good news.

848
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
Okay, folks.

849
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
It would be 480p.

850
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,920
If you really have been out of shape about that, remember, PlayStation 3 games are region-free.

851
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,920
So, if you really need your 1080i, to be honest, you're not going to tell the difference between...

852
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,920
If you've got an HDTV, then it doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.

853
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,920
No, it shouldn't.

854
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,920
So get it. Import it.

855
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
And there's your workaround.

856
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Hooray! Workaround!

857
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Speaking of workarounds, they finally released the custom firmware from DarkAlex,

858
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,920
the guy behind all those wonderful PSP custom firmwares, released all the popular ones.

859
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,920
He has just released 3.80 M33, and it will give you all the wonderful features of 3.8,

860
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,920
including the streaming internet radio and all that fun stuff, plus a bunch of new features as well.

861
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,920
One of the cool things I liked about this, actually, is once you've loaded 3.8 in there,

862
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,920
any additional firmware updates that happen to come along from the custom firmware scene,

863
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,920
you can actually update them over the internet, just like you would your normal PSP firmwares.

864
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:45,920
So you can just download an update and update it right there, just like you would any official firmware,

865
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,920
which I did, and it was pretty cool.

866
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,920
But that's available right now for PSP Slims, and they also have one for the PSP Fat, I guess,

867
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:04,920
that also has some of the stuff for the 1.5 firmware, so you can run your homebrew crap.

868
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,920
But try as they may, they'll never stop the people from breaking those firmwares.

869
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Do you think at some point Sony's just going to give up?

870
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,920
No.

871
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,920
I guess they really think that they're going to win.

872
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,920
I guess it keeps some people employed or what have you, I don't know.

873
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Anyhow, one thing that perhaps DarkAlex maybe wants to work on soon is solving the Dust problem on the PlayStation 3,

874
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,920
because, no, I'm not trying to make a joke that nobody's playing their PlayStation 3 so they're getting dusty,

875
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,920
but remember, remember, like, Dust killed somebody's PlayStation, like Sony refused to do anything about it or something like that?

876
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,920
The guy ended up getting a refund from the credit card company or something like that?

877
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,920
Well, Dust is obviously a huge issue for PlayStations.

878
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,920
Dude, that PS3 right there looks like someone put it under their sawhorse when they were cutting some wood or something.

879
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
I mean, this is ridiculous.

880
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
They collect dust, though, really easily.

881
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
They're dust magnets, I'm telling you.

882
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,920
Well, Hori makes a bunch of different peripherals.

883
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,920
They're like a peripheral making company, and they are coming out with a Dust Guard Kit 3.

884
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,920
It guards all four of your air vents.

885
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,920
It puts a filter that, you know, prevents dust and, of course, cigarette smoke from getting inside the PlayStation 3

886
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,920
for all those people that smoke next to their PlayStation 3s.

887
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,920
It also covers up the open ports and so on.

888
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,920
So insert your dust cap joke here, but there is officially a dust cap coming for the PlayStation 3.

889
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
That's actually pretty cool.

890
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
That company makes really good stuff.

891
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,920
We got a couple of controllers that they put out, the GameCube ones back in the day.

892
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I want a mod that makes my PS3 smoke a cigarette, because that would make it even cooler.

893
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,920
Or you could just not smoke next to your PlayStation 3 or put it in a well vent.

894
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Oh, yeah.

895
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,920
Take a hit off this PS3, you'll love it.

896
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Suddenly your PlayStation 3 is glowing.

897
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Want to get high?

898
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
Look at the website, though.

899
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,920
Did you look at the ad for it?

900
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
No.

901
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,920
The connector, it's actually pretty cool.

902
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Looking at how all of this fits in, I think it's a very good idea.

903
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
How it all pieces together?

904
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Well, they said that it's charged with static to attract the dust.

905
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,920
You know those static wipes for dusting?

906
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
It's the same theory on it.

907
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
That's actually pretty cool.

908
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Wow.

909
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,920
I'll link the ad in the chatroom.

910
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Interesting.

911
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
The ad is available at hoary.jp.

912
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
Just browse to their products for the Dust Guard Kit 3.

913
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
I know.

914
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,920
I think that GameStop still carries a lot of the hoary products.

915
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
So, shouldn't have any problem.

916
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Very cool.

917
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Dust Cap 3.

918
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
I was always hoping it would come to the U.S.

919
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Wow, let's move on with some more news.

920
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Well, in other news.

921
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,920
And, you know, we said we weren't going to talk about this guy again.

922
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,920
But he who shall not be named keeps reappearing.

923
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
Has he opened the Chamber of Secrets this time?

924
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
He's trying.

925
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,920
He's trying to open up a can of drama is what he's doing.

926
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Oh, really?

927
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
No way.

928
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Yeah, really.

929
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Anyway, I will say it for the benefit of those who have not listened for a while

930
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,920
and don't know who the heck we're talking about when we speak of he who shall not be named.

931
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
But Jack Thompson, the butthead.

932
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Sends shivers down my spine.

933
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,920
Lord Voldemort.

934
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,920
He said that there were quotes that were attributed to him by British newspapers

935
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,920
that were a total fabrication about Buzz.

936
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,920
And he's quoted saying, I was never interviewed about Buzz.

937
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,920
I never heard about it until I was quoted having allegedly said this about it.

938
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,920
And what he was quoted as saying is that video games have hurt far more people than they have helped.

939
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,920
And he said that what he would say.

940
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,920
Well, I'm just going to read his quote because he speaks in circles.

941
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,920
I would never say what I am quoted as saying in any context as the quotation,

942
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,920
regardless of what it is applied to, is absurd on its face.

943
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,920
How in the world could anyone prove and or quantify that games have hurt more people than they have helped?

944
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,920
That sounds to me like he's lying.

945
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,920
You know, every time this guy opens his mouth, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

946
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,920
Do you get a little angsty?

947
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,920
Real quick, I was just going to mention that Take-Two actually proactively sued him,

948
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,920
so that's also going on right now, too.

949
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,920
You know, Loki cut me off, and that makes me even more angsty,

950
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,920
so you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

951
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:56,920
Music

952
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,920
I'm an FU to my washing machine for not wanting to wash my hoodie by itself and imbalancing,

953
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,920
because I really wanted to wear my Jack hoodie tonight.

954
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,920
My nightmare before Christmas day, and I couldn't because of the wet.

955
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,920
I'm really not very angsty.

956
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
All right.

957
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,920
No, an FU to my cat for throwing up a hairball on my massage diploma,

958
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,920
so now I have to go get a reprint of it and my transcripts, and I have to get reprints of those.

959
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,920
And an FU to my folder from when I first started school,

960
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,920
because it has all of my massage clover seats in it, so that I can have myself one big fat tax write-off.

961
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,920
An FU to the company I work for for not claiming my W-2 yet.

962
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,920
For real?

963
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,920
I want money!

964
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Me too.

965
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,920
Loki, you're FUs.

966
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,920
Um, FU to the theater that I went and saw Cloverfield in,

967
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,920
because the entire time the front left speaker was making a

968
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,920
noise, so it was really annoying.

969
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
The entire movie.

970
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Are you sure it wasn't just the monster?

971
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
I'm pretty sure.

972
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,920
And we went and complained to management, and they're like, you know,

973
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,920
a bunch of little kids running around trying to figure out how to fix the speaker.

974
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
The monster didn't go have some fourth meal at Taco Bell?

975
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
I'm pretty sure.

976
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,920
All right.

977
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Is that it?

978
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
That's it.

979
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,920
My FU of the week goes to the damn flies in here,

980
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
who have not been served yet with the swatter of justice.

981
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Are they hiding right now?

982
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
I think they are.

983
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,920
I haven't seen one in a little while.

984
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,920
But FU to the fact that the flies hide all week long,

985
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,920
and then they come out on Sunday.

986
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
I hate that.

987
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
Anyhow.

988
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,920
Rice Princess, Nathan, do you guys have anything you want to add?

989
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,920
Flies just like listening to the show, geez.

990
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Um, FU to being sick and, you know,

991
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,920
not being able to hear out of my left ear,

992
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,920
so I sound like an old woman, like, eh?

993
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Can I do Janet again, Johnny?

994
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,920
Like, yeah, it's annoying.

995
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,920
And then I also second the FU to Cloverfield audiences.

996
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Wait, no, you just said the theater, right?

997
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
The audio.

998
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,920
Well, I'd say FU to the audience,

999
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,920
because they're stupid and immature,

1000
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,920
and they're, like, yelling out what they thought of a movie at the end.

1001
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,920
That's why I don't go see movies on opening weekend ever.

1002
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Because of kids.

1003
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Yeah, there were a bunch of kids.

1004
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,920
It's not like I went out and said, you know, my opinion on the movie,

1005
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,920
because I don't care to do that, but people do and they're stupid,

1006
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
FU!

1007
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,920
My only FU is for Nintendo.

1008
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,920
I love you guys, but you gotta really hurry up

1009
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,920
and make available on the Virtual Console

1010
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.

1011
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Some people haven't played it and don't know how great it is.

1012
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,920
My games are better.

1013
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,920
I have one.

1014
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,920
FU didn't know Guardian Legend either.

1015
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Greatest 8-bit game of all time.

1016
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,920
We've been saying that for a long time on this show.

1017
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,920
But I do agree, Super Mario RPG would make a fine addition to Virtual Console.

1018
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,920
But don't keep holding your breath.

1019
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Anyhow.

1020
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Anyway, Loki, anyway.

1021
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,920
So, this is kind of exciting and hopefully this comes out in the Wii,

1022
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,920
because this would be one of those games that could utilize that whipping motion

1023
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,920
from the Wii Remote.

1024
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,920
But Leisure Suit Larry, box office bust,

1025
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,920
is coming to consoles and the PC fall of 2008.

1026
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,920
And yes, if you don't remember Leisure Suit Larry,

1027
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,920
well, then you need to look it up on the internet,

1028
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,920
because I'm not going to explain it to you, but it's awesome.

1029
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,920
Except for that last game, because that last game blew really bad,

1030
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
and not in a good way.

1031
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Well, if the last game was bad, what's going to make this game good?

1032
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Because it's not the last game.

1033
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,920
But it's scheduled right now for, it looks like,

1034
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,920
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and mobile phones,

1035
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,920
and is being developed by Team17, the group behind the Worms games.

1036
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Nice.

1037
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Oh, cool.

1038
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,920
And the script, I guess, is being penned by Happy Madison Productions' Alan Covert.

1039
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,920
Is that Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison or something?

1040
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Well, Happy Madison is Adam Sandler's production group.

1041
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Oh, okay.

1042
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,920
And Alan Covert, he's done such wonderful movies as,

1043
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,920
okay, I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, Grandma's Boy,

1044
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Eight Crazy Nights, Mr. Diesel and Nicky, Big Daddy,

1045
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,920
Deuce Bigalow, Mail Jiggalow, Waterboy,

1046
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,920
pretty much every other Adam Sandler movie that's been out there, Happy Gilmore.

1047
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,920
So, you know what, if only that game had Adam Sandler

1048
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,920
and the whole Happy Madison group doing the voices in there,

1049
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,920
that might be cool.

1050
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Because Rob Schneider in that game, that could be cool.

1051
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
You can do it!

1052
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,920
All night long.

1053
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,920
They should make a Leisure Suit Larry movie, Happy Madison.

1054
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
That would be cool.

1055
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,920
You never know, anything's possible.

1056
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,920
All right, well, part A of our program is coming to a close,

1057
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,920
but not before we pay a little respect to our elders

1058
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,920
by nodding at the classic games,

1059
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,920
and we do that with a little segment we call

1060
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,920
Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1061
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,920
So, Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the kids this week

1062
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,920
to play a little bit of?

1063
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
The game I'm referring to is one of the last ones

1064
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,920
that came out on the Sega Saturn in America.

1065
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,920
One of the games, I actually, it's one of my favorite games,

1066
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,920
is Burning Rangers, which is also put out by Sonic Team.

1067
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,920
Who can do no wrong?

1068
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
I love Sonic Team.

1069
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,920
Anyway, the game is basically set in the future

1070
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,920
where the old Sonic games,

1071
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:02,920
where the only few hazards remaining is one of them is fire.

1072
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,920
So these are futuristic fire fighters who use their super sentai powers

1073
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,920
to extinguish flames and rescue people.

1074
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,920
And after you beat the game once,

1075
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,920
you actually have a random level generator

1076
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,920
that you can use to change the game each time you go play it.

1077
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,920
As far as the technical side of it,

1078
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,920
for people who were Saturn fans,

1079
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,920
you know that the Saturn was,

1080
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,920
it wasn't very good with transparency,

1081
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,920
but they did it for this game.

1082
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,920
It's one of the games that used it.

1083
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,920
And also, the first game that used ADX audio compression.

1084
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,920
On top of that, while there hasn't been a sequel,

1085
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,920
it's been referenced to quite a number of times.

1086
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,920
In Phantasy Star Online,

1087
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,920
there was a central dome fire swirl level

1088
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,920
where one of the main characters from Burning Rangers

1089
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,920
asked you to help him put out fires and help people,

1090
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,920
and had the music from the Japanese version of Burning Rangers,

1091
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,920
which was angels with burning hearts.

1092
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
Two of the vocal songs were in Sonic Pinball Party.

1093
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,920
Also, the theme song was in Samba de Amigo,

1094
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,920
if you remember, as one of the downloadable songs.

1095
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,920
And could make a return when Samba de Amigo comes out on the Wii a little later, right?

1096
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,920
You could actually access it in, I believe, in the second Samba 2000.

1097
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,920
Also, Phantasy Star Universe had an event called Operation Firebreak

1098
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,920
that uses the same song,

1099
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,920
and it's on the planet that was involved in the game.

1100
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,920
And it's actually, all the soundtrack was designed by the guitarist

1101
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,920
for a British band called UFO.

1102
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,920
So, Burning Rangers is cool.

1103
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,920
There you have it, your classic game of the week, Burning Rangers,

1104
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,920
a game I never played, but maybe I ought to.

1105
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,920
Well, I will bring that in the side and over one day.

1106
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,920
I think you should.

1107
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,920
I think it's funny that it goes for bucks on eBay,

1108
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,920
and I got mine at a convention swap meet for 30 bucks.

1109
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,920
Wow. Sometimes you find little gems there.

1110
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,920
So, there you go.

1111
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,920
All right, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of our show.

1112
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,920
But as you know, Orange Launch Radio is divvied up into two parts every week,

1113
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,920
so we will be right back after just a little bit with Orange Launch Radio, Part B.

1114
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,920
Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

1115
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,920
and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1116
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
