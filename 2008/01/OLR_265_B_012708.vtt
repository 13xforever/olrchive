00:15.300 --> 00:19.600
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.700
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, our last show for January,

00:24.700 --> 00:28.000
because it is January the 27th of 2008.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.700
Let's get right back into the gaming news. If you missed Part A, you missed a lot.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.700
You missed a lot of randomness, that's for sure.

00:33.700 --> 00:39.000
But now we're going to get into some Nintendo news, because we had a substantial lack of Nintendo in Part A.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.300
So let's kick it off with some Nintendo news, Loki.

00:41.300 --> 00:45.000
One of the new things we learned this week about Smash Bros. Brawl

00:45.000 --> 00:49.100
is that it will have classic game demos included with it,

00:49.100 --> 01:01.300
including demos for The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Bros., as well as Star Fox 64.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.600
That's pretty cool and all.

01:04.600 --> 01:10.600
My question is, why the fuck don't they have demos on the Virtual Console if they're all available on Brawl?

01:10.600 --> 01:16.400
Come on, if it's that easy to make demos for this stuff, then why isn't it available for the other stuff?

01:16.400 --> 01:19.100
Is it just me, or is this maybe a workaround?

01:19.100 --> 01:23.900
Because they realize that tons and tons of Wii owners are going to be buying this game.

01:23.900 --> 01:27.600
This is a AAA title of the highest kind for the Nintendo Wii.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.400
I think it's cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, but seriously though, if it's easy to implement,

01:32.400 --> 01:38.000
why aren't they doing timed demos on some of these Nintendo games and stuff?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.600
Here's the weird thing. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea, I think it's great.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.800
It gives this game even more value than it had already.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.400
God, we all knew this was going to be a powerhouse game anyway.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.800
But the only thing that makes me go, are there really that many people who haven't played these games?

01:53.800 --> 01:55.100
I don't think so.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.600
Am I just spoiled because I'm older, so I kind of grew up with 8-bit Nintendo and stuff?

01:58.600 --> 02:02.300
But are there a lot of people who have never played The Legend of Zelda?

02:02.300 --> 02:04.800
Who have never played original Mario Bros.?

02:04.800 --> 02:10.100
There may be some people though, obviously we grew up in the 80s and stuff,

02:10.100 --> 02:13.200
but there's a lot of people that have never played the original games.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.800
Alright, Chris is raising her hand, I guess that's true.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.200
I was denied video games when I was five.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.600
That's right, you said during the break though, you were denied video games when you were a child,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
so you didn't really have a lot of exposure to this.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.600
No, my parents refused to buy me anything that had to do with the video game

02:27.600 --> 02:32.400
until I was finally in high school and I got my Pokemon games.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.600
My mom used to play with me.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.400
Well, your mom was awesome, my parents were retarded.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.400
Just the different, well I mean obviously, you pretty much have two different extremes right here.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.600
You have the no video games in this house whatsoever, and then the family that plays together.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.600
I mean you literally have the two games in the spectrum here.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
Well, the family I used loosely because it was me, my mom, and my brothers,

02:50.600 --> 02:52.600
you know, we weren't the typical family unit.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
Right, well, you know.

02:53.800 --> 02:59.200
Well, it was just, it really was, my brothers ran outside and played the neighborhood

02:59.200 --> 03:01.600
and my mom was usually in my room playing my Nintendo.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.200
So I had to, I didn't get to play my Nintendo as much as my mother played it.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.800
They also mentioned that there are other demos that are hidden in there.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.800
My question is why aren't there full games kind of like Animal Crossing had?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.800
Because now there's the virtual console.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
So?

03:16.800 --> 03:21.800
Because a virtual console is a money making machine, it's free money, essentially.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.300
I shouldn't say free money, but very, very low cost money.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.800
Because, you know, obviously somebody is having to make those manuals and those kinds of things,

03:28.800 --> 03:31.800
you know, and QA the game and make sure it works in the emulator and all that stuff,

03:31.800 --> 03:34.800
but that, all things considered, is extremely low cost.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
They should have a demo for Mother 3 on there, that would be hilarious.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
Actually, that would be kind of rad.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.800
I would kind of hope they would do something like that.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.800
Like give us a game that has only been seen in Japan, I don't know.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.800
No, just a demo for it. You'll never see the full game over here, just the demo.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.800
Mother 3 came out in Europe.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.800
That's evil. Oh, that's true. True.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.800
RasteelUT has a thought. He says in chat.orangelsrader.com,

03:54.800 --> 03:59.800
he says, Loki, Nintendo doesn't have many new games, so they have to sell this stuff.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.800
Well, that's cool. I don't mind them selling this stuff,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.800
but like for some of these obscure games on a virtual console,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.800
I like to be able to try them out before I spend $5 on them.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
And, of course, there's other people that are piping up.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.800
You know, Brad from Pod Culture says, I've never played a Zelda game.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.800
And, you know, I guess, you know, and Act F says younger people maybe haven't played the games.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.800
And all very good points.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.800
Again, I guess maybe my perspective is spoiled because I really grew up on this shit.

04:23.800 --> 04:28.800
Some people were also primarily PC gamers or had like an Apple II or something.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.800
You know, I had a friend who never had a Nintendo,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
but she was the world's biggest Doom player that I knew.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
Well, that's cool. That's cool.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
All right, I guess you guys make a good point.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.800
I can admit when you guys make good points.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.800
But, I mean, like I said in the beginning, this was never a bad thing.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.800
It was just kind of, wow, that's interesting.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.800
So I guess all you guys that never got to play these games will finally get your chance.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.800
And if you like it, you can send Nintendo $5 and get the full version.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.800
Who knows, though, if there will be any Sega Master System games included in Smash Bros. Brawl.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.800
Not likely since the only Sega character in the game that we know of is Sonic.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.800
But we did get news this week that Sega Master System games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
That's right.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.800
A whole resurgence of the Sega Master System.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.800
You know, the Sega Master System never really caught on here in America quite in the same way that Nintendo did.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
It was always kind of the cultish thing.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.800
I'll tell you where it caught on. Brazil.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.800
That's true.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
And they still, you know, Genesis and all that stuff.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.800
I remember reporting on the Genesis handheld that's still big in Brazil.

05:32.800 --> 05:38.800
Dan was showing me a video file of Castle of Illusion for Master System, which looks oddly like DuckTales.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.800
Well, no matter where you live, Sega Master System games you are going to be able to get very soon.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.800
It's really funny.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
I actually, Sega popped in my mind.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.800
When I was like, I don't even know how old I was, but my uncle, I had to go stay over at his house.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.800
He's like, oh, and don't worry.

05:53.800 --> 05:59.800
It's like at my house I've got a lot of cool stuff like Sega and Sonic.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
I had no idea what the fuck that was.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.800
And then he showed it to me and my mind blew up because I didn't know what to do with it.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
It was crazy.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.800
There was this little blue thing running in circles trying to get these little dancing ring things.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.800
And my perspective on that was, Satan!

06:17.800 --> 06:19.800
And here you are on this program now.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
And here I am years later.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
Life is funny.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
It is pretty funny.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.800
Life is funny.

06:24.800 --> 06:31.800
That reminded me of that because he was so excited to tell me about that when my mom forbid me to play video games.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.800
What is this, Satan?

06:33.800 --> 06:37.800
Well, Japan will be the first country to get to indulge in the Sega Master System games.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.800
But it's almost a certainty that other countries will be soon to follow.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.800
Fist of the North Star will be the first game to come out for 600 points.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
And then, Jamie, you'll like this.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.800
Fantasy Zone will be coming out for 500 points, the original Master System version.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
That would be pretty cool.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.800
I have it.

06:52.800 --> 06:59.800
A lot of early speculation that since the Game Gear pretty much ran off the same hardware as the Master System,

06:59.800 --> 07:02.800
it's only a matter of time before Game Gear follows on the Virtual Console.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.800
That is actually true.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.800
They were the same pretty much.

07:06.800 --> 07:14.800
Which is why a lot of the games that did come out on Game Gear had Master System releases in other countries.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.800
And for the record, I have Fantasy Zone on Master System.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
Well, look for those.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.800
If you don't have Fantasy Zone, maybe you ought to check it out.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
Look for those to come to Japan in February.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.800
I'm sure other regions will only be a little ways behind.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
I mean, it's not like we're talking about the MSX here.

07:28.800 --> 07:35.800
You know, MSX is something the American and European audiences really don't know much about,

07:35.800 --> 07:38.800
because all the games on the console were all in Japanese.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
So we're probably never going to see that, unfortunately.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
But that's the system.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.800
They gave us Guardian Legend.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.800
Well, Guardic and Metal Gear, the old-school Metal Gear.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Anyhow.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
And the actual good sequel.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
Instead of the one we got over here.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.800
Snake's Revenge.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.800
But anyhow, what other Virtual Console news do we have tonight?

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
Well, this one makes me relatively happy,

08:01.800 --> 08:07.800
is that Super Street Fighter II is going to be on the Virtual Console in the UK.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.800
Over on the PAL systems.

08:10.800 --> 08:18.800
It's going to be 800 Wii points, which is £5.60 or €7.

08:18.800 --> 08:26.800
And it's Ryu Ken, Gael Blanca, Zangief, Chun-Li, Honda, Dhalsim, Wu.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.800
Most importantly, Kami.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.800
And the new challengers, yes.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.800
Kami, with her butt.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.800
Unfortunately, it wasn't Kylie Minogue at that time.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.800
But, you know, playing this can make you reminisce about Kylie Minogue.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.800
She had camo legs so you couldn't see them.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.800
Isn't that game out here in the US, Virtual Console?

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
I think it came out last week.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
Did it? Cool.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
Well, then there you go, Jamie.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.800
If you're that excited, you can go grab it in the US, too, it sounds like.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.800
But I have the original.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.800
Oh, well then, la-di-da.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.800
I'm waiting for the Xbox One, to be honest.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.800
Like, why would I go buy this old one when there's going to be the new HD one?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
That's going to be sexy.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.800
When I moved out here, this is how big of a nerd I was.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
I shipped out a whole bunch of my stuff.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.800
But in my luggage, I brought my Super Nintendo and all my games with it.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.800
And the first game that I had on the Super Nintendo that was mine

09:16.800 --> 09:21.800
was one that my boyfriend at the time bought me, which was Super Street Fighter II.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
Awesome.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.800
And I still have the box, everything.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800
That's like my game.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.800
And to this day, that remains a pretty great port.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.800
Oh yeah, it was really good.

09:29.800 --> 09:34.800
You know, Street Fighter Alpha 2 had loading in a cartridge.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.800
And I thought that was hilarious.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.800
I had Super Street Fighter II Turbo for the computer.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.800
But the thing I remember about it on the PC is it had like remixed music.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
And it was also the Red Book Audio.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.800
You could put it in any CD player.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
It was kind of cool.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
Random tidbit.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.800
So, moving on.

09:49.800 --> 09:55.800
Anyways, there's some other good news coming from Japan about the Wii.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.800
They've surpassed five million units sold.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
Of course, you know, the Wii is the number one selling system in the world.

10:03.800 --> 10:09.800
But, at least, well, the new generation of systems, it is the number one.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.800
Of course, not in the U.S., but, you know, not for long.

10:13.800 --> 10:22.800
Anyways, right now, they have sold, at least as of January 20th, five million, 19,337 units.

10:22.800 --> 10:27.800
Which is not bad, seeing that it's been out for 14 months already.

10:27.800 --> 10:33.800
In the U.S., their sales were 7.38 million as of the end of 2007.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.800
So, doing pretty good.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.800
Nice.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
Not unsurprising, but nice.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.800
I mean, we all knew Wiis were selling like crazy, no matter where you are.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
So, there you have it.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.800
One other thing that's only sure to sell more Wiis, more and more,

10:48.800 --> 10:53.800
is the release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which, of course, we were talking about a little earlier.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.800
Well, the demo kiosks are on their way to Japan.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.800
In fact, if you look on YouTube, it's already there.

10:59.800 --> 11:07.800
It was reported earlier this week that 30 shops throughout Japan were going to be getting kiosks with Super Smash Brothers Brawl on January 26th.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.800
And, of course, that was yesterday.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.800
So, some clips are already hitting YouTube.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
So, pretty awesome.

11:15.800 --> 11:22.800
So, it's only a matter of time before we find out all the secrets that the Smash Brothers dojo has yet to reveal.

11:22.800 --> 11:30.800
And I did look at some of the YouTube clips, and I have to admit, the game looks a lot like Super Smash Brothers Melee,

11:30.800 --> 11:35.800
which isn't to be surprised, but it definitely feels like it has that next level to it.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
You know what I mean?

11:36.800 --> 11:38.800
It definitely feels like the game is taken to the next level.

11:38.800 --> 11:46.800
Actually, I've been kind of seeing the Subspace Emissary, or whatever it's called.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.800
That looks really cool, as far as a side-scrolling thing.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.800
And I think Nintendo should make a game, not necessarily like Brawl,

11:53.800 --> 11:58.800
but just a side-scrolling, kind of a beat-em-up type of game with Nintendo characters.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.800
I think that would be really awesome.

12:00.800 --> 12:06.800
I can't wait to play that level that's the old-school Mario level that scrolls automatically while you're in it.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
That's awesome.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.800
The thing about this game that I think is going to make it a winner,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.800
and I realize fanboys everywhere are peeing their pants over it.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
I think it's the same reason why WarioWare.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
It's variety.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.800
Yeah.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
It is variety.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.800
The game sounds like, really, they have thought of everything.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
Variety.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.800
And that's value.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
It is.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
It really is.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
You really feel like you're getting your money's worth, I think.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.800
But then again, obviously, you have to withhold judgment until the game actually comes out.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.800
But certainly the hype, they're doing a wonderful job.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.800
Well, we'll see, right?

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
We will soon see.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.800
Well, for our friends who are fortunate enough to have a Wii right now,

12:44.800 --> 12:50.800
it's been said that Okami Wii will be out in the UK, actually, by the summer.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.800
We're getting our version over here on 25th March.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.800
But there's not a specific date stated for the UK.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.800
But it will be coming out.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.800
That's pretty cool.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.800
I'm glad to see it's making its way out, finally.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.800
And there's, you know, just real quick, I want to say about Okami real quick.

13:11.800 --> 13:17.800
I actually kind of missed it in the PS2, because when it came out, I was too busy with,

13:17.800 --> 13:20.800
ooh, Xbox, you know, I was too busy with all that,

13:20.800 --> 13:25.800
as I think a lot of the late-gen games from the PS2 were kind of like that.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.800
So I'm kind of looking forward to being able to give this a real shot on the Wii,

13:29.800 --> 13:30.800
and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.800
So I'm glad to hear it's on its way.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.800
I'd like to see what they've done for controls on it.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.800
Me too.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.800
From what I hear, it's not really changed that much from the PS2 version.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
What, no Waggle?

13:41.800 --> 13:45.800
Well, they're going to have Waggle in there, but it's pretty much a straight port.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
Don't expect anything additional to it.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
Alright, alright.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.800
I did hear there's widescreen support, though, which is pretty awesome.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
I'm sold.

13:52.800 --> 14:00.800
There's a new handheld MP4 player capable of running old-school Nintendo emulators,

14:00.800 --> 14:04.800
and it's powered by the sun, using solar power.

14:04.800 --> 14:12.800
It can also play MP3s, store ebooks, and records audio, and of course displays images,

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
all for $123.32.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.800
The cool part, though, is it also has a USB port to connect to other portable devices

14:19.800 --> 14:24.800
to share the solar energy it has collected, so you can power your other devices with it.

14:24.800 --> 14:31.800
But it's kind of funny, though, because the whole thing looks very similar to the original Game Boy Advance.

14:31.800 --> 14:38.800
So, I don't know, one of those things that you probably only see in Korea or something like that.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.800
If nothing else, though, it makes for a great headline, you know?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.800
Console powered by sun!

14:43.800 --> 14:47.800
But then how do I play late at night?

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
That's the bummer.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
What was it, that one game member?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
I have to go outside to play a game?

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
This makes no sense.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.800
There was that one game that came out on the Game Boy Advance, and I know, I can't remember the title.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
A Boktai!

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
But the problem with the original Game Boy Advance is when you play it out in the sun,

15:02.800 --> 15:07.800
you can't see it, because it's not backlit, and it made it hard to see.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.800
So, not a good plan, unfortunately.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.800
Yeah, I was not a big Boktai fan.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.800
The one that came out after that, which I can't...

15:15.800 --> 15:19.800
Oh, it was kind of like a sequel, but it was on the DS.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.800
Damn it, I can't remember, but they kind of took the sun part out of it,

15:22.800 --> 15:26.800
but it was still an element of the game, but you could just hit a button to charge it.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
Yeah, it was something that Hideo Kojima did.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
It was like a sequel.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
It was on the DS.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
I can't remember the name.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.800
I'm sure someone in chat will save me.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.800
Solar Knights, was that it?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
Probably.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.800
Anyhow, another game making its way, another port.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.800
Nintendo DS is getting a version of Guitar Hero.

15:46.800 --> 15:51.800
That's right, you're going to soon be able to play Guitar Hero on the go on the DS,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
but it might not be what you think.

15:53.800 --> 15:59.800
Activision has filed a trademark for a game called Guitar Hero on Tour,

15:59.800 --> 16:03.800
and of course some news that spilled earlier this week from a French website

16:03.800 --> 16:06.800
that Guitar Hero on Tour was on the way to Nintendo DS eventually,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.800
so who knows what this game could be.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.800
Probably a spin-off game.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.800
I would imagine there's not going to be a little guitar controller you actually plug in.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
Actually, I think there will be.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.800
Really? That's going to be weird.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
Because here's how they're going to probably do it.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.800
They're going to have an attachment that plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot,

16:21.800 --> 16:24.800
and there you go, you can have your additional buttons like that.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
I was going to assume maybe it was a tapping game,

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800
kind of like Elite Beat Agents,

16:28.800 --> 16:30.800
but you have the guitar on the lower screen or something,

16:30.800 --> 16:32.800
you can tap the beats or something, does that make sense?

16:32.800 --> 16:36.800
I guess it makes sense, but I think that they're actually going to have it where you play the guitar.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.800
The only thing I would think about, though, is if they did have it where you play the guitar like that,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.800
there's no real easy way to see the screen and play the guitar.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.800
Well, actually, no, I take that back,

16:45.800 --> 16:49.800
because you can hold it in your hand so that you look at the top screen

16:49.800 --> 16:55.800
and use your left hand to hit all the keys and stuff.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.800
It could work.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
It's a weird idea, but it could work.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.800
But if it does come out, it'll be probably selling quite a bit.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.800
Yeah, and regardless, we all know this is just a way to further milk a franchise that is prime.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
It's not quite dead yet.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
The hot thing right now, right?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800
Jamie, I know you play a lot of games on the DS.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.800
Is Guitar Hero something you'd want to play on the DS?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.800
I'd try it out, but otherwise, probably not.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.800
It would be a nice diversion for a quick moment.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.800
I have Rock Band.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.800
True, true.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.800
By the way, oh, I totally forgot to say this during my gaming week,

17:26.800 --> 17:30.800
but how could I forget, like, Thursday, you know what I did?

17:30.800 --> 17:37.800
I ran home, I powered on the Xbox, I put in Guitar Hero 3, and I downloaded me some Journey.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.800
And it was awesome.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.800
I just wanted to get that out there.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
We were listening to the demo on that.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.800
Oh, it was so hot.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
I downloaded it, I didn't care.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
I just wanted Journey.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.800
Journey in Guitar Hero makes me happy.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
Anyhow, you know what else makes me happy?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
It's hearing from you guys, our listeners.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.800
Every week, you guys send us e-mails at mailbag at orangelandrady.com,

17:55.800 --> 17:58.800
and we pull a few of our favorites to read here on air.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
Remember, if you want to be included in this segment,

18:00.800 --> 18:02.800
mailbag at orangelandrady.com.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.800
So Dark Sakura is going to reach in the mailbag and pull out a few e-mails,

18:05.800 --> 18:10.800
of which I understand there weren't a whole lot this week, but some.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.800
There were some.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.800
One of them is not going to be read because, honestly, it's worthless.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.800
Oh, snap.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.800
Because clearly if said person had been listening to the entirety of the thing,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
they wouldn't have taken it completely out of context.

18:24.800 --> 18:30.800
So therefore, addressing lucky nuts,

18:30.800 --> 18:35.800
which just instantly indicates the quality of the person listening to this,

18:35.800 --> 18:38.800
fuck you.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
And I mean that with none of the respect that you intended as well.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.800
I didn't even see this e-mail.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.800
I'm going to have to check it out.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
What was the comment about how I said I would be interested in physics

18:48.800 --> 18:49.800
if not for the math?

18:49.800 --> 18:55.800
You can be interested in a topic and not actually care to do anything with it.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.800
Fucking moron.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.800
Was it tongue-in-cheek or what?

18:59.800 --> 19:00.800
I don't think so.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.800
Interesting.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
All right, whatever.

19:02.800 --> 19:09.800
Anyway, DidYouLoseASock wrote in and sent a link to StarTropics Wii decoder.

19:09.800 --> 19:15.800
It was on YouTube because we are broadcasting, I don't know, it's 22 seconds,

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
but I'll link it in the chatroom.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.800
Apparently this is how it's supposed to work in StarTropics.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.800
Do we have more music?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.800
No, that's the end of that music.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.800
Oh.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
Sorry.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.800
But I did watch the video earlier this week.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.800
I can kind of describe it for our listeners.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
It's pretty rad.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.800
Inside the manual, you know how when you download games on Virtual Console,

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
you have the manual?

19:38.800 --> 19:41.800
Well, what's cool is that they actually included a little hyperlink

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
where it says in the story, you got a letter,

19:44.800 --> 19:47.800
and when you click on a letter, it actually brings up the original letter,

19:47.800 --> 19:52.800
the text, and then there's this little animation of the letter being dipped in water

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
and then it says code, frequency 747.

19:55.800 --> 19:56.800
So they did include it.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.800
We were kind of wondering how are they going to get the letter in there,

19:58.800 --> 19:59.800
and it is in there.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.800
You just have to dig through the manual a little bit, but the code is there.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.800
Sorry if I spoiled the code for anyone playing the game.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.800
It's pretty neat.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.800
That is pretty cool.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
I think that's very intelligently done, I should say.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.800
It was a cute way to get around it.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.800
I'll check out the video in just a sec.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.800
Also, we have an e-mail from Silver Chaos.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.800
Last week, as of when I'm writing this,

20:19.800 --> 20:21.800
you all were talking about the dusty PS3 with Ranma.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.800
Sorry if I felt it wrong.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.800
Yeah, you did, but I won't point it out.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.800
And he brought up the fact that it might have been a setup.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.800
You were all discussing who might have done it,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.800
mentioning Microsoft and Nintendo as possibilities,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
but you missed the most obvious answer,

20:35.800 --> 20:37.800
and I'm surprised no one in chat mentioned this,

20:37.800 --> 20:39.800
the makers of Dustcat 3.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.800
If you people thought that Dust is this big problem,

20:41.800 --> 20:45.800
they would rush out and purchase one to protect their beloved PS3s.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.800
Thanks for reading this in need of a new screen name, Silver Chaos.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.800
I like your screen name.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.800
I think it's kind of cool.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.800
All righty.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.800
Is this supposed to be Lucky Nuts?

20:57.800 --> 21:00.800
Lucky Nuts is clearly not all that lucky.

21:00.800 --> 21:06.800
The hate is spewing out of the mailbag this week.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
Ranma.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
They can hate on me. I can hate back.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.800
All right.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.800
I am a PMSing female, goddammit.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.800
Do we have a happy email we can read?

21:15.800 --> 21:16.800
Yes.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
Okay.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.800
Robert M., our good buddy, went to Video Games Live,

21:21.800 --> 21:23.800
so I'm going to read this.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.800
Well, I paid to see Video Games Live at Fox Theater in St. Louis

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
and enjoyed the experience.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.800
A few minor FUs presented as wishes, such as it is.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.800
One, wish the mid-balcony seats weren't high enough to obscure the top part

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
of the video screen behind the lighting structure,

21:38.800 --> 21:41.800
had I known that I would have paid more for the lower-level seating.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.800
Two, wish I had been in these lower-level seating at least

21:44.800 --> 21:47.800
to get better connections with other DS players.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.800
My attempts to start four-player Pac-Man versus matches

21:49.800 --> 21:51.800
ended in connection failures.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.800
Fun to connect with that many gamers, though.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.800
Three, I almost wish the Zelda section had featured more music

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
than the iconic overworld theme,

21:58.800 --> 22:02.800
something more along the lines of their medley of music from the Sonic games.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.800
And finally, one major FU, well, absolutely not really,

22:05.800 --> 22:09.800
ending the show with one-winged angel.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.800
Enjoyable experience overall, part of me wish it had been longer,

22:12.800 --> 22:15.800
you know, than the three hours it ran, plus pre-show and intermission.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.800
He also sent another email.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.800
Oh, just about to add one more,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
because he couldn't go to the chat room for some reason.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.800
He sent me to Square Enix for not allowing use of their video in the show.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
Yeah, that makes sense.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
Last email.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
You know why?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.800
I think it's because they have something to do.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
Don't quote me on this,

22:36.800 --> 22:39.800
but I think they have something to do with the competing show, Play,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
because Play is a derivative of Dear Friends.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.800
It's put on by the same production company.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.800
So, something to think about.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.800
And GS68 says he went to play in San Jose,

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
which I had no idea it was even going to be in San Jose

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
or I might have gone.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
That's like two hours away.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
Yeah.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.800
For a good concert, I'll drive that.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
You know what I mean?

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
Oh, yeah.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.800
I drive that far just to see one person.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.800
Hey, I drove to the San Jose HP Pavilion,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
or whatever it's called, to see the Spice Girls.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.800
Worth every dollar of gas it took me.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.800
Yeah.

23:10.800 --> 23:11.800
Alright, anyhow.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
So, anyway, he says he went to play in San Jose GS68

23:13.800 --> 23:15.800
and says there were so many people in PictoChat

23:15.800 --> 23:18.800
that people were actually using Room B.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
Wow.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.800
You don't see that.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
Anyway, sorry.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.800
Well, I remember doing PictoChat at E3 a couple years ago

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
and realized that one of the people I was talking to

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
was Melody.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
We were in the Nintendogs line.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.800
That's great.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
Yeah.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.800
Anyway, this last one says,

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
Hi, OLR.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.800
It's officially a year I've been listening to your show.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.800
You rock and keep up the good work.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.800
I listen to OLR on my iPod to keep my sanity

23:42.800 --> 23:43.800
while I do homework.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.800
And then when I run out of recent episodes to listen to,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.800
I tune into your radio station and listen to the music.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
Great job on everything.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.800
And you have taught me important lessons.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
After the band, I feel like I'm less immature.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.800
Now, is DDR dead?

23:56.800 --> 23:59.800
I don't seem to see much DDR action anymore.

23:59.800 --> 24:00.800
And when I used to play DDR,

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
I'd get people to stop and watch me play.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.800
Now, people really don't care

24:04.800 --> 24:06.800
if someone's triple A-ing Mac songs.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.800
Also, how do I deal with a kid at school

24:08.800 --> 24:09.800
who thinks I'm a nerd,

24:09.800 --> 24:11.800
yet he devoted all of his time and money

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
to do World of Warcraft?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.800
Can I use the fact he plays World of Warcraft against him

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
and was...

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
Thank you, Chris.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.800
Can you hear me?

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
She said yes.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.800
And was it a mistake using my $100 Dell gift card

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
towards buying a widescreen computer monitor

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
instead of buying an Xbox 360 with it?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
Too many questions, I know.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
This is from Sakura Max.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
I like her.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.800
Can I say this about DDR is dead?

24:35.800 --> 24:38.800
We kind of got into this in a previous episode.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.800
Let me try to phrase this best I can.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.800
No, DDR is not dead.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.800
But DDR has evolved,

24:45.800 --> 24:48.800
and it hasn't evolved in the way I think

24:48.800 --> 24:51.800
most of us hardcore fans that grew up with DDR

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
wanted it to.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
It didn't evolve for us.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.800
It evolved to where the money's at,

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
which you can't blame them for doing.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
That's what they want to do.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
But when you look at the mixes,

24:59.800 --> 25:02.800
Disney Channel, plug into your TV,

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
my first DDR.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.800
DDR is kind of geared towards 12-year-old girls

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
and their slumber parties,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.800
which, again, that's where the money's at.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.800
It's disappointing because you would think

25:12.800 --> 25:15.800
that there's two distinctly different audiences,

25:15.800 --> 25:19.800
the 12-year-old girls and the anime convention-going people

25:19.800 --> 25:23.800
that kind of helped foster DDR in the first place.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.800
You would think we would get a new mix

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
that caters to us a little bit,

25:26.800 --> 25:28.800
and I suppose you could say Supernova 2 is that,

25:28.800 --> 25:31.800
but is it really anything new?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
No.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
I always kind of said they needed to let the people

25:34.800 --> 25:36.800
responsible for the Xbox versions of DDR

25:36.800 --> 25:38.800
develop the next arcade mix

25:38.800 --> 25:41.800
because the last time we ever saw any true innovation

25:41.800 --> 25:43.800
out of DDR was all done on the Xbox versions,

25:43.800 --> 25:46.800
good and bad, but at least it was innovation.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
That's all I'm really going to say about DDR.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.800
Can I finish reading the e-mail?

25:49.800 --> 25:50.800
Sorry, yes, you may.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.800
Well, I'm going to give my...

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
Well, you know, with inflation,

25:54.800 --> 25:56.800
I guess it's $5 worth.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
Um...

25:57.800 --> 26:03.800
Are you really that incredibly amusing?

26:03.800 --> 26:05.800
Okay.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
I made Chris laugh.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.800
That was great.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.800
Remember when we threw you into the fire

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
and pretended that we were going to kill you?

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
I thought somebody was going to be reading an e-mail.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.800
Oh, yeah, okay, fine.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
Okay.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.800
Yes, you can use the fact

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
that that guy plays World of Warcraft against him,

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
and I actually...

26:21.800 --> 26:23.800
If I had an option of getting a monitor

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
or an Xbox 360 right now, I'd get a monitor,

26:25.800 --> 26:29.800
but then again, I already have an Xbox 360.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.800
So, um...

26:30.800 --> 26:33.800
And he assigns this kid who likes Toho music

26:33.800 --> 26:36.800
on OLR station MMOs and Crysis,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.800
and there's a PS on here that is addressed to Loki.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.800
Loki, if you haven't yet, go on crymod.com.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.800
It has a bunch of Crysis mods and maps.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
Download the...

26:47.800 --> 26:49.800
I guess Physis?

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
It's P-H-Y-S-I-S 3 map.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
It has random contractions

26:55.800 --> 26:59.800
that showcase the physics engines of Crysis.

26:59.800 --> 27:00.800
I'll try that.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.800
Actually, I finally got my second graphics card in

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
and running in SLI,

27:05.800 --> 27:10.800
and it's tough because overclocking one graphics card's easy.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
Overclocking two graphics cards is not easy

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
because you actually have to flash them.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.800
So, I've been playing around with that a little bit,

27:17.800 --> 27:19.800
trying to get it stable,

27:19.800 --> 27:21.800
and benchmarks now.

27:21.800 --> 27:26.800
I got 17,000-something in 3 Mark 06,

27:26.800 --> 27:29.800
which is supposedly pretty good,

27:29.800 --> 27:33.800
but I have to try Crysis yet with my cards in SLI.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.800
He offers another description for that particular mod.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
It says,

27:37.800 --> 27:41.800
You get to play bowling with a barrel with Korean soldiers as pins.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.800
I've seen videos of that. It's funny.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.800
Drop weights on a wedge to make a truck go flying, and much more.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.800
And that's the last email.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
I'll have to try it.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
Let me say a comment here from chat real quick

27:52.800 --> 27:54.800
regarding the whole DDR thing we were talking about a minute ago.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
RossdielUT says,

27:56.800 --> 27:57.800
in chat.orangetownstrator.com,

27:57.800 --> 28:00.800
Rob, there's clearly not as much money for DDR

28:00.800 --> 28:03.800
as there is for SingStar, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.800
And you know, I hate to say it,

28:05.800 --> 28:08.800
because I do love Konami and all that stuff,

28:08.800 --> 28:11.800
and they really did start a revolution, no pun intended.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
But the more I think about it,

28:13.800 --> 28:16.800
the more I really want Harmonix to do a dance game.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.800
Like, I really want them to make a dance game

28:19.800 --> 28:23.800
that would use a similar DDR mat to what we've already bought.

28:23.800 --> 28:27.800
That would make me very happy for Harmonix to develop something like that,

28:27.800 --> 28:31.800
because honestly, I think Harmonix gets American audiences

28:31.800 --> 28:34.800
in a way Konami just never did,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.800
or when they did, they were never noticed.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.800
Because I think the Xbox versions of DDR were great,

28:38.800 --> 28:44.800
but even then, it didn't ever take DDR to the next, next level.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.800
And I don't know, I think Harmonix would just kind of start from scratch.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
I mean, they would have to.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.800
And I think DDR has needed that for a while.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.800
I think there needs to be a DDR mix that starts from scratch.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
You know, say Konami will sue all you want,

28:55.800 --> 29:02.800
but if Harmonix was able to innovate guitar freaks

29:02.800 --> 29:04.800
in a way that the game feels completely different,

29:04.800 --> 29:06.800
I'm sure the same can be done for a dance game.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.800
So, I don't know if we have any people from Harmonix that listen to this program,

29:10.800 --> 29:12.800
but if we do, please be a known.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.800
I would like you to make a dance game for me, please?

29:15.800 --> 29:19.800
Or I would like, you know, I wouldn't mind if Konami would reinvent,

29:19.800 --> 29:22.800
but if Konami is going to make a new one, they need to start over from scratch.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.800
Throw out all the old code, we are starting over, mean it.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
Throw out all your old code and start again.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.800
I'm serious.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.800
Anyhow, sorry.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.800
We can get back to gaming news now.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.800
Can we?

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
Yes, sorry.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.800
Okay.

29:39.800 --> 29:47.800
Well, this is a weird bit of news, but apparently the Gizmondo is coming back.

29:47.800 --> 29:48.800
What?

29:48.800 --> 29:55.800
Yes, apparently they had a Gizmondo teaser site stating that the legend is reborn

29:55.800 --> 30:02.800
and exciting physic worlds and some other stuff,

30:02.800 --> 30:08.800
but apparently it will be back according to, at least in some form,

30:08.800 --> 30:11.800
Plextech technical director, Ian Murphy,

30:11.800 --> 30:15.800
insists that the product has been recovered from liquidators

30:15.800 --> 30:22.800
and Plextech is bringing it back to the market.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
Okay.

30:23.800 --> 30:29.800
Now, some folks are asking in chat, wasn't this then retracted a little later?

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
Was this story ended up being retracted?

30:31.800 --> 30:33.800
It might have been, I don't know.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
I'm not sure if it's been retracted or not.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.800
At least this article didn't really say that,

30:38.800 --> 30:46.800
but he basically said that the device's second coming is happening as soon as May 2008.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
But, I don't know.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
To be honest, if it was retracted, great,

30:50.800 --> 30:53.800
because I don't think it was too good to begin with.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.800
All right.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.800
Well, this is not being retracted, and actually I think this is kind of cool.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.800
I did not realize this franchise was set to make a comeback.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
It's a game called Populous.

31:03.800 --> 31:04.800
I don't know if you guys ever played this.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.800
I remember that.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.800
Yeah, it was on Super Nintendo, but it was more of a computer game.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.800
I think it's more best remembered as a computer game.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.800
Well, it's going to have a resurgence on the DS,

31:12.800 --> 31:14.800
and Electronic Arts is bringing Populous out for the DS.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.800
But here's what's really cool.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.800
One thing about Populous was that basically the game had,

31:19.800 --> 31:21.800
I would call it different skins.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.800
There were many different skins the game had,

31:23.800 --> 31:27.800
and you would build these cities that were human cities or Martian cities,

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
or it was more like, I shouldn't say human cities.

31:29.800 --> 31:33.800
It was like a medieval city or a new age city or what have you.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.800
But this is really cool, and the DS version of Populous,

31:36.800 --> 31:38.800
a new type of skin is going to be added.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.800
It's a Nintendo civilization.

31:40.800 --> 31:41.800
That's right.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.800
The small cities start off as a little Game & Watch system.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.800
Then they grow into NESs.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
Then they grow into Game Boys,

31:48.800 --> 31:52.800
which grow into Super Nintendos and DSs and so on,

31:52.800 --> 31:56.800
until the Supreme Nintendo Wii won.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.800
However, I would like to point out,

31:57.800 --> 32:01.800
I noticed a distinct lack of Virtual Boy in the civilization.

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
What's up with that?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.800
Are you just trying to pretend it never existed?

32:04.800 --> 32:05.800
Maybe.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.800
I was going to say that as far as the Gizmondo story,

32:08.800 --> 32:11.800
the story was retracted at one time,

32:11.800 --> 32:14.800
then the retraction was retracted, so it is coming.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
What?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.800
What does that even mean, the retraction was retracted?

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
The first retraction was a mistake.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.800
Make up your goddamn mind.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.800
No, the first retraction was a mistake.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.800
It is actually coming.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.800
Scary enough.

32:25.800 --> 32:30.800
DM ends in chat and trying to make a joke about OLRs

32:30.800 --> 32:33.800
that you can evolve your crappy guys on a show to a Sunday show,

32:33.800 --> 32:34.800
like there should be an OLR skin.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.800
Actually, I think that's kind of a cool idea,

32:36.800 --> 32:38.800
not so much what you're suggesting,

32:38.800 --> 32:41.800
but a version of Populous where you can make your own skins.

32:41.800 --> 32:42.800
That would be kind of fun.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.800
A little silly, but fun.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.800
I am definitely looking forward to Populous DS.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.800
That will be a good chance to revisit a series I haven't played in a long time.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.800
Well, I'm glad you'll have that opportunity.

32:55.800 --> 32:59.800
For people who like games on their iPod,

32:59.800 --> 33:03.800
Pole Position is coming out to iPod.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.800
So Namco is releasing Pole Position Remix.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.800
It's available through iTunes.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.800
And you drive with the iPod wheel.

33:12.800 --> 33:17.800
So I hope that it comes out okay,

33:17.800 --> 33:20.800
but they're actually saying that it's the worst of all iPod games that are available now.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
Don't.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.800
But another reviewer said that it's the best one out.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.800
It's five bucks.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
If you've got five bucks, you know,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.800
and don't have to spend it on kitty litter, give it a try.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.800
Or worse, or better.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.800
You know, it makes sense though,

33:35.800 --> 33:37.800
a driving game with the iPod wheel.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.800
I mean, it is kind of a logical step,

33:40.800 --> 33:42.800
so I would think it would be okay.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.800
But then again, Pole Position is a little bit,

33:45.800 --> 33:47.800
I don't know, old?

33:47.800 --> 33:50.800
Pole Position is definitely one of those games

33:50.800 --> 33:54.800
that was way cooler when you were playing it at Chuck E. Cheese when you were six, right?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.800
Like, you go back and play it now, you're like...

33:56.800 --> 33:58.800
I had a Pole Position cabinet in my house for a long time.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.800
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.800
It had a name in it, and we had, actually, Dan found an identical one.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.800
That's right, you had a stand-up cabinet for Pole Position.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.800
We had a stand-up cabinet.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.800
I remember Chuck E. Cheese, they had the sit in the thing Pole Position.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.800
Oh, those were great!

34:10.800 --> 34:12.800
Those were awesome, but like, it was better when you were six.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
Remember Hard Drivin'?

34:14.800 --> 34:15.800
That sucked.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.800
Hard Drivin', no.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.800
Hard Drivin' was good because I worked at a Namco arcade

34:18.800 --> 34:20.800
when I was out of high school,

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
and one day I was there and we had no customers

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
and I'd been up all night and I took a nap and won.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.800
There was a...

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
They were dark.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
There was a game that was on the PC that was very similar to Hard Drivin'.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.800
It was called Stunts, and you made your own stunt tracks,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.800
but the graphics were pretty much the same as Hard Drivin'.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.800
It was great, though, because if you made a bunch of little 45-degree ramps...

34:37.800 --> 34:39.800
There was stunt drivin', too.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.800
Yeah, it was similar to that, but if you made a bunch of 45-degree ramps

34:43.800 --> 34:48.800
and just drove on it really fast, your car would get up to like 500 miles an hour

34:48.800 --> 34:50.800
and it would fly into the air like a tornado.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.800
It was awesome.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.800
If you think about it, games like Burnout,

34:54.800 --> 34:57.800
you can trace their roots back to Hard Drivin'.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.800
I remember playing Test Drive 3 on the PC with the really crappy graphics.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.800
Hey, screw you, I had Test Drive on the Commodore 64.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.800
Well, this might as well have been on the Commodore 64

35:07.800 --> 35:10.800
because the graphics were crap, but it was fun.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.800
I used to drive and run over chickens in that.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.800
Hey, when I was eight, Test Drive had like the best graphics ever.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.800
What are you talking about?

35:17.800 --> 35:24.800
Well, this game may not be as good of an idea

35:24.800 --> 35:29.800
as, say, you know, Pole Position on the iPod,

35:29.800 --> 35:34.800
but there is a fan made, and I don't even know where this came from

35:34.800 --> 35:36.800
because I think it was a joke at one time,

35:36.800 --> 35:39.800
or they had a demo for it a while back,

35:39.800 --> 35:44.800
but it's Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.

35:44.800 --> 35:50.800
It's a fan made game made with RPG Maker,

35:50.800 --> 35:57.800
and it basically tells an epic story of post-Cyberpocalypse,

35:57.800 --> 36:02.800
Neo-New York, in the wake of the great b-ball purge of 2041

36:02.800 --> 36:07.800
that threatens to own the entirety of your existence for some time.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.800
Well, they actually have a bunch of weird stuff in there.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
It's cool, though.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.800
It's basically an RPG, and you have like your basketball moves you do

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
and little mini games and stuff.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.800
It is free to download, and free is the magic word, of course.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.800
Free is a good price for this story,

36:23.800 --> 36:27.800
and if you're interested, there's...

36:27.800 --> 36:29.800
I'm sure you can find it out there.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
There are a bunch of different links and stuff hosting it.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.800
The website that actually has the info is from a gaming forum.

36:36.800 --> 36:41.800
It looks like gamingw.net, and just check their forums.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.800
They've got the full game from Tales of Games Studios.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.800
It presents Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.800
Wow.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.800
Okay, well if you want to play a real RPG,

36:53.800 --> 36:56.800
might I suggest World of Warcraft?

36:56.800 --> 36:59.800
Obviously, there's going to be people who want to argue with me on that point,

36:59.800 --> 37:01.800
but you can argue this.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.800
There's definitely a shitload of people playing World of Warcraft.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.800
You want to know how much is a shitload?

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
It's 10 million.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.800
That's right, it's been announced this week

37:08.800 --> 37:11.800
that World of Warcraft now has 10 million subscribers.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.800
Now, they're counting people who are still in their free trials and stuff,

37:15.800 --> 37:19.800
but whatever, there's 10 million people playing World of Warcraft right now.

37:19.800 --> 37:23.800
To put that in perspective, and a lot of sites have been putting it this way,

37:23.800 --> 37:26.800
that's half the size of Australia,

37:26.800 --> 37:29.800
because Australia's population is like 20 million.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.800
Now, granted, you have to think about Australia is mostly desert in the middle,

37:33.800 --> 37:35.800
in the outback.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.800
Most of the people kind of live on the coast, but whatever.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.800
It's still a pretty staggering number there.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.800
Chris, I know you missed that.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.800
10 million subscribers in World of Warcraft announced this week.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.800
That's a lot.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.800
That's not surprising.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.800
And they all live in China, which is amazing.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Actually, no, that's no joke.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.800
Actually, there are 5.5 million of those.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.800
Over half of those subscribers are in Asia.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.800
So not just China, but the Asian region.

38:00.800 --> 38:05.800
2.5 here in North America and 2 million subscribers in Europe.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.800
That's pretty impressive.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.800
Yeah, well, some of those people from North America are kind of-

38:08.800 --> 38:09.800
Wait, I'm sorry, Chris. And a mic? What?

38:09.800 --> 38:11.800
Oh, never mind. I didn't see you.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.800
I didn't see you. Stole one.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.800
Yeah, I stole it.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.800
Some of those people in America are not that bright.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.800
Like, I surf the forums.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.800
I'm not active on the forums because I just can't deal with it.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.800
Oh, yeah. World of Warcraft forums, home of some serious lulz.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.800
Yeah.

38:28.800 --> 38:29.800
Serious lulz.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.800
Best one today.

38:30.800 --> 38:38.800
Server crash was deliberate hack by horde.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.800
Oh, noes. The horde crashed by server.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.800
And the funny thing is this wasn't a joke.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.800
This chick at- or it could be a guy. I don't know.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.800
This person actually-

38:46.800 --> 38:48.800
Wait, is it a blood elf female?

38:48.800 --> 38:49.800
Yes.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
It's a guy.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.800
Okay. This person- it's a level 7, too.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.800
This person actually, like, was damn serious and everyone was, like, going,

38:56.800 --> 39:00.800
oh, lulz broke the internet. What is it? The horde insert-

39:00.800 --> 39:04.800
kills you and your internet. That's right. Your internet is under attack.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.800
You know, so everyone- this person's, like, sitting there defending himself.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.800
It's, like, no, no, no, I'm serious.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.800
And, you know, they've got a reason for it, but it's just, like,

39:12.800 --> 39:16.800
the horde is not after your fucking server.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.800
ColorOfSakura says in chat.orensonsradio.com,

39:19.800 --> 39:23.800
WoWForums is like the Gaia of gaming forums.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.800
Oh, God, I know.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.800
I have never seen it so, like, plainly put, but that is a very good point.

39:28.800 --> 39:34.800
Alright, let's move on from the internet lulz to something a little more newsworthy.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.800
Well, for-

39:38.800 --> 39:44.800
It says for PlayStation 2 release in March, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters

39:44.800 --> 39:50.800
will be coming from PSP to the PS2.

39:50.800 --> 39:56.800
And also mentioned is-

39:56.800 --> 40:01.800
Well, I'm trying to- I thought there was another game mentioned in this.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.800
Is it not loading?

40:04.800 --> 40:09.800
Well, given that it's, you know, completely crashed my browser before.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.800
Don't-

40:12.800 --> 40:15.800
Well, Silent Hill Origins is the other game.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.800
Well, yeah, Silent Hill Origins. Well, we had already talked about that.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.800
It wasn't particularly mentioned here.

40:22.800 --> 40:27.800
But basically Ratchet and Clank Size Matters was officially announced on Sony's site.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.800
So what basically- both these games that, like, everybody kinda knew was coming,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.800
but like nobody wanted to announce, finally they're like,

40:35.800 --> 40:39.800
oh yeah, since the entire internet found out, you know, the horde ruined it for everybody,

40:39.800 --> 40:42.800
these games are coming up.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.800
Surprise, I'm sure you're shocked.

40:44.800 --> 40:49.800
I don't know about you, Jamie, but I'm actually excited about Silent Hill Zero on the PlayStation 2.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
Well, hell yeah.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.800
Because, like, Silent Hill wasn't really a game I wanted to play on the PSP, you know what I mean?

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Yeah.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.800
Like, I was actually thinking of getting a light just so I could hook it up to the TV.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.800
Because Silent Hill's a scary game, you know, the little screen's not that scary.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
I like scary.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800
I like scary too.

41:02.800 --> 41:08.800
I like the kind of scary that fucks with your head.

41:08.800 --> 41:13.800
Well, if Silent Hill isn't your cup of tea, then maybe some old Sega arcade games are.

41:13.800 --> 41:18.800
Apparently the Niomi BIOS has been cracked and now will be...

41:18.800 --> 41:19.800
Finally?

41:19.800 --> 41:20.800
Yeah, finally.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.800
Ah, that means Planet Harrier.

41:23.800 --> 41:30.800
Now that means that this brand new emulator, well actually it's an emulator for the Dreamcast,

41:30.800 --> 41:39.800
will be able to run wonderful games such as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Ferrari, F355 Challenge, and Ikaruga.

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
Planet Harrier.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.800
Also known as the good stuff.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
Planet Harrier.

41:43.800 --> 41:48.800
Yes, so the Niomi games are going to be coming soon.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.800
Awesome.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.800
More news as soon as we get some.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.800
Nice.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.800
Well, I want to go back to World of Warcraft for a minute, but not to talk about some internet

41:57.800 --> 41:58.800
lols.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.800
I actually want to talk about something kind of a little bit sad.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.800
It has to do with a Virginia Tech student.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.800
This is not related to the tragedy that happened last year, but it was just another unfortunate

42:07.800 --> 42:08.800
tragedy.

42:08.800 --> 42:13.800
There was a student there, a 21 year old senior named Daniel Kim who actually killed himself

42:13.800 --> 42:15.800
in a target parking lot in Virginia.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.800
And of course, what was the first thing that was blamed in the death?

42:19.800 --> 42:20.800
Gaming.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.800
Video games.

42:21.800 --> 42:22.800
It was the Horde!

42:22.800 --> 42:23.800
Individuals...

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
Not okay.

42:25.800 --> 42:29.800
Individuals were automatically making assumptions about his death.

42:29.800 --> 42:34.800
But this writer here at Filefront.com who ran this article did a little research and

42:34.800 --> 42:40.800
found out that actually one of the things that this person really liked and enjoyed

42:40.800 --> 42:42.800
in life was World of Warcraft.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.800
He developed a lot of friendships in the game over the past couple years.

42:46.800 --> 42:51.800
In fact, the only warning signs that he was thinking of doing this were coming from World

42:51.800 --> 42:53.800
of Warcraft.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.800
The players that played with him in World of Warcraft were sending emails to university

42:57.800 --> 43:02.800
telling them about warning signs, but little action was taken by the university because

43:02.800 --> 43:03.800
of the warning signs.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.800
And unfortunately, it came to this.

43:05.800 --> 43:12.800
So, next time you want to bash video games, think about the community and the friendships

43:12.800 --> 43:14.800
that people build throughout the video game community.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.800
You know what I mean?

43:15.800 --> 43:19.800
Well, how else is the university going to take an email that says the Horde is going

43:19.800 --> 43:23.800
to kill Billy or whatever his name is?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.800
I'm sorry, Loki, I can't laugh at that.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.800
It's just very unfortunate, the whole thing.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.800
But it makes me angry that people always jump to these conclusions.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.800
And of course, you know, you save Virginia Tech, you think about that horrible, horrible

43:36.800 --> 43:38.800
tragedy that happened there last year.

43:38.800 --> 43:43.800
And who is the very first guy to come out and start blaming video games?

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
Lord Voldemort.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.800
And if you've listened to this show enough, you know who I'm referencing.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
Lord Voldemort comes right out and blames the video games.

43:50.800 --> 43:55.800
Turns out, guy never played, he didn't own a single video game thing.

43:55.800 --> 44:01.800
There were mental problems that went beyond anything entertainment based.

44:01.800 --> 44:04.800
So it just, it pisses me off that people jump to these conclusions.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.800
Okay, he's a lawyer, he can say whatever he wants.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.800
Oh, well, you know what?

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
No repercussions.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.800
No, there is repercussions because there's angry people like us that get on the internet

44:12.800 --> 44:13.800
and yell at them.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.800
I know, serious stuff, right?

44:15.800 --> 44:19.800
Regardless, this kind of stuff makes me very angsty when I hear people jumping to conclusions

44:19.800 --> 44:22.800
about the video games made me do it or whatever.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.800
So what better time for us to bring on the FUs of the week?

44:25.800 --> 44:51.800
My FU of the week goes to my finger because it's been catching a lot more lately and I'm

44:51.800 --> 44:56.800
going to have to go to the doctor next week and it's also starting in my index finger

44:56.800 --> 44:57.800
now.

44:57.800 --> 45:01.800
So it's looking like I'm going to have to have surgery on my hand.

45:01.800 --> 45:05.800
But maybe I'll get disability and not have to go to work.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.800
The thing is if I had that much time off of work, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.

45:09.800 --> 45:14.800
And if I couldn't use my hand, I really wouldn't know what to do.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.800
I would be so bored.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.800
And that, and I haven't been able to draw anything in like three weeks.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.800
It's been really a pain in the butt.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.800
So whatever you do, don't let the evil get into your hand.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.800
Otherwise you're going to have to chop it off with a chainsaw.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
That's right.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.800
But then I can have a shotgun hand.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.800
That is the plus.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.800
Wow.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
I can replace it with a machine gun hand.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.800
You know, I thought the Wonder shows and stuff was bad, but you guys are...

45:37.800 --> 45:39.800
This is not Boomstick.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.800
You guys are taking it to a whole new level.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.800
Some folks in chat are giving you the finger, but only so you can type.

45:46.800 --> 45:47.800
Thank you.

45:47.800 --> 45:48.800
All right.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.800
Moving on, Loki.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.800
Effie to another one of my 360s crapping out.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.800
Luckily, though, I found out there is another way to fix it,

45:56.800 --> 46:00.800
which involves heating up the motherboard with either a heat gun,

46:00.800 --> 46:03.800
or in this case, since I don't own a heat gun, a blow dryer,

46:03.800 --> 46:06.800
until it gets really hot and then hopefully fixes everything.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.800
That's about as effective as, I don't know,

46:09.800 --> 46:12.800
throwing your console at a wall and hopefully fixing it that way.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.800
But I'm going to give it a shot because, hey, what's the worst that can happen?

46:15.800 --> 46:17.800
It's already broken.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.800
Wow.

46:19.800 --> 46:20.800
All right.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.800
I'm knocking on wood.

46:23.800 --> 46:24.800
My turn?

46:24.800 --> 46:25.800
Yes.

46:25.800 --> 46:31.800
My FU of the week goes to this A&W float, which I saw at the grocery store.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.800
Who doesn't like root beer floats, right?

46:32.800 --> 46:33.800
I do.

46:33.800 --> 46:34.800
I love root beer floats.

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
Exactly.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
But have you tried this?

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
No.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.800
It's shit.

46:38.800 --> 46:39.800
I think there's a little bit.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.800
You want to try some of this?

46:40.800 --> 46:41.800
No.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.800
Here, try it.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
Try it on there.

46:43.800 --> 46:46.800
I don't like it.

46:46.800 --> 46:47.800
That's not bad.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.800
The first taste to me was good and the second one to me was blah.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.800
FU to all y'all.

46:51.800 --> 46:52.800
You don't know what you're talking about.

46:52.800 --> 46:53.800
It's too sweet.

46:53.800 --> 46:54.800
It is a little sweet.

46:54.800 --> 46:58.800
It's missing that nice contrast between root beer and ice cream.

46:58.800 --> 47:03.800
It's like what happens when you put too much ice cream and root beer together and it melts

47:03.800 --> 47:05.800
and it's flat.

47:05.800 --> 47:10.800
FU to A&W for this thing that is no substitute for the real thing.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.800
And FU to you guys for disagreeing with me.

47:12.800 --> 47:16.800
How hard is it seriously to make a root beer float?

47:16.800 --> 47:17.800
I mean, come on.

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
Well, I do.

47:18.800 --> 47:19.800
No, they should have.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.800
The concept of it all being in one bottle is interesting.

47:22.800 --> 47:23.800
You know what?

47:23.800 --> 47:24.800
I wonder if this would work.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.800
Root beer with the vanilla Dippin' Dots dropped in there.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.800
I can say at the store they not only have the A&W float, but they have Sunkist floats

47:32.800 --> 47:33.800
too.

47:33.800 --> 47:34.800
But I don't think I'll be trying those.

47:34.800 --> 47:35.800
I don't think I'll be trying those.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.800
Well, like orange cream soda is actually really good.

47:36.800 --> 47:37.800
Those are bad.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.800
I feel like a creamsicle.

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
Sane Delight floats?

47:41.800 --> 47:43.800
No, Sane Delight would be nasty.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.800
No, that wouldn't work.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.800
All right.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.800
Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you want to give out?

47:48.800 --> 47:52.800
Yeah, I'd FU to my dad's girlfriend.

47:52.800 --> 47:58.800
The woman's driving me absolutely fucking nuts because she's, well, you know, I've been

47:58.800 --> 48:03.800
saying on air all night, she's a new mom and she's hormonal and I get that.

48:03.800 --> 48:08.800
But keep the baby away from things that are going to kill her.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.800
Like, for instance, baby 101.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.800
For those of you who do not have children, I would assume that all of you are intelligent

48:15.800 --> 48:19.800
to know that blankets are a potential hazard.

48:19.800 --> 48:25.800
Like, you put the baby in baby blankets, but you keep it so that they're not, you know,

48:25.800 --> 48:27.800
in the way of the face.

48:27.800 --> 48:28.800
What does she do?

48:28.800 --> 48:32.800
She puts the baby on their bed and puts a comforter over it.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
Like a down comforter.

48:33.800 --> 48:37.800
No, she's not going to roll over and like suffocate herself.

48:37.800 --> 48:41.800
It's just like, give me the child and get away.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.800
But it's not mine, so I have to like hold my tongue.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.800
It's a learning experience for everyone.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.800
She's going to kill her, I swear to God.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.800
I'm not going to have a sister when I get back.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.800
She's driving me nuts.

48:53.800 --> 48:57.800
You know, just like I get, you're a new mom, I get that.

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
Everyone makes mistakes.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.800
But you're making like 101 mistakes.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.800
You should have learned.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.800
You've met your quota.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.800
You've met your quota of mistakes, right?

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
Yeah, no, it's like you're allowed to make mistakes,

49:07.800 --> 49:10.800
but you're not allowed to make mistakes that are this big.

49:10.800 --> 49:15.800
This is like stuff you should have learned when you learned you were pregnant.

49:15.800 --> 49:16.800
You know?

49:16.800 --> 49:19.800
And those baby wipes, they're supposed to be cold as fuck.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
Well, I hope things get better.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.800
Sorry to hear about the discomfort there.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.800
Anything else?

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
No, I'm good.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.800
Well, FU to you for leaving us.

49:30.800 --> 49:31.800
I'm sorry.

49:31.800 --> 49:32.800
I'm just kidding.

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
You know I love you.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.800
I can't say FU to you.

49:34.800 --> 49:35.800
All right.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
Well, you would, but it would be kinky.

49:37.800 --> 49:38.800
Hot.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.800
All right, we just have a couple more gaming stories,

49:40.800 --> 49:43.800
and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your phone calls

49:43.800 --> 49:48.800
at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.800
But first, some more gaming news.

49:50.800 --> 49:51.800
Yes, Jamie?

49:51.800 --> 49:54.800
Choo, choo, choo.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.800
I couldn't pass that up.

49:56.800 --> 50:01.800
There's a rumor that Space Channel 5 is coming to Wii and other systems.

50:01.800 --> 50:04.800
I mean, we're getting Nights in Samba de Amigo,

50:04.800 --> 50:11.800
so there was a mention saying that there was going to be Space Channel 5.0

50:11.800 --> 50:15.800
that was reported on Japanese news site The Magic Box.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.800
Sega denied it on IGN, but you know what?

50:19.800 --> 50:23.800
It could happen because they've done this before.

50:23.800 --> 50:28.800
And it was even stated by Mizuguchi that he'd be interested in bringing it

50:28.800 --> 50:34.800
as a downloadable game like a Res HD is.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.800
That would be cool if they made a new game.

50:37.800 --> 50:43.800
From what I heard, were they licensing some of the old Michael Jackson music?

50:43.800 --> 50:47.800
I think so, because I know that in the second Space Channel 5,

50:47.800 --> 50:52.800
the dances were in there in one of the dance battle ones.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.800
Good stuff.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.800
Well, I've got some last minute stories here real quick,

50:57.800 --> 51:01.800
and then after that we'll be taking some calls on the Skype line.

51:01.800 --> 51:05.800
First, of course, who doesn't like a good drinking game?

51:05.800 --> 51:09.800
Well, apparently Sexy Video Game Land's blog

51:09.800 --> 51:11.800
has come up with a few different drinking games,

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
one of which is for Metal Gear Solid,

51:14.800 --> 51:18.800
and it requires a bunch of different concoctions to make up,

51:18.800 --> 51:23.800
including, I guess, American beer, a bottle of Russian vodka,

51:23.800 --> 51:27.800
a six-pack of Red Bull, and some other stuff.

51:27.800 --> 51:32.800
Oh, coarse salt, lemon lime juice, and yeah.

51:32.800 --> 51:35.800
Anyways, real quickly I'll just go over some of these.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.800
When you trigger alert, drink Red Bull.

51:39.800 --> 51:44.800
When an enemy shows inappropriate sexual attraction to Snake,

51:44.800 --> 51:48.800
you take a vodka shot.

51:48.800 --> 51:52.800
And let's see here, whenever your commander reminds you via the codec

51:52.800 --> 51:56.800
that you're on a stealth slash sneaking mission,

51:56.800 --> 51:59.800
that's when you take a beer shot.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.800
That's kind of complicated,

52:00.800 --> 52:02.800
and they have a big long list of stuff that you do,

52:02.800 --> 52:04.800
so you probably can get pretty wasted from that.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.800
Other drinking games that they had available, though.

52:08.800 --> 52:15.800
One was for Final Fantasy X2, or X2, my mistake.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.800
Anyways, this one's a lot simpler.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.800
Basically, four different things to take a shot to.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.800
Every time you see YRP, you take a shot.

52:25.800 --> 52:30.800
Every time you see a clumsy-framed Yuna fanservice upskirt, take a shot.

52:30.800 --> 52:36.800
And whenever you notice, or re-notice LeBlanc's impossible simultaneous

52:36.800 --> 52:40.800
side and under-boob dress setup, take a shot.

52:40.800 --> 52:44.800
What's the idea, to get drunk in like five seconds?

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
I don't know.

52:45.800 --> 52:51.800
Whenever a brother's antics become completely insufferable, take a shot.

52:51.800 --> 52:55.800
I'd like to see the OLR drinking game, I bet it's hilarious.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.800
I'm sure they've got one.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.800
Some other stuff real quick, of course.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
The Skype line's open, by the way.

53:02.800 --> 53:06.800
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

53:06.800 --> 53:11.800
There's some screenshots showing a car in No More Heroes,

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
and apparently it has a New Jersey played on it,

53:13.800 --> 53:18.800
and you're thinking, hey, Santa Destroy's in New Jersey.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.800
One cool thing, if you haven't played it yet,

53:20.800 --> 53:22.800
I was playing a little bit during break, Potapon,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.800
the demo is available in the US,

53:24.800 --> 53:27.800
and one of the cool things about playing the demo

53:27.800 --> 53:32.800
is it will unlock an exclusive weapon when you buy the full game.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.800
If you buy the full game, I guess.

53:34.800 --> 53:39.800
By the way, when I said the whole OLR drinking game,

53:39.800 --> 53:43.800
SSA-100-MAT and act deaf like in unison said, OLR drinking game,

53:43.800 --> 53:47.800
every time Loki says, anyway, you take a shot.

53:47.800 --> 53:48.800
Love it.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.800
All right, let's go to the phones real quick.

53:50.800 --> 53:51.800
I'll let Loki finish the stories in a little bit,

53:51.800 --> 53:53.800
but we want to hear from you guys.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.800
Who's this?

53:56.800 --> 53:57.800
GS68.

53:57.800 --> 53:58.800
Hello, GS68.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.800
What's on your mind, buddy?

54:00.800 --> 54:02.800
Well, I've been playing Super Metroid lately,

54:02.800 --> 54:07.800
and several weeks ago I decided to try Metroid Prime 3.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.800
Oh, crap, I can't solve.

54:09.800 --> 54:12.800
You were playing Metroid Prime 3, uh-huh.

54:12.800 --> 54:16.800
Yeah, and, like, I found it pretty disorienting,

54:16.800 --> 54:20.800
and at some point I got stuck,

54:20.800 --> 54:22.800
and I started going around in circles and getting dizzy,

54:22.800 --> 54:28.800
and that's when I just realized that I'm not for first-person games,

54:28.800 --> 54:31.800
and I'm not a big fan of 3D games.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.800
I will admit, GS68, that's a lot of the problems I've had with 3D games.

54:35.800 --> 54:39.800
It was very hard for me to move from the old-school two-dimensional

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
Super Nintendo games to, you know,

54:41.800 --> 54:43.800
when we got into PlayStation and PlayStation 2,

54:43.800 --> 54:46.800
and now, you know, where we're at with Wii and everything else,

54:46.800 --> 54:49.800
it was very hard to kind of make that transition into the first-person games.

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
I'm kind of the same way.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.800
I always conceptualized Metroid in a 2D space,

54:53.800 --> 54:56.800
so to take Metroid to a 3D space is tough,

54:56.800 --> 54:58.800
because you really have to, you know,

54:58.800 --> 55:01.800
when you've played 2D games for a long time,

55:01.800 --> 55:03.800
to then suddenly have to conceptualize things in 3D

55:03.800 --> 55:05.800
takes some getting used to.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.800
It really does, and I think a lot of people don't give some of us enough credit.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.800
I partially blame it for why I suck so bad at Halo.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.800
I'm always getting lost, just because I don't know.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.800
I don't know what it is.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.800
I'd like to think I'm not stupid or anything.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.800
I don't think I am.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.800
I just am not used to gaming in a 3D space for a long time.

55:20.800 --> 55:25.800
Well, actually, I just started playing Super Metroid over summer,

55:25.800 --> 55:32.800
and I think it's more with me and first-person shooters.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.800
I mean, on caper, I mean, the first-person shooter on the Wii sounds really cool,

55:36.800 --> 55:39.800
but when I try it, I get dizzy.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.800
You know, maybe you're just...

55:41.800 --> 55:43.800
You might have a little bit of the motion sickness, too.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.800
You've got to make sure you look away once in a while and all that stuff.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.800
I mean, certainly.

55:47.800 --> 55:51.800
I know Dark Sakura's talked about that she doesn't like to play a whole lot of first-person shooters,

55:51.800 --> 55:57.800
because she, you know, on a big old TV can make you feel a little nauseous, right?

55:57.800 --> 55:58.800
Yeah.

55:58.800 --> 56:03.800
So mostly it's probably, I'm assuming, and Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,

56:03.800 --> 56:07.800
I'm assuming it's kind of a lot of the same triggers that make people motion sick in cars

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
come into play in video games.

56:09.800 --> 56:10.800
I think so.

56:10.800 --> 56:15.800
Because it's like, you know, that whole thing where like if you're sitting in the back of a car around a whiny road...

56:15.800 --> 56:16.800
Anyway, go ahead.

56:16.800 --> 56:17.800
Sorry.

56:17.800 --> 56:25.800
Yeah, there was like this cutscene in Final Fantasy VII where Cloud says never to read while at a car or truck,

56:25.800 --> 56:28.800
which I thought was interesting.

56:28.800 --> 56:32.800
Well, it's interesting you bring up Final Fantasy VII, because remember that was a big shock when it came out,

56:32.800 --> 56:36.800
because it was like, OMG, it's taking a 2D game and putting it in 3D space.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.800
But it was kind of different.

56:37.800 --> 56:43.800
Like Final Fantasy VII still felt pretty 2D to me, just with a 3D twist to it.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.800
It was like two and a half dimensions, if that makes sense.

56:46.800 --> 56:53.800
I think the point is like, overall, I guess I'm just more into side scores and first-person shooters.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
And I think that's okay.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.800
I think people are into whatever they're into.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.800
So there's no particular type of game you have to like.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.800
All right, GS68, any other final thoughts for our listeners before we keep moving on?

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Um, no.

57:03.800 --> 57:04.800
All right.

57:04.800 --> 57:05.800
Well, thank you for your input tonight.

57:05.800 --> 57:06.800
And I hope...

57:06.800 --> 57:09.800
Metroid Prime 3 is a great game once you can kind of get used to the first-person-ness.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.800
So I hope the sickness doesn't bog you down.

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
Give it another go.

57:12.800 --> 57:13.800
I think you'll find this a lot of fun.

57:13.800 --> 57:14.800
Good luck.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.800
Forgive it.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.800
I'll try sometime in the future.

57:17.800 --> 57:18.800
Please do.

57:18.800 --> 57:19.800
Take care.

57:19.800 --> 57:20.800
You know, even...

57:20.800 --> 57:21.800
Here's the weird thing.

57:21.800 --> 57:24.800
I'm not a big fan of the first-person games.

57:24.800 --> 57:25.800
Like, I frickin' love Oblivion.

57:25.800 --> 57:26.800
Love it.

57:26.800 --> 57:27.800
It's...

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
I don't know.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
Like, I don't have a problem with it.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.800
It's all about punching the animals.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
I guess so.

57:31.800 --> 57:32.800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
Who's this?

57:33.800 --> 57:34.800
Yeah, what's up?

57:34.800 --> 57:35.800
This is RossdielUT.

57:35.800 --> 57:36.800
Hello, RossdielUT, my friend.

57:36.800 --> 57:37.800
Hi.

57:37.800 --> 57:38.800
What is on your mind?

57:38.800 --> 57:39.800
Well, a few things.

57:39.800 --> 57:46.800
First off, you're talking about the whole idea of conceptualizing 3D games when you've

57:46.800 --> 57:50.800
been used to the 2D games just now.

57:50.800 --> 57:59.800
I think what's helped with the PS2 and the PS3, maybe late in the PS1 and the 64, but

57:59.800 --> 58:07.800
especially in the PS2 and PS3, you have environments that are more detailed to where you can associate

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
landmarks.

58:09.800 --> 58:16.800
If you remember the old 3D games, like in the early PS1, all the walls looked the same.

58:16.800 --> 58:21.800
It made Doom damn near impossible for me, because one wall looked the same as the other.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
I think you've got a damn good point here.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.800
That's one thing that always kind of frustrated me about the Mega Man Legends games, especially

58:26.800 --> 58:30.800
the early ones, is that everything kind of looked the same, so it was very hard.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.800
Well, there were only two Mega Man Legends games.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.800
Yeah.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.800
But yeah, I know what you mean.

58:35.800 --> 58:40.800
You can't do a 3D game and have everything look the same, because you're just going to

58:40.800 --> 58:43.800
get horribly lost, and it doesn't matter what system.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.800
But then again, the same thing happens with a lot of 2D games.

58:46.800 --> 58:52.800
The original Metroid was a pain in the ass, because all you had was the black background

58:52.800 --> 58:56.800
and the different colors of the floor, so it took me a little while.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.800
Super Metroid had the landmarks.

58:58.800 --> 59:02.800
Yeah, you bring up a damn good point, because it's not like in the real world I have a problem

59:02.800 --> 59:04.800
conceptualizing 3D space.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.800
I don't think many of us do.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
Maybe there's a condition out there.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
I don't know.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.800
But most people don't have a problem conceptualizing 3D space in the real world, and I think you're

59:12.800 --> 59:13.800
right.

59:13.800 --> 59:14.800
A lot of that is landmarks.

59:14.800 --> 59:15.800
Right?

59:15.800 --> 59:16.800
How do we give directions out?

59:16.800 --> 59:19.800
We say, okay, go straight down the street, and when you see the McDonald's, turn right.

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
You know?

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
Landmarks are huge.

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
Exactly.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.800
I think you got a damn good point.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
You need those recognizable landmarks.

59:24.800 --> 59:26.800
Yeah, you need a McDonald's.

59:26.800 --> 59:28.800
You know, here's the other thing.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.800
For lack of a better term, yeah.

59:29.800 --> 59:33.800
Let me say this, though, Ross Studio T, because I think here's the other big change I think

59:33.800 --> 59:37.800
that came later on in the PlayStation 2 and so on games that you didn't see a whole lot

59:37.800 --> 59:39.800
of in PlayStation 1 games.

59:39.800 --> 59:40.800
Maps.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.800
Maps.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.800
Maps.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.800
One button maps.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.800
A little mini map in the corner.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.840
A way to conceptualize the 3D and 2D very quickly.

59:47.840 --> 59:51.800
That's one reason I way prefer Kingdom Hearts 2 to Kingdom Hearts 1 is the mini map.

59:51.800 --> 59:52.800
Seriously.

59:52.800 --> 59:53.800
It's a huge improvement for me.

59:53.800 --> 59:54.800
Yeah, I hear you.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.200
A lot of the games have the mini maps.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.360
Even the really late ones like Call of Duty 4 has a mini map when you pause.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.800
There are a lot of aids today.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
There is that.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Like I said, 3D is a lot easier today than it used to be.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
Right.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800
Well, what else did you want to say, Ross Studio T?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800
Because we're trying to move through a lot of calls tonight.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.800
I want to go back to the whole idiots on mass effect thing.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800
Ah, yes.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.400
You know, we've been seeing for the better part of a decade and a half idiots attacking

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400
video games.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.300
And I'm going to call them idiots because, you know, ignorant means you don't know better.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.800
Stupid means you don't want to learn.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.800
It's true.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.400
True words have not been spoken on this show tonight.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
Go ahead.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400
Thank you.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400
Thank you.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:52.040
The thing is, I always wonder what sort of impact they really have aside from the whole

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
soundbite culture.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.820
Because when you look at it in that time when the anti-gaming attacks have been so intense,

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.240
the industry has just grown and blossomed enormously.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.040
We just had this epic year last year, what was it, 18 billion dollars for the industry

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.080
last year?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:18.100
You know, so you have to really wonder how important these Jack Thomsons, how many people

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.660
they actually reach out to.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:26.240
I think what we lose sight of is that the United States is a country of 300 million

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.040
people.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.860
There's a ton of cable networks, literally a ton of cable networks and satellite and

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.760
everything else, you know, there's so many options out there.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.120
You know what, I think you're kind of right, Rosco, I think one thing we kind of don't

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.100
consider about this Fox News piece is that they were probably preaching to the choir

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100
in a sense.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.360
Like a lot of the people that watch Fox News were probably already the crowd that bans

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.480
their children from playing video games all together and all this stuff, you know, but

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.540
it doesn't excuse the ignorance.

01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:00.180
And that's the thing, I think, in this day and age, I know you're with me there, but

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.040
I think originally these guys were probably preaching to the choir, but at the same time

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.600
it doesn't give them the right to lie.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:16.840
Of course, and I'm angry about the lie, but at the same time, compared to other times

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.260
in history, other media's attacks, video games have had a pretty damn light and have

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.520
gone through it pretty damn quickly in comparison.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.000
It took the movie industry 40 years to get over the Hays Code, for example.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.160
And the comic book industry only recently got out of the shadow of the comic school.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.600
Video games have had a very light.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.880
Rosco, you two, we've got to wrap up, but I've got to say this, it's going to be very

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.200
interesting to see what happens, especially as this Hollywood writer's strike continues,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.820
where video games are going to become, you watch this happen, the longer this strike

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.920
goes on, the more these writers are going to start writing for video games.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.160
And we're going to have very Hollywood-ish type of video games.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160
It's going to be very interesting.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.760
Well, we're already seeing that happen.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.400
We're already seeing video games taking audience from television, which is part of why you

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.720
see all this anti-gaming stuff on TV.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
True, but you know how...

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.720
They're trying to get rid of that market.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720
Anyway, I know you're tied.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720
I'm sorry.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.960
I know, really quick, but there was another story about this this week.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:16.160
You know how they say that video game plots are always so thin they never make good movies.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.160
You know, that...

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.960
I think you're going to start seeing a lot more games with them.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.600
Well, they don't make good movies because the directors suck.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.040
That's true a lot of the time, too.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
Uwe Boll, anyone?

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.280
Silent Hill, some of them were passable.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.280
Some of them were...

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
Even Mortal Kombat was passable.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.280
Passable.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.360
I liked the first Mortal Kombat.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.360
I liked the first Resident Evil.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360
But then you look into shit.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360
Those are good movies.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.360
You look at shit like BloodRayne, and you're just like, this is why we get about that.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Okay.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360
One sexy...

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.360
All right, all right.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.360
You want to get to the next column.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
All right.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Rustiel Ute, I'm so sorry.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360
We've got to let you go.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360
But have a good one, buddy.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
It's always good to hear from you.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
Bye-bye.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360
You do the same.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360
Bye-bye.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360
Hello.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720
Anyone at the line?

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
Oh, hi.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
Two- elders.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720
Hi, everyone.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720
Sorry to interrupt you.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.720
The phone is ringing off the hook tonight.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.720
I literally click the hang up button and another call drops in.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720
It's crazy.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720
It's an orange launch radio.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.720
Who's this?

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720
This is Act Def from chat.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720
Hello, Act Def from chat.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720
What is on your mind?

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.800
Actually, three things online.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.420
The first one is the DDR is dead thing.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.300
I agree with you on the Konami.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:29.580
definitely hire or commission harmonics on the whole renewal of DVR. They are having

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:36.360
so much success with Guitar Hero and Rock Band that maybe they should work together

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.320
and make a better new game.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.980
I don't know how feasible that arrangement is, but it would certainly be a fanboy's dream

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:47.360
to see something like that happen. With the way complex corporate relationships and money

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.060
and everything works, I don't know how feasible it is, but it certainly is a fun thing to

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.060
dream about, right?

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:59.660
True. So it would be nice to see them work together.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:03.340
Now Act Deaf, you're from Mexico, right, if I remember right?

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340
Yes.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.660
Here's one question. I hear that Pump It Up has a huge fan base in Mexico. Is that true

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.740
in your neck? Now obviously Mexico is a very big place, but is that true in your neck of

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.260
the woods?

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:21.900
Actually Pump It Up is more popular on the center of the country, more on the south side.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.620
On the north, DVR has more popularity.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:29.860
I see. Do you think that might just be because a lot of American culture seeps through because

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.620
the closer you get to the border and everything, do you think that might be a part of it or

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.820
just coincidence?

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.820
Yeah. Yeah, that's most a part of it.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.780
Because I was thinking, yeah, and somebody brought it up in chat too, Color Sakura said

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.620
it in chat, and I was thinking of this too, that the World Pump Festival was happening

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:50.540
in Mexico City. But yeah, Mexico City is much further south in Mexico than, you know, other

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540
places.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540
Anyhow.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:06:03.380
Yeah. Also, I wanted to comment on a news you said a week ago about Video Games Live,

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:07.180
that it's coming to Mexico and it's coming to Mexicali, that's my hometown.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.180
Awesome.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.360
I'm pretty damn excited.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360
That has got to be awesome.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.380
It's not going to be.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:19.420
I bet it's not every day. You know, unfortunately, a lot of big tours and things don't always

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:24.540
think to go to Mexico or other countries. Like, you know, we hear a lot from Footy Monster

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.060
who's in Argentina and not a lot of stuff comes to his neck of the woods either. I bet

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.620
that's got to be pretty awesome to see something like this, like actually kind of recognize

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.380
like, hey, let's go to some places a little bit outside the north. Let's go somewhere

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.060
besides L.A. and New York, right?

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.060
Pretty cool.

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:45.100
Yeah. It's pretty exciting because here in my town, it doesn't happen anything like this

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:50.740
huge, like Video Games Live, though maybe for some people it will be like, oh, video

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:57.260
games. Oh, yeah. Like, whatever. But for me, it's like a great experience that is going

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:06.220
to happen, like going to the ballroom that's going to be happening and hearing all the

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.780
music I know and recognize from old video games and also with my friends that also are

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.780
video game fans.

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.420
Act F, let me ask you just one last question and then we've got to wrap up. Do you think

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:22.820
it will succeed in a non-traditional place like Mexicali? Do you think this show has

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.740
potential to do very well there?

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:33.660
We have a pretty big community of gamers and also people who like anime, otakus and pretty

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:44.940
much geeks. It would be a success, though not as great as in a big city.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.700
Well, you know, I know you've been saying in chat that I should go. It is a bit of a

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.300
long drive to Mexicali. I know it's towards the north end of Mexico, so it's not unreasonable.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.100
Who knows? If I get my passport renewed, anything is possible. Who knows? I've never been to

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.660
Mexico either. This will give me a great excuse. Who knows?

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:03.140
Yeah. Another thing I wanted to add before...

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.140
Really quick, yeah.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:13.140
...ending the call. It's the Fox News thing. Just a little opinion on that, on my part.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:25.300
It should be not us attacking them also or ignore them. We should acknowledge their opinions

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:35.740
and maybe make a debate. The PAX Expo tried to do last year with Jack Thompson a debate.

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:41.940
Very interesting perspective that maybe instead of getting on the offensive, like things that

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:46.320
you see on Amazon.com, everybody attacking this lady who said this, maybe the video game

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.260
community can kind of look at how can we stop this from happening in the future? If this

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.140
is what people really think, how can we educate them otherwise?

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.140
Yes.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.900
That's a very interesting way of looking at it. That's a very interesting way of looking

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.280
at it. I appreciate your opinion. Act F, we're out of time. I got to let you go, but thanks

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280
so much for your call.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280
You too.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280
All right. Bye-bye.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.280
I don't want to be the better person.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.420
What did you say, Chris? I think that's worth saying to the mic. What?

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.060
I don't want to be the better person.

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.540
You're right. Sometimes you don't want to be the better person. You're right. But you

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.900
know what? I think he makes a damn good point is that maybe instead of going on the offensive,

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.380
we should take a look at how can we stop this shit from happening again? How can we educate

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.580
these people. But then again, there's another part of me that says you can lead a horse

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.720
to water, but you can't make a drink.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.600
Exactly. You can give them all the education. They can be the most educated people about

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.580
video games. But if they have an agenda, like trying to be sensationalists and stuff like

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.900
that, and really rile up people about video games, they're just going to do these stories.

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:45.060
Anyway, since obviously they don't really care about apologizing about it, I'm surprised

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:49.280
we don't see more crazy shit on there like, you know, Grand Theft Auto literally reaches

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.020
out of the TV and murders your children and stuff like that.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.020
The Horde is after your children?

01:09:54.020 --> 01:10:00.860
Yes, the Horde is after your children. It is a satanic cult cultivated by a video game.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:09.140
It has 10 million followers and it will destroy the Christian race. I don't know how we can

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.140
go from that into another call, but we're going to try. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.140
Radio. Who's this?

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.040
Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ronma.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.460
You've been listening to that because sometimes I pick up calls and don't acknowledge for

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.340
a little bit just to get them on the line. You've been listening to that for 30 seconds.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.940
I don't know how you held the laughter in so we couldn't hear you.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.940
Yeah, pretty much.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.940
All right. Ronma, what's on your mind?

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:35.120
Well, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I'm putting that aside because

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.860
I'm very pissed off right now.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.860
Why is that?

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.980
I have one thing to say. Can I please say it?

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.980
Okay.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:42.980
No.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:53.500
People, shut the fuck up about DDR. It's done. God forbid Konami ignores these other franchises

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.740
to please you drooling fanboys.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.820
I wouldn't say they're really ignoring their franchise. They're still releasing more than

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.180
two games a year for the damn thing. I mean, I wouldn't say it's dead.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:08.380
Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I mean, be thankful you're getting something, you know?

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.900
It's all the people who play DDR. It's all their fault because they're not the ones playing

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.180
it. Konami's releasing plenty of games. It's just you guys, you all suck. That's why.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:20.540
Ronma, I agree and I disagree. I agree to a point that at some point you have to let

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.620
DDR go. You just have to let it go. It's past its prime, whatever. But at the same part,

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.980
it sucks because without DDR, I would never have met Jamie. I would have never met Matt.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.100
I would have never met you. You know what I mean?

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.660
It's true. That is so true.

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.940
So I think that's why people are so passionate about it and they know everybody has their

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.620
own idea of what's best for the series because a lot of us have made friends through that

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.900
community. It goes back to what we were talking about during the bonus segment. I don't know

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.820
if you were here for the bonus segment and I know our podcast listeners don't get to

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:54.960
hear the bonus segment, but during the bonus segment, Chris was talking about a fundraiser

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.900
going on on DeviantArt to help one of the artists in need. And I was talking about that's

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:04.180
a really great example of community. And I bet if something like that happened in the

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.540
DDR world, the DDR community would have done something similar. You know what I mean?

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.380
Thomas Howard, he's hungry.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:16.060
Every community has done something like that, you know? I mean, some conventions, when they

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:22.460
have the auctions for artwork and stuff like that, they would say a portion of this would

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.860
go to this charitable organization, which is pretty cool.

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:31.180
Well, okay. So, all right. We've heard all sides of this. Let's not continue to indulge

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.820
the DDR discussion. What else did you want to say, Rama?

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:40.060
Okay. I do know a few episodes back, there was talk about the Wii and the Wii Remote.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:45.540
And it's something I thought about. Let me ask all of you guys this, and girls. If the

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:53.060
Wii came loaded with the Wii Remote and the classic controller, would the console still

01:12:53.060 --> 01:13:01.860
be considered a gimmick system?

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.660
You know, it's weird, because I don't think that would have ever happened, because Nintendo's

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:10.180
thing was to force developers to get away from that. So, it's kind of hard for me to

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:14.900
answer that, because I think the whole niche about the waggle and the motion sensing, that

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:21.060
was Nintendo's whole thing. So, if they had bundled in a classic controller with that,

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:25.740
it kind of would have defeated the purpose altogether. You see some developers sneaking

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.660
around that a little bit. Like, for instance, I think of Geometry Wars. Like, you can play

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:35.420
that with the motion sensing way, or you can play it with the good old-fashioned, old-school

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:41.780
2 sticks way, if you have a classic controller, which a lot of people do. But, you know, it's

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.100
really hard to say, Rama, because I think that was Nintendo's whole thing in the first

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.620
place, and for them to have included a classic controller would have defeated the entire

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.620
purpose.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.380
Well, I agree on that. I do see how Nintendo wanted to get away from that. That was cool.

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:59.780
I played some of the Wii games on launch, and it was cool. I played Dragon Ball Z Budokai

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.820
2. I couldn't get into it. I was like, I need a regular controller in order to play the

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.620
game. At first, everyone was like, oh, this is so cool. This is so great. Now, developers

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:13.580
are like saying, this ain't a joke, you know? Let's go on to other things.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:18.780
I think a very realistic possibility in the future, Rama, is that when the Wii start coming

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.700
out in other colors, and again, this is all speculation, why not throw in a matching classic

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:27.340
controller of another color? You know, the Wii is an established thing now. This whole

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.980
new, you know, the waggling and the motions, it's established now. Developers will buy

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.860
into it. I think it's okay to start putting in classic controllers and kind of see what

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.420
can happen with a good mix.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.740
That'll definitely work. I mean, like, you got, like, a game where one person uses a

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:45.980
controller to, like, drive a car. Some other person can use the Wii, the controller, like,

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.500
the little guns or the lasers. That'd be pretty cool.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.780
Yeah. Lots of ideas. And, of course, I think back to that YouTube that came out a little

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.860
while ago with the whole reverse thing where the guy had the whole conceptualized space

01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:00.100
thing but he was, like, wearing the sensor bar on his head. That thing was amazing. I

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.100
don't know if you saw it.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.220
Yeah, I didn't see it.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.580
I'm sure someone in chat has a link to the YouTube. It's freaking amazing. Rama, really

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.460
quickly, any last thoughts? And we got to let you go.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:13.060
I'm tired of 3D games. I want more 2D games and 3D environments. That's it.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.620
Real quickly, how do you feel about the Bionic Commando remake? Because that seems to be

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:20.060
exactly the kind of thing you're talking about.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.060
I'll buy that for $20.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.300
All right. You do that. All right, thanks so much for your call, Rama. Take care.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300
No problem.

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.300
Bye-bye.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.300
All right.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.300
Seriously, like, I had the biggest nerdgasm when I saw that Bionic Commando thing last

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.660
week, if I can even say that. All right, any other...

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.660
Any other?

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:40.220
Any other? Yes, I fangasmed all over myself. All right, real quick, I got another call

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:43.420
driving. This is the last one, I promise. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:47.420
Hello.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.420
Hi, who's this?

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.060
This is Let's Have Tea.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.140
Hello, Let's Have Tea. Welcome to the show. Real quick, because we're trying to wrap up,

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:58.380
what did you want to say?

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:03.740
I know you didn't really want any more comments on the whole DDR thing, but there are communities

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:12.700
out there working together using DDR for charities. I know there's an organization in Indiana

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:24.580
that they've been doing annual charities for seven years now, using DDR as a way to raise

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:31.860
money. And this year, they raised just over $2,800 a weekend for a children's hospital.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:36.620
That's awesome. Do you happen to have a website link or anything?

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:44.740
The community for that is over at nddr.com, and it's called the DDR-a-thon.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.460
Very cool. Let's Have Tea. We've got to let you go, because I swore we were going to wrap

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.420
it up, but thank you so much for sharing that with us. Have a good one, okay?

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.420
Yep.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.420
All right.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420
Bye.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.700
Bye-bye. I love that nickname, too. I forgot to compliment him when he was on the line,

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.820
but Let's Have Tea is one of my favorite nicknames of anybody in chat. All right, I promised

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.100
we could wrap up. We're going to do a couple quick last minute stories, but I did want

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.060
to say this real quick, because he's talking about charity, and I think it's really interesting.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.300
This has kind of become a fad lately. I don't know if that's the right word to use, because

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.940
that has kind of a negative context with it, but I've noticed it seems like I've seen a

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:22.420
lot of these 48-hour gaming sessions for charity lately. Like, you know, I want to say somebody

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:25.180
sent me an email. I think it was one of our listeners that they were going to play through

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:31.500
the Banjo-Kazooie games in one weekend, and of course, we saw the Mario-a-thon, the Sonic-a-thon,

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:38.320
the Zelda-a-thon, and, you know, it's a very interesting trend right now that people are

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.820
doing these marathons for different charities. I think it's cool. I think it's a great example

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:50.780
of how the community can kind of band together. I would caution, though, too much of a good

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.340
thing can be too much, so I would encourage those that are thinking about doing these

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.260
types of things in the future, I encourage you to think about a spin that you can kind

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.860
of put on it to make it your own. You know, what kind of spin can you put on it that makes

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:10.620
it stick out from the rest? That's all. Anyhow, that's it. That's all I'm going to say on

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:15.020
that. Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki? Sure. To kind of go back to some of

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:24.060
the stuff we talked about earlier, there is a rumor, I guess now, apparently a tipster

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:34.700
who tipped off QJNet about the phasing out of the 20-gig PS3s is also saying that now

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:41.340
he has information about the phase-out of the 80-gig PS3s for GameStop and EB. Apparently

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:45.560
they're also phasing them out as well. And he says, I went ahead and looked in our back

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:51.460
office inventory screen and found that only SKU listed as active for the PS3 console was

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:58.100
the 40-gig system. The 20, 60, and 80 SKUs were deleted. So that's kind of interesting

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:06.420
and of course Sony has come out and said no comment regarding the phased-out rumors. Most

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:10.380
likely though, if we're hearing that a lot of these retailers are phasing out, that something's

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:16.620
going to happen. So not a big surprise there. Someone else apparently found another hack

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:22.740
into the Wii to run their own code. Apparently there's an exploit using a game save for Zelda

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:30.700
Twilight Princess where you can crash it and run a code using a buffer overflow. So it's

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:37.860
kind of neat. Interesting. And then the surfer girl, of course, she's had a lot of rumors

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:45.860
that have come true here. Some of our newest ones include Slalom, I guess, a rare NES game

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:51.540
and that's rare in the company, that actually will be making its way to the Virtual Console

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:56.500
in the next few months here. Some other stuff, they're also talking about Onimusha 5 is apparently

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:02.340
coming out for both the PS3 and 360 sometime next year, as well as Dead Rising 2 and Lost

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:08.120
Planet 2 not too far behind. The PSP also getting a follow-up title coming in the form

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:14.380
of another siphon filter game. And we'll have the story tied into a PS3 version as well,

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:21.340
also set for 2009. And finally, there is some stuff coming from EA. Apparently they are

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:26.220
rumored to be working on another Wing Commander title, an actual Wing Commander title, not

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:32.100
some crappy Xbox Live Arcade game. However, there is also another Xbox Live Arcade game

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:38.780
coming from Rare, and that game is Mr. Pants, which I don't know if you've played Mr. Pants

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:45.660
but it's a weird game. I can't say I have. Mr. Pants. What is a game called Mr. Pants

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:51.140
about? I don't remember but it looked weird. Alright. We're way over for time tonight so

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:55.100
we definitely have to wrap things up. Any other last minute stories quickly though?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:21:00.180
I just want to make sure. No. Alrighty. Then let's go ahead and wrap it up with our final

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:06.740
thoughts. Loki, your final thought tonight? My final thought is I need a cage match song

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.940
quick. Yes you do. Dark Soccer, your final thought? I picked my cage match song seven

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:17.580
hours ago. And my final thought is vitamin water is very good. It's much better for me

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:22.960
than soda too, I'm sure. As long as I drink it in moderation. I wouldn't live off vitamin

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.880
water but it's good stuff. And lastly but certainly not leastly, thank you so much Chris

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:32.300
for coming over tonight and lending your moral support and your shining face to our show.

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.760
And a very good bonus segment all thanks to you tonight. So Chris, any final thoughts

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:44.020
from you? The Horde is after your server. And please call in once in a while and let

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.580
us know you're doing okay. Oh I plan to. You better. And you're still going to be our roving

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.380
reporter in Wisconsin. We'll find something gaming related up there for you to cover.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:55.420
Okay. Well actually I got something that I want to plug later but I'll do that later.

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:59.500
Do you want to plug it now? Because the show's almost over, you ain't got much time left.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:04.700
No I'll do it in the cage match. Right before the cage match. Something for the live listeners.

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:08.780
Because you people are special and I love you all. Live listeners get a special treat

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:12.140
from Chris very soon. Well sorry podcasters but that's part of the magic of listening

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:18.060
live. And for those of you on video, I might just dance. That's right. The Justin TV-ers

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:23.140
get to hear it too. Alright and well thank you guys so much for, did I do a final thought?

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.820
Oh yeah I said vitamin water. So that, hello, I'm losing my memory already. Anyhow that's

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:36.660
going to do it. Get an old rub. Shut up. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:41.000
Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.860
supporting independent podcasting and independent media. I know we say this every week and we

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:50.460
start to sound like a broken record but we really mean it. Without your guys' support

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.820
it just wouldn't happen. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be able to do this and we do it

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.300
for free. We do it because we love getting to hang out with you all on a Sunday night

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.940
and even for those guys who can't make it live, we love the feedback and the stuff we

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:05.300
get. You guys are awesome and thank you so much for your support of us. If you like what

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:10.260
we do, all we ask, help spread the word. Tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.420
Post a positive review on iTunes which by the way we got a couple of those this week.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.260
I'd like to really thank those new entries on iTunes this week. Some really nice reviews.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:22.220
Or wherever you think would be best. I know not everyone uses iTunes so you know whatever.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:28.700
Dig, Yahoo, podcast, whatever. I think it's great. Thank you guys so much as always and

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:32.980
until next week when we will be joined with our first ever musical guest which is going

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.820
to be all kinds of interesting. Can't wait. We'll see you then here at Orange Lounge Radio.
