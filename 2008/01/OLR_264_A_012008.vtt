00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Alright, anything else you want to add to your gaming week, DarkSakura?

00:02.640 --> 00:03.300
Nope.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.620
Then let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

00:05.620 --> 00:07.700
My gaming week was fine.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.040
I played a little bit of

00:11.040 --> 00:15.280
Nitro Bike this week because I was anticipating it was going to be awesome and

00:15.280 --> 00:19.680
all that stuff for the week because, you know, they're kind of comparing it to Excite Truck.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.960
It is not even close to Excite Truck and it's also not even close to being good, so

00:24.960 --> 00:26.680
unfortunately it sucked.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.000
And what ways did it suck?

00:28.000 --> 00:33.220
It sucked because the tracks weren't really open enough like Excite Truck.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.280
The game itself

00:35.280 --> 00:38.400
wasn't very fun because you can do tricks

00:38.400 --> 00:40.600
in the air and stuff, but

00:40.600 --> 00:44.760
I mean really there's no need to be doing any sort of variety of tricks because you can do

00:44.760 --> 00:49.360
the same trick over and over and get the same kind of bonus for it, which is more Nitro.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.000
But the fact is the

00:51.000 --> 00:55.860
tracks aren't really straight enough anyways to where you would need the Nitro, so

00:55.860 --> 00:58.240
it was kind of dumb.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.080
They tried and they failed. The other thing though that I do not like about a lot of these

01:03.080 --> 01:05.700
racing games

01:05.700 --> 01:09.720
is that unlike Excite Truck, which you hold the Wii Remote kind of, you know,

01:09.720 --> 01:11.180
parallel to the ground,

01:11.180 --> 01:16.080
a lot of these games will have it where you're holding it on its side so that, you know, you can

01:16.080 --> 01:18.420
use those really crappy plastic

01:18.420 --> 01:21.440
steering wheel controllers.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.560
And I really hate having to hold it like that because it makes it really uncomfortable

01:25.560 --> 01:28.960
for your hands because you have to twist your whole wrist back and stuff.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.280
Excite Truck is just awesome, what can I say.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.760
Then on purpose I played Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, which is

01:36.760 --> 01:39.040
a game that got reviewed on

01:39.040 --> 01:43.840
IGN giving it a 1.5.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.280
Yeah, it's deserving of that. It was just really bad.

01:47.280 --> 01:52.600
Basically your vehicles in the game kind of control like crap,

01:52.600 --> 01:57.800
very sluggish, and I had trouble staying on the track because of that.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.960
But it was fun to get to play it, I guess.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.720
Then, not so crappy games, I got to play

02:04.720 --> 02:09.760
Burnout Paradise, which I'm very surprised,

02:09.760 --> 02:10.780
the game

02:10.780 --> 02:13.020
I didn't think was going to be that good

02:13.020 --> 02:17.960
when I played the demo. It didn't seem like something I would like,

02:17.960 --> 02:22.400
but playing the full version of the game, I was completely wrong.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.600
Absolutely the best Burnout game in the series so far.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.160
Personally for me, number three was my favorite. This is very much like

02:30.160 --> 02:33.600
number three. The takedowns are a little bit easier like three was.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.800
Very fast, I like the ability to drive anywhere in the entire game. Plus,

02:38.800 --> 02:42.860
the best part of the entire game is the Showtime mode, which basically,

02:42.860 --> 02:46.280
for all those people complaining that there's no crash mode anymore, well you can

02:46.280 --> 02:50.640
activate crash mode anytime you want. Just absolutely, you're driving down the street,

02:50.640 --> 02:52.480
oh look, there's a bunch of cars, hit the buttons,

02:52.480 --> 02:56.200
and you just roll, and you keep rolling, smashing through cars,

02:56.200 --> 02:59.880
and you can travel like thousands and thousands and thousands of feet

02:59.880 --> 03:03.720
down the street and just smashing into the stuff.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.320
It's absolutely fun.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.680
Now, is it just, the game's a little more like test drive, right? Where you're

03:09.680 --> 03:12.420
kinda driving in this free world and then you can pull up to something to

03:12.420 --> 03:13.240
start a race?

03:13.240 --> 03:16.440
Sort of, not really. Can you pick up chicks too?

03:16.440 --> 03:19.520
No. Like you couldn't test drive at all? No, but

03:19.520 --> 03:23.160
the game, the only thing that's kind of weird though is you have to crash some of the,

03:23.160 --> 03:27.480
or you have to take down certain cars if you want to unlock them, so you basically

03:27.480 --> 03:29.920
unlock them, they'll drive around the city, and you have to find them.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.320
And a lot of times it's hard to find those cars, and in fact,

03:33.320 --> 03:37.600
usually I notice, you know, a car will zoom past me and start driving crazy, and I'm like,

03:37.600 --> 03:38.840
okay, that's one of the cars,

03:38.840 --> 03:43.880
and so I'll chase after it and stuff, but it's just pretty awesome, and the races are

03:43.880 --> 03:44.600
pretty cool.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.360
Also the music in the game, they have a great soundtrack in it.

03:48.360 --> 03:53.280
Although the only flaw, they put Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in there, so I

03:53.280 --> 03:54.880
guess there's gotta be something

03:54.880 --> 03:59.520
for everybody, but it was a little weird driving and all of a sudden your girlfriend

03:59.520 --> 04:00.520
comes on, it just felt

04:00.520 --> 04:04.880
strange. But I highly recommend the game.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.880
I'm going to be playing this for a long time. Very cool.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.080
I'm actually looking forward to picking up this game too, I like the Burnout games. I'm not huge on a

04:13.080 --> 04:14.600
lot of racing games, but I like

04:14.600 --> 04:17.720
Burnout quite a bit. I want to try the online, but the servers, I guess, are not up right now.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.160
Well, seeing as the game isn't totally out yet, that might make sense, why?

04:22.160 --> 04:26.880
Yeah. Oh, and then Product Placement, there's a ton of it.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.160
There's vans driving around with like Axe and

04:30.160 --> 04:33.680
Gillette and all sorts of weird shit on them. Like manly ads.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.360
Yeah, but you can crash into them, which is great.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.880
It's like, oh, Product Placement, destroy!

04:40.880 --> 04:44.760
It would be funnier if you got more points if you destroyed a Tampax

04:44.760 --> 04:46.440
billboard or something, you know what I mean?

04:46.440 --> 04:49.760
It's awesome though. Seriously, you drive

04:49.760 --> 04:53.840
really fast through the game, they'll have like Stunt Mode and stuff. It's cool.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.640
I just like, it's like, hee hee hee, you know, just crashing and stuff. I don't know, it's

04:58.640 --> 05:02.040
hee hee fire. Exactly.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.640
Did you try doing like your own custom soundtracks? Because you said you don't like Avril Lavigne or

05:05.640 --> 05:06.600
whatever that's in there, but

05:06.600 --> 05:10.440
like when I played the last Burnout game on 360, I just used custom soundtracks all the time.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.760
I would basically use the music from Whangam Midnight Maximum Tune

05:13.760 --> 05:17.960
to Burnout, and it was awesome. No, actually, I just, they have the EA tracks or whatever,

05:17.960 --> 05:21.200
you can go in there and shut off which songs you don't like. So if you don't like Avril Lavigne,

05:21.200 --> 05:24.760
you can just turn the track off and you'll never hear it again. That's a good function.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.840
But, you know, actually what I did is I kept, and I may,

05:28.840 --> 05:32.880
if I have to find it for my cage match, but I may pick this song. There's a song in there,

05:32.880 --> 05:37.120
a remix by Jason Nevins that I've been having on repeat because

05:37.120 --> 05:40.160
it was the song that they had in the trailer for and

05:40.160 --> 05:45.160
it was, what was it, I want to say it was Taxi or something like that.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.720
That really crappy movie with Queen Latifah and

05:49.720 --> 05:53.120
Oh God, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, but it was a cool song though,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.920
but they had it in the trailer and just racing to that song is pretty awesome.

05:56.920 --> 06:01.640
I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. We actually have

06:01.640 --> 06:04.280
two chat rooms now because we have the Justin TV chat too,

06:04.280 --> 06:07.560
but I'm a little worse at being able to stay on top of that one, so we'll try

06:07.560 --> 06:09.680
to read both chats, but I'm looking at our

06:09.680 --> 06:14.440
main chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and some predictions from Son of Dad for the

06:14.440 --> 06:15.340
next Burnout game.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.400
It's Britney, bitch. Maybe that'll be on the soundtrack.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.840
Who knows? And that will be turned off as well.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.440
I don't know, some Britney songs are actually kind of fun to drive to. They do

06:26.440 --> 06:29.880
incite a lot of rage and the ability to crash into other cars.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.720
I think the online mode is going to be pretty fun because

06:33.720 --> 06:36.560
you know, I guess you can just turn it on where people are just racing around with

06:36.560 --> 06:38.160
you and stuff which would be cool

06:38.160 --> 06:42.080
because the game itself, I mean, just driving around is pretty fun.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.160
So, I don't know, I like it.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.280
Rice Princess, I know you've said you've been playing a lot of WoW this week while

06:49.280 --> 06:51.240
you're sick. Is that it or are there other games?

06:51.240 --> 06:55.080
Well, I got my Wii back online finally

06:55.080 --> 06:58.440
because I had the brilliant idea of taking it over to Nathan's where he has

06:58.440 --> 07:03.200
like a wireless connection. So we downloaded Alien Crush and

07:03.200 --> 07:06.800
really he's been playing that more than me. Good taste. Yeah.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.200
I played more Actraiser. What else did I play? I love Actraiser.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.920
I know, Actraiser is so good. Doesn't it have like the best music ever? It does.

07:14.920 --> 07:20.400
Yuzo Koshiro is the man. Oh yeah, we have to get Devil's Crush too.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.200
Well, that's up there now too, huh? Well, I just remembered that we played a bit of

07:24.200 --> 07:27.160
Alien Crush at my house and then we had to hook up the TurboGrafx and play Devil's

07:27.160 --> 07:28.760
Crush but now that it's there it's like, oh yeah.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.400
I know, seriously, like, because Alien Crush is addictive.

07:32.400 --> 07:37.520
I got to 64 on my Ork Hunter and wow,

07:37.520 --> 07:41.160
whoop dee doo. Nothing super exciting, nothing new.

07:41.160 --> 07:45.800
But you are wearing a Silent Hill shirt. Are you excited for Silent Hill 5?

07:45.800 --> 07:49.680
Yes, I am. Rumor is it's going to be out by summer. Really? I hope that's true.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.720
I hope it is too. Did you check out Silent Hill Origins on PSP at all?

07:52.720 --> 07:56.400
No, I don't have a PSP. I know, but I figured maybe you stole someone else's, I don't know.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.360
Yeah, that's a good idea. Ask William. I bought him one for his birthday, he never plays it.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.480
Really? Yeah, but also, well, also take note that Silent Hill Origins is coming out on

08:04.480 --> 08:05.680
the PlayStation 2 very soon.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.800
Oh my. So you can just play it on PS2.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.360
Hmm, that's an idea. Decision, decision. Someone needs to play

08:12.360 --> 08:16.520
the other Silent Hill games. Is that

08:16.520 --> 08:20.200
Nathan you're looking at? Maybe. Oh, Nathan, care to defend yourself? Maybe tell us a

08:20.200 --> 08:21.320
little bit about your gaming week?

08:21.320 --> 08:24.600
I have never played a Silent Hill in my life.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.960
Have you played Resident Evil? I wouldn't say played

08:28.960 --> 08:33.600
so much as died a lot. Alright.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.360
Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Nathan? Alien Crush

08:37.360 --> 08:41.560
a lot. I don't even know what the point of the game is besides points,

08:41.560 --> 08:45.960
but that's all that I care about is more. You just want to keep your ball alive

08:45.960 --> 08:49.720
is what you want to do. I try to keep as many balls as possible.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.960
In play at the same time? Sure. Alright. It's pinball.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.360
It's the point. Anything else you've been up to this week in the gaming world?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.880
Just today, my

09:01.880 --> 09:06.800
level 58 Tauren Warrior went to Outlands.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.160
Well, congratulations. Getting to Outlands is a really big deal for WoW nerds,

09:11.160 --> 09:15.120
so congratulations. It's beautiful, really. Did you shed a tear a little bit when you

09:15.120 --> 09:16.040
walked through the portal?

09:16.040 --> 09:19.840
It's like your character's all grown up now? No, I just said woot.

09:19.840 --> 09:25.560
Woot. Alright, good. Well, anyhow, feel free, you guys, to chime in

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
throughout the show as we talk about stories.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.560
You know, your usual schtick, even though you're sick, Irene.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.280
So, I do want to hear your opinion on things.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.640
You're right, I don't. But I do want to hear the chat room opinion.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.680
chat.orangelandradio.com

09:40.680 --> 09:44.120
Let's see. Robert M says, I actually got both

09:44.120 --> 09:47.440
Alien and Devil Crush, both very good video pinball titles.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.800
You gotta get Sonic Spinball, too. I like that one for a pinball game. It's not as

09:50.800 --> 09:52.000
good, but it's still fun.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.480
It's fun-ish. Why are you making a scrunchy I don't like you face, Irene?

09:56.480 --> 10:02.080
Whatever.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.880
Just not your kind of game? I was trying to get the mic over you, it's not working.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.920
Sorry. I'm tangling myself up. Alright.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.000
Um, let's see.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.600
You know what they need to do? What? We need a

10:15.600 --> 10:19.800
a new Williams pinball collection or we need a

10:19.800 --> 10:23.200
a Stern pinball collection.

10:23.200 --> 10:28.080
Because Stern has the, um, I think has the licensing rights to Big Bang Bar.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.800
Well, it was just like my favorite pinball table.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.760
You want a Big Bang Bar machine. And the Pirates pinball.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.200
And the Spider-Man pinball that just came out. Whatever happened to,

10:40.200 --> 10:43.480
I remember you talking about this at one of the pinball shows you went to, and I'm just curious if it ever

10:43.480 --> 10:45.400
came out, but like something I heard about

10:45.400 --> 10:50.160
where like they were going to take a high-def TV and put it on its side and lay it down so it was

10:50.160 --> 10:50.680
like a

10:50.680 --> 10:53.920
like a pinball table, like rectangular. They had six of them there. They're

10:53.920 --> 10:57.600
their ultra-cade pinball is what they are.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.720
And they're very, very cool, but I have to say, because what I did

11:02.720 --> 11:06.320
is I went and played the virtual tables

11:06.320 --> 11:10.400
and then I went back to play the actual pins, because a lot of them were there.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.440
And they're pretty close.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.920
The physics in them are very, very good.

11:16.920 --> 11:23.360
But there's just something not right. But each of them, I think, held like six tables

11:23.360 --> 11:27.560
and I think there's a capacity for more. Sounds interesting.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.120
It was very interesting, but you couldn't get like, you'd only be able to do like

11:31.120 --> 11:35.120
certain pins, like there's the standard two flipper,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.960
you know, start button, whatever, unless you had something equipped

11:38.960 --> 11:42.000
that had the other buttons mapped, like for things with double flippers

11:42.000 --> 11:45.400
where you have to have two sets of flipper, two controls for it,

11:45.400 --> 11:48.720
or like a special,

11:48.720 --> 11:51.400
like the MagnaBall, for example, on...

11:51.400 --> 11:56.400
One of those tables that we can't remember.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.120
I know it is. It's like one that you hit the button and it catches the ball before it drains.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.600
And I want to say, I know it's not on...

12:03.600 --> 12:06.480
I want to say that it was on...

12:06.480 --> 12:10.120
Whodunnit had one. But like,

12:10.120 --> 12:13.600
things like that, it would be a little bit more difficult.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.240
They'd have to find a way to map it. Or the cannon button

12:17.240 --> 12:20.840
on Black Rose.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.680
I want to read some other things in chat room right now. Not related to pinball,

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
unfortunately, but

12:25.680 --> 12:29.920
something about the burnout. We were talking about the custom soundtracks and SSJ100 Matt

12:29.920 --> 12:30.240
said,

12:30.240 --> 12:33.320
I'm waiting for the next OLR listener to suggest Dragon Force.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.240
That would be an amazing soundtrack to put as a custom soundtrack to a burnout. We'll see what

12:37.240 --> 12:37.680
happens.

12:37.680 --> 12:42.120
Anyhow, we're about to get into the gaming news for the week, but first,

12:42.120 --> 12:46.480
a quick housekeeping. As many of the folks in our live chat are noticing, we have moved

12:46.480 --> 12:50.880
from operator 11 to a new service called Justin.tv. So hello to all the

12:50.880 --> 12:55.560
Justin.tv people. The cool thing about Justin.tv is that we now are no

12:55.560 --> 12:57.040
longer limited to 40 minutes

12:57.040 --> 13:01.280
for a section of the show. We pretty much have unlimited. I am noticing some folks

13:01.280 --> 13:04.580
already having problems. That's probably because the cam is running off the Wi-Fi

13:04.580 --> 13:05.280
right now.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.680
So until I get a splitter out here to run the regular

13:08.680 --> 13:12.440
line through, it may be a little bit choppy, and I think it's causing

13:12.440 --> 13:13.680
buffering or whatever. But

13:13.680 --> 13:17.000
remember, the video isn't the main part of our show. We're trying to do a radio show.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.800
So

13:17.800 --> 13:21.240
audio is the most important part, and that way it gets out there to the podcast and all that.

13:21.240 --> 13:21.600
But

13:21.600 --> 13:25.200
the other cool thing about Justin.tv is it does archive everything, so you can kind of

13:25.200 --> 13:28.400
go back and watch corresponding video to a show. So if something particularly

13:28.400 --> 13:29.720
hilarious happens,

13:29.720 --> 13:32.880
then actually what can happen is that one of our listeners can set it as a

13:32.880 --> 13:33.600
highlight,

13:33.600 --> 13:36.280
and then people can go back and watch just the highlights. So that's kind of

13:36.280 --> 13:37.680
interesting. We'll have to see how that works out.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.960
So Justin.tv, and our username on Justin.tv, of course, is OrangeLoungeRadio.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.960
So if you want to check out the cam right now, you just go to www.Justin.tv

13:45.960 --> 13:49.560
slash OrangeLoungeRadio. Alright,

13:49.560 --> 13:54.080
that's going to do it for housekeeping, so let's get into some gaming news, and we'll

13:54.080 --> 13:55.480
start off tonight with

13:55.480 --> 13:58.520
Loki. Anyways,

13:58.520 --> 14:02.480
I'm sure this is going to come as a big shock to you, but

14:02.480 --> 14:05.560
there's a certain game out there that's going to be delayed one month.

14:05.560 --> 14:10.280
So yeah, Nintendo finally came out and said that, guess what, Smash Brothers is

14:10.280 --> 14:12.080
delayed to March 9th,

14:12.080 --> 14:15.280
and I'm sure that's the first time that you've ever heard of that,

14:15.280 --> 14:20.200
ever. Lucky for the people in Japan, though, it is coming out the 31st of this

14:20.200 --> 14:20.640
month.

14:20.640 --> 14:25.880
Also lucky for me. So for all those people that import their games,

14:25.880 --> 14:28.960
they're going to be plenty successful. They are a-okay.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.920
But isn't it going to be very heavy on the Japanese? Is it going to be, are you going to be able to navigate through the game?

14:32.920 --> 14:35.280
I think you'd be able to navigate through the game just fine.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.760
It's a fighting game. That's true. It's not going to be that complex,

14:38.760 --> 14:41.960
but there's so many different modes. Like if you've been watching what's going on

14:41.960 --> 14:42.520
on the

14:42.520 --> 14:47.960
dojo, there's so many different modes. That makes it even easier, though.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.520
I don't think it's going to even matter as much with that, because

14:51.520 --> 14:55.360
first of all, half the time they put up the text, it's going to be in hiragana,

14:55.360 --> 14:59.960
I'm sorry, either hiragana or katakana, and then there's usually a language select

14:59.960 --> 15:02.000
anyway for different regions.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.080
Well, their excuse for it is they said that development is taking slightly longer than

15:06.080 --> 15:06.920
expected,

15:06.920 --> 15:10.040
which is bullshit, since it's coming out in Japan

15:10.040 --> 15:14.080
already. So obviously development's done on it. It's localization.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.480
It's either taking a long time, or they can't press enough copies fast enough, so

15:18.480 --> 15:21.960
one of those.

15:21.960 --> 15:26.040
Well, is it possible that maybe

15:26.040 --> 15:29.360
there's, well, I guess that's localization. I was thinking maybe translation and all that stuff, but

15:29.360 --> 15:32.840
people shouldn't read into this, like, OMG, they went back and added a new

15:32.840 --> 15:35.200
character or something like that. No. They're not adding a new character.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.480
So, do you think there might be any secret characters that they've been sitting on that they

15:39.480 --> 15:40.600
haven't announced yet? I think so, yeah.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.280
I hope the eggplant wizard's in it, because I love Kid Icarus.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.840
Well, I mean, look at, they didn't announce all the new characters. Why are you

15:47.840 --> 15:51.600
laughing at the eggplant wizard, Nathan? I'm thinking of Captain N.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.840
Well, like, you know, Captain N,

15:54.840 --> 15:58.880
Captain N should be in it! Game & Watch, or Mr. Game & Watch, he was a secret character,

15:58.880 --> 16:03.720
that they never talked about before, so you never know. Mr. Game & Watch is awesome.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.560
Well, if eggplant wizard doesn't make it to Super Smash Brothers, perhaps it will

16:07.560 --> 16:10.040
make it to the rumored, emphasis on rumored,

16:10.040 --> 16:13.520
Kid Icarus game that is being worked on by Factor 5

16:13.520 --> 16:18.360
for the Nintendo Wii. Rumors are abounding this week, and Go Nintendo is

16:18.360 --> 16:20.360
reporting that Factor 5

16:20.360 --> 16:23.900
has been offered up the license from Nintendo to make

16:23.900 --> 16:28.360
a Kid Icarus game, or Kid Icarus, however you want to pronounce it, because that was

16:28.360 --> 16:30.920
always a point of contention that, you know, people never knew exactly how to

16:30.920 --> 16:31.680
pronounce the game.

16:31.680 --> 16:37.680
But, Icarus? Well, regardless, Factor 5 made some previous games on the

16:37.680 --> 16:41.640
GameCube. I believe they did, um, they did

16:41.640 --> 16:45.360
Star Fox, right? Didn't they do the Star Fox game?

16:45.360 --> 16:48.640
They may have. I think so. So, anyhow,

16:48.640 --> 16:51.960
I'll be very excited. Didn't they do Fire Emblem? Perhaps.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.360
I don't remember. Yeah,

16:55.360 --> 16:58.640
but, well, Factor 5 is not Fire Emblem. No.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.560
No, Fire Emblem wasn't Capcom. Huh.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.800
Are you thinking Breath of Fire? Breath of Fire was Capcom. Yeah.

17:04.800 --> 17:09.440
Alright, so, well, anyhow, regardless, I am very excited at the potential of

17:09.440 --> 17:10.840
having a new Kid Icarus game

17:10.840 --> 17:14.400
out there. I just hope they don't kinda, like, screw it up.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.320
I don't know. I don't want it to be 3D or any of that stuff. You just kinda know that

17:18.320 --> 17:18.840
things

17:18.840 --> 17:22.800
gonna be inevitable. Of course, Chat Room saves the day when we forget things.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.200
Shadow Next Gen says Factor 5 did the Rogue Squadron games. There you go.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.680
Alright, anyhow, uh, let's move on.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.920
Well, in other news, let's see, wasn't that professional.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.320
Um, for anybody who keeps up with the, um,

17:38.320 --> 17:42.720
results of video game system sales, it has, uh,

17:42.720 --> 17:46.400
been pretty clear that the Wii and DS

17:46.400 --> 17:50.520
are outselling, um, the Xbox 360 as far as units,

17:50.520 --> 17:53.800
but, um, Microsoft is like, uh-uh, we made more money, so we win.

17:53.800 --> 17:59.320
So, um, in fact, they've made, uh, 4.8 billion compared to, uh, 3.5 billion on

17:59.320 --> 17:59.800
the Wii

17:59.800 --> 18:05.400
and, uh, 2.2 billion on PS3. So, if you're just looking at money, um,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.720
yeah, PS3 does not have it. Um,

18:08.720 --> 18:15.480
they also, for the Xbox 360, they've, uh, sold 4.62 million units. That's just

18:15.480 --> 18:16.240
pretty cool.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.600
Um, PS2, um, sold 3.97

18:19.600 --> 18:22.720
million, uh, PSP 3.82 million,

18:22.720 --> 18:25.760
and the PS3, uh, sold 2.56 million

18:25.760 --> 18:29.020
for its first year. A lot of that money stuff has to do with the fact, though, that the

18:29.020 --> 18:30.280
Nintendo Wii, they make

18:30.280 --> 18:34.000
quite a bit of money off every sales of those, whereas, uh, Microsoft and Sony still

18:34.000 --> 18:34.660
lose money

18:34.660 --> 18:38.780
on everyone. Yeah, I think, I think that, yeah, so I think that for,

18:38.780 --> 18:43.240
if they're saying that, if Microsoft is saying that they've made more money

18:43.240 --> 18:47.280
with what they lose in production, then

18:47.280 --> 18:51.220
overall, yeah, they are, I'd have to say they're definitely having to move a lot

18:51.220 --> 18:51.960
more units,

18:51.960 --> 18:56.620
but I don't see where the, but the Wii is clearly selling

18:56.620 --> 19:00.000
the, like, crazy if they're having trouble stocking them. And this is only,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.460
this is only the numbers for 2007, too. Obviously, you know,

19:03.460 --> 19:07.160
Xbox 360 is still number one in the US, although,

19:07.160 --> 19:11.540
worldwide, the Wii is number one. Are people still crazy about Wii? Are they

19:11.540 --> 19:14.320
still hard to find? Yes, they're still hard to find. Wow.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.880
What happened with the rain check program the GameStop was supposed to be doing?

19:17.880 --> 19:22.320
Well, I don't know, I'm just kinda curious, like, I'm just kinda throwing it out there. I remember

19:22.320 --> 19:24.200
they were gonna have all these systems

19:24.200 --> 19:27.820
for these people who ordered rain checks, and now the system is still hard to get.

19:27.820 --> 19:28.680
I still think that,

19:28.680 --> 19:33.640
I mean, I'm sure that was successful for them, but, I don't know, maybe

19:33.640 --> 19:36.460
gave them a little bit more attention. I don't think that they got any more than they

19:36.460 --> 19:37.560
would have normally gotten

19:37.560 --> 19:40.680
anyways. Maybe a little bit, because I know that,

19:40.680 --> 19:45.520
you know, distribution didn't get as many Wii systems in January because of

19:45.520 --> 19:49.720
this whole rain check program, but I don't think it's

19:49.720 --> 19:54.040
a lot, you know, it's not like, dude, they're not like getting like four million systems.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.600
Yeah, I don't know how many people that affected, but I'm just kinda

19:56.600 --> 19:59.600
curious, because I remember throwing that story out there, and it was kinda like, well, what if

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
Wii's are still really hard to come by in January,

20:01.600 --> 20:05.120
which it seems like they are. I don't know, but,

20:05.120 --> 20:08.480
yeah, it's still hard to find,

20:08.480 --> 20:12.680
and it probably will be for a while. Chat Room to the Rescue, yet again, JV Mon is

20:12.680 --> 20:15.960
in there, chat.orangelandradio.com, and says, Rob, I work at GameStop,

20:15.960 --> 20:19.880
we filled all the pre-orders already, and are already got extras to sell to people.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.080
So, there you go. We got the same amount we did November to December.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.280
We're still cranking them out there. Well, as far as what the games did themselves, Halo 3 was at the top,

20:28.280 --> 20:31.920
had 4.82 million, and Wii Play was right behind it,

20:31.920 --> 20:35.240
which I think was kinda funny. Call of Duty 4

20:35.240 --> 20:38.680
followed that. Guitar Hero 3 on PS2 was behind that.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.840
I think the only reason Wii Play did so well is because it was like controller,

20:42.840 --> 20:43.520
plus

20:43.520 --> 20:48.160
cheap games, and that made it stand out. And it's like Wii Sports, and people

20:48.160 --> 20:53.000
love Wii Sports, and for a while there, it was hard to find remotes, and

20:53.000 --> 20:56.400
that was the only way you could find it, so win-win-win.

20:56.400 --> 21:01.060
Sneaky. We actually were at Fry's last week when I was having my computer

21:01.060 --> 21:01.560
drama,

21:01.560 --> 21:05.160
and there was a lady there trying to decide whether or not to buy Trauma Center or

21:05.160 --> 21:06.200
buy Wii Play,

21:06.200 --> 21:09.320
and she's like, wait, this has a controller with it, and put it down Trauma Center.

21:09.320 --> 21:13.720
That was it. But Trauma Center's so awesome.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.800
I know. It's all about the lowest common denominator.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.540
For real, there it is right there. Nintendo's secret to success. It's all

21:21.540 --> 21:23.160
about the lowest common denominator.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.520
For real. Nintendo deer hunting, that's all.

21:26.520 --> 21:32.440
That'll win. Let's move on. Anyways, Nintendo came out and announced a few dates

21:32.440 --> 21:36.120
of titles coming out, and this is first and third party stuff.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.440
For the first half of 2008,

21:39.440 --> 21:43.960
some of which we probably already knew about, some I guess were surprising, I don't know.

21:43.960 --> 21:49.480
Anyways, one game that was rumored to be coming out soon was Okami on the Wii.

21:49.480 --> 21:54.800
That's been dated for the 25th. Wii Fit scheduled for Quarter 2,

21:54.800 --> 21:59.640
which that would coincide with the supposed rumor from 1UP that

21:59.640 --> 22:03.360
Wii Fit's supposed to come out May 2nd, or not 2nd, the 20th.

22:03.360 --> 22:09.760
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, they're going to have some sequels coming out

22:09.760 --> 22:14.000
for that in Quarter 2 as well. Crossword DS,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.200
Nintendo Crosswords coming out May 5th,

22:17.200 --> 22:21.100
and Professor Layton in the Curious Village, the

22:21.100 --> 22:24.960
current number one selling DS title in Japan right now coming out

22:24.960 --> 22:28.560
in the United States on February 10th.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.440
Let's see, some other fun stuff for the Wii.

22:32.440 --> 22:37.220
February 26th, The Masked Queen and The Tower of Mirrors, the Dragon Quest

22:37.220 --> 22:38.680
Swords game.

22:38.680 --> 22:43.200
Karaoke Revolution presents American Idol Encore.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.640
That's coming out in the early part of February as well.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.960
Let's see here.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.920
Looks like a Poona is scheduled to be coming out from Koei. That's supposed to be a pretty good

22:54.920 --> 22:58.960
role-playing game.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.360
It sounds dirty, I'm sorry, I'm laughing over here like a three-year-old, but...

23:03.360 --> 23:06.840
Poona, I just can't contain herself either.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.080
Ironic. That's hilarious.

23:10.080 --> 23:15.000
Strangely enough though in here, they have Nitro Bike from Ubisoft listed as

23:15.000 --> 23:16.320
March.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.200
Apparently they didn't realize it's already come out, so...

23:20.200 --> 23:25.040
They didn't get the memo on that. And then, of course, April, we cannot forget

23:25.040 --> 23:26.480
Wild Earth

23:26.480 --> 23:28.240
African Safari

23:28.240 --> 23:30.640
from Majesco, the rip-off of

23:30.640 --> 23:32.260
Africa.

23:32.260 --> 23:35.360
And Cooking Mama Cook-Off 2

23:35.360 --> 23:39.720
in June, because I know the first one controlled so well. The Cooking Mama on Wii

23:39.720 --> 23:41.360
was horrific,

23:41.360 --> 23:45.240
but the DS one's still cool.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.960
Another cool game that's on the Nintendo DS is Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.080
That game was pretty awesome on the Nintendo DS.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.360
And some screenshots, some rumored screenshots, have leaked from a new

23:54.360 --> 23:58.040
Castlevania game, although we kind of emphasize this is only a rumor at this

23:58.040 --> 24:01.520
time. However, it would really not be a surprise. It's kind of a no-brainer that

24:01.520 --> 24:05.960
Konami would probably make a follow-up game to Portrait of Ruin at some point, a

24:05.960 --> 24:09.340
new DS title. You might remember that the cool thing about Portrait of Ruin was

24:09.340 --> 24:13.000
that you could use the Nintendo Wi-Fi service, but now it looks like that this

24:13.000 --> 24:16.240
new Castlevania game, with some early screenshots that have been linked or to be

24:16.240 --> 24:17.120
believed,

24:17.120 --> 24:18.800
could possibly have

24:18.800 --> 24:20.200
a Wii

24:20.200 --> 24:23.520
connectivity feature built into it so that your DS interacts with your Wii

24:23.520 --> 24:25.560
somehow. How?

24:25.560 --> 24:26.920
Who knows?

24:26.920 --> 24:30.900
It's unknown at this time, but apparently there's some type of Wii menu item

24:30.900 --> 24:33.560
that's being seen in the screenshots

24:33.560 --> 24:34.960
on the screen, so...

24:34.960 --> 24:37.120
Would that imply that, you know,

24:37.120 --> 24:40.600
there's going to be a Wii from Castlevania game coming out soon as well then?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.480
I would think.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.900
I hope so.

24:44.900 --> 24:49.380
Because Castlevania is a good franchise, that's why.

24:49.380 --> 24:53.240
I seem to remember, though, that the creator of Castlevania was not too

24:53.240 --> 24:56.680
pleased with the Nintendo Wii when he first... You know, he didn't want it to be that

24:56.680 --> 24:57.520
gimmicky,

24:57.520 --> 25:01.320
oh, you're going to actually use the thing as a whip, oh, what the...

25:01.320 --> 25:05.600
He fucking wears an ugly cowboy hat. I don't care. You know, he can suck it,

25:05.600 --> 25:06.480
because

25:06.480 --> 25:09.020
I would really like for one to be on the Wii.

25:09.020 --> 25:13.280
But isn't that... I mean, that would be cheesy, though. They don't have to act like you can actually whip.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.680
No one says that you... That's not cheesy at all. I would love that. No one says you can't have just a

25:17.680 --> 25:21.120
traditional game on the Wii system. Exactly.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.360
People just, for some reason, get it stuck in their heads that they've got to

25:24.360 --> 25:28.460
make some, you know, motion control crap and stuff that go along with it.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.040
You don't need to.

25:30.040 --> 25:34.060
Look at, uh, what is it, you know, Super Paper Mario.

25:34.060 --> 25:37.320
I mean, that didn't have two... I mean, it had some stuff, but

25:37.320 --> 25:39.800
it was pretty much a traditional game.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.840
Uh, MacMan, that says in chatroom, Castlevania whip carnival games.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.660
There you go.

25:45.660 --> 25:49.200
Why you don't applaud that?

25:49.200 --> 25:53.800
First time in Belmont, or whatever, one of the Belmont crew has to, uh, tame lions or

25:53.800 --> 25:54.880
something like that.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.000
GS68 in our chatroom speculates,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.840
uh, it's probably going to be Castlevania

26:01.840 --> 26:02.920
W

26:02.920 --> 26:06.840
of I, you know, because it has to be, you know, it's to say Wii, so he's suggesting

26:06.840 --> 26:09.800
Castlevania Wind of Illness.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.720
Does that sound Castlevania-esque to you? That's very Castlevania-esque. Very Castlevania-esque.

26:13.720 --> 26:18.720
But does it have to be, like, a music, like, symphony, rondo, wind of incontinence?

26:18.720 --> 26:24.480
The ones with the, with...

26:24.480 --> 26:27.360
Well...

26:27.360 --> 26:29.280
Sorry, JB, yes?

26:29.280 --> 26:31.680
That really only applied to, well,

26:31.680 --> 26:35.600
only applied to Dracula X.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.360
To be technical, Symphony of the Night slash Nocturne in the Moonlight

26:39.360 --> 26:42.840
was part of the Dracula X series, and all the other ones after that were just

26:42.840 --> 26:45.800
Castlevania.

26:45.800 --> 26:50.560
Well, also not all the games have been that, because Portrait are ruined. Portrait's not a music thing, so...

26:50.560 --> 26:54.040
They could have Dracula, or, you know, part of the

26:54.040 --> 26:58.000
Dracula triple X series, you know, and then the whips and chains get, you know, that's a

26:58.000 --> 27:01.280
whole different part of the game. Those could excite some of the people.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.800
Now you're talking!

27:02.800 --> 27:04.800
I'd buy that. You know what I'd buy?

27:04.800 --> 27:09.200
Well, I am sure we're going to get into this a little bit later. That's probably something Itagaki would be into, as well, right?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.480
There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:11.480 --> 27:18.480
You can have to whip the cowboy hat off his head, because, you know...

27:23.160 --> 27:24.840
Uh, anyhow...

27:24.840 --> 27:27.400
Ew, this is a crappy game!

27:27.400 --> 27:30.720
What? From Namco? It's listed as a game coming out in the summer.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.820
Active Life Outdoor Challenge?

27:32.820 --> 27:34.740
I'm sorry, I don't want to be active.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.400
I refuse to buy that game.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.240
I like being active.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.260
They should have different types of interactive games like that.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.920
Anyway, for

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
our friends in the UK, there are a

27:46.920 --> 27:51.680
couple of things out for Virtual Console, and I'm very sorry for you all.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.740
Well, I mean, one of them was okay, but

27:53.740 --> 27:54.980
there's better.

27:54.980 --> 27:57.480
Like, 1080 Snowboarding

27:57.480 --> 27:59.500
from the Nintendo 64.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.160
Yeah, it's out. I'm sorry.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.340
And then Riot Zone for Turbo Duo. I'm really sorry.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.280
Because it's, um...

28:08.280 --> 28:13.480
not very good. So, sorry.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.240
Or, you know, if you're feeling adventurous, you could just say, you know what? Forget

28:16.240 --> 28:18.200
Jamie's opinion. I'm going to download it anyway.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
If you want to download it and throw up,

28:20.200 --> 28:22.240
be my guest.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.320
Well, enjoy, or don't.

28:24.320 --> 28:29.600
There is one game that's coming out on the WiiWare service at some point here.

28:29.600 --> 28:33.860
That's actually being scheduled for the second quarter of 2008.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.820
It's a game called Plachin, and it's kind of a

28:37.820 --> 28:40.240
mix between a shooter and a puzzle game.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.800
Now, what I thought was interesting is they were talking about some of the stuff

28:43.800 --> 28:45.280
that it will support.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.240
One thing,

28:46.240 --> 28:49.920
they have a price point on it, which is going to be 1,500 Wii points, so you can kind of

28:49.920 --> 28:53.400
expect a lot of these games to be around the $10, $20 range

28:53.400 --> 28:56.600
instead of... Or $15 in that case.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.680
Well, that's why that's a range, Rob.

28:59.680 --> 29:04.360
Which, you see, it falls right in the middle of that range.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.600
Alright, I understand basic math. I get it. I'm just saying.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.240
You say $10 and $20, yeah, this game's going to be $15.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.360
I'm just clarifying.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.880
For our listeners who may not be following, because they fell asleep during your report because they

29:13.880 --> 29:16.600
can't understand simple math. Are you insulting our listeners like that?

29:16.600 --> 29:20.200
No, I would never.

29:20.200 --> 29:25.440
Look, it's Nintendo's strategy, lowest common denominator, right?

29:25.440 --> 29:27.080
I guess.

29:27.080 --> 29:31.960
It's got some interesting stuff, though, in it. You can play it with the Wii Zapper,

29:31.960 --> 29:34.080
although I don't know why.

29:34.080 --> 29:39.920
You can play it offline with up to 12 people at the same time.

29:39.920 --> 29:44.280
So I guess that would be one person uses a nunchuck, one person uses a remote,

29:44.280 --> 29:49.100
and then also the four controllers, and then four GameCube controllers.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.440
That's craziness.

29:51.440 --> 29:57.280
I can't even fit that many people in my living room without breaking some type of fire hazard.

29:57.280 --> 30:00.920
We did that once. Remember WarioWare? Eleven people.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.320
That's right, but that was crazy. That was like a workout, because you had to run around.

30:04.320 --> 30:08.320
There wasn't enough room in that room for people.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.000
It supports DK Bongos.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
There's finally another game that can utilize the DK Bongos.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.760
And, apparently, they're also playing a...

30:22.760 --> 30:24.920
Can you use a Guitar Hero 3 controller, too?

30:24.920 --> 30:27.680
Oh, sure. Why not?

30:27.680 --> 30:28.680
If you can use everything...

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
Maybe R-Mat?

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
Maybe.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:31.680 --> 30:35.100
Actually, I'm sure you probably could, since, you know, it's...

30:35.100 --> 30:40.640
That could be like the Ultimate Showdown. Twelve people. Twelve peripherals in the Ultimate

30:40.640 --> 30:42.180
WiiWare Showdown.

30:42.180 --> 30:46.820
Keep in mind, I think that it's actually pretty funny, because for me, who likes to find however

30:46.820 --> 30:50.940
many different controllers will work on a different game? I mean, my friend was the

30:50.940 --> 30:52.540
one who invented Rodcalibur.

30:52.540 --> 30:57.600
But here's the thing, though. I mean, this will have, you know, a ton of different multiplayer

30:57.600 --> 31:02.960
options and peripheral options, but what if the game sucks? You know, it's like, oh, great,

31:02.960 --> 31:06.280
I can use all these controllers, but do we really want to play this game?

31:06.280 --> 31:09.700
Now, are you sure it's a twelve player game, or is it somewhere in the range of ten to

31:09.700 --> 31:10.700
fourteen players?

31:10.700 --> 31:15.720
No, it's twelve players. It says, for support for twelve people, it does not say a range

31:15.720 --> 31:17.420
of...

31:17.420 --> 31:21.000
That's why they offer you different controller choices, so that you can change the nature

31:21.000 --> 31:25.440
of the game. So, it's like, man, I hate playing it with the Zapper. I'm going to use the Bongo.

31:25.440 --> 31:29.120
Hey, I like the Bongo. Then, those people are covered.

31:29.120 --> 31:33.560
Anyways, I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about some of this

31:33.560 --> 31:37.160
stuff, so hopefully that service launches pretty soon. I still think that they're going

31:37.160 --> 31:39.200
to announce it at Game Developers Conference.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.800
That would actually be a really smart place.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.880
It would make lots of sense. Actually, now that I remember seeing this before, this was

31:45.880 --> 31:49.480
the first game that was announced for WiiWare at one time. Actually, it doesn't look that

31:49.480 --> 31:53.560
bad. It's kind of weird looking, though. It's like, I don't know, how would you describe

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
that?

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
Abstract.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
Abstract?

31:56.560 --> 32:02.520
This is great radio. Rob, describe this screenshot for our listeners.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.640
I don't know. It's in space. It's got bejeweled stuff and a sun.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.720
I can tell you from the distance it looked like a pizza. From over here, it looked like

32:09.720 --> 32:10.720
pizza.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
You're just hungry. You just want to eat it.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.720
Alright, that's it.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.440
Let's move on.

32:14.440 --> 32:18.800
I think that's a good idea, though. We need to do the whole twelve people, twelve peripherals,

32:18.800 --> 32:23.840
one game, and have a showdown, and then laugh at how stupid we are. Paraglove wins.

32:23.840 --> 32:33.740
Anyhow, anyway, let's move on to another story.

32:33.740 --> 32:37.560
You might remember, you know, it's funny, these April Fools stories that run in Electronic

32:37.560 --> 32:41.600
Gaming Monthly have this really strange habit of turning into reality. Remember Mortal

32:41.600 --> 32:47.360
Kombat? There was the rumor of the hidden character, Ermac, that it was the red sub-zero

32:47.360 --> 32:52.120
or whatever, and then he actually showed up in a game later on. Well, years ago, I don't

32:52.120 --> 32:54.480
remember how long it was, maybe it was last year, I don't remember, but there was supposedly

32:54.480 --> 32:58.160
a game that was going to be made, it was their April Fools joke, Super Mario Fusion, I'm

32:58.160 --> 33:01.520
sorry, it was Super Mario Kingdom Hearts, or something like that. It was the idea that

33:01.520 --> 33:04.160
the Mario universe would be combined with Kingdom Hearts.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.720
It was Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.

33:06.720 --> 33:11.760
That's what it was, Mushroom Kingdom Hearts. Well, what's happened now is that someone

33:11.760 --> 33:17.960
has taken, I guess, they've taken Mario and combined it with, what the hell else, they

33:17.960 --> 33:23.840
got this game, Fusion, and they've got, I guess, Kingdom Hearts all worked into one.

33:23.840 --> 33:29.720
It's a combined, it's basically a game called Super Mario Bros. Fusion, but it combines

33:29.720 --> 33:30.720
like Mega Man.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.720
What the hell? That's Mega Man.

33:31.720 --> 33:40.320
Yeah, it combines Mega Man, Halo, they've got Ghosts and Goblins, Sonic the Hedgehog,

33:40.320 --> 33:44.640
just a bunch of stuff, and it's all made in this one Game Maker 7 program or whatever,

33:44.640 --> 33:48.920
but it plays like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros. 3.

33:48.920 --> 33:53.120
Wow, that's like a Halo stage and we had a Mega Man stage. Who else is there here? That's

33:53.120 --> 33:54.120
more Mega Man.

33:54.120 --> 33:56.080
Yeah, they have the whole entire Bubble Man stage.

33:56.080 --> 33:59.880
That is craziness. Somebody was really bored.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.480
Yeah, I think that's all we see is the Bubble Man stage now.

34:02.480 --> 34:07.080
But you can actually play the demo for it.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.080
You can throw the bubbles.

34:10.080 --> 34:15.400
That's pretty awesome. Very cool.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.400
That's very creative.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.680
Somebody's got a lot of free time on their hands, seriously.

34:18.680 --> 34:22.080
That's actually cooler than Asshole Mario.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.080
That's quite a compliment.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.920
Yeah, because Asshole Mario is really cool.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
And funny.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
That's really cool.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.560
Mega Man asks the question, Mario plus Kingdom Hearts plus Mega Man plus Halo plus Sonic

34:32.560 --> 34:33.560
equals Will It Blend?

34:33.560 --> 34:38.480
If you've ever visited that website, Will It Blend? Forget it. Forget it.

34:38.480 --> 34:44.760
All right, anyhow, let's move on to Will It Come Out, talking about some new release dates

34:44.760 --> 34:48.240
and what games are in your future. We'll start off with Europe.

34:48.240 --> 34:54.600
Well, for our friends over there, there is some actually sort of cool stuff coming out.

34:54.600 --> 34:58.920
There is, as soon as this works for me, there we go. We have Pirates of the Burning Sea

34:58.920 --> 35:06.280
on the 22nd. We have Advanced Wars Dark Conflict and Burnout Paradise on the 25th. We have

35:06.280 --> 35:13.000
Cruisin for Wii, Donkey Kong Jet Race, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Foster's Home for

35:13.000 --> 35:20.780
Imaginary Friends, Imagination Invades on DS, FDC World Darts Championship 2008, Fantasy

35:20.780 --> 35:26.280
Star Universe Ambition of Illuminus, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, and finally, Universe

35:26.280 --> 35:31.360
at War Earth Assault for PC.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.360
That it?

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
Yeah.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Doesn't seem like that busy of a week over there.

35:34.360 --> 35:41.080
Well, I guess all of the people who are addicted to PSU will be happy.

35:41.080 --> 35:47.600
Well, it's not a very busy week over in Japan either, but I'm going out of turn. It's actually

35:47.600 --> 35:49.600
supposed to be the U.S. states next. My bad.

35:49.600 --> 35:57.600
I can wait. Anyways, in the U.S. we have a pretty good week of stuff coming out. My personal

35:57.600 --> 36:02.320
favorite, No More Heroes, is coming out for the Wii. Definitely worth picking up. If you

36:02.320 --> 36:07.060
don't have a Wii, maybe you'll like this for the DS, Advanced Wars Days of Ruin. Looks

36:07.060 --> 36:08.060
pretty awesome.

36:08.060 --> 36:13.920
Let's see, Pirates of the Burning Sea for the PC. We have Burnout Paradise coming out

36:13.920 --> 36:18.840
in Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you're looking for more of a casual game, Endless

36:18.840 --> 36:24.460
Ocean on the Wii. You can swim around with the fishies. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic

36:24.460 --> 36:32.280
Games on the DS. One Piece Unlimited Adventure on the Wii. Iridium Runners on Playstation

36:32.280 --> 36:41.280
2. It's a piece of crap. Rainbow Islands Evolution on the PSP. Hopefully you'll be able to get

36:41.280 --> 36:52.600
past Kawasaki Jet Ski, which is actually supposed to be like Wave Race, but probably not going

36:52.600 --> 36:57.760
to be because it's put out by Destiny and every game that they make sucks. But, cross

36:57.760 --> 36:59.960
our fingers, maybe someday their games won't suck.

36:59.960 --> 37:05.000
I'm just going to say this about Rainbow Islands on the PSP. I do love Rainbow Islands, the

37:05.000 --> 37:09.600
original Rainbow Islands game, and that is where my love for the series ends. None of

37:09.600 --> 37:12.640
the games after that were really worth, you know, getting excited about.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.480
Okay, now we'll go over to Japanese Re-

37:14.480 --> 37:16.320
What about Paracel Stars?

37:16.320 --> 37:19.360
That's different. I mean, you could say all those games are in the Bubble Bobble universe,

37:19.360 --> 37:20.360
I suppose, but, you know.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.520
Yeah, Paracel Stars was great.

37:21.520 --> 37:26.420
Paracel Stars was pretty cool. Anyway, going over to Japanese release dates, not a lot

37:26.420 --> 37:31.340
on the Xbox 360, but you do have on the Playstation 3 this week, Juice 2, which I think was delayed

37:31.340 --> 37:34.720
from last week because it came out on all the other systems last week. There really

37:34.720 --> 37:38.880
isn't a lot to speak of otherwise on the next gen systems, but on the current gen systems,

37:38.880 --> 37:43.000
such as Playstation 2, or, I don't know, is it high time for us to start calling it last

37:43.000 --> 37:47.160
gen now? The Playstation 2 is really last gen and current gen is, I guess, last gen.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.160
Who knows? Who cares?

37:48.160 --> 37:49.640
How about we just call it the PS2?

37:49.640 --> 37:54.620
How about we just call it the PS2? Coming to the PS2, a game called Lucky Star, also

37:54.620 --> 37:59.400
a game called Tokka Race Driver 3 Ultimate Racing Simulator come out this week as well

37:59.400 --> 38:05.720
on the Playstation 2. Going to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Daikokai

38:05.720 --> 38:11.880
Jidai 4 Rota Nova moves in to the best hits from Koei, and that's a price reduction. The

38:11.880 --> 38:16.100
only really new game that looks like it's coming out over there is you get Hijoguchi

38:16.100 --> 38:22.280
Exit DS. There's another Mahjong game coming out on the DS as well. The Sims 2 Cast Away

38:22.280 --> 38:27.480
also comes out on the Nintendo DS. And the Prince of Tennis Driving Smash Side King.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.800
That's an interesting anime.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.320
That's right. You two can be the Prince of Tennis in the privacy of your own home.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.800
I'd rather be the Prince of the Cosmos.

38:35.800 --> 38:41.000
On the Sony PSP, not a whole lot of stuff, but you do have a Winning Eleven Ubiquitous

38:41.000 --> 38:45.120
Evolution 2008 coming out on the PSP. A couple other games getting price reductions, such

38:45.120 --> 38:51.200
as Luminous 2. That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.960
That's all happy and good. Well, speaking of things that are happy and good, there was

38:55.960 --> 39:00.200
a, well I'm sure that people have heard about this by now, but there was a guy named Paxton

39:00.200 --> 39:07.200
Galvanek, who rescued two victims from an overturned SUV in North Carolina. And this

39:08.560 --> 39:12.420
guy's supposed to be pretty cool because he, you know, assessed the situation, treated

39:12.420 --> 39:19.260
their wounds like with perfect first aid, kept them alive, and his medical background

39:19.260 --> 39:22.080
consists of playing America's Army.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.080
Wow.

39:24.080 --> 39:29.160
Apparently there's a classroom in there, and part of the classroom area is basically all

39:29.160 --> 39:33.680
the stuff they go through in basic, which is including a medic class, so that you learn

39:33.680 --> 39:39.080
basic first aid. And when he witnessed the accident, he basically went right into that

39:39.080 --> 39:45.720
mode and, you know, he, the first person he treated was someone who had lost two fingers,

39:45.720 --> 39:50.600
and so he used a towel to stop the bleeding and held their hand over their head, which

39:50.600 --> 39:56.080
is, I mean, I've got a full first aid certification because I have to as a massage therapist,

39:56.080 --> 39:59.880
and that's the first thing that you do. You see who's more injured, and you, you know,

39:59.880 --> 40:04.040
if they're bleeding, you hold their hand over their head and, you know, have them do that.

40:04.040 --> 40:08.800
And he also treated somebody for a head wound too, so that by the time someone arrived,

40:08.800 --> 40:13.920
which I think is kind of funny because it said it was a soldier that showed up to help

40:13.920 --> 40:20.920
them out, everybody was fine. And he actually, I think it's pretty cool, though, if they're

40:20.920 --> 40:25.920
putting in, like, actual real first aid techniques in that game, then that's pretty cool.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
By chance, did he play Trauma Center as well?

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
I don't think so.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.920
Because you can learn a little bit from playing Trauma Center.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.920
Like, we're not to cut people?

40:33.920 --> 40:37.920
You can stitch up somebody by, you know, waving furiously, and then you can also stop time

40:37.920 --> 40:39.920
and slow down time if you use your psychic powers.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.920
Star, you can totally, like, heal them completely, wow.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.920
Okay, so maybe America's Army is a little more practical, but...

40:47.920 --> 40:52.920
Well, I mean, that was the whole point of that game, though, is to show, you know, what

40:52.920 --> 40:57.920
it's supposed to be like to go through, you know, basic and be out, you know, in the field

40:57.920 --> 41:03.920
and everything. And I actually think that's kind of cool that someone could just pick

41:03.920 --> 41:07.920
up from that and learn and use it actually in a real life situation.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.920
I think it's also very healthy for the video game scene to actually get a video game saves

41:12.920 --> 41:17.920
life as opposed to stupid kid shoots his brother over a video game type news story, you know?

41:17.920 --> 41:20.920
So, just, it's nice to have a change.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.920
Like, I was 28 years old.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.920
Who actually plays a medic in, like, America's Army?

41:25.920 --> 41:30.920
I mean, seriously, it's like, I want to be the medic! Ooh!

41:30.920 --> 41:34.920
You know what, it's required to have first aid training when you go in the Army.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.920
It's a game!

41:35.920 --> 41:40.920
There's a lot of people that go into the Army to study doctor type stuff, you know?

41:40.920 --> 41:43.920
Here at the end of America's Army 2, they all become rock stars and have tons of women

41:43.920 --> 41:47.920
and, like, live in mansions, because that's what the military is supposed to do.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.920
It's going to give you women in mansions.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.920
I don't think so. I don't think that's how they advertise it.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.920
Yeah. Sure, they do.

41:55.920 --> 42:00.920
I think it's more of the be all you can be and going into the Army can strengthen yourself.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
Whatever.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.920
I think it's like, Mike, yay.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.920
I think it's like when people are playing an MMO and they pick their class, it's like

42:08.920 --> 42:14.920
the same people who would pick a priest because they like to assist and, like, heal people.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.920
That's my theory.

42:17.920 --> 42:23.920
And, of course, our chat room is breaking out into a chorus of, heal please, heal please.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
I don't know.

42:24.920 --> 42:29.920
Good for him for actually, you know, being able to help them, although it's very coincidental

42:29.920 --> 42:33.920
that he actually learned something from this game from, you know, because it's usually

42:33.920 --> 42:38.920
it's like, okay, I hit A and then they heal. Okay, that didn't work right, you know.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.920
Have you ever played America's Army?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.920
No, I have not played America's Army.

42:42.920 --> 42:46.920
It is a rigorous training process just to start the game.

42:46.920 --> 42:51.920
Like, they make you take tests before you get your gun and then it jams.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.920
Sounds like fun. Sounds like a lot of fun.

42:54.920 --> 42:59.920
LF-10,000M, Iraq instance. Tank and healer needed. Please send tell.

42:59.920 --> 43:05.920
Well, if people are, you know, buying the game for the purpose of what it is as a simulation,

43:05.920 --> 43:07.920
then it needs to be that in depth.

43:07.920 --> 43:11.920
Because, I mean, really the game is just a marketing tool for the Army anyway.

43:11.920 --> 43:12.920
It is, but.

43:12.920 --> 43:16.920
And now this kid is going to be the poster child of that game.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.920
Look, see what America's Army can do?

43:18.920 --> 43:21.920
Now imagine what would happen if you joined the real military.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.920
I was just reading the thing over and saying, you know, when he was talking about what he did

43:25.920 --> 43:29.920
and I was like, that is proper first aid. That's what you're supposed to do.

43:29.920 --> 43:33.920
So, pay attention. Kudos to you.

43:33.920 --> 43:39.920
Hooray. So, I guess you really can't stitch up somebody by going like this and flailing your arm about.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.920
I refuse to believe it, Rob.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.920
Alright, let's move on.

43:43.920 --> 43:48.920
Anyways, something along the same lines as America's Army.

43:48.920 --> 43:56.920
Okay, maybe not. But apparently the porn industry has dropped their backing for HD DVD.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.920
No!

44:00.920 --> 44:05.920
And dozens of Xbox 360 owners cry out in pain all at once.

44:05.920 --> 44:10.920
I'm going to put HD DVD player on Craigslist tomorrow.

44:10.920 --> 44:15.920
I mean, I don't know if it's everybody, but one studio in particular, Digital Playground,

44:15.920 --> 44:20.920
has decided to abandon HD DVD and stick solely with Blu-Ray.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.920
Good for them, I guess.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
But not every studio.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.920
Not every studio, as a lot of people are reporting. It's just Digital Playground.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.920
It wasn't... never mind, I'm not going to say it.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.920
And, you know, I don't know.

44:35.920 --> 44:40.920
To be honest, I... let's...

44:40.920 --> 44:43.920
Sorry, Irene and I are giggling like three-year-olds over here.

44:43.920 --> 44:48.920
Irene's all, you're just hoping it's not Falcon or Colt, huh?

44:48.920 --> 44:52.920
No, I mean, it's one studio... I mean, how many porn studios are out there, seriously?

44:52.920 --> 44:53.920
Billions!

44:53.920 --> 44:54.920
There's a ton of them.

44:54.920 --> 45:00.920
But let's see what Digital Playground has to offer us, you know, because...

45:00.920 --> 45:04.920
Okay, I mean, seriously, let's see here.

45:04.920 --> 45:11.920
They're top-selling titles that you may be missing if you have HD DVD and you want it in HD.

45:11.920 --> 45:15.920
Jack's Teen America 19,

45:15.920 --> 45:18.920
Mrs. Bee Haven,

45:18.920 --> 45:20.920
Jessie's Juice,

45:20.920 --> 45:22.920
Jannikova and Blu,

45:22.920 --> 45:24.920
Forbidden Tales,

45:24.920 --> 45:28.920
Jack's Big Tit Show number four,

45:28.920 --> 45:31.920
Hush! and Jessie Jean's Scream.

45:31.920 --> 45:38.920
Although, to their credit, though, they did produce the Pirates film, and Pirates was hilarious.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.920
Hilariously bad.

45:40.920 --> 45:48.920
MacMan suggests that the PlayStation 3's newest games, Drake's Penis, Ratchet and Dick, and Heavenly Sword.

45:48.920 --> 45:52.920
But here's the thing, though.

45:52.920 --> 45:58.920
They may have stopped making HD DVDs, but they still sell them.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.920
They still have quite a bit of stuff on there.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.920
And besides, anyone that actually watches a lot of porn anyways, they don't buy their porn.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.920
I mean, come on, this is the internet revolution, you know?

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
Who actually buys porn nowadays?

46:11.920 --> 46:14.920
And you can find plenty of it in Divx out there.

46:14.920 --> 46:19.920
And remember, your PlayStation 3 also plays Divx, and hopefully Xbox 360 will at some point soon.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.920
Or you can stream stuff.

46:21.920 --> 46:25.920
I believe Xbox 360 is already playing Divx now after their last patch.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.920
Yeah, yeah.

46:27.920 --> 46:32.920
Because I was watching, it wasn't porn, it was a legitimate television show,

46:32.920 --> 46:37.920
but I was watching Cat House Girls that I downloaded from the internet in Divx on the Xbox 360.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.920
So I'm pretty sure it supports Divx.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.920
So crisis averted.

46:41.920 --> 46:43.920
Exactly.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.920
Anyhow, there's always Porn02 on your Wii, by the way.

46:46.920 --> 46:49.920
Not that we're telling you how to do that.

46:49.920 --> 46:54.920
Anyhow, if you don't want to use your PlayStation 3 to watch pirates or other types of porn,

46:54.920 --> 46:58.920
you can use it for more legitimate purposes, such as playing SingStar.

46:58.920 --> 47:03.920
However, apparently the SingStar SingStore is not that great.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.920
Remember when we first saw the SingStar SingStore at a previous E3

47:07.920 --> 47:12.920
and it looked like every song ever made looked like it was going to be in there with all these videos and so on?

47:12.920 --> 47:16.920
Sony had promised 350 music tracks.

47:16.920 --> 47:21.920
Well, so far there are less than 100 songs, apparently, out there.

47:21.920 --> 47:23.920
Apparently the server keeps going down.

47:23.920 --> 47:27.920
There really aren't a lot of updates in the SingStore news section.

47:27.920 --> 47:32.920
So SingStar does not appear to be doing quite as well as people originally thought.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.920
I'm glad they can underdeliver like normal.

47:34.920 --> 47:38.920
Now, however, to be fair, Sony did make a response a little later in the week.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.920
SingStar Studios said that downloadable songs for SingStore are on the way.

47:42.920 --> 47:46.920
The original vision was supposed to be 350, but they missed the mark.

47:46.920 --> 47:52.920
However, they are going to put out 18 new tracks on January 18th, which should have already passed,

47:52.920 --> 47:58.920
15 English songs and three Spanish ones, including David Bowie and Blur.

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
Not bad.

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
I like Blur.

48:00.920 --> 48:04.920
And February 4th is supposed to see the launch of even more songs.

48:04.920 --> 48:07.920
That's okay. They only missed the mark by 200 songs.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.920
Good thing they're looking at 18.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.920
No, 15 of those are in English.

48:12.920 --> 48:16.920
Well, they're supposed to be updating it now twice a week.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.920
Sorry, not twice a week, twice a month.

48:18.920 --> 48:20.920
That's okay. No one needs to be playing SingStar anyways.

48:20.920 --> 48:23.920
It's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.

48:23.920 --> 48:28.920
Karaoke is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of entertainment, okay?

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
How do you really feel?

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
I enjoyed it.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.920
Plus they have the ability to upload videos of yourself singing.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.920
Who would do that? That's lame.

48:36.920 --> 48:40.920
I don't know what to tell you.

48:40.920 --> 48:45.920
Well, we do have a situation.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.920
Uh-oh.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.920
Do I have to call out the troops?

48:50.920 --> 48:51.920
No.

48:51.920 --> 48:52.920
Do we have to get a medic?

48:52.920 --> 48:55.920
No.

48:55.920 --> 49:00.920
I'm sorry for all of our European listeners who are excited about Uncharted.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
It's not in 1080i.

49:02.920 --> 49:04.920
Sorry.

49:04.920 --> 49:08.920
It was only added to the U.S. version later in development,

49:08.920 --> 49:10.920
and the PAL version is not going to have it.

49:10.920 --> 49:12.920
Thank God. I thought there was a real problem.

49:12.920 --> 49:17.920
They said that it would delay the game's release because they have to test it for QA.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.920
So, sorry.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.920
Wait a minute. Game developers are QA-ing their games again?

49:21.920 --> 49:22.920
That's good news.

49:22.920 --> 49:23.920
Okay, folks.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.920
It would be 480p.

49:24.920 --> 49:31.920
If you really have been out of shape about that, remember, PlayStation 3 games are region-free.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.920
So, if you really need your 1080i, to be honest, you're not going to tell the difference between...

49:35.920 --> 49:41.920
If you've got an HDTV, then it doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.

49:41.920 --> 49:42.920
No, it shouldn't.

49:42.920 --> 49:46.920
So get it. Import it.

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
And there's your workaround.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.920
Hooray! Workaround!

49:50.920 --> 49:58.920
Speaking of workarounds, they finally released the custom firmware from DarkAlex,

49:58.920 --> 50:03.920
the guy behind all those wonderful PSP custom firmwares, released all the popular ones.

50:03.920 --> 50:11.920
He has just released 3.80 M33, and it will give you all the wonderful features of 3.8,

50:11.920 --> 50:18.920
including the streaming internet radio and all that fun stuff, plus a bunch of new features as well.

50:18.920 --> 50:24.920
One of the cool things I liked about this, actually, is once you've loaded 3.8 in there,

50:24.920 --> 50:30.920
any additional firmware updates that happen to come along from the custom firmware scene,

50:30.920 --> 50:37.920
you can actually update them over the internet, just like you would your normal PSP firmwares.

50:37.920 --> 50:45.920
So you can just download an update and update it right there, just like you would any official firmware,

50:45.920 --> 50:48.920
which I did, and it was pretty cool.

50:48.920 --> 50:54.920
But that's available right now for PSP Slims, and they also have one for the PSP Fat, I guess,

50:54.920 --> 51:04.920
that also has some of the stuff for the 1.5 firmware, so you can run your homebrew crap.

51:04.920 --> 51:10.920
But try as they may, they'll never stop the people from breaking those firmwares.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.920
Do you think at some point Sony's just going to give up?

51:12.920 --> 51:14.920
No.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.920
I guess they really think that they're going to win.

51:18.920 --> 51:21.920
I guess it keeps some people employed or what have you, I don't know.

51:21.920 --> 51:30.920
Anyhow, one thing that perhaps DarkAlex maybe wants to work on soon is solving the Dust problem on the PlayStation 3,

51:30.920 --> 51:34.920
because, no, I'm not trying to make a joke that nobody's playing their PlayStation 3 so they're getting dusty,

51:34.920 --> 51:40.920
but remember, remember, like, Dust killed somebody's PlayStation, like Sony refused to do anything about it or something like that?

51:40.920 --> 51:45.920
The guy ended up getting a refund from the credit card company or something like that?

51:45.920 --> 51:49.920
Well, Dust is obviously a huge issue for PlayStations.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.920
Dude, that PS3 right there looks like someone put it under their sawhorse when they were cutting some wood or something.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
I mean, this is ridiculous.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
They collect dust, though, really easily.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.920
They're dust magnets, I'm telling you.

51:59.920 --> 52:02.920
Well, Hori makes a bunch of different peripherals.

52:02.920 --> 52:07.920
They're like a peripheral making company, and they are coming out with a Dust Guard Kit 3.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.920
It guards all four of your air vents.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.920
It puts a filter that, you know, prevents dust and, of course, cigarette smoke from getting inside the PlayStation 3

52:15.920 --> 52:18.920
for all those people that smoke next to their PlayStation 3s.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.920
It also covers up the open ports and so on.

52:21.920 --> 52:27.920
So insert your dust cap joke here, but there is officially a dust cap coming for the PlayStation 3.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.920
That's actually pretty cool.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.920
That company makes really good stuff.

52:30.920 --> 52:36.920
We got a couple of controllers that they put out, the GameCube ones back in the day.

52:36.920 --> 52:41.920
I want a mod that makes my PS3 smoke a cigarette, because that would make it even cooler.

52:41.920 --> 52:47.920
Or you could just not smoke next to your PlayStation 3 or put it in a well vent.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
Oh, yeah.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.920
Take a hit off this PS3, you'll love it.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.920
Suddenly your PlayStation 3 is glowing.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.920
Want to get high?

52:57.920 --> 52:59.920
Look at the website, though.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.920
Did you look at the ad for it?

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
No.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.920
The connector, it's actually pretty cool.

53:05.920 --> 53:11.920
Looking at how all of this fits in, I think it's a very good idea.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.920
How it all pieces together?

53:13.920 --> 53:17.920
Well, they said that it's charged with static to attract the dust.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.920
You know those static wipes for dusting?

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
It's the same theory on it.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.920
That's actually pretty cool.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.920
Wow.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.920
I'll link the ad in the chatroom.

53:28.920 --> 53:29.920
Interesting.

53:29.920 --> 53:31.920
The ad is available at hoary.jp.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.920
Just browse to their products for the Dust Guard Kit 3.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
I know.

53:35.920 --> 53:39.920
I think that GameStop still carries a lot of the hoary products.

53:39.920 --> 53:41.920
So, shouldn't have any problem.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
Very cool.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
Dust Cap 3.

53:43.920 --> 53:47.920
I was always hoping it would come to the U.S.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.920
Wow, let's move on with some more news.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.920
Well, in other news.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.920
And, you know, we said we weren't going to talk about this guy again.

53:54.920 --> 53:59.920
But he who shall not be named keeps reappearing.

53:59.920 --> 54:01.920
Has he opened the Chamber of Secrets this time?

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
He's trying.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.920
He's trying to open up a can of drama is what he's doing.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.920
Oh, really?

54:07.920 --> 54:09.920
No way.

54:09.920 --> 54:10.920
Yeah, really.

54:10.920 --> 54:17.920
Anyway, I will say it for the benefit of those who have not listened for a while

54:17.920 --> 54:21.920
and don't know who the heck we're talking about when we speak of he who shall not be named.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.920
But Jack Thompson, the butthead.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.920
Sends shivers down my spine.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.920
Lord Voldemort.

54:28.920 --> 54:33.920
He said that there were quotes that were attributed to him by British newspapers

54:33.920 --> 54:38.920
that were a total fabrication about Buzz.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.920
And he's quoted saying, I was never interviewed about Buzz.

54:41.920 --> 54:45.920
I never heard about it until I was quoted having allegedly said this about it.

54:45.920 --> 54:50.920
And what he was quoted as saying is that video games have hurt far more people than they have helped.

54:50.920 --> 54:56.920
And he said that what he would say.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.920
Well, I'm just going to read his quote because he speaks in circles.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.920
I would never say what I am quoted as saying in any context as the quotation,

55:04.920 --> 55:08.920
regardless of what it is applied to, is absurd on its face.

55:08.920 --> 55:15.920
How in the world could anyone prove and or quantify that games have hurt more people than they have helped?

55:15.920 --> 55:19.920
That sounds to me like he's lying.

55:19.920 --> 55:23.920
You know, every time this guy opens his mouth, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.920
Do you get a little angsty?

55:25.920 --> 55:31.920
Real quick, I was just going to mention that Take-Two actually proactively sued him,

55:31.920 --> 55:34.920
so that's also going on right now, too.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.920
You know, Loki cut me off, and that makes me even more angsty,

55:37.920 --> 55:40.920
so you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

55:40.920 --> 55:56.920
Music

55:56.920 --> 56:03.920
I'm an FU to my washing machine for not wanting to wash my hoodie by itself and imbalancing,

56:03.920 --> 56:06.920
because I really wanted to wear my Jack hoodie tonight.

56:06.920 --> 56:11.920
My nightmare before Christmas day, and I couldn't because of the wet.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.920
I'm really not very angsty.

56:14.920 --> 56:15.920
All right.

56:15.920 --> 56:22.920
No, an FU to my cat for throwing up a hairball on my massage diploma,

56:22.920 --> 56:27.920
so now I have to go get a reprint of it and my transcripts, and I have to get reprints of those.

56:27.920 --> 56:31.920
And an FU to my folder from when I first started school,

56:31.920 --> 56:38.920
because it has all of my massage clover seats in it, so that I can have myself one big fat tax write-off.

56:38.920 --> 56:43.920
An FU to the company I work for for not claiming my W-2 yet.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
For real?

56:44.920 --> 56:45.920
I want money!

56:45.920 --> 56:46.920
Me too.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.920
Loki, you're FUs.

56:48.920 --> 56:53.920
Um, FU to the theater that I went and saw Cloverfield in,

56:53.920 --> 56:57.920
because the entire time the front left speaker was making a

56:57.920 --> 57:01.920
noise, so it was really annoying.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.920
The entire movie.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.920
Are you sure it wasn't just the monster?

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
I'm pretty sure.

57:06.920 --> 57:09.920
And we went and complained to management, and they're like, you know,

57:09.920 --> 57:12.920
a bunch of little kids running around trying to figure out how to fix the speaker.

57:12.920 --> 57:14.920
The monster didn't go have some fourth meal at Taco Bell?

57:14.920 --> 57:15.920
I'm pretty sure.

57:15.920 --> 57:16.920
All right.

57:18.920 --> 57:19.920
Is that it?

57:19.920 --> 57:20.920
That's it.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.920
My FU of the week goes to the damn flies in here,

57:23.920 --> 57:26.920
who have not been served yet with the swatter of justice.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
Are they hiding right now?

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
I think they are.

57:28.920 --> 57:30.920
I haven't seen one in a little while.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.920
But FU to the fact that the flies hide all week long,

57:32.920 --> 57:33.920
and then they come out on Sunday.

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
I hate that.

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
Anyhow.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.920
Rice Princess, Nathan, do you guys have anything you want to add?

57:38.920 --> 57:41.920
Flies just like listening to the show, geez.

57:41.920 --> 57:45.920
Um, FU to being sick and, you know,

57:45.920 --> 57:47.920
not being able to hear out of my left ear,

57:47.920 --> 57:50.920
so I sound like an old woman, like, eh?

57:50.920 --> 57:52.920
Can I do Janet again, Johnny?

57:52.920 --> 57:54.920
Like, yeah, it's annoying.

57:54.920 --> 57:59.920
And then I also second the FU to Cloverfield audiences.

57:59.920 --> 58:01.920
Wait, no, you just said the theater, right?

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
The audio.

58:02.920 --> 58:04.920
Well, I'd say FU to the audience,

58:04.920 --> 58:06.920
because they're stupid and immature,

58:06.920 --> 58:10.920
and they're, like, yelling out what they thought of a movie at the end.

58:10.920 --> 58:13.920
That's why I don't go see movies on opening weekend ever.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.920
Because of kids.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.920
Yeah, there were a bunch of kids.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.920
It's not like I went out and said, you know, my opinion on the movie,

58:20.920 --> 58:23.920
because I don't care to do that, but people do and they're stupid,

58:23.920 --> 58:25.920
FU!

58:27.920 --> 58:31.920
My only FU is for Nintendo.

58:31.920 --> 58:34.920
I love you guys, but you gotta really hurry up

58:34.920 --> 58:38.920
and make available on the Virtual Console

58:38.920 --> 58:43.920
Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.

58:43.920 --> 58:50.920
Some people haven't played it and don't know how great it is.

58:55.920 --> 58:58.920
My games are better.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.920
I have one.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.920
FU didn't know Guardian Legend either.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.920
Greatest 8-bit game of all time.

59:06.920 --> 59:08.920
We've been saying that for a long time on this show.

59:08.920 --> 59:12.920
But I do agree, Super Mario RPG would make a fine addition to Virtual Console.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.920
But don't keep holding your breath.

59:15.920 --> 59:16.920
Anyhow.

59:16.920 --> 59:19.920
Anyway, Loki, anyway.

59:21.920 --> 59:25.920
So, this is kind of exciting and hopefully this comes out in the Wii,

59:25.920 --> 59:29.920
because this would be one of those games that could utilize that whipping motion

59:29.920 --> 59:31.920
from the Wii Remote.

59:31.920 --> 59:34.920
But Leisure Suit Larry, box office bust,

59:34.920 --> 59:38.920
is coming to consoles and the PC fall of 2008.

59:38.920 --> 59:42.920
And yes, if you don't remember Leisure Suit Larry,

59:42.920 --> 59:45.920
well, then you need to look it up on the internet,

59:45.920 --> 59:48.920
because I'm not going to explain it to you, but it's awesome.

59:48.920 --> 59:52.920
Except for that last game, because that last game blew really bad,

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
and not in a good way.

59:53.920 --> 59:56.920
Well, if the last game was bad, what's going to make this game good?

59:56.920 --> 59:58.920
Because it's not the last game.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.920
But it's scheduled right now for, it looks like,

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.920
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and mobile phones,

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.920
and is being developed by Team17, the group behind the Worms games.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.920
Nice.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920
Oh, cool.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.920
And the script, I guess, is being penned by Happy Madison Productions' Alan Covert.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.920
Is that Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison or something?

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.920
Well, Happy Madison is Adam Sandler's production group.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
Oh, okay.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.920
And Alan Covert, he's done such wonderful movies as,

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.920
okay, I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, Grandma's Boy,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.920
Eight Crazy Nights, Mr. Diesel and Nicky, Big Daddy,

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.920
Deuce Bigalow, Mail Jiggalow, Waterboy,

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.920
pretty much every other Adam Sandler movie that's been out there, Happy Gilmore.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.920
So, you know what, if only that game had Adam Sandler

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.920
and the whole Happy Madison group doing the voices in there,

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
that might be cool.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.920
Because Rob Schneider in that game, that could be cool.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920
You can do it!

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
All night long.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.920
They should make a Leisure Suit Larry movie, Happy Madison.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
That would be cool.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.920
You never know, anything's possible.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.920
All right, well, part A of our program is coming to a close,

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.920
but not before we pay a little respect to our elders

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.920
by nodding at the classic games,

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.920
and we do that with a little segment we call

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.920
Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.920
So, Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the kids this week

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.920
to play a little bit of?

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.920
The game I'm referring to is one of the last ones

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.920
that came out on the Sega Saturn in America.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.920
One of the games, I actually, it's one of my favorite games,

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.920
is Burning Rangers, which is also put out by Sonic Team.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Who can do no wrong?

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.920
I love Sonic Team.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.920
Anyway, the game is basically set in the future

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.920
where the old Sonic games,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.920
where the only few hazards remaining is one of them is fire.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.920
So these are futuristic fire fighters who use their super sentai powers

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.920
to extinguish flames and rescue people.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.920
And after you beat the game once,

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.920
you actually have a random level generator

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.920
that you can use to change the game each time you go play it.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.920
As far as the technical side of it,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.920
for people who were Saturn fans,

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.920
you know that the Saturn was,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.920
it wasn't very good with transparency,

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.920
but they did it for this game.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.920
It's one of the games that used it.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.920
And also, the first game that used ADX audio compression.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920
On top of that, while there hasn't been a sequel,

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920
it's been referenced to quite a number of times.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920
In Phantasy Star Online,

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.920
there was a central dome fire swirl level

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.920
where one of the main characters from Burning Rangers

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.920
asked you to help him put out fires and help people,

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.920
and had the music from the Japanese version of Burning Rangers,

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.920
which was angels with burning hearts.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.920
Two of the vocal songs were in Sonic Pinball Party.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.920
Also, the theme song was in Samba de Amigo,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.920
if you remember, as one of the downloadable songs.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.920
And could make a return when Samba de Amigo comes out on the Wii a little later, right?

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:24.920
You could actually access it in, I believe, in the second Samba 2000.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.920
Also, Phantasy Star Universe had an event called Operation Firebreak

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.920
that uses the same song,

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.920
and it's on the planet that was involved in the game.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.920
And it's actually, all the soundtrack was designed by the guitarist

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.920
for a British band called UFO.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.920
So, Burning Rangers is cool.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.920
There you have it, your classic game of the week, Burning Rangers,

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.920
a game I never played, but maybe I ought to.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.920
Well, I will bring that in the side and over one day.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920
I think you should.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.920
I think it's funny that it goes for bucks on eBay,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.920
and I got mine at a convention swap meet for 30 bucks.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.920
Wow. Sometimes you find little gems there.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.920
So, there you go.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.920
All right, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of our show.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.920
But as you know, Orange Launch Radio is divvied up into two parts every week,

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.920
so we will be right back after just a little bit with Orange Launch Radio, Part B.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.920
Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.920
and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
