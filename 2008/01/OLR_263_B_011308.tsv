487	5571	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5891	14757	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15458	19140	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19881	26425	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this part B of our program.
26846	29888	So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
30325	39747	Yes, there's some big news coming from Nintendo Power talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.
40648	50350	And apparently the game's titled Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me.
50550	52030	But, you know, what do I know?
52550	53331	Is that a bad thing?
53991	57792	No, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG?
57972	58532	Seriously.
58912	59112	Well...
59919	63240	A, Bioware didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.
63600	63861	So?
64561	66141	No, I agree that it doesn't matter.
66201	68102	I don't care if Square does it or, you know.
68802	71483	But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?
71523	74004	Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.
74324	76225	They were the closest thing I've played to that since.
76805	77926	I miss Mario RPG.
79907	81467	But the Sonic thing looks pretty good.
81567	86489	They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.
87309	88130	So that's kind of neat.
88270	88970	Oh, that's kind of cool.
91470	91770	I don't know.
92170	97656	Don't know much about it yet, but it should be the next issue, I guess.
97996	100558	DarkSakura, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.
100618	106344	Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out, or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?
107825	112109	If it's not done by Sonic Team, it doesn't exist in my universe.
112149	112530	How's that?
112650	113110	Oh, snap.
114291	114792	Well said.
115666	123734	Alright, well, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to and one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.
124194	131421	But some fans are kind of pissed off because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere.
132201	136384	It's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC, but no love for the Nintendo Wii.
136825	146051	However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.
146832	147913	Cue the petition!
149154	153137	Almost immediately an internet petition went up, bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.
153417	156239	So they're taking a page out of Konami's book there.
156895	161459	Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then we'll make the product.
161699	165482	Oh, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.
167444	169826	Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.
169906	173389	Quote, it will largely depend on what the fans want for the future Bionic Commando.
173709	178573	If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.
181095	185779	Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's got people very happy.
187008	188569	Anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?
189729	190130	Not yet.
190410	197292	It's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007 because everybody said it was great, but I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.
197673	208717	There's a DS version now where you can basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff and sword fight and kill people and stuff.
209297	215540	But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers and picking pockets and doing other stuff.
215860	216160	Wait, wait.
217236	218957	You can use a stylus for interrogating.
218977	219937	So what do you do?
219957	220717	You just poke them?
220737	222178	Poke, poke, poke, poke.
222238	222598	Tell me.
222698	223819	Poke, poke, poke, poke.
223899	228421	And then you talk into the speaker part and go, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.
229081	229481	Like that.
231442	233463	Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game.
233483	234303	I don't know.
234323	235063	It could be interesting.
235124	236224	I think it'd be kind of cute.
236324	237344	It's supposed to be a prequel.
237364	238165	It looks kind of neat.
238645	238925	I don't know.
240906	242987	The Nyko Wireless Nunchuck.
243007	244788	I remember we talked about that a little bit ago.
247074	248936	Pretty useless device, I think.
249256	254940	But I guess if that little cord really bothers you, then great.
255401	256822	You can buy this.
256862	259304	That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.
260745	261125	Whatever.
261966	263407	How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?
263447	264067	That's what I want to know.
266509	264067	$30.
268751	269111	Never mind.
269151	271573	I can deal with it for $30.
272694	276737	Apparently, though, it did win a CNET CES Gaming Award
278106	279926	for Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.
281067	284027	You know, I forgot to talk about this this week, my game week.
284207	290329	I played some Ghost Squad and I bought those Nyko Perfect Shots.
291049	292409	The ones that look like the little pistols.
292709	293749	Those are fucking awesome.
294590	305052	And the other thing about Ghost Squad and why I love the game even more, they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper so that you don't use the B button as a trigger, you use the Z button so that you're actually firing it correctly.
305852	306012	So,
306601	315445	Hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters, will look to Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.
316625	318286	Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.
318306	320907	He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.
321387	324649	That's true, because you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.
326149	327170	What else was I going to say about this?
327450	328990	What do they get for getting this award?
329010	331131	Do you get a trophy or a plaque or just internet fame?
331471	332112	Internet fame.
332212	332512	I see.
332612	335213	Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about this device on the program.
335635	336456	I want another trophy.
336476	337276	I want a 2008 trophy.
358138	361940	I know, you had to go all the way to LA and you had to meet Adam Curry, poor you.
362100	366983	No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.
369105	370946	With his Bon Jovi hair.
371386	374608	I want a new 2008 trophy.
375308	376949	So what award can we win?
377189	379211	There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.
379231	381592	I'll have to look into that to make that happen.
382116	385058	Well, the year is young, and there are the Darwin Awards.
386218	387879	It's a little bit of a permanent solution.
387899	389360	Can we give ourselves a stupid award?
389400	390641	Can we do something really stupid?
390761	393603	But we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?
393963	395664	Robway says, make your own awards show.
395704	398685	Well, there are podcasts out there that make their own awards show.
399006	405909	Hell, the Gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.
407931	409091	You think we could team up with Sony?
409111	410332	They got nothing going for them, right?
412415	413056	All right, forget it.
413396	414477	Let's move on with the gaming news.
414517	416018	Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.
416078	419962	That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.
419982	421343	Yeah, I could use that too.
422324	426067	So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit.
426327	432032	But we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th, if a new one-up column is to be believed.
432312	437537	The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers both in Japan and abroad.
437884	439165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
468720	469080	News Trophy
498826	504148	Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of airtime, if that, and I'll say something brief.
505149	505869	Oh, it's so much fun.
506369	506670	All right.
508430	511452	By the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news, it's on YouTube.
511572	513533	Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.
513553	516194	They interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes, and that's what they used.
516594	517234	Oh, it's so much fun.
517815	518095	All right.
520543	520964	DarkSakura.com
540362	542904	Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.
543484	545045	You don't get a Golden Globe.
545425	548087	You get an aluminum foil ball.
548807	550368	Okay, and spray-painted gold.
550389	551649	All right, so there you have it.
551689	556372	So the Orange Lounge Radio Orangies, even though they're gold.
556512	556693	Yes.
556713	561336	We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.
562016	563377	Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight.
563417	563737	I don't know.
564538	566019	Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag.
566439	567459	And the envelope, please.
567540	569741	Who wins Orangie number one?
571564	572404	You're funny, Rob.
573725	576147	The first one is from TJ.
576187	577888	It says, That's a good excuse.
577908	578608	I have other crap to do.
578628	578808	I'm sorry.
598151	598471	Jenga the Game
621775	623876	Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.
623996	629897	Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.
630077	630817	I don't know if it's just me.
630837	632717	So there you have it.
634638	636078	So, next email.
636378	643160	With Bioshock, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Wii Play, Super Mario Galaxies, and an iPhone, this must be the best Christmas ever.
643940	649141	Yeah, I know this email's a bit late, but I felt I must comment on how especially kick-ass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.
649707	651008	Wait, is this the same email or a new one?
651028	651648	This is a different one.
651828	652848	Oh, who sent this one in?
653088	654469	This one's from Osfer.
654809	655049	Oh, okay.
656590	660251	Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.
661031	663572	As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.
663672	667814	It's so much fun to play and controls are nothing short of sexy.
669534	673616	I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies.
674016	676337	And some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.
676377	677878	Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.
678118	678798	What's Chapter 4, Rob?
680071	681551	Call of Duty 4 is fucking epic
702324	706149	You play the game to experience it yourself and then watch your jaw hit the floor.
706689	710474	Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?
711195	711375	No.
713918	714879	Not live, no.
715059	718063	You can listen to the podcast from any touchtone phone.
718724	720286	It's something, I want to say like,
721468	722689	You can't do it from a touch-tone phone?
723009	724269	Like a regular phone?
724650	726290	You can hear the podcast on a phone.
726390	730632	There's some service out there, free service, because I know one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.
731293	732813	She might have signed our podcast up for it.
732853	733434	I don't even know.
733554	734094	I don't remember.
734934	737015	But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.
737075	737576	I'll look it up.
737596	739637	There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.
739657	745479	I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work, but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.
747801	749041	Thanks for reading, as always.
749141	749401	Awesome.
752196	755678	You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.
757439	759480	This email comes from Stan.
761360	761721	Hi there.
762181	764962	I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.
765002	766963	Makes me wonder why I wasn't listening to you folks before.
768104	773106	After listening to your year-end wrap-up show, I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.
773226	773927	Well, do y'all?
774487	777688	I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit.
778369	778469	And...
779306	780907	If you guys had a booth or something.
781047	785510	Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.
785570	787251	That's what we usually do when we do our panels.
788112	790734	If not, then taping something while there.
790774	793696	I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.
793936	795917	I mean, actually, that's more what we do is we do the recording.
797558	800360	I don't know if anyone else in Chicago listens to your show, but I'm sure...
801209	802970	They're here somewhere, just never looked.
803091	805252	Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur 3?
805532	806533	I could really use a challenge.
807554	812257	I didn't get Soul Calibur 3 because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.
814179	816160	I like Soul Calibur 3, but maybe that's just me.
817921	822385	Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs to be played during your music portions.
822845	823686	Did I read that right?
824306	829610	I know you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands, I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.
829650	830731	You know, a rock band set up.
831383	837927	Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride Saxophone Ensemble and a few of us are big gamers and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.
838407	843830	Right now I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks, especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.
845749	849371	As you can guess, a sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.
849951	858715	I've tinkered around with arrangements before, but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience, then sure, all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.
858775	859395	So how about it?
859735	862056	Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?
862556	863337	I would say so, dude.
863357	864217	I played saxophone.
864657	865557	I don't see why not.
866118	872640	One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation, meaning like 10-minute songs are a little much.
872720	876522	But if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most.
876562	878643	I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while.
878903	882564	But if you have something radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat, I don't see why not.
882825	883405	Yeah, I don't see why not.
883865	889427	I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet, so I don't see why not.
890908	891148	Anyway...
891826	892447	Thanks so much.
892547	893288	Keep up the great work.
893389	895772	I really get a kick if this was read on the air.
895832	896934	One of these days I'll call in.
897094	897735	You should.
897755	898216	There you go.
898276	898857	You got a kick.
899137	899979	And you got an orangey.
901090	902171	Just for emailing us tonight.
902411	904532	By the way, I want to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.
904792	908855	The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone, it's called Podlines.
909275	913938	Now, we don't like totally endorse this because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.
913998	914278	I don't know.
914298	915218	I haven't done this in a long time.
915558	916599	But here's the phone number.
916719	919181	It's area code 650-523-6855.
919921	924484	I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.
924524	927085	Let's see what happens because I don't know what happens when you call this.
927806	930307	I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens or if we get an ad or what.
933923	938304	OneRingyDingy And it's busy.
939664	940905	I guess we've been taken off the air.
940985	941385	I don't know.
941985	944465	Well, he sent in another part to his email.
944785	945265	Alright, fine.
945666	948786	It says, Oops, I forgot, but have any of you watched Street Fighter the later years?
949206	949746	Yes, I have.
950527	951427	It's so damn funny.
951947	954807	Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2 will appreciate this.
954888	958268	I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.
958408	958968	Yay, gamers.
959749	961749	It's like, okay.
963036	963857	I've watched some of it.
963997	965118	It's pretty darn funny.
966178	966759	Good times.
967179	976526	And last, well, we actually got an email from our good buddy Rob, the two Bs, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.
977686	977987	Really?
978207	980488	Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.
980989	981269	Cool.
982110	989795	But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable cord.
990302	991983	for one of his video game pads.
992043	995086	They haven't said what the system was or anything.
995866	1001871	It said that the guy was playing a game and the father was trying to get him to stop.
1002291	1005754	He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.
1006875	1012720	The dad took out the power cable and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.
1015802	1016262	Interesting.
1017243	1019225	He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.
1020040	1020560	As you should be.
1021621	1024604	Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?
1024624	1025404	Last email.
1025725	1027966	You were just mad because he was playing right to speak.
1028187	1029568	Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.
1030088	1031689	No, I said last email.
1031870	1032490	Oh, and.
1032950	1034211	Oh, fine.
1035032	1035713	One more email then.
1035733	1036453	This one's important.
1036493	1037134	It's from Belgium.
1037474	1037914	Oh, cool.
1038255	1038415	Yes.
1039226	1040947	Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
1041067	1044910	I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming and I am a PC gamer.
1045330	1047251	It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.
1047831	1054655	I just want to say that I would appreciate very much if you could do a show at noon in your time zone like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.
1055836	1063121	Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.
1063561	1066663	I would love to do that sometime so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.
1067350	1072253	I always download the podcast to my PSP, so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.
1072674	1077757	I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live, it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.
1078517	1080739	Also, an interesting story perhaps.
1080759	1084501	Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.
1085082	1088384	We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.
1089044	1092727	With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007, the PS3 sold the most, closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.
1096698	1103985	Xbox 360 is the least popular console and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.
1104565	1106968	After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.
1107048	1108909	Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.
1110251	1112553	I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made...
1113240	1118502	A lot of people instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money on a next-generation console.
1119062	1126864	I have the feeling the Xbox Never was a really big success here, and so many people are more inclined to play PlayStation 3, although the 360 might have the best games so far.
1130103	1136048	Also, the casual gamers are of course going for the Wii over here too.
1136448	1145997	If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose, because it is the most innovative system and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.
1146177	1148939	Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Gritz, G-R-T-Z.
1150761	1153863	Oh, I'm sorry, that's in closing, his name is Martin.
1154944	1155665	Well, thank you for the email.
1156112	1158994	And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?
1159154	1160395	I have a three-day weekend coming up.
1161736	1162376	Too soon, though.
1162396	1164757	We want to get the word out, you know, so people know, you know.
1165338	1165758	Yeah, I know.
1165778	1167399	A three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.
1167479	1168660	We might have Marissa up here, too.
1168980	1169160	Huh?
1169320	1170441	We might have Marissa up here, too.
1170461	1171081	Oh, that would be good.
1171822	1174724	Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.
1174744	1180207	We'll just have to check our schedules because I know around, you know, Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know, things might get busy.
1180327	1181788	But we'll see.
1183206	1184106	Sometime in February.
1184146	1187547	I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.
1187567	1189528	We've done it before, like for pre-taping.
1189568	1192609	Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?
1193289	1193809	I don't see why not.
1194049	1194830	I don't see why not either.
1194910	1196910	We will make that happen for our overseas listeners.
1197630	1199211	We'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.
1199291	1203832	Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day week is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?
1203912	1205833	Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February?
1206633	1207153	President's Day?
1207753	1208374	I do believe so.
1208754	1209894	Maybe we can make it happen around then.
1210194	1210414	Maybe.
1210614	1211335	We'll check our schedules.
1212235	1212475	Okay.
1212755	1212955	All right.
1214246	1223613	Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with one and only Loki.
1224273	1224513	Yes.
1225194	1233580	Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that, there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it.
1234240	1235881	One of which was shown off at CES.
1236121	1243907	It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of
1244591	1246252	Rock Band Stage Kit GameStop GameStop
1274574	1289570	It's coming out around June for $100 and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show This actually sounds kind of epic You know what though?
1291110	1294635	If I still have $200 in store credit around that time, I'll pick it up.
1295456	1296717	That would be awesome.
1296938	1298159	We'll do it during the show.
1298219	1299902	We'll just leave it on during the show.
1300242	1300643	That's right.
1300663	1303506	We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Launch Radio one night.
1303686	1305128	Hopefully the webcam's back by then.
1305469	1305789	Yeah.
1306610	1307792	That would be awesome.
1309032	1310052	Light Show and Smoke.
1310072	1311513	Remind me not to be here for that show.
1312073	1312933	I know, seriously.
1313154	1321976	Because you can imagine just how, you know, it looks one way on the box, but then when you actually do it in person, it probably... It probably smells like farts or something.
1322016	1324877	It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.
1324897	1325478	Seriously, though.
1325498	1330699	And it's going to look like somebody... We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.
1331080	1332220	Why would you do this?
1332540	1336121	I mean, why would you play this, like, in your living room with smoke and stuff here?
1336401	1338022	I can't see the screen anymore.
1338362	1340303	You know, it's filling up the house full of smoke.
1340863	1344944	Macman in our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com says, Does it come with some weed, too?
1345004	1346805	That would be the true rocker experience.
1347925	1348265	I don't know.
1348345	1352627	It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.
1353207	1356628	So, I mean, you know, it's a pretty well-known company.
1356688	1359269	It's funny, but is it $100 funny?
1359469	1361270	I mean, like, how many of these are they really going to sell?
1361770	1363010	And let me put it this way.
1363090	1367812	If it is, like, an actual smoke machine, I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that, but...
1368649	1373472	Dude, you gotta, like, buy the liquid smoke for it, and, you know, that's expensive.
1374613	1376374	Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine!
1376414	1378696	What the hell are you gonna be doing playing with a smoke machine?
1378776	1382858	Like, you can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.
1383079	1383539	I don't know.
1383619	1384299	I think it'd be funny.
1385060	1388522	I think it'd be funny, too, just to do for one show, but Loki, $100 funny.
1389963	1390343	I don't know.
1390604	1391464	It's all store credit.
1391484	1393185	Chatroom, is it $100 funny?
1393626	1394446	That's what I need to know.
1395307	1398269	I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of the Judgement instead.
1399696	1403338	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1422498	1432926	Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.
1433306	1436048	Now this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.
1436068	1443033	You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game.
1443673	1445974	on the DS was going to interact with the ride.
1446054	1451377	In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride, you'd unlock a new character or something.
1451657	1460142	So kind of something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to kind of go into the park and actually get this, especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.
1461183	1466606	Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of, I guess, application that would download to your DS.
1466986	1470187	It would be a tour of the park, basically.
1470227	1471188	What you could do, imagine this.
1471388	1472509	Let's say you use your...
1473809	1476630	Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles
1504158	1504598	All right, hold on.
1504918	1505359	These are hot.
1505399	1506139	These are just out of the oven.
1506439	1506980	Sorry, guys.
1507020	1508801	The show has been interrupted for cookies.
1510341	1510982	Oh, my God.
1511102	1512182	They're so good.
1512783	1513903	I'm waiting to try one.
1513923	1515124	Oh, hot.
1515284	1515604	Hold on.
1515824	1516385	Yeah, I know they're hot.
1516405	1516645	Hold on.
1517525	1518806	Snickerdoodles are, like, the best cookies ever.
1518826	1519526	Oh, those are good.
1519767	1520587	What's a snickerdoodle?
1521488	1522608	They're cinnamon sugar cookies.
1522648	1523208	They're cinnamon.
1523248	1524409	They taste like... Thank you, Katie.
1526190	1526750	Oh, she can hear.
1526770	1526910	Good.
1527331	1527571	All right.
1528231	1528952	So, anyway, where were we?
1529012	1529872	Mm, cookie goodness.
1530292	1530833	No, Disney.
1531273	1531313	Um...
1532935	1533375	Let's see.
1533515	1535076	How to manage your weight right.
1535556	1535836	Oh, yeah.
1535876	1538877	So you can, like, click on an area and see, you know, how long the weight is.
1539457	1543419	And you can actually go, like, let's say you could click on it.
1543479	1545559	And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylus, obviously, right?
1545939	1553622	You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney World, and you could see what their menu is.
1554082	1556343	So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.
1557824	1562005	If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.
1562858	1563898	You have to call Disney Dining.
1593351	1604074	Something else that's really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now is that Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games.
1607015	1621080	Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games, which is Peggle Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,
1621733	1623273	and Portal First Slice.
1624494	1636316	And First Slice is actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.
1637877	1642278	So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.
1642338	1643038	But it's kind of cool.
1644498	1647599	And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.
1648905	1652206	So that you can have real life versus competitions and things like that.
1652686	1652906	Cool.
1655366	1657187	Sorry, chewing on a cookie.
1657207	1658367	Cookies are freaking good.
1658387	1659347	Anyways.
1662108	1662588	Let's see.
1665049	1675011	Last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.
1676129	1683795	Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how much they're really entitled to.
1684516	1687238	And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.
1688419	1690781	One day worth of outages is approximately $13.7.
1691741	1695404	So for about the six days of outages, that's $0.82.
1695525	1698547	Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.
1702423	1709907	So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.
1710747	1714029	And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.
1715610	1718911	And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft.
1718931	1719231	82 cents.
1721172	1721813	No, I'm just kidding.
1721853	1724294	They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.
1724314	1727836	Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it.
1727936	1730237	So you're getting a way better deal this way.
1730737	1732118	Yeah, but at the same time...
1733558	1735959	How do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?
1735999	1739700	I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.
1740300	1741961	How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?
1742701	1743301	Just saying.
1743781	1744182	You don't.
1744782	1745322	But, anyway.
1746382	1747663	No, DarkTestSuyu, you're right.
1747823	1750944	DarkTestSuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.
1750984	1751824	You're right, I'm not.
1751924	1752464	It's stupid.
1752624	1756245	Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.
1756506	1757686	They don't owe me anything.
1758926	1759426	But a hug.
1760247	1760927	I would like a hug.
1761769	1762769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1791781	1792821	I don't know who is to blame.
1815012	1819478	Okay, fair enough, just another person, you know, trying to knock video games for making kids fat.
1819778	1822442	But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.
1822742	1824004	Do you know who he's the CEO of?
1824565	1825185	McDonald's.
1828089	1831654	It's all their blame game thing, trying to, you know, get the...
1832518	1838883	The thing off of them, you know, especially since they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.
1839183	1842446	Yeah, so I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.
1842966	1848451	I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo 64 play zones and stuff.
1848491	1852334	So, you know, it's not like, you know, granted, he's in the UK, he's in America.
1852454	1852614	I know.
1853956	1855977	Here kid, go play with some old games.
1882751	1887316	Do Not Make Kids Fat, or McFlurries and Cones.
1905225	1909391	And even, and this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.
1909411	1921388	She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym and it tricked her body right back into, you know, losing again because it's like,
1921752	1922152	www.DarkSakura.com
1946798	1947318	DarkSakura.com
1975623	1976143	or whatever.
1976884	1979786	If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.
1980847	1982508	And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.
1982528	1983149	I've done that before.
1984230	1986031	Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.
1986051	1988013	I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.
1988053	1992196	So regardless, just saying, it's not you eat it occasionally and not every day.
1992256	1996059	It's not where you eat.
1996179	1998040	It's what you do and what you eat.
1998241	2001203	It's not the where, the who, any of that.
2001323	2003865	It's what you're doing.
2005017	2006958	It's nobody else's fault but your own.
2007699	2010561	That's how I see it.
2011041	2012702	Or just be fat and be beautiful.
2012782	2013342	If you're happy?
2013462	2014023	Be BB.
2014843	2017165	Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman, or a BBM.
2017405	2019466	You know what?
2019526	2025150	People should be happy the way they are, and I think that a lot of this crap that people go through for...
2028865	2031207	All of that is just people being unhappy with themselves.
2031247	2043516	And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself, and I know that I don't always do the same thing myself, but the moment that you are happy with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body is going to follow.
2045217	2047499	Or you won't care.
2048099	2055785	Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites a certain sort of rage within us that can only be...
2057383	2061626	Crushed by us venting our FUs of the week.
2069992	2072053	I accidentally used the old song tonight, but we'll deal.
2072113	2072373	Sorry.
2072634	2073634	DarkSakura.
2073674	2076236	FU to Rob for using the old music.
2078138	2081760	Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day.
2082681	2084242	I've had sort of a disappointing day.
2086129	2087991	And disappointing is a very good word for it.
2088011	2091053	I've had multiple in a row disappointments.
2092454	2094196	And I want an iMac.
2095477	2098279	So F you to me not having an iMac.
2100041	2101342	I'll go next, if you're done.
2102663	2106286	My F you goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today.
2106366	2108388	Well, first F you to me for putting in the wrong song.
2108828	2110530	F you to this cup of coffee for getting cold.
2110910	2114573	And then F you to me going to the store today without my wallet.
2117068	2123155	Thank God I didn't do that.
2123535	2129482	So if you're picturing, you know, me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because thank God I was looking for, um,
2130126	2130667	Thank you for watching!
2151249	2152230	Loki.
2152510	2163280	F you to the muscle that's pulled in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.
2163380	2164300	It hurts when you laugh?
2164541	2165281	It hurts when I laugh.
2165381	2173228	I would give you a bit of advice if you were going to rub it clockwise because otherwise you will get constipated.
2173649	2174009	It's true.
2174029	2174109	Okay.
2175051	2176972	Have you had trouble going lately?
2177032	2178252	No, I have not had trouble going.
2178312	2179073	No, no, no, no.
2179973	2184695	I've actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion goes clockwise.
2185296	2188477	And you can actually block your digestion by going counterclockwise.
2188957	2189237	Wow.
2189658	2190578	You learn something new every day.
2190618	2191098	You really do.
2191478	2191618	Yeah.
2191638	2194400	Let's not talk about colon.
2194740	2197121	Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.
2200350	2205792	So is that a trick I can play on my friends, is run up to people and rub their bellies counterclockwise and go, ha ha, you're constipated?
2205812	2207273	No, it takes everyone.
2209233	2210194	I'm just being a little silly.
2210694	2215316	Although Macman in chat says, it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make Loki laugh.
2215796	2220918	I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 deaths video and that was painful enough.
2221818	2223319	I'm going to put my advice in the chat room now.
2223599	2223839	All right.
2224298	2227499	Well, you need to do your next story, DarkSakura, before you get to advice.
2228040	2228780	Games first.
2229220	2230281	Constipation later.
2232362	2241125	Well, coming out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have StarTropics for NES.
2242106	2244607	It was released on the 11th.
2245887	2252690	Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so we are getting that.
2252770	2253871	Well, they are getting that
2255000	2258101	which is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.
2260802	2261042	Cool.
2261262	2262122	It was a Master System.
2262402	2265083	Actually, no, it was not on Master System.
2265103	2266383	I do believe it was a Genesis game.
2266403	2268164	Awesome.
2268184	2268664	So there you go.
2270024	2271885	Any news yet on... No, I think they're back.
2272085	2274766	It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.
2276026	2278687	Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?
2278827	2279467	I have no idea.
2279667	2280127	In U.S.?
2281127	2281427	All right.
2282428	2283888	Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
2284417	2285257	In the meantime, more news
2314895	2319636	flat out refusing to give EGM access to early previews or reviews.
2320116	2330639	And so, you know, basically he said, you know, warning readers that they're going to get little, late, or no coverage of, you know, these three companies' games.
2331799	2335080	And they won't treat these products or companies any differently.
2335480	2340201	They'll just cover them to their best ability without their support.
2342101	2344422	Because, after all, they're writing for the reader, not them.
2345251	2350214	So that's kind of interesting that he, you know, planned out, called them out.
2350254	2357599	I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies because, you know, after the whole Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of heard them.
2359621	2362943	I kind of support the calling out of these companies.
2364744	2365865	Yeah, so I don't know.
2365965	2373370	Like a part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is like such huge news, but I think it is kind of big because, you know, somebody's kind of finally taken a step and saying, you know,
2375523	2378099	Let's call them out on what they're doing and the fact that
2378539	2379199	and DarkSakura.com
2405865	2411206	Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative, you know, feedback for them.
2411246	2419288	I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but, you know, and this isn't the first, you know, companies to do this.
2419488	2426309	Apparently Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from, you know, EGM as well, and now they're back supporting them.
2426429	2428610	So, I don't know.
2428770	2435591	It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game is going to be exposed to less people, you know,
2436363	2438166	Coverage is coverage.
2438186	2440610	You may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.
2441010	2448462	Sometimes, too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind of ruin it.
2448542	2449845	It might not be... For instance...
2450575	2451216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2475868	2476389	and DarkSakura.com.
2486078	2494586	Maybe it's not necessarily Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.
2494946	2495647	It is pretty bad.
2496408	2497389	It wasn't really reviews.
2497469	2509120	It was based on previews and stuff because they were being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these bugs in the game and hopefully they get worked out because otherwise it's going to suck.
2510041	2511382	I think that's an honest opinion.
2511778	2516662	And they realize that it's not finished yet, and that's why they phrased it in such a way.
2516742	2521285	But apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you talk about our game, blah, blah, blah.
2522186	2523547	They only want glowing reviews.
2523627	2530052	Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit it to the magazine, if you don't want anyone doing that.
2530092	2533414	Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.
2533694	2535676	Just do it all like press releases or something like that.
2536311	2538231	Then everybody can own a game magazine.
2538391	2540992	Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.
2541232	2541692	Period.
2541792	2548173	I mean, when I say public, I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know, literally the public at trade shows and things.
2548213	2550693	Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.
2550753	2551073	That's all.
2552594	2553854	That's good customer service, right?
2554014	2554294	I don't know.
2555914	2556914	Good customer service.
2557055	2562895	Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're in a PR department, then your customer is the press.
2563656	2565116	So be careful who you have representing.
2565476	2565696	Well...
2566992	2589945	and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer service classes when I worked on the phone, is that for every one person that is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends.
2590565	2595028	It's sort of like dropping a boulder in a lake or something.
2595612	2596372	What the hell's wrong with you?
2621152	2621792	It's easy.
2621892	2622553	Just be nice.
2640243	2643385	I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job and it's a very challenging job.
2643405	2647368	And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to try and help you.
2647788	2648909	Unless they're being douchebags.
2649069	2651130	Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.
2652211	2654853	And do not ask for the supervisor first.
2655093	2655853	Give them a chance.
2656133	2656574	Exactly.
2657554	2660576	SSJ100 Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?
2660596	2662518	Yeah, but that was a stupid prank.
2662858	2663418	That's different.
2664839	2665339	Much different.
2666040	2666300	All right.
2667102	2668963	Anyhow, let's talk about something else.
2669624	2671906	Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the Diamond Card?
2671946	2672967	Don't you have one of these, Loki?
2672987	2673687	Yes, I do have one of these.
2673727	2679792	I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the Xbox Live Diamond Card, which gets you a discount.
2679812	2681573	Have you ever used the Diamond Card, out of curiosity?
2681613	2681773	No.
2682294	2682874	That's what I thought.
2683274	2685656	I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.
2686357	2687618	Well, it won't be free much longer.
2687678	2690640	It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.
2691421	2696745	Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the Diamond Card program is moving over to a new...
2698122	2698963	Kind of system.
2699263	2700724	It's the Passport Unlimited.
2701284	2701965	So, anyhow.
2702225	2714313	To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what you're... Unless you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's not very good.
2714653	2717615	I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.
2717755	2721477	It's nothing really... I don't know what works for me.
2721757	2722818	I just have one because it's neat.
2723629	2728613	Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.
2728733	2730514	I'm assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.
2731074	2732755	Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee.
2733536	2735978	And I don't think a lot of people will be.
2737078	2738860	I don't see why you would need to pay a $7 fee.
2740681	2741181	Well, I don't know.
2741221	2746785	If somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, HitStun in the chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave & Buster's.
2747646	2748587	So that's a pretty fun place.
2748607	2750628	Wait a second, though.
2750908	2752209	Let's just think about this for a second.
2752790	2753250	How are these...
2754119	2761245	businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not.
2762065	2763346	You're just going to have your card.
2763647	2764988	Does it have a barcode?
2765548	2765688	No.
2767830	2770312	It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.
2770532	2771353	Expiration date?
2771873	2774695	I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way.
2774916	2775896	Loki's getting out the card.
2775916	2777077	He's getting out his wallet.
2777177	2777598	Let's see here.
2777638	2777898	Hold on.
2780117	2780817	That's a good question.
2780877	2781618	How are they going to know?
2781898	2785899	It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they know?
2785919	2787680	Oh, wait, it has the year on it.
2788320	2788600	I don't know.
2788660	2790061	Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.
2790861	2793882	I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.
2793982	2798284	It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year.
2798304	2799364	Wait, let me see.
2800304	2801365	It doesn't have an expiration date?
2801405	2801805	No, it does.
2802125	2802485	No, it does.
2802625	2804706	Expiration 507, so there you go.
2806387	2807147	Maybe that's how they know.
2807654	2829453	They'll send something out to all the retailers to say Those things suck anyways because I remember when that program first came around It took me like six months to get mine So, you know, even if you paid the $7 You're already pissed away half a year So, I don't know Well, alright So, I don't know I'd be curious to see if anybody Does anybody in chat Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?
2829953	2835358	That's what I'd like to know Or get some phone calls on that later Meanwhile, while we await that feedback We'll move on to another story
2836616	2846761	Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle and Bust a Move and Bliss Island for the Xbox 360.
2849763	2853465	Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.
2853485	2853865	I don't know.
2853885	2856866	I haven't really played it any.
2857367	2861649	But then there's also, I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
2864298	2866099	Pagel is fun, actually.
2866299	2870761	It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.
2871621	2873102	I'll say this about the PopCap games.
2873322	2879765	Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played are really addicting and fun.
2880165	2884847	And I see people at work playing those games all the time on their breaks and stuff.
2884867	2887729	I was going to say, Pagel was confirmed that it is coming out.
2888049	2890370	So PopCap did confirm that one.
2890610	2890790	Wow.
2891810	2892230	It's fun.
2892250	2892811	I like Peggle.
2893091	2896112	So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.
2896812	2898052	Why would you rate them if they're not?
2898712	2899093	Exactly.
2899793	2900133	Exactly.
2901353	2910516	Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room except SSJ100 Matt says, I still use my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts.
2911236	2912257	Yeah, that's the other thing too.
2912297	2920119	I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?
2920512	2922253	They might not, or they may just not care.
2922833	2924053	So, try it.
2927274	2931516	So, with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive.
2931536	2933577	You may be wondering, what the hell am I going to use this for?
2934117	2944060	Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out for a while now.
2944540	2949502	But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.
2950687	2978899	5 gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive oh and by the way that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes so before you can play your game you must waste 40 minutes awesome and I know it's not the only game that has you install it to it's hard drive like for example Ratchet and Clank Ridge Racer has the option to do that I'm pretty sure Oblivion does and a bunch of other ones
2982383	2982763	Cool.
2984945	2987307	Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?
2987548	2987988	I think so.
2988088	2989810	Does it save that much time by doing so?
2990070	2990430	I don't know.
2990951	2991351	Probably not.
2992152	2994794	You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.
2994834	2995855	God damn, that game is great.
2996075	2996556	It really is.
2996716	2998517	You could just do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.
2999618	3001200	Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?
3001760	3001900	No.
3002141	3002401	At all?
3002881	3003962	You know they gotta be making it.
3004583	3008106	Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.
3008857	3009137	Why?
3009498	3010599	I want to go back and play.
3010779	3011540	That's not Oblivion.
3011600	3012801	Half-Life 2 or something.
3012881	3016565	Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter 4 when it's released because it looks better and better every day.
3016665	3018327	I actually like the look of Street Fighter 4.
3018367	3020850	I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me.
3021360	3049584	and of course Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzin has been announced as well but there's some new characters and one of the new ones is Crimson Viper and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine scans that were posted all over the interwebs Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit but with more boobage, like you know King from Art of Fighting and this big pink ponytail but she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her
3050307	3051268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3079028	3081670	Oh, and also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter.
3082190	3083831	Just like large-breasted women fighting games.
3083851	3085212	That was the first Dead or Alive.
3085292	3086893	And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.
3087234	3089075	Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.
3092717	3095939	Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style.
3096019	3097560	Never seen in the Street Fighter series.
3098121	3101583	Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boobs.
3102364	3102864	I doubt that.
3103324	3104765	Or probably fighting with her hair.
3105166	3106647	Although, wait, wasn't that done before?
3106707	3108087	I think that was done before somewhere.
3108108	3108748	That was Milia.
3110022	3110543	and Guilty Gear.
3112644	3122029	Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing, at least it's a rumor right now, that there's another Resident Evil arcade game.
3122049	3126251	I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.
3126691	3129953	Well, yeah, there were the Gun Survivor games.
3130593	3131433	Oh, those were in the arcade?
3131694	3131894	Yeah.
3132274	3132494	Oh, cool.
3133120	3136041	I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.
3136121	3141162	That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.
3141762	3153564	The voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.
3156505	3158385	She said that she really likes playing Jill.
3160346	3162386	The quote at the end of what she had to say is,
3162830	3166194	You can bet it'll be on the lookout for the game in arcades there.
3169017	3173583	They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.
3174266	3175987	I don't know if the Gun Survivor games are fun.
3176107	3177988	That shit better be coming to a console.
3178429	3179009	I hope the Wii.
3179169	3179629	It should.
3180070	3181470	I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.
3181511	3187454	Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii using the gun controller thingy.
3187654	3191997	And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.
3192357	3196840	Because I don't know about Target Terror, but something tells me it's not going to be that good.
3198772	3205956	Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old Gun Survivor games, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?
3206476	3208217	How it had the controller on it?
3208697	3221644	I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game, and you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have your gun.
3221684	3226827	We were talking about how they should do a walkthrough House of the Dead.
3227567	3229329	that use that sort of functionality.
3229369	3231672	I think that that would work for Gun Survivor.
3231692	3233934	It's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.
3236089	3236509	Very cool.
3236950	3238591	The Skyplane will be opening soon, by the way.
3238751	3242573	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call toll-free in the U.S.
3242613	3245535	and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3245595	3248858	Username on Skype again, Orange Lounge Radio, but one more story before we get to that.
3249178	3254922	So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the WiiWare service is going to actually come out.
3256323	3265909	Now, a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch date is scheduled,
3266567	3269808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3292580	3295081	It would be right up their alley for them to announce something like that.
3295321	3301844	I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive or something to keep all this crap on that I download.
3302284	3305045	I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.
3305065	3309467	At least allowing you to put them on memory sticks or something like that.
3309487	3312368	Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again.
3312628	3316490	What's the point of having an SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to use it?
3317364	3319565	or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.
3320525	3324347	So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?
3325407	3326588	I've done that a lot, actually.
3327568	3328568	It's silly, but it's fun.
3328628	3331950	So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?
3332470	3333090	Only a couple.
3333530	3336832	I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of seeing that.
3336892	3339833	I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.
3339893	3342574	I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.
3344784	3346505	I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.
3346845	3347345	Okay.
3348926	3352307	Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.
3352667	3354548	Actually, we've had a problem with our WeConnect.
3355148	3355468	Oh, no.
3355849	3356649	It hasn't wanted to.
3356669	3357869	Oh, that sucks.
3358270	3361591	So we've had a hard time updating our software.
3364172	3364592	What a bummer.
3365232	3371354	All right, well, let's open up the Skype line at username OrangeLaunchRadio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3371454	3372755	Our Skype line is now open.
3373422	3374322	Open for business.
3374402	3377003	And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.
3377063	3378404	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
3378444	3378804	Who's this?
3379584	3380665	This is Raven Stolfen.
3380865	3381245	How are you?
3381625	3384946	I am fine, and I'm so shocked and awed that you got through first somehow.
3385146	3387487	You got a quick finger there dialing in.
3387507	3387907	That's all right.
3387927	3388547	What's on your mind, buddy?
3389308	3389988	What's on my mind?
3390008	3390768	Alex Navarro.
3390808	3391768	That's what's on my mind.
3392088	3393829	Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.
3393869	3396390	We brought him up briefly in Part A. What did you want to say?
3397389	3398650	You know, that's a shocker.
3398710	3401971	You know, the other guy, Greg Provo left, and now Jeff.
3402011	3404652	It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.
3404732	3406893	It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.
3407554	3411436	And, you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.
3413897	3414237	I don't know.
3414337	3421840	Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is just some corporate website and, you know, I mean... True.
3423181	3424962	I don't really have, you know...
3425862	3426922	I just wish I had IGN myself.
3455922	3458424	What did you think about the editorial from EGM?
3459585	3461127	I just think that's just a little shocking.
3461167	3464089	He's just going like, yeah, F them.
3464129	3464710	I don't care.
3465130	3467312	Yeah, you know, we'll blackball you.
3467993	3468733	We'll send you the game.
3468773	3469634	We just rate games.
3469674	3475019	So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs to do.
3476246	3487672	But it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was going, rawr, we're going to beat you up, because he was like, we'll review their games anyway, but it just might be slower because, you know, they don't send us the free stuff.
3489073	3492775	But, I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.
3492815	3493775	I mean, look at what we're doing.
3493795	3494096	Hello.
3494556	3495956	You know, but I understand.
3495997	3499558	We're not for profit either, and all these guys are, so obviously it's a little different.
3499698	3504161	But, you know, if you love what you do, you can do it.
3504361	3504641	I don't know.
3505279	3505820	I know I do.
3505860	3507701	But I understand you've got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.
3508982	3510303	What else did you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?
3510323	3510643	Anything else?
3511364	3512805	Yes, one more thing.
3513205	3515567	You were talking about that four girls finger painting.
3515787	3524074	I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday night, and they kind of dug me.
3524114	3527817	They had to get some digs out of me, so I had to watch it live on air.
3528077	3530599	This video is really bad, so stay away.
3531896	3532777	I've heard things.
3533117	3537139	Actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on PerezHilton.com.
3537159	3537499	Don't laugh.
3537799	3542462	And I saw his reaction video to it, and it was kind of funny.
3543242	3544163	There's one of me now.
3544863	3545363	Is there really?
3545504	3545964	On YouTube?
3546744	3549486	Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead, Operator11.
3549806	3550846	Oh, it's on Operator11?
3551367	3551587	Really?
3551607	3552267	Where can I find it?
3553208	3555989	Under my name, just saying return of RavensDolphin.
3556049	3558310	Let's see, RavensDolphin.
3559671	3561052	But how far in the show do I have to look?
3562096	3562656	Not far.
3562676	3564037	It should be, like, right there.
3564057	3568058	It should be, like, the second one before the cartoon cast and all that.
3568618	3569478	You can search for it later.
3569518	3570858	I'll give you the thing.
3570998	3572299	Are you RavensDolphin1 here?
3572379	3572799	Let's see.
3572819	3573959	Yeah, I'm 1.
3574599	3575500	Cartoon cast?
3575520	3576640	I don't care about cartoon cast.
3576980	3577900	Where's Return of RavensDolphin?
3577920	3579721	Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.
3580141	3581561	Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.
3581581	3583002	Oh, there it is.
3583862	3585202	Why did you call it Poop on a Stick?
3585222	3586123	That's kind of nasty.
3587263	3588383	Because it is nasty!
3588683	3590684	All right, where in the show will I see this?
3590764	3591484	Right at the very beginning?
3592145	3593486	Yeah, it's only six minutes.
3595006	3596247	We're not watching all six minutes.
3597548	3600709	Just speed it up, speed it up, speed it up.
3600789	3602830	Epic, listen to the epic.
3603430	3608573	I'm doing it right now.
3609213	3612215	Oh, I think he's doing it.
3614016	3615516	Wow, my precious ears.
3615556	3615896	I'm sorry.
3616297	3617097	That's all right.
3617257	3618057	I said it was loud.
3618638	3619098	That's all right.
3622017	3624518	Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.
3625159	3627140	It was chaos, what do you expect?
3627480	3628661	But I mean, alright, forget it.
3628861	3629741	I'm wasting everybody's time.
3629761	3630802	I was doing it from a MacBook.
3630822	3632683	Alright, I'm wasting everybody's time.
3632823	3634744	Anything else you want to share with us, Raven Stolfen?
3635885	3637265	Not just that, and bye.
3637285	3638006	Alright, buh-bye.
3638026	3642748	If you want to give us a call, forget it, another one's already coming in.
3642789	3644569	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3645590	3646070	GS68.
3646190	3647951	Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?
3649152	3650833	Well, with the release of Rock Band, like,
3651866	3656590	As I expected, there are people who think it's the first game to have a drum part.
3657471	3669120	Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people who think it's the first game to use drums.
3670208	3670809	X-Play Beatmania
3695678	3702780	Here in America, and they said it was a rip-off of Guitar Hero, and all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like, What the fuck?
3702840	3703781	You guys are stupid!
3704821	3705081	Right?
3705361	3711663	This is kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get the credit for doing it first.
3712664	3713104	Of course.
3713924	3719186	Well, on top of rock bands' drums, before anyone calls me a Bambani Alitas, it's...
3720516	3722498	Drum Media was not the first game to have drums.
3722578	3727081	Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?
3728462	3731965	You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?
3732489	3736031	Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?
3736071	3737372	Like, I don't really think there was anything to it.
3737392	3739393	Like, I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.
3739853	3742895	Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.
3743075	3747618	You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with them.
3747838	3749619	But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?
3749659	3750759	There was no... Did they?
3751080	3753961	But there was no, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.
3754121	3755042	No, nothing like that.
3755062	3755442	Let's see.
3756543	3756943	Interesting.
3757903	3758584	I'm not sure.
3758684	3760425	When did the first... Well, let's see.
3760465	3761365	If Drumscape was out in 96...
3762902	3765104	The first DDR was out in 98, so I don't know.
3765784	3768186	Actually, I think it was 97 or so.
3768306	3772929	I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.
3773429	3780814	I had to tag it with the... Well, DarkTek Studio did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.
3781394	3783716	So maybe it was around the same time as Drum Mania.
3783736	3786798	But regardless, I mean, I get your point.
3787798	3791501	Even so, you could say that I'm sure there were older games that even...
3792563	3793424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3818541	3822742	There's plenty of drum games already out there, it's just that Rock Band gave it a different twist.
3823342	3832484	You can't tell me that Rock Band was not, like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having with that.
3833665	3835765	Props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.
3836745	3838526	I said this before Rock Band came out.
3839426	3843267	If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.
3843967	3848068	And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could have had.
3848499	3849880	If they just wouldn't put the effort into it.
3850621	3852022	But, it's a risk they don't want to take.
3853824	3863233	I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix, I mean, sure they're Konami's rivals for its music games, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.
3864213	3870059	I mean, it's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do accomplishments or high scores.
3872544	3873965	Eh, that's kind of obscure, though.
3874045	3877187	I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.
3877247	3878928	That just seems like a logical thing to me.
3878968	3886092	I mean, there's lots of games that... I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download, if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.
3886172	3889434	I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.
3890535	3896118	So... All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
3897158	3897779	No, I'm good.
3898259	3899360	All right, well, you have a great week.
3899380	3900020	We'll talk to you again.
3900800	3901081	You too.
3901301	3901641	Bye-bye.
3902925	3905326	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.
3905406	3906966	Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.
3907006	3909707	I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.
3910047	3911047	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3911087	3911447	Who's this?
3912327	3914348	I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.
3914808	3915708	Well, hello, Ranma.
3915728	3916168	How are you?
3917089	3917729	I'm doing good.
3917769	3918489	How's everybody out there?
3918609	3919209	Hello.
3919289	3926571	It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that –
3927526	3928967	You can introduce yourself to the listener.
3929007	3931948	But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length of time.
3932468	3933589	Our buddy in New York City.
3934309	3935490	What is on your mind this week, Ranma?
3936630	3939772	Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter at a later years, right?
3940792	3941092	Yes.
3942893	3944414	Look up Minesweeper, the movie.
3944754	3945054	Okay.
3946374	3947115	I have to see this one.
3947135	3948635	That sounds kind of stupid.
3949356	3950196	You have to see it.
3950316	3952037	It's stupid in a funny way.
3953538	3956299	Briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.
3957196	3958457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3979011	3985414	I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something and maybe I should just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.
3985974	3988995	I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lounge Radio very soon, aren't you?
3989816	3991476	Yeah, it's still in works.
3991676	3995578	I'm waiting for my co-host and it looks like it's definitely going to happen.
3995598	3999779	We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.
3999979	4001140	Tell us a little bit about your new show.
4002436	4004138	It's called Anime Jam Sessions.
4004499	4009644	The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime podcast.
4009964	4012767	I started listening to a couple of them and I didn't like it.
4013128	4016131	I've always felt that if you don't like it,
4016710	4043455	Do something about it, put up or shut up And thus I started doing it I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out And a lot of people liked it So I have me and my friend Kuro Usagi Who's going to be my news reporter girl And I have some interviews lined up And basically we're going to be talking about What's going on in anime, anime movies, anime games Cosplay, upcoming conventions And just a touch of randomness here and there Very cool
4044116	4061967	and so that will definitely be coming to the station soon we don't know what night yet we're still trying to figure that out based on other programs like there's another program that I told like a year ago we were going to get on our station and it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24 hour 7 station but now in 2008 we're trying to kind of go back to that so
4062327	4063708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4088764	4098567	And to those of you that have missed myself and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon, I hope.
4098587	4099708	That's going to be awesome.
4099968	4101028	I'm looking forward to it, too.
4102229	4105830	And Loki has been talking about he might even get back into the swing of things.
4105990	4108771	It won't be a show that's on our station, though.
4109655	4112996	Oh, well, F you then.
4113356	4115536	It's not just an audio program.
4115996	4123678	And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com, and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.
4124238	4128179	I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw around with your time.
4128899	4131740	Send us some samples, because we are looking to address – I should put it this way.
4132062	4135584	We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.
4153976	4155077	Variety is the spice of life
4183241	4184962	Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?
4185622	4186242	I did.
4186542	4188564	Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.
4188604	4189404	I thought it was awesome.
4189664	4195507	My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture you sent and where you saw it.
4196728	4206173	Anywho, me and my friend Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but when we got there, the machining was off, and we're walking around on our way out, and I see...
4206894	4207294	Mario Kart GP2
4223866	4224966	I will say this much.
4225086	4234088	If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Race or anything like that.
4234348	4236789	This, I can play, and it's just totally fun.
4237109	4242310	Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick up different weapons and stuff.
4242810	4247591	GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.
4248251	4253532	That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games, if you come in first place, you get a free game.
4254784	4257586	You basically have to pay for each round when you play.
4257786	4258307	That sucks.
4259588	4264911	You know what I love at Dave & Buster's that I would probably play instead is that fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.
4265611	4268513	Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there just playing it.
4268593	4269634	It's just uber fun.
4270695	4273276	Yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.
4273477	4273897	Absolutely.
4273937	4274938	Painting finger.
4276459	4277619	All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
4277779	4278580	Any quick final thoughts?
4279675	4282318	about the LAN adapter for GameCube.
4282898	4287222	One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.
4288323	4293588	We had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.
4294409	4295730	You could use that with Double Dash?
4295790	4296290	I forgot.
4296390	4297011	Yes, you can.
4297151	4297912	Eight-player play.
4297932	4298472	Yes, you can.
4299073	4300194	Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.
4300534	4304638	Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of mana it was ever used.
4305677	4315323	Probably, if we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if somebody was like, if they were like a few floors down below us.
4316164	4317705	Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.
4317725	4321007	I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.
4321147	4322648	Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.
4322908	4325089	Okay, Ranma, we really got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?
4325830	4326050	Bye-bye.
4326090	4329612	If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.
4329672	4331614	Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
4331654	4334135	Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.
4334195	4335216	I don't know if you guys heard about this.
4335646	4338268	But there was Gizmodo blog.
4338868	4339748	They were at CES.
4339768	4340469	Did you hear about this?
4340589	4345732	They got some TV Be Gone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.
4345772	4347253	We actually have a little bit of a clip here.
4347693	4354577	Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?
4354657	4355958	Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.
4355998	4356618	It doesn't work.
4357519	4358479	People are playing this game.
4358519	4359860	He's using the TV, shutting it all off.
4363909	4370538	And if you want to see the full videos, post it at gizmodo.com And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish.
4370979	4371479	And it was.
4371619	4372220	I mean, it's funny.
4372561	4375825	I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way.
4375865	4378068	But you kind of look in retrospect and you go, what a dick.
4378869	4379130	Right?
4379590	4380071	What a dick.
4380533	4388940	and they actually post in the Go's Moto blog, they say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some people's jobs harder and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.
4389300	4390161	We're sorry.
4390701	4397206	And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh down.
4398246	4401849	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4426684	4428566	I say a well-deserved ban.
4428767	4430349	I realize it might have been funny in the moment.
4431310	4434113	And, you know, in a dick jerk kind of way, it is funny.
4434213	4438518	But, you know, if you're going to be a dick jerk, expect to get punished like a dick jerk does.
4438759	4439419	Get jerked back.
4439760	4439880	Yep.
4441563	4443705	A well-deserved ban from CES.
4463377	4477447	and I'm not going to say that certain other media outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media outlets came in drunk to certain press events and that's all I have to say about that.
4477467	4478187	I remember that one.
4478247	4479708	It was interesting.
4480189	4481750	Maybe we should be naming names on this show.
4481770	4486493	Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names of the journalists, but not tonight.
4486533	4488174	We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.
4488615	4493578	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4494058	4495499	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
4495519	4495879	Who's this?
4497160	4498661	This is Ross Steel, UT.
4498901	4499941	Ross Steel, UT.
4500001	4500842	What is on your mind, buddy?
4502563	4503243	A few things.
4503303	4504664	First off, yeah, I agree.
4505324	4511368	That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.
4511388	4513349	That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.
4514150	4520573	I know, it's kind of one of those, you laugh for 30 seconds, and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at this.
4520653	4523334	Like, it really isn't funny, like, in retrospect, you know?
4523354	4523994	Yeah, it's so funny.
4524915	4525975	Loki, you're just an asshole.
4526455	4531377	Yeah, I was about to say, Loki's a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is... Oh, snap!
4532358	4533238	All right, anyway, what do you want?
4534258	4539080	But the thing is, man, doing that during the presentations, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody locked a job over that crap, you know?
4539120	4541742	That's, you know, that's just wrong, you know?
4543442	4547265	Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.
4547485	4560313	And I think that's why CES is saying, we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to do against Gawker and all that stuff, is because I think they're waiting to see what the response is going to be.
4560613	4564095	And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.
4564135	4566037	They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.
4566337	4570520	But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it, so what?
4570560	4572721	Then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.
4573177	4579141	Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.
4579181	4582623	You know, Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.
4583103	4583284	Yeah.
4583384	4584544	You know, that could be a problem.
4584985	4589047	It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see, we'll see.
4590228	4590848	Yeah, we'll see.
4591009	4594711	Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.
4594731	4598213	You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?
4599254	4599414	No.
4599434	4599474	No.
4600239	4600739	That's cool.
4604241	4618889	Yeah, apparently the FBI went to this kid in Texas, I forgot the exact city, but apparently the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, the radiation in their houses doubled.
4619029	4621470	This was a few years ago.
4621531	4622271	No, this was recent.
4622731	4623532	Oh, it happened again?
4625172	4629775	Yeah, it was posted on January 10th, actually.
4630906	4632867	I've read something about something similar a few years ago.
4632887	4634728	Tiger Claw just posted the link in our chat.
4634808	4636849	Apparently it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.
4637549	4640251	I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else.
4641631	4644493	It wasn't a gamer, it was this 11-year-old genius.
4645499	4654288	Yeah, I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.
4654488	4656350	Let me read this from Kotaku here.
4656390	4659253	The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.
4659573	4661716	He said he started studying physics around the 8th grade.
4661756	4665099	He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.
4665526	4666926	Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.
4666946	4667886	You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.
4667906	4668387	It's like 30 bucks.
4668447	4668667	Seriously.
4668687	4669907	Yeah, I thought they cut them like little cans.
4692438	4693679	Rockwall, Texas.
4693839	4698262	So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this guy, you know, just in case.
4699483	4702985	And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.
4704006	4706568	You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.
4706608	4707569	Then that's when you blog about it.
4707989	4713333	Now this, um... I agree with what SSJ100Matt's saying in chat.
4713373	4715574	Leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye.
4716595	4717896	Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?
4719217	4720458	Zombie Mr. Wizard, huh?
4721687	4722788	There it is, there it is.
4722808	4731356	This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear reactor in.
4731496	4732036	Wait for it.
4732196	4737081	If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.
4738942	4739883	Games made him do it.
4740684	4744888	The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee.
4746161	4750669	and the radiation level was actually fairly safe.
4750809	4754155	That's what I need, a nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.
4754175	4757521	But it was a 15 year old using graduate level physics textbooks.
4759165	4764588	and used vacuum pump manufacturer manuals and scoured the web for cheap.
4764608	4767269	Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.
4767289	4768670	They should be going to offer him a job.
4768990	4770671	They should be freaking sending him to college.
4770691	4770811	Oh, no.
4770831	4773453	This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.
4773513	4776494	I mean, with all this attention, he's going to be working in a university.
4776534	4777915	It's on no time at all.
4778035	4780456	We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.
4781036	4781237	All right.
4781257	4783678	Well, any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty?
4783698	4783818	Well,
4786731	4792076	One other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three companies.
4792116	4793197	I'm going to be honest with you.
4793437	4796399	I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.
4796960	4802885	The thing is with the 1UP Network is that really they're little more than a tabloid.
4803005	4810751	It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being sensational.
4811091	4812312	I knew that word was going to come into play.
4812352	4814915	I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking like sensationalist.
4816138	4817520	Which, yeah, I kind of agree.
4818922	4825230	I mean, you remember after Gershman got fired, the whole thing with the protest in front of the CNET building?
4827093	4829155	You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalists.
4829196	4831318	I mean, it's not like they come to press events drunk.
4831338	4833862	Oh, wait, no, no, they do.
4835248	4836769	Yes, they do.
4837029	4838530	They do their podcast drunk.
4838570	4841671	What are you talking about?
4841692	4843753	To be fair, we have too, but you know.
4844233	4845753	Yeah, but also we don't get paid.
4845854	4847254	Nobody pays us to do this program.
4847274	4848635	We pay to do this program.
4848675	4849535	That's how sick we are.
4849996	4851196	You know what I mean?
4851436	4854057	I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.
4854118	4863282	These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit in the entire gaming big review industry, you know?
4864623	4866124	and you see it in their reviews.
4866184	4867926	They go out of their way to be negative.
4868026	4875653	You look at, particularly in EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that, quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.
4876233	4880477	I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they could say, hey, look how negative we can be.
4880497	4881438	We're not like GameSpot.
4883425	4884506	Interesting perspective.
4884526	4889229	You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because, again, I don't really read a lot of these sites.
4889389	4890150	I really don't.
4890310	4895193	Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but, like, secretly I'm, like, watching every move they make.
4895554	4896494	But I just don't.
4896634	4900397	I don't... I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.
4900457	4911925	You know, I... Actually, this is a little off-topic, but IGN did... Lately, their thing is they've been revealing some of the Destiny-era games, the data design stuff, you know, the absolute shit on, you know, the Wii, and...
4912245	4918268	And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man.
4918728	4920429	And of course it got a really low score.
4920709	4922230	And then they did a video review for it.
4922290	4928613	But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally a minute long.
4928633	4930474	He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?
4930514	4932015	It has platforms and jumping.
4932435	4933296	That's about it.
4933856	4935997	And that was the end of the video review.
4936277	4937198	It's like, seriously.
4937825	4940327	Don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're going to do.
4940627	4941407	Take it seriously.
4941747	4949452	Even though the game is crap, you've got to point out, you can do it funny, but point out why it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did one for you.
4949812	4951373	I mean, that's stupid.
4952934	4958637	Yeah, now that you're talking about that, not enough people are doing good, funny reviews.
4958677	4962520	I mean, you remember the old Alex Navarro review for Big Rigs?
4963120	4964701	I mean, that was hilarious.
4965211	4965691	He likes Peggle.
4965711	4966452	He likes Psychonauts.
4992577	4994199	He generally likes Assassin's Creed.
4994520	4998346	The thing with him is that he'll point out... He looks at the games.
4998386	5000108	He just looks at the games to look at the games.
5000148	5001691	He's not, you know...
5003025	5005767	The fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.
5006267	5008328	I think as long as there's a balance to it.
5008388	5009889	He tells it like it is.
5009949	5012450	I don't like the people that do nothing but negative reviews.
5012510	5015231	It's kind of like, okay, haha, joke's over.
5016072	5016532	Move on.
5017372	5018373	Show us both sides.
5018413	5018793	Be balanced.
5019173	5023055	Ross Steele, I've got to wrap up because we want to try and take one more call before we close the show tonight.
5023295	5025596	We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?
5027297	5028178	Embrace false idols.
5028218	5028538	Goodbye.
5030339	5030699	Bye-bye.
5033769	5036311	So I guess RawSteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.
5036331	5036851	I don't know what to say.
5036991	5037231	All right.
5037772	5039172	We'll take one more call if we have any time.
5039593	5041294	I'm sorry, if we have any more people who want to call in.
5041394	5044256	Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5045036	5047498	Meanwhile, any last-minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?
5048178	5053061	I don't really have a last-minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an exploding baby in it.
5053521	5059445	So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.
5061226	5062567	I'm so happy for you.
5063900	5067722	Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.
5069222	5071123	I look forward to his reviews every week.
5071183	5074745	We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.
5075745	5078206	Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.
5078286	5080167	Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?
5080207	5080447	Um, no.
5080487	5080727	All right.
5085169	5085670	One more call.
5085730	5086630	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5086650	5087010	Who's this?
5088191	5088771	It's DT.
5089011	5090312	Hey, Dartetsuya.
5090352	5091032	What's on your mind, buddy?
5092543	5093144	Oh, nothing.
5093184	5095965	I just thought I'd call.
5096005	5096606	Just chilling?
5096846	5097767	Listening to OLR?
5097867	5098387	Just chilling?
5098867	5099768	Oh, yeah.
5099928	5102069	What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?
5104631	5105331	Pretty interesting.
5106072	5106612	That's right.
5106672	5107473	Interesting stuff.
5108994	5110835	Pretty good stuff, yeah.
5111475	5112716	What games have you been playing this week?
5115778	5120121	Actually, there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.
5120141	5121342	I don't know if you've ever heard of it.
5121863	5122283	I have not.
5122303	5123703	Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?
5125004	5129045	Well, basically, it's like an adventure game.
5129925	5133186	I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games.
5133426	5138187	And you go around and you collect items and kill enemies.
5138747	5140067	Sort of like Castlevania.
5140808	5142448	A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.
5143001	5143481	Yeah, I updated it.
5143501	5144082	It's pretty funny.
5169716	5176858	Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.
5177298	5178119	But the game is hard?
5179699	5181740	Oh, yeah.
5182260	5184420	They don't give you, like, any help or anything, I don't think.
5185061	5186681	So there's no cheat mode, no help mode?
5188122	5190482	No, I mean, there was a trick I learned.
5190502	5193383	There was this video walkthrough.
5194383	5196984	There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.
5198785	5199505	So that might help.
5200506	5203907	DarkTetsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
5203927	5203967	Uh...
5229130	5229710	No, not really.
5229750	5230671	I think that's about it.
5230991	5231331	All right.
5231652	5233113	So go play La Mulana.
5233133	5233693	Go play some more.
5234914	5235074	Yeah.
5235214	5235434	All right.
5235474	5235935	Take care, buddy.
5236975	5237155	You too.
5237195	5237656	All right.
5237696	5237996	Bye-bye.
5238896	5239137	All right.
5239157	5242159	We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and end the show.
5242559	5256208	And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent Hill Origin, which apparently he says the whole series jumped the shark, and between Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and all this stuff, right?
5257333	5258073	SILENT HILL ORIGINS
5287000	5299516	for those of you guys listening because there's some really kick-ass songs I mean it's it's more Akira Yamaoka doing some great stuff let's see what was oh this song I think I liked unfortunately I couldn't tell you the name of it because the songs aren't labeled but here's one
5317591	5319292	Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.
5319312	5321893	There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week.
5322413	5325235	So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.
5326115	5328576	Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.
5328776	5330257	Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?
5330877	5331878	Nope, I don't have anything.
5331918	5332418	You got anything?
5332858	5333138	All good.
5333558	5334479	All right, well, then we're good.
5334539	5336780	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5337500	5338641	DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.
5340021	5340902	I like these cookies.
5342303	5344604	My final thought is penguins are cute.
5345084	5345304	Loki?
5346590	5348171	This game filler is pretty fun.
5371920	5372700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5403095	5404096	Tune in next week.
