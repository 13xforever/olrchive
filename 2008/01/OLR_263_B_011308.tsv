5700	11600	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11600	15100	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15100	19600	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19600	26600	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this Part B of our program.
26600	30100	So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?
30100	33600	Yes, there is some big news coming from Nintendo Power
33600	40100	talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.
40100	44400	And apparently the game's title is Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood
44400	47900	and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe
47900	52200	and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me, but, you know, what do I know?
52200	53400	Is that a bad thing?
53400	58700	Uh, no, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG? Seriously.
58700	63400	Well, A, BioWare didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.
63400	64400	So?
64400	66200	No, I agree that it doesn't matter.
66200	68800	I don't care if Square does it or, you know, BioWare.
68800	71500	But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?
71500	74200	Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.
74200	76600	They were the closest thing I've played to that since.
76600	78400	I miss Mario RPG.
78400	81500	And, um, but the Sonic thing looks pretty good.
81500	87200	They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.
87200	88200	So that's kind of neat.
88200	89500	Oh, that's kind of cool.
89500	92000	Uh, I don't know.
92000	97900	Don't know much about it yet, but, um, should be the next issue, I guess.
97900	100500	Dark Soccer, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.
100500	102700	Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out,
102700	107700	or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?
107700	110500	If it's not done by Sonic Team,
110500	112500	it doesn't exist in my universe. How's that?
112500	114100	Oh, snap.
114100	115500	Well said.
115500	119700	Alright, well, uh, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to,
119700	124100	and, uh, one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.
124100	125600	But some fans are kind of pissed off,
125600	128100	because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw,
128100	131800	and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere?
131800	134500	Well, it's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC,
134500	136700	but no love for the Nintendo Wii.
136700	142100	However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel
142100	146500	would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.
146500	148700	Cue the petition!
148700	151500	Almost immediately an internet petition went up,
151500	153300	bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.
153300	156700	So they're taking a page out of, uh, Konami's book there.
156700	161600	Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then, uh, we'll make the product.
161600	167300	Well, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.
167300	169800	Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.
169800	170300	Quote,
170300	173600	It will largely depend on what the fans want for the future of Bionic Commando.
173600	181000	If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.
181000	186200	Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's had people very happy.
186200	189600	Um, anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?
189600	193800	Not yet, it's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007
193800	197500	because everybody said it was great, but I just, I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.
197500	205100	Well, there's a DS version now, where you can, um, basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff,
205100	209200	and sword fight, and kill people, and stuff.
209200	215800	But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers, and picking pockets, and doing other stuff.
215800	221000	Wait, wait, you can use a stylus for interrogating informers, so what do you do, you just poke them?
221000	222600	Poke, poke, poke, poke, tell me!
222600	223800	Poke, poke, poke, poke!
223800	226700	And then you talk into the, um, the speaker part, and go,
226700	229000	bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother!
229000	231400	Like that.
231400	234000	Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game!
234000	236300	I know, it could be interesting, I think it'd be kind of cute.
236300	238600	It's supposed to be a prequel, looks kind of neat.
238600	239600	I don't know.
239600	245200	Um, the Nyko Wireless Nunchak, I remember we talked about that a little bit ago,
245200	252600	um, pretty useless device, I think, but I guess if you, that little cord really bothers you,
252600	256300	um, then great, you can buy this.
256300	256800	Anyways...
256800	260600	That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.
260600	261800	Whatever, okay, so...
261800	263400	How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?
263400	264400	That's what I want to know.
264400	268500	Uh, $30.
268500	270400	Never mind, I can deal with it for $30.
270400	276900	Yeah, and, um, so, apparently though, it did win a, uh, CNET CES Gaming Award.
276900	280100	For, uh, Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.
280100	284100	You know, I kind of, I forgot to talk about this this week, my gaming week,
284100	288900	I played, um, some Ghost Squad, and I bought those, um,
288900	292500	Nyko Perfect Shots, the ones that look like the little pistols.
292500	293900	Those are fucking awesome.
293900	297200	And, the other thing about Ghost Squad, and why I love the game even more,
297200	301700	they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper, so that you don't use the B button as a trigger,
301700	305700	you use the Z button, so that you're actually firing it correctly.
305700	309800	So, hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters,
309800	316500	will look to, uh, Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.
316500	318200	Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.
318200	321300	He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.
321300	325000	That's true, because, you know, you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.
325000	327300	Um, what else was I going to say about this?
327300	329000	What did they get for getting this award?
329000	331300	Did you get a trophy, or a plaque, or just internet fame?
331300	332100	Internet fame.
332100	335500	I see. Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about the device on the program.
335500	336800	Maybe a plaque, who knows.
336800	338000	A trophy?
338000	339500	I want to win a trophy!
339500	343500	Are there any award shows coming up where you can win a trophy in?
343500	345600	I want a trophy.
345600	347100	I have a trophy for us.
347100	349700	That's from, like, 2005, and it's at your house.
349700	351200	I want a trophy here.
351200	352400	I can bring that one here.
352400	355200	You should bring that one here. But I want another trophy.
355200	356600	I want a 2008 trophy.
356600	358000	But I went all the way for that trophy.
358000	362000	I know, you had to go all the way to L.A. and you had to meet Adam Curry. Poor you.
362000	367100	No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.
367100	369700	Look, no, I-
369700	371100	With his Bon Jovi hair.
371100	374700	I want a new 2008 trophy.
374700	377100	So what award can we win?
377100	379400	There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.
379400	381700	I'll have to look into that to make that happen.
381700	385200	Well, the year is young and, you know, there are the Darwin Awards.
385200	387900	It's a little bit of a permanent solution.
387900	390700	Can we give ourselves a stupid award? Can we do something really stupid?
390700	393700	But, you know, we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?
393700	395600	Rob Way says, make your own award show.
395600	398800	Well, there are, you know, there are podcasts out there that make their own award show.
398800	406000	Hell, the gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.
406000	410200	You think we could team up with Sony? They got nothing going for them, right?
410200	414200	Alright, forget it. Let's move on with the gaming news.
414200	415800	Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.
415800	419800	That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.
419800	421200	Yeah, I could use that too.
421200	425800	So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit,
425800	429400	but we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th,
429400	431800	if a new one-up column is to be believed.
431800	436200	The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers,
436200	437600	both in Japan and abroad.
437600	440200	North Americans can expect to see the game on May 20th,
440200	443400	by which time presumably they'll have that plus-sized Western Balance Board
443400	446200	properly stress-tested and ready for use.
446200	449600	However, the interesting thing about that was that that little drop date
449600	451200	had never been mentioned before.
451200	454800	So, is May 20th the day that this game will come out?
454800	457400	If it is the day, then hooray, they got it correct.
457400	459600	If it's not the day, they can just say, oh, it's been delayed.
459600	463200	Loki, from the distribution angle,
463200	465400	do you have any insider information possibly on this?
465400	466600	Nope, haven't heard a thing.
466600	467400	Interesting.
467400	469600	At least not on that game.
469600	472200	Well, I'm looking forward to this game, you know,
472200	474400	just because I think it'll be fun.
474400	479000	Maybe Loki and I can have a contest as we both want to play some Wii Fit.
479000	481400	Maybe we can have that OLR Biggest Loser contest
481400	483200	we've been talking about for a long time.
483200	486000	Maybe Loki and I will get fit with Wii Fit.
486000	487400	We can have like a blog and shit.
487400	489400	Yeah, we can be on the news.
489400	490400	Yay!
490400	493000	Because people losing weight on a weight loss game,
493000	494600	that's so fucking new.
494600	496400	And there we go, we get a trophy for being on the news.
496400	498400	News trophy.
498400	501600	Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of air time
501600	504200	if that, and I'll say something brief.
504200	506000	Oh, it's so much fun.
506000	510600	Alright, by the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news,
510600	511400	it's on YouTube.
511400	513200	Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.
513200	514200	It's great.
514200	515200	And like, they interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes,
515200	516200	and that's what they used.
516200	517200	Oh, it's so much fun.
517200	522800	Alright, let's give out some trophies right now to our listeners.
522800	525400	Our listeners are awesome, and we wouldn't be here without you guys.
525400	527400	And we always invite you to interact with our program,
527400	530200	whether it be through the chat room or through our email.
530200	532600	It's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,
532600	535200	and Dark Sakura will be giving you a trophy in spirit
535200	537800	every time she reads one of your emails tonight, won't you, Dark Sakura?
537800	539800	In fact, you'll actually be winning a Golden Globe.
539800	542800	Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.
542800	545000	You don't get a Golden Globe.
545000	548200	You get an aluminum foil ball.
548200	550400	Okay, and spray-painted gold.
550400	551600	Alright, so there you have it.
551600	556400	So, the Orange Lounge Radio Oranges, even though they're gold.
556400	558400	We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.
558400	563800	Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight, I don't know.
563800	567400	Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag and the envelope, please.
567400	569800	Who wins orangie number one?
569800	572600	You're funny, Rob.
572600	576600	The first one is from TJ.
576600	579600	It says, hey, before I begin, I want to say that I love your show
579600	584000	and wish I could catch it live, but unfortunately I have other crap to do.
584000	587400	That's a good excuse. I have other crap to do.
587400	590400	Regardless, I try and catch the podcast as often as possible.
590400	594800	I couldn't help noticing that nobody mentioned my opinion on the year's worst game.
594800	597600	I work part-time at a GameStop. I'm sorry.
597600	601600	And the one game that sold zero units during December was Jenga for the Wii.
601600	604600	I mean, come on. Everyone's bored with the original game.
604600	606600	It's not going to do shit on the Wii.
606600	609600	Anyway, I just wanted to get that out there and keep up the good work.
609600	610600	TJ.
610600	613600	Thank you, TJ. The only reason I didn't mention Jenga
613600	615600	is that I had completely erased it from my memory.
615600	619600	I'd like to thank you personally for bringing it back into my existence, you jerk.
619600	621600	Jenga's a game. Horrible.
621600	623600	Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.
623600	626600	Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game
626600	629600	because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.
629600	631600	I don't know if it's just me.
631600	633600	So there you have it.
635600	636600	Next email.
636600	641600	With Bioshock Mass Effect Call of Duty 4, we play Super Mario Galaxies and an iPhone.
641600	643600	This must be the best Christmas ever.
643600	645600	Yeah, I know this email's a bit late,
645600	649600	but I felt I must comment on how especially kickass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.
649600	651600	Wait, is this the same email or a new one?
651600	652600	This is a different one.
652600	653600	Oh, who sent this one in?
653600	654600	This one's from Ospher.
654600	655600	Oh, okay.
655600	660600	Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.
660600	663600	As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.
663600	667600	It's so much fun to play and control, and controls are nothing short of sexy.
667600	668600	Ooh.
668600	673600	I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies,
673600	676600	and some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.
676600	678600	Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.
678600	679600	What's Chapter 4, Rob?
679600	681600	Wait, in Mario Galaxy?
681600	684600	I don't want to spoil anything,
684600	689600	but the soundtrack is out there on the internet, so take a look.
689600	690600	On your favorite torrent site.
690600	691600	Not that I endorse that sort of thing.
691600	692600	Look on your iPhone!
692600	694600	But it is out there.
694600	695600	Okay.
695600	697600	Next paragraph.
697600	701600	As for Call of Duty 4, it's just as Rob said, it's fucking epic.
701600	706600	You play the game to experience it yourself, and then watch your jaw hit the floor.
706600	710600	Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?
710600	712600	No.
712600	714600	Not live, no.
714600	717600	You can listen to the podcast from any touch-tone phone.
717600	720600	It's something I want to say, like...
720600	723600	You can't do it from a touch-tone phone, like a regular phone.
723600	725600	You can hear it, you can hear the podcast on a phone.
725600	727600	There's some service out there, free service,
727600	730600	because I know, because one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.
730600	733600	She might have signed our podcast up for it, I don't even know, I don't remember.
733600	736600	But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.
736600	737600	I'll look it up.
737600	739600	There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.
739600	742600	I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work,
742600	747600	but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.
747600	751600	Thanks for reading, as always, Ospher sent from my iPhone.
751600	756600	You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.
756600	760600	This email comes from Stan.
760600	761600	Hi there.
761600	764600	I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.
764600	767600	It makes me wonder why I was listening to you folks before.
767600	769600	After listening to your year-end wrap-up show,
769600	772600	I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.
772600	774600	Well, do y'all?
774600	777600	I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit,
777600	780600	and if you guys had a booth or something.
780600	783600	Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool
783600	785600	if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.
785600	787600	That's what we usually do when we do our panels.
787600	790600	If not, then taping something while there,
790600	793600	I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.
793600	796600	I mean, actually, that's more what we do as we do the recording.
796600	799600	I don't know if anyone else in Chicago that listens to your show,
799600	802600	but I'm sure they're here somewhere just never looked.
802600	805600	Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur III?
805600	807600	I could really use a challenge.
807600	813600	I didn't get Soul Calibur III because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.
813600	817600	I like Soul Calibur III, but maybe that's just me.
817600	820600	Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs
820600	822600	to be played during your music portions.
822600	824600	Did I read that right?
824600	826600	Some of you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands,
826600	829600	I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.
829600	831600	You know, a rock band setup.
831600	833600	Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride saxophone ensemble,
833600	835600	and a few of us are big gamers,
835600	838600	and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.
838600	840600	Right now, I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks,
840600	845600	especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.
845600	849600	As you can guess, the sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.
849600	851600	I've tinkered around with arrangements before,
851600	856600	but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience,
856600	858600	then I'm sure all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.
858600	859600	So how about it?
859600	862600	Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?
862600	864600	I would say so, dude. I played saxophone.
864600	866600	I don't see why not.
866600	870600	One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation,
870600	872600	meaning like ten-minute songs are a little much,
872600	876600	but if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most,
876600	878600	I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while,
878600	881600	but if you have something, you know, radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat,
881600	883600	I don't see why not. Yeah, I don't see why not.
883600	887600	I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet,
887600	890600	so I don't see why not.
890600	893600	Anyway, thanks so much. Keep up the great work.
893600	895600	I really get a kick if this was read on the air.
895600	896600	One of these days, I'll call in.
896600	897600	You should.
897600	898600	There you go. You got a kick.
898600	900600	And you got an orangey.
900600	901600	Yes, you do.
901600	902600	Just for emailing us tonight.
902600	904600	By the way, I wanted to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.
904600	907600	The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone,
907600	908600	it's called Podlines.
908600	910600	Now, we don't like totally endorse this,
910600	913600	because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.
913600	915600	I don't know. I haven't done this in a long time.
915600	916600	But here's the phone number.
916600	922600	It's area code 650-523-6855.
922600	924600	I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.
924600	925600	Let's see what happens,
925600	927600	because I don't know what happens when you call this.
927600	929600	I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens,
929600	931600	or if we get an ad or what.
931600	937600	One ringy dingy.
937600	939600	And it's busy.
939600	940600	I guess we've been taken off the air.
940600	941600	I don't know.
941600	944600	Well, he sent in another part to his email.
944600	945600	All right, fine.
945600	946600	It says, oops, I forgot,
946600	948600	but have any of you watched the Street Fighter the later years?
948600	950600	Yes, I have.
950600	951600	It's so damn funny.
951600	953600	Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2
953600	954600	will appreciate this.
954600	957600	I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.
957600	960600	Yay, gamers.
960600	962600	It's like, okay.
962600	963600	I've watched some of it.
963600	965600	It's pretty darn funny.
965600	967600	Good times.
967600	972600	Well, we actually got an email from our good buddy, Rob,
972600	976600	the two B's, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.
976600	977600	Really?
977600	980600	Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.
980600	981600	Cool.
981600	985600	But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested
985600	989600	for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable
989600	991600	for one of his video game pads.
991600	995600	They haven't said what the system was or anything.
995600	999600	It said that the guy was playing a game
999600	1001600	and the father was trying to get him to stop.
1001600	1005600	He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.
1005600	1008600	The dad took out the power cable
1008600	1014600	and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.
1014600	1016600	Interesting.
1016600	1019600	He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.
1019600	1021600	As you should be.
1021600	1025600	Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?
1025600	1027600	He was mad because he was playing right to speak.
1027600	1029600	Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.
1029600	1031600	No, I said last email.
1031600	1032600	Oh, and?
1032600	1034600	Oh, fine.
1034600	1035600	One more email then.
1035600	1036600	This one's important.
1036600	1037600	It's from Belgium.
1037600	1038600	Oh, cool.
1038600	1039600	Yes.
1039600	1040600	Hey, Sky, DarkSakura and Loki.
1040600	1043600	I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming
1043600	1044600	and I am a PC gamer.
1044600	1047600	It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.
1047600	1049600	I just want to say that I would appreciate very much
1049600	1051600	if you could do a show at noon in your time zone
1051600	1055600	like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.
1055600	1058600	Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep
1058600	1063600	and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.
1063600	1064600	I would love to do that sometime,
1064600	1067600	so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.
1067600	1069600	I always download the podcast on my PSP,
1069600	1072600	so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.
1072600	1074600	I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live,
1074600	1078600	it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.
1078600	1080600	Also, an interesting story perhaps.
1080600	1084600	Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.
1084600	1088600	We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.
1088600	1092600	With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007,
1092600	1096600	the PS3 sold the most closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.
1096600	1099600	Xbox 360 is the least popular console,
1099600	1104600	and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.
1104600	1106600	After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.
1106600	1109600	Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.
1109600	1113600	I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made a lot of people
1113600	1116600	instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money
1116600	1118600	on a next-generation console.
1118600	1122600	I have the feeling the Xbox never was a really big success here,
1122600	1125600	and so many people are more inclined to play a PlayStation 3,
1125600	1129600	although the 360 might have the best games so far.
1129600	1135600	Also, the casual gamers are, of course, going for the Wii over here, too.
1135600	1138600	If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose,
1138600	1140600	because it is the most innovative system,
1140600	1145600	and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.
1145600	1150600	Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Grits, G-R-T-Z.
1150600	1154600	Oh, I'm sorry. That's in closing. His name is Martin.
1154600	1155600	Well, thank you for the e-mail.
1155600	1158600	And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?
1158600	1161600	I have a three-day weekend coming up.
1161600	1164600	Too soon, though. We want to get the word out so people know.
1164600	1167600	Yeah, I know, a three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.
1167600	1168600	We might have Marissa up here, too.
1168600	1169600	Huh?
1169600	1170600	We might have Marissa up here, too.
1170600	1171600	Oh, that would be good.
1171600	1174600	Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.
1174600	1175600	We'll just have to check our schedules,
1175600	1178600	because I know around Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know,
1178600	1182600	things might get busy, but we'll see.
1182600	1187600	Sometime in February. I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.
1187600	1189600	We've done it before, like for pre-taping.
1189600	1192600	Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?
1192600	1193600	I don't see why not.
1193600	1194600	I don't see why not either.
1194600	1196600	We will make that happen for our overseas listeners,
1196600	1198600	but we'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.
1198600	1203600	Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day weekend is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?
1203600	1207600	Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February, President's Day?
1207600	1208600	I do believe so.
1208600	1209600	Maybe we can make it happen around then.
1209600	1210600	Maybe.
1210600	1211600	We'll check our schedules.
1211600	1212600	Okay.
1212600	1213600	All right.
1213600	1217600	Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email,
1217600	1220600	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1220600	1223600	But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with the one and only Loki.
1223600	1224600	Yes.
1224600	1230600	Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that,
1230600	1233600	there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it,
1233600	1235600	one of which was shown off at CES.
1235600	1245600	It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of souped up for Rock Band.
1245600	1254600	It's got the four drums, and then it's got three cymbals as well, mapped to yellow, blue, and green.
1254600	1256600	So that's kind of neat.
1256600	1262600	No word on when it's going to come out or how much it is, but cool nonetheless.
1262600	1272600	Now, one thing that's not so cool but kind of weird is this Rock Band stage kit that was spotted on GameStop,
1272600	1285600	and apparently it's coming out around June for $100, and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show.
1285600	1288600	This actually sounds kind of epic.
1288600	1290600	You know what, though?
1290600	1291600	Oh, Lordy.
1291600	1294600	I still have $200 in store credit around that time. I'll pick it up.
1294600	1296600	That would be awesome.
1296600	1299600	We'll do it during the show. We'll just leave it on during the show.
1299600	1303600	That's right. We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Lawns Radio one night.
1303600	1305600	Hopefully the webcam's back by then.
1305600	1309600	That would be awesome. A light show and smoke.
1309600	1311600	Remind me not to be here for that show.
1311600	1316600	I know, seriously, because you can imagine just how it looks one way on the box,
1316600	1321600	but then when you actually do it in person, it probably smells like farts or something.
1321600	1324600	It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.
1324600	1325600	Seriously, though.
1325600	1330600	We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.
1330600	1332600	Why would you do this?
1332600	1335600	I mean, why would you play this in your living room with smoke and stuff here?
1335600	1338600	I can't see the screen anymore.
1338600	1340600	It's filling up the house full of smoke.
1340600	1343600	Mac Man in our chat room at chat.orangeslawnsradio.com says,
1343600	1347600	Does it come with some weed, too? That would be the true rocker experience.
1347600	1348600	I don't know.
1348600	1352600	It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.
1352600	1356600	It's a pretty well-known company.
1356600	1359600	It's funny, but is it $100 funny?
1359600	1361600	How many of these are they really going to sell?
1361600	1365600	Let me put it this way. If it is an actual smoke machine,
1365600	1367600	I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that,
1367600	1374600	but, dude, you got to buy the liquid smoke for it, and that's expensive.
1374600	1376600	Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine.
1376600	1378600	What the hell are you going to be doing playing with the smoke machine?
1378600	1382600	You can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.
1382600	1384600	I don't know. I think it would be funny.
1384600	1389600	I think it would be funny, too, just to do for one show, but, Loki, $100 funny?
1389600	1390600	I don't know.
1390600	1391600	It's all store credit.
1391600	1394600	Chat room, is it $100 funny? That's what I need to know.
1394600	1399600	I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of Judgment instead.
1399600	1401600	I don't think so.
1401600	1402600	Ain't going to happen.
1402600	1405600	Eye of Judgment rock band smoke machine.
1405600	1407600	Sometimes it's just too hard to tell.
1407600	1408600	Loki, I know what you should do.
1408600	1413600	You should give me that money, and I'm going to put it towards my Disney World trip
1413600	1414600	that Dark Soccer and I are going to take.
1414600	1415600	Right, Dark Soccer?
1415600	1416600	Yes.
1416600	1417600	All right.
1417600	1422600	Disney World is the place that Dark Soccer and I have to visit someday.
1422600	1425600	The cool thing is that maybe this will be up and running by the time we go there.
1425600	1428600	Now, this is just a rumor, but I think this is awesome.
1428600	1432600	Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.
1432600	1435600	Now, this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.
1435600	1443600	You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game
1443600	1445600	on the DS was going to interact with the ride.
1445600	1448600	In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride,
1448600	1451600	you'd unlock a new character or something.
1451600	1456600	Something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to go into the park and actually get this,
1456600	1460600	especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.
1460600	1465600	Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of application
1465600	1466600	that would download to your DS.
1466600	1469600	It would be a tour of the park, basically.
1469600	1470600	What you could do, imagine this.
1470600	1475600	Let's say you use your stylus to click on New Orleans Square.
1475600	1478600	You click on that, and then you can actually click on the Haunted Mansion
1478600	1481600	and see that the wait time for that ride is 20 minutes.
1481600	1482600	Smart.
1482600	1487600	That's a really kick-ass application, I think, in many ways.
1487600	1488600	Oh, thank you.
1488600	1492600	Sorry, we're being brought cookies right now that are being made.
1492600	1494600	I don't want to drop them like I did the coffee.
1494600	1495600	What kind of cookies are these?
1495600	1496600	Snickerdoodles.
1496600	1497600	Snickerdoodles.
1497600	1498600	Oh, I get all three then.
1498600	1499600	No.
1499600	1500600	I'm just kidding.
1500600	1503600	No, you can get me one.
1503600	1504600	All right, hold on.
1504600	1505600	These are hot.
1505600	1506600	These are just out of the oven.
1506600	1510600	All right, guys, the show has been interrupted for cookies.
1510600	1512600	Oh, my gosh, they're so good.
1512600	1514600	I'm waiting to try one.
1514600	1515600	Oh, hot.
1515600	1516600	Hold on.
1516600	1517600	Yeah, I know they're hot.
1517600	1518600	Hold on.
1518600	1519600	Snickerdoodles are like the best cookies.
1519600	1520600	Oh, those are good.
1520600	1521600	What's a snickerdoodle?
1521600	1522600	They're cinnamon sugar cookies.
1522600	1523600	They're cinnamon.
1523600	1525600	They taste like, thank you, Katie.
1525600	1527600	Oh, she can hear it good.
1527600	1528600	All right.
1528600	1529600	So anyway, where were we?
1529600	1530600	Cookie goodness.
1530600	1531600	No, Disney.
1531600	1533600	Let's see.
1533600	1535600	Haunted Mansion wait ride.
1535600	1536600	Oh, yeah.
1536600	1539600	So you can click on an area and see how long the wait is.
1539600	1543600	And you can actually go, let's say you could click on it.
1543600	1545600	And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylist, obviously, right?
1545600	1552180	You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney
1552180	1553600	World, and you could see what their menu is.
1553600	1557840	So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.
1557840	1562600	If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.
1562600	1563600	You have to call Disney Dining.
1563600	1564600	No, I know.
1564600	1565600	I know.
1565600	1566600	But anyway, I think that's kind of rad.
1566600	1567600	That would be an awesome thing.
1567600	1569600	I mean, can you imagine if they did this?
1569600	1574880	Like, me, you, Chris, Megsy would all have to make a trip and just have our DSs out the
1574880	1575880	whole time.
1575880	1576880	Like, okay, what's got a short wait right now?
1576880	1577880	Let's go to Indy.
1577880	1578880	Right?
1578880	1579880	It'd be fun.
1579880	1582720	That would be a very smart thing, but we go to Disneyland much more than we go to Disney
1582720	1583720	World.
1583720	1585880	But someday, someday we have to make it to Disney World.
1585880	1589080	I'm actually planning on going sometime this year, which is partly why we didn't renew
1589080	1590480	my annual pass.
1590480	1592600	Sounds like fun, though.
1592600	1598280	Well, something else is really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now.
1598280	1606880	Is it Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games?
1606880	1612720	Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games,
1612720	1621840	which is PEGL Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,
1621840	1624600	and Portal First Slice.
1624600	1637920	And First Slice, it's actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.
1637920	1642360	So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.
1642360	1643360	But it's kind of cool.
1643360	1648360	And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike, so
1648360	1653200	they can have real-life versus competitions and things like that.
1653200	1654200	Cool.
1654200	1656800	Sorry, chewing on a cookie.
1656800	1660000	I know, cookies are freaking good.
1660000	1668160	Anyways, let's see, last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are
1668160	1676040	trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.
1676040	1682240	Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how
1682240	1684640	much they're really entitled to.
1684640	1688460	And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.
1688460	1693080	One day worth of outages is approximately 13.7 cents.
1693080	1698080	So for about the six days of outages, that's 82 cents.
1698080	1702480	Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.
1702480	1710820	So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.
1710820	1714840	And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.
1714840	1719680	And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft, 82 cents.
1719680	1721880	No, I'm just kidding.
1721880	1724240	They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.
1724240	1729800	Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it, so you're getting a way better deal
1729800	1730800	this way.
1730800	1735720	Yeah, but at the same time, how do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?
1735720	1740360	I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.
1740360	1741920	How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?
1741920	1742920	Just saying.
1742920	1743920	You don't know.
1743920	1744920	You don't.
1744920	1745920	But anyway.
1745920	1747920	No, Darktitsuyu, you're right.
1747920	1751080	Darktitsuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.
1751080	1752080	You're right, I'm not.
1752080	1753080	It's stupid.
1753080	1756560	Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.
1756560	1760200	They don't owe me anything but a hug.
1760200	1764800	I would like a hug and reassurance that everything will be okay soon.
1764800	1770320	Anyhow, you would think that maybe more news on the lawsuit would invoke our FUs of the
1770320	1775240	week or possibly win a stupid award, but my God, how could we when there was this news
1775240	1776880	that came out this week?
1776880	1785400	And this has to do with a certain CEO in the UK named Steve Easterbrook.
1785400	1791680	He made a quote this week blaming video games for the obesity epidemic.
1791680	1793640	I don't know who is to blame.
1793640	1797640	The issue of obesity is complex and is absolutely one our society is facing.
1797640	1801320	There's no denial about that, but if you break it down, I think there's an education piece.
1801320	1804800	How can we better communicate to individuals the importance of a balanced diet and taking
1804800	1806000	care of themselves?
1806000	1807520	Then there's a lifestyle element.
1807520	1811700	There's fewer green spaces and kids are sat home playing computer games on the TV when
1811700	1814680	in the past they'd have been burning off energy outside.
1814680	1816040	Okay, fair enough.
1816040	1819840	Just another person trying to knock video games for making kids fat.
1819840	1822280	But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.
1822280	1824600	Do you know who he's the CEO of?
1824600	1825600	McDonald's.
1825600	1835080	It's all their blame game thing trying to get the thing off of them, especially since
1835080	1839480	they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.
1839480	1842760	So I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.
1842760	1846880	I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo
1846880	1852600	64 play zones and stuff, so it's not like, granted, he's in the UK and it's America.
1852600	1856000	Here, kid, go play with some old games.
1856000	1858600	They still have Nintendo 64 after all these years.
1858600	1861520	Don't they have a DS wireless station too?
1861520	1864480	I seem to remember that was big news last year.
1864480	1871720	But anyhow, regardless, despite that hypocrisy where McDonald's actually endorses video games
1871720	1876560	in their stores, there's just that whole thing about, okay, well, so the video games make
1876560	1881800	kids fat, but the chicken McNuggets and hot apple pies with the molten lava in the center
1881800	1887600	of them do not make kids fat, or McFlurries and cones.
1887600	1888600	You know what it is?
1888600	1889600	What?
1889600	1891140	And actually, he did say it himself.
1891140	1894680	It's a matter of lifestyle.
1894680	1901000	You can sit around all day and play a game, or you can get out and engage in a sport,
1901000	1905280	but also it has to do with what you're eating.
1905280	1909520	And this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.
1909520	1913560	She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her
1913560	1917480	plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym,
1917480	1922320	and it tricked her body right back into losing again because it's like, okay, well, I'm no
1922320	1927240	longer on this little amount of food, I'm on this much food, and so it went right back
1927240	1928240	into burning.
1928240	1931840	I mean, you've got to eat to lose, is how it works.
1931840	1933720	McDonald's can be a part of a healthy diet.
1933720	1934720	It can.
1934720	1938480	Well, especially they've enacted so many different choices that they have.
1938480	1941520	You can get apples, as long as you don't dip them in caramel sauce.
1941520	1945440	I freaking love that apple walnut salad thingy they have there.
1945440	1946720	Be careful of the yogurt dressing.
1946720	1947720	Yeah.
1947720	1950680	Well, not just that, but the walnuts themselves aren't that healthy, but certainly more healthy
1950680	1953120	than a quarter pounder with cheese, right?
1953120	1958220	Well, yeah, and it's all a matter of not only looking at the content of your food but looking
1958220	1960280	at how much of it you are eating.
1960280	1961280	Right.
1961280	1966400	I mean, you can even go and have a freaking Chicken McNuggets meal as long as you have
1966400	1971100	it once a week and you don't get super-sized french fries.
1971100	1973480	You have your six nuggets and small fries.
1973480	1975640	No, you don't eat the french fries.
1975640	1976640	Or whatever.
1976640	1980920	If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.
1980920	1982680	And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.
1982680	1983680	I've done that before.
1983680	1986000	Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.
1986000	1988080	I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.
1988080	1991920	So regardless, just saying, you know, it's not like you eat it occasionally and not every
1991920	1992920	day.
1992920	1993920	You're fine.
1993920	1994920	It's not where you eat.
1994920	1998360	It's not, you know, it's what you do and what you eat.
1998360	2001440	It's not the where, the who, the any of that.
2001440	2005100	It's what you're doing.
2005100	2007840	It's nobody else's fault but your own.
2007840	2010160	That's how I say it.
2010160	2012800	Or just be fat and be beautiful.
2012800	2013800	If you're happy.
2013800	2014800	Be BB.
2014800	2017440	Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman or a BBM.
2017440	2018440	You know what?
2018440	2023840	People should be happy the way they are and I think that a lot of this, you know, crap
2023840	2030040	that people go through for, you know, the yo-yo diets and all of that is just people
2030040	2031040	being unhappy with themselves.
2031040	2035440	And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself and, you know, and I know
2035440	2038720	that I don't always, you know, do the same thing myself but the moment that you are happy
2038720	2042880	with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body
2042880	2043880	is going to follow.
2043880	2044880	All right.
2044880	2045880	Well, anyway.
2045880	2047880	Or you won't care.
2047880	2053040	Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites
2053040	2060920	a certain sort of rage within us that can only be crushed by us venting our FUs of the
2060920	2063920	week.
2063920	2072240	I accidentally used the old song tonight but we'll deal.
2072240	2073240	Sorry.
2073240	2074240	Dark Sakura.
2074240	2078000	I don't know if you're using the old music.
2078000	2086800	Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day, I've had sort of a disappointing day and disappointing
2086800	2088000	is a very good word for it.
2088000	2097600	I've had multiple in a row disappointments and I want an iMac so FU to me not having
2097600	2099960	an iMac.
2099960	2102680	I'll go next if you're done.
2102680	2107680	My FU goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today, well, first FU to me for putting
2107680	2108680	in the wrong song.
2108680	2113560	FU to this cup of coffee for getting cold and then FU to me going to the store today
2113560	2115880	without my wallet.
2115880	2120320	That's a bit embarrassing if you go to the front with a full thing of groceries and you
2120320	2121320	don't have your wallet.
2121320	2123600	Thank God I didn't do that.
2123600	2127960	So if you're picturing me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because
2127960	2132080	thank God I was looking for something at the store to deal with the fly problem we have
2132080	2136920	here in the studio and while I was browsing, that was the first thing I was looking at
2136920	2140240	and I got a phone call while I was browsing and as I reached for my phone, that was the
2140240	2144000	moment I realized, hey, wait a minute, my phone's here but my wallet's not so thankfully
2144000	2147800	I just put the cart back empty and snuck out of the store like nothing ever happened in
2147800	2148800	the first place.
2148800	2151800	But that still was a waste of gas.
2151800	2162320	FU to the muscle that's cold in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me
2162320	2165320	to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.
2165320	2166320	It hurts when you laugh?
2166320	2167320	It hurts when I laugh.
2167320	2170320	I will give you a bit of advice if you are going to rub it good clockwise because otherwise
2170320	2173160	you will get a constitution.
2173160	2175160	It's true.
2175160	2176720	Have you had trouble going lately?
2176720	2178440	No, I have not had trouble going.
2178440	2179880	No, no, no, no.
2179880	2183880	I have actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion
2183880	2187440	grows clockwise and you can actually block your digestion by going counter-clockwise
2187440	2189720	if you are looking at your stomach.
2189720	2190720	You learn something new every day.
2190720	2191720	You really do.
2191720	2192720	You can actually handle it.
2192720	2193720	I want really good.
2193720	2194720	Yeah.
2194720	2200920	Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.
2200920	2204360	Is that a trick I can play on my friends is run up to people and rub their bellies counter-clockwise
2204360	2206080	and go, ha ha, you're constipated.
2206080	2209160	No, it takes everyone.
2209160	2210720	I'm just being a little silly.
2210720	2214600	Although Mac Man in chat says it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make
2214600	2215600	Loki laugh.
2215600	2221120	I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 Deaths video and that was painful enough.
2221120	2224240	I'm going to put my advice in the chat window.
2224240	2225240	All right.
2225240	2228240	You need to do your next story, Dark Soccer, before you get to advice.
2228240	2233120	Games first, constipation later.
2233120	2243160	Starting out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have Star Tropics for NES.
2243160	2246240	It was released on the 11th.
2246240	2255120	Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so they are getting that, which
2255120	2261280	is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.
2261280	2262280	It was a master system.
2262280	2264920	Actually, no, it was not on Master System.
2264920	2270080	I do believe it was a Genesis game.
2270080	2271080	Any news yet?
2271080	2272080	No, I take that back.
2272080	2276040	It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.
2276040	2278760	Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?
2278760	2279760	I have no idea.
2279760	2280760	In the US?
2280760	2281760	All right.
2281760	2284440	Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
2284440	2286440	In the meantime, more news.
2286440	2296320	In the latest editorial for EGM, the editor-in-chief, Dan Hsu, actually called out three companies
2296320	2302320	for allegedly refusing to work with the magazine due to negative reviews of their games.
2302320	2307960	According to him, the three companies involved with that would be Midway's Mortal Kombat
2307960	2317080	team, the Sony Sports Division, and Ubisoft, and they're flat-out refusing to give EGM
2317080	2324800	access to early previews or reviews, and so basically he said, warning readers, that they're
2324800	2332240	going to get little, late, or no coverage of these three companies' games, and they
2332240	2336780	won't treat these products or companies any differently, they'll just cover them to their
2336780	2344240	best ability without their support, because after all, they're writing for the reader,
2344240	2345320	not them.
2345320	2350240	So that's kind of interesting that he called them out.
2350240	2354320	I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies, because after the whole
2354320	2359720	Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of herd them.
2359720	2366440	I kind of support the calling out of these companies, yeah, so I don't know.
2366440	2369540	Part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is such huge news, but I think it
2369540	2375880	is kind of big, because somebody's kind of finally taking a step and saying, let's call
2375880	2380920	them out on what they're doing, and the fact that if they get negative reviews, they leave
2380920	2383860	the room with their panties in a huff, but I'm just surprised that somebody would do
2383860	2389160	this to a company like EGM, Ziff Davis, who has the one-up, they have a lot of muscles,
2389160	2391720	so that seems kind of counterproductive.
2391720	2395920	Your company is going to put out a game that's not well-liked once in a while, but the same
2395920	2401080	thing happens with movie studios, and does 20th Century Fox stop showing their movies
2401080	2403800	to Roger Ebert just because they don't like one of his reviews?
2403800	2404800	No?
2404800	2405800	You just, you deal.
2405800	2410760	Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative feedback
2410760	2411760	for them.
2411760	2418680	I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but this isn't the first companies
2418680	2419680	to do this.
2419680	2424600	Apparently, Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from EGM as well, and now they're
2424600	2428160	back supporting them, so...
2428160	2429160	I don't know.
2429160	2433000	It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game's
2433000	2436680	going to be exposed to less people, you know?
2436680	2441160	Coverage is coverage, you know, you may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.
2441160	2447180	Sometimes too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind
2447180	2448180	of ruin it.
2448180	2452200	Like, you know, it might not be, like, for instance, I did not have a positive experience
2452200	2456520	with Capcom at one E3, but that's because they had one douchey person representing them
2456520	2461280	that kind of treated me kind of mean and looked down on me because I wasn't a journalist from
2461280	2465120	some big, huge magazine or whatever, but I had some shitty little podcast, right?
2465120	2468880	So that kind of tarnished Capcom's image, but I'm sure there's a lot of great people
2468880	2472080	that work for that company, and they do put out a lot of very solid games, but it did
2472080	2476040	kind of leave you this taste in my mouth of, like, wow, Capcom kind of fucking sucks, but
2476040	2481060	it obviously didn't impact the amount of news or coverage we did on this program, but sometimes
2481060	2487480	one douchey person can really, you know, so I kind of wonder, maybe it's not necessarily
2487480	2492320	Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their
2492320	2494560	feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.
2494560	2498920	It is pretty bad, and it's all, it wasn't really reviews, it was based on, like, previews
2498920	2503360	and stuff, because they're being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these
2503360	2507280	bugs in the game, you know, and hopefully they get worked out, because otherwise, you
2507280	2509100	know, it's gonna suck.
2509100	2511880	And I think that's an honest opinion.
2511880	2515800	And they realize that it's, you know, not finished yet, and that's why they phrased
2515800	2519520	it in such a way, but, you know, apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you
2519520	2523480	talk about our game, blah, blah, blah, you know, they only want glowing reviews.
2523480	2527000	Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit
2527000	2530240	it to the magazine, then, if you don't want anyone doing that.
2530240	2533480	Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.
2533480	2536400	We'll just do it all like press releases or something like that.
2536400	2538600	Then everybody can own a game magazine.
2538600	2541200	Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, period.
2541200	2546480	I mean, when I say public I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know,
2546480	2548300	literally the public at trade shows and things.
2548300	2551680	Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, that's all.
2551680	2553640	That's good customer service, right?
2553640	2554980	I don't know.
2554980	2555980	Right.
2555980	2557000	Good customer service.
2557000	2560460	Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're
2560460	2565700	in a PR department, then your customer is the press, so be careful who you have representing.
2565700	2570980	Well, and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer
2570980	2579860	service classes when I, you know, worked on the phone, is that for every one person that
2579860	2585580	is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to
2585580	2589180	talk to their friends, and they're going to talk to their friends, and they're going to
2589180	2590180	talk to their friends.
2590180	2595920	It's sort of like dropping, you know, a boulder in a lake or something.
2595920	2597660	Eventually it's going to cause enough waves.
2597660	2601580	Something I don't talk about a lot on this program, but my day job, I actually am a trainer
2601580	2606980	for customer service for our call center for a major health insurance company.
2606980	2612580	So you know, I definitely, it always makes me frown when I see poor customer service,
2612580	2617900	whether it be at a, you know, at a Safeway, Bel Air grocery store type thing, or a, you
2617900	2618900	know, video game trade show.
2618900	2621220	What the hell is wrong with you?
2621220	2622220	It's easy.
2622220	2623220	Just be nice.
2623220	2624220	It's a tough job.
2624220	2627860	Customer service is a tough job, and so I never, like whenever I call in, if I'm like
2627860	2631860	totally pissed off, like the, you know, let's say the cable's down or whatever, you know,
2631860	2635140	it's been down for a long time or whatever, and I call in, I never get mad at the rep.
2635140	2637940	I just go, I'm really upset about this situation.
2637940	2640040	What can we do to resolve the situation?
2640040	2642460	You know, I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job, and it's
2642460	2643460	a very challenging job.
2643460	2646660	And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to
2646660	2647660	try and help you.
2647660	2649060	Unless they're being douchebags.
2649060	2652780	Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.
2652780	2655180	And do not ask for the supervisor first.
2655180	2656180	Give them a chance.
2656180	2657180	Exactly.
2657180	2660620	SSJ100Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?
2660620	2662940	Yeah, but that was just a, that was a stupid prank.
2662940	2663940	That's different.
2663940	2664940	Much different.
2664940	2665940	All right.
2665940	2669740	Anyhow, let's talk about something else.
2669740	2672060	Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the diamond card?
2672060	2673060	Don't you have one of these, Loki?
2673060	2674060	Yes, I do have one of these.
2674060	2677540	I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the
2677540	2679860	Xbox Live diamond card, which gets you discount.
2679860	2681660	Have you ever used the diamond card out of curiosity?
2681660	2682660	No.
2682660	2683660	That's what I thought.
2683660	2685740	I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.
2685740	2687700	Well, it won't be free much longer.
2687700	2691560	It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.
2691560	2694620	Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the diamond
2694620	2699340	card program is moving over to a new kind of system.
2699340	2701340	It's the Passport Unlimited.
2701340	2702340	So anyhow.
2702340	2706860	To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what your, unless
2706860	2713660	you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's
2713660	2714660	not very good.
2714660	2717800	I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.
2717800	2721660	It's nothing really, I don't know, it works for me.
2721660	2723380	I just have one because it's neat.
2723380	2728660	Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.
2728660	2730700	I am assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.
2730700	2736500	Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee, and I don't think a lot of people will be.
2736500	2740780	I don't see why he would need to pay a $7 fee.
2740780	2744220	Well I don't know if somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, Hitstun in the
2744220	2747980	chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave and Buster's.
2747980	2748980	That's a pretty fun place.
2748980	2750980	Wait a second though.
2750980	2752840	Let's just think about this for a second.
2752840	2757380	How are these businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the
2757380	2762180	diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not?
2762180	2763780	You're just going to have your card.
2763780	2765580	Does it have a barcode?
2765580	2767860	I don't know.
2767860	2771080	It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.
2771080	2772080	Expiration date?
2772080	2774940	I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way...
2774940	2775940	Loki's getting out the card.
2775940	2776940	He's getting out his wallet.
2776940	2777940	He's getting out the card.
2777940	2778940	Let's see here.
2778940	2779940	Hold on.
2779940	2780940	That's a good question.
2780940	2781980	How are they going to know?
2781980	2785820	It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they
2785820	2786820	know?
2786820	2787820	Oh wait, it has the year on it.
2787820	2788820	I don't know.
2788820	2790740	Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.
2790740	2793940	I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.
2793940	2794940	They use their student ID years later.
2794940	2797820	It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year, so...
2797820	2798820	But it does have a...
2798820	2800340	Wait, let me see.
2800340	2801340	It doesn't have an expiration date?
2801340	2802340	No, it does.
2802340	2803340	No, it does.
2803340	2804340	Expiration 507.
2804340	2806540	So there you go.
2806540	2807740	Maybe that's all they know.
2807740	2809460	They'll send something out to all the retailers that say...
2809460	2812820	Those things suck anyways, because I remember when that program first came around, it took
2812820	2818740	me like six months to get mine, so even if you paid the $7, you're already pissed away
2818740	2821740	half a year, so I don't know.
2821740	2822780	Oh, alright.
2822780	2824220	So I don't know.
2824220	2827200	I'd be curious to see if anybody in chat...
2827200	2830060	Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?
2830060	2832780	That's what I'd like to know, or get some phone calls on that later.
2832780	2836980	Meanwhile, while we await that feedback, we'll move on to another story.
2836980	2845500	Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle, and Bust-A-Move, and Bliss Island for the
2845500	2849820	Xbox 360.
2849820	2853500	Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.
2853500	2858980	I don't know, I haven't really played it any, but then there's also...
2858980	2864340	I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
2864340	2867700	Peggle is fun, actually.
2867700	2871220	It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.
2871220	2873380	You know, I'll say this about the PopCap games.
2873380	2877580	Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played
2877580	2883120	are really addicting and fun, and you know, I see people at work playing those games all
2883120	2884820	the time on their breaks and stuff.
2884820	2890300	I was going to say, Peggle was confirmed that it is coming out, so PopCap did confirm that
2890300	2891300	one.
2891300	2892300	Wow.
2892300	2893300	It's fun!
2893300	2894300	I like Peggle.
2894300	2896860	So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.
2896860	2899060	Why would you rate them if they're not?
2899060	2900060	Exactly.
2900060	2901060	Exactly.
2901060	2907420	Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room, except SSJ100Matt says, I still use
2907420	2910900	my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts, so...
2910900	2912300	Yeah, that's the other thing, too.
2912300	2915980	I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really
2915980	2920540	going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?
2920540	2921540	They might not.
2921540	2927340	Or they may just not care, so try it.
2927340	2932220	So with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive, you may be wondering,
2932220	2933860	what the hell am I going to use this for?
2933860	2939020	Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't
2939020	2943240	really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out
2943240	2944700	for a while now.
2944700	2950420	But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.
2950420	2953780	Five gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive.
2953780	2959180	Oh, and by the way, that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes.
2959180	2965260	So before you can play your game, you must waste 40 minutes.
2965260	2967780	Awesome.
2967780	2971220	And I know that's not the only game that has you install it to its hard drive.
2971220	2976820	Like for example, Ratchet and Clank, Ridge Racer has the option to do that, I'm pretty
2976820	2980460	sure Oblivion does, and a bunch of other ones.
2980460	2982060	Cool.
2982060	2987460	Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?
2987460	2988460	I think so.
2988460	2989980	Does it save that much time by doing so?
2989980	2990980	I don't know.
2990980	2991980	Probably not.
2991980	2994700	You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.
2994700	2996060	God damn, that game is great.
2996060	2997060	It really is.
2997060	2999660	You have to do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.
2999660	3001540	Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?
3001540	3002540	No.
3002540	3003540	At all?
3003540	3004540	You know they've got to be making it.
3004540	3008180	Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.
3008180	3009180	Why?
3009180	3010940	I want to go back and play.
3010940	3011940	That's not Oblivion.
3011940	3012940	Half-Life 2 or something.
3012940	3015940	Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter IV when it's released, because it looks better and
3015940	3016940	better every day.
3016940	3018340	I actually like the look of Street Fighter IV.
3018340	3021780	I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me, and of course
3021780	3024980	Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love,
3024980	3028620	like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzim has been announced as well.
3028620	3029620	But there's some new characters.
3029620	3035560	One of the new ones is Crimson Viper, and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine
3035560	3038180	scans that were posted all over the interwebs.
3038180	3042740	Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit, but with more boobage,
3042740	3046300	like you know King from Art of Fighting, and this big pink ponytail.
3046300	3050380	But she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her.
3050380	3052580	So she looks like she could be fun.
3052580	3058420	Dark Soccer, you could probably cosplay that, you know, with the glasses look and everything.
3058420	3059420	That's quite alright.
3059420	3060420	You don't want to do the boobage?
3060420	3062420	Well, I have before.
3062420	3070220	No, I've cosplayed Biken before from Guilty Gear, because I remember Evan helped me with
3070220	3071220	Claw.
3071220	3072220	Oh, true true.
3072220	3073820	We stayed up for three days working on it.
3073820	3079460	They just need to come out with Namco and Capcom need to kind of come together, and
3079460	3085340	also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter, just like large-breasted women fighting games.
3085340	3087380	And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.
3087380	3091140	Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.
3091140	3096840	Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style, never seen in the Street
3096840	3097840	Fighter series.
3097840	3102260	Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boops.
3102260	3103320	I doubt that.
3103320	3106500	Or probably fighting with her hair, although, wait, wasn't that done before?
3106500	3108140	I think that was done before somewhere.
3108140	3111980	That was Milia in Guilty Gear.
3111980	3120160	Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing... at least it's a rumor right now that there's
3120160	3122420	another Resident Evil arcade game.
3122420	3126540	I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.
3126540	3130300	Well, yeah, there were the gun survivor games.
3130300	3132180	Oh, those were in the arcade?
3132180	3133180	Yeah.
3133180	3134180	Oh, cool.
3134180	3136220	I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.
3136220	3141780	That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.
3141780	3149900	But the voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working
3149900	3156540	for M on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.
3156540	3159740	She said that she really likes playing Jill.
3159740	3164420	And the quote at the end of what she had to say is, you can bet it'll be on the lookout
3164420	3169060	for the game in arcades there.
3169060	3173660	They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.
3173660	3176180	I don't know, the gun survivor games are fun.
3176180	3178340	That should better be coming to a console.
3178340	3179340	I hope the Wii.
3179340	3180340	It should.
3180340	3181700	I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.
3181700	3185300	Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii with
3185300	3187720	the using the gun controller thingy.
3187720	3192260	And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.
3192260	3196380	Because I don't know about target terror, but something tells me it's not going to be
3196380	3197380	that good.
3197380	3203580	Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old gun survivor games,
3203580	3206540	that they, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?
3206540	3208620	How it had the controller on it?
3208620	3212740	I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've
3212740	3216820	got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game.
3216820	3221260	And you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have
3221260	3222260	your gun.
3222260	3228340	We were talking about how they should do a walk through House of the Dead that used that
3228340	3229340	sort of functionality.
3229340	3231780	I think that that would work for a gun survivor.
3231780	3234980	That's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.
3234980	3236980	Very cool.
3236980	3238760	The Skype line will be opening soon, by the way.
3238760	3241940	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can always give us a call toll free
3241940	3245820	in the U.S. and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3245820	3249220	Username on Skype again, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one more story before we get to that.
3249220	3252980	So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the Wii
3252980	3256360	Ware service is going to actually come out.
3256360	3260140	Now a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine
3260140	3264780	Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch
3264780	3268240	date is scheduled for this March.
3268240	3273220	So with, I know, Game Developers Conference right around the corner, maybe that's something
3273220	3276860	that they'll talk about since, you know, that would be something that developers would be
3276860	3279660	interested in, maybe.
3279660	3281940	Oh, that's true.
3281940	3285140	That's a really good point, is that possibly that's something we'll be seeing around Game
3285140	3286140	Developers Conference.
3286140	3287140	I hope so.
3287140	3291380	That would make sense, because, you know, something that they can produce games cheaply
3291380	3295060	on their service, it would be right up their alley for them to announce something like
3295060	3296060	that.
3296060	3299080	I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive
3299080	3302700	or something to keep all this crap on that I download.
3302700	3305180	I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.
3305180	3309620	At least allowing you to put them on, like, memory sticks or something like that.
3309620	3313380	Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again doesn't work
3313380	3314380	for me.
3314380	3316060	What's the point of having a damn SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to
3316060	3317380	use it?
3317380	3320580	Or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.
3320580	3325380	So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?
3325380	3326820	I've done that a lot, actually.
3326820	3328020	A little silly.
3328020	3329020	It's silly, but it's fun.
3329020	3332580	So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?
3332580	3333580	Only a couple.
3333580	3336380	I don't have a lot of friends, I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of
3336380	3337380	seeing that.
3337380	3339660	I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.
3339660	3343460	I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.
3343460	3344660	I have it, nah nah nah.
3344660	3347060	I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.
3347060	3348060	Okay.
3348060	3352620	I'd be like, Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.
3352620	3354860	Actually, we've had a problem with our Wii Connect.
3354860	3355860	Oh no.
3355860	3356860	It hasn't wanted to.
3356860	3357860	Oh, that sucks.
3357860	3361580	So we've had a hard time updating our software.
3361580	3364260	So, ew.
3364260	3365260	What a bummer.
3365260	3366260	All right.
3366260	3371460	Well, let's open up the Skype line at username Orange Launch Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3371460	3374460	Our Skype line is now open for business.
3374460	3377060	And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.
3377060	3378060	Hi.
3378060	3379060	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
3379060	3380060	Who's this?
3380060	3381060	This is Ravenstaufen.
3381060	3382060	How are you?
3382060	3383060	I'm fine.
3383060	3384980	And I'm so shocked and odd that you got through first somehow.
3384980	3385980	Hello.
3385980	3387420	You got a quick finger there dialing in.
3387420	3388420	That's all right.
3388420	3389420	What's on your mind, buddy?
3389420	3390420	What's on my mind?
3390420	3391420	Alex Navarro.
3391420	3392420	What's on your mind?
3392420	3393900	Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.
3393900	3397460	We brought him up briefly in part A. What did you want to say?
3397460	3398780	You know, that's a shocker.
3398780	3402060	You know, the other guy, Greg Provo, left and now Jeff.
3402060	3404780	It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.
3404780	3407660	It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.
3407660	3413660	And you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.
3413660	3414660	I don't know.
3414660	3418100	Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is
3418100	3424780	just some corporate website and you know, I mean, I don't, I don't really have, you
3424780	3428300	know, attachments to reviewers, you know what I mean?
3428300	3435060	It's just, I guess you could say, okay, this just continues that fallout from what was
3435060	3440380	a huge thing that happened in the journalistic industry as a whole late last year, but I
3440380	3441380	don't know.
3441380	3443060	I'm kind of over it at this point.
3443060	3447060	You know, I think, I think lots of lessons have been learned here that aren't soon to
3447060	3451260	be repeated, especially now this whole, you know, now it's, oh, we're not afraid to name
3451260	3452540	names after this week.
3452540	3453540	You know what I mean?
3453540	3454540	What do you think about all that?
3454540	3456260	I just watch IGN myself.
3456260	3459500	What do you think about the editorial from EGM?
3459500	3461260	I just think that's just a little shocking.
3461260	3464100	He's just going like, yeah, F them.
3464100	3465100	I don't care.
3465100	3466100	Yeah.
3466100	3467540	You know, we're blackball you.
3467540	3468800	Just send, we'll send you the game.
3468800	3469800	We just rate games.
3469800	3474620	So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs
3474620	3475620	to do.
3475620	3479560	Well, it was kind of, but it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was
3479560	3483980	going rawr, we're going to beat you up because he was like, well, we'll review their games
3483980	3489140	anyway, but it just might be slower because you know, they don't send us the free stuff.
3489140	3492820	But I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.
3492820	3494180	I mean, look at what we're doing.
3494180	3495180	Hello.
3495180	3498280	You know, but I understand we don't, we're not for profit either and all these guys are.
3498280	3503780	So obviously it's a little different, but you know, if you love what you do, you can
3503780	3504780	do it.
3504780	3505780	I know I do.
3505780	3508180	But I understand you got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.
3508180	3510860	So what else did you want to share with us Raven's Dolphin?
3510860	3511860	Anything else?
3511860	3512860	Yes.
3512860	3513860	One more thing.
3513860	3515740	You were talking about that four girls finger painting.
3515740	3521180	I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday
3521180	3524180	night and they kind of dug me.
3524180	3525780	They had to get some digs out of me.
3525780	3527940	So I had to watch it live on air.
3527940	3530020	So this video is really bad.
3530020	3531660	So stay away.
3531660	3532820	I've heard things.
3532820	3536360	I actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on Perez
3536360	3537360	Hilton.com.
3537360	3538360	Don't laugh.
3538360	3542780	And I saw his reaction video to it and it was kind of funny.
3542780	3546860	So is there really on YouTube?
3546860	3549780	Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead operator 11.
3549780	3551540	Oh, it's on operator 11.
3551540	3553300	Really where can I find it?
3553300	3559860	Under my name, just saying return of Raven's Dolphin under my account.
3559860	3562220	How far in the show do I have to look?
3562220	3563220	Not far.
3563220	3564220	It should be like right there.
3564220	3568940	It should be like the second one before failure, before the cartoon cast and all that.
3568940	3569940	Search for it later.
3569940	3570940	I'll give you the thing.
3570940	3572500	Are you Raven's Dolphin one here?
3572500	3573500	Let's see.
3573500	3574500	Did you?
3574500	3575500	Yeah, I'm one.
3575500	3576500	Cartoon cast?
3576500	3577500	I don't care about cartoon cast.
3577500	3578500	Where's return of Raven's Dolphin?
3578500	3579500	Poop on a stick.
3579500	3580500	Return of dolphin.
3580500	3581500	Poop on a stick.
3581500	3582500	Return of dolphin.
3582500	3583500	Oh, there it is.
3583500	3585500	Why did you call it poop on a stick?
3585500	3587500	That's kind of nasty.
3587500	3588500	Because it is nasty.
3588500	3589500	All right.
3589500	3590860	Where, where in the show will I see this?
3590860	3592420	Right at the very beginning?
3592420	3595100	Yeah, it's only six minutes.
3595100	3596460	We're not watching all six minutes.
3596460	3597460	Just speed it up.
3597460	3598460	Speed it up.
3598460	3599460	Speed it up.
3599460	3600460	It's epic.
3600460	3601460	It should be epic.
3601460	3602460	I'm doing it right now.
3602460	3603460	I'm doing it right now.
3603460	3604460	Oh, I think he's doing it.
3604460	3605460	Wow, my precious ears.
3605460	3606460	I'm sorry.
3606460	3607460	That's all right.
3607460	3608460	I said it was loud.
3608460	3609460	That's all right.
3609460	3625180	Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.
3625180	3626180	It was chaos.
3626180	3627180	What do you expect?
3627180	3628340	But, I mean, all right.
3628340	3629340	Forget it.
3629340	3630340	I'm wasting everybody's time.
3630340	3631340	I was doing it from a MacBook.
3631340	3632340	All right.
3632340	3633340	I'm wasting everybody's time.
3633340	3636100	Anything else you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?
3636100	3637100	Not just that.
3637100	3638100	And bye.
3638100	3639100	All right.
3639100	3640100	All right.
3640100	3641100	If you want to give us a call.
3641100	3642100	Forget it.
3642100	3643100	Another one's already coming in.
3643100	3644100	Hi.
3644100	3645100	You're on Orange Lawn's radio.
3645100	3646100	Who's this?
3646100	3647100	GS68.
3647100	3648100	Hi, GS68.
3648100	3649100	What's on your mind?
3649100	3655020	Well, with the release of Rock Band, as I expected, there are people who think it's
3655020	3656500	the first game to have a drum part.
3656500	3657500	Wait.
3657500	3658500	I'm sorry.
3658500	3659500	We're in the back.
3659500	3660500	You're a little quiet.
3660500	3661500	Get close to your microphone and repeat that.
3661500	3662500	I'm sorry.
3662500	3667220	Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people
3667220	3669260	who think it's the first game to use drums.
3669260	3670260	Oh, yeah.
3670260	3671260	Of course.
3671260	3672260	Yeah.
3672260	3673780	I mean, didn't the same thing happen with Guitar Hero?
3673780	3678540	Like, remember how all these awards were lavished upon Guitar Hero for being original?
3678540	3679540	Yeah.
3679540	3680540	Just an original game, et cetera.
3680540	3684420	And to be fair, it did, you know, I would say there was a lot original about Guitar
3684420	3685420	Hero.
3685420	3689060	It wasn't the first game to ever use a guitar, but it was the first one to be so successful.
3689060	3690540	But then, remember this?
3690540	3696180	Remember when, I think it was X-Play, then did a review of Beatmania here in America,
3696180	3698540	and they said it was a ripoff of Guitar Hero?
3698540	3702340	And like, all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like,
3702340	3703340	what the fuck?
3703340	3704340	You guys are stupid.
3704340	3705340	Right?
3705340	3710500	It's just kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get
3710500	3712660	the credit for doing it first.
3712660	3713660	Of course.
3713660	3720900	Well, on top of Rock Band's drums, before anyone calls me up and money elite this, Drummino
3720900	3722660	is not the first game to have drums.
3722660	3728500	Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?
3728500	3732720	You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?
3732720	3736140	Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?
3736140	3737460	Like I don't really think there was anything to it.
3737460	3739980	Like I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.
3739980	3743140	Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.
3743140	3747540	You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with
3747540	3748540	them.
3748540	3749540	But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?
3749540	3750540	Bad songs?
3750540	3751540	Did they?
3751540	3753980	I don't know, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.
3753980	3755980	There's nothing like that.
3755980	3756980	Interesting.
3756980	3758780	I'm not sure.
3758780	3759780	When did the first...
3759780	3760780	Well, let's see.
3760780	3764700	If Drumscape was out in 96, the first DDR was out in 98.
3764700	3765700	So I don't know.
3765700	3768220	Actually, I think it was 97 or so.
3768220	3773220	I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.
3773220	3777740	I had to tag it with the tag.
3777740	3781460	Well Darktad soon did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.
3781460	3783820	So maybe it was around the same time as DrumMania.
3783820	3788820	But regardless, I mean, I get your point, is that maybe, you know, even so, you could
3788820	3794180	say that I'm sure there were older games that even made use of drums.
3794180	3798620	Maybe not like a full drum peripheral, but I'm trying to think of like older games.
3798620	3802740	This whole topic came back to me as a recent gif after recent Rockman, and someone's like,
3802740	3809980	oh, there's another game besides Donkey Kong that uses drums, and that had me face-powling
3809980	3810980	for a bit.
3810980	3812980	Well, there's also Taiko no Tatujin.
3812980	3813980	Let's not forget that.
3813980	3814980	That's kind of a drum game.
3814980	3818180	I mean, it's not like a drum set, but certainly it's drums.
3818180	3820100	So there's plenty of drum games already out there.
3820100	3823420	It's just that Rockband gave it a different twist.
3823420	3828180	You can't tell me that Rockband was not like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix
3828180	3832100	thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having
3832100	3833100	with that.
3833100	3836460	But props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.
3836460	3839500	I said this before Rockband came out.
3839500	3844020	If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.
3844020	3847820	And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could
3847820	3850780	have had if they just would have put the effort into it.
3850780	3853820	But it's a risk they don't want to take.
3853820	3858780	I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix and Sugar, Konami's Marvel's Forest music
3858780	3863340	game is good, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.
3863340	3868560	It's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do
3868560	3872860	accomplishments or high scores.
3872860	3873980	That's kind of obscure, though.
3873980	3877380	I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.
3877380	3878940	That just seems like a logical thing to me.
3878940	3883060	I mean, there's lots of games that, I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download,
3883060	3886140	if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.
3886140	3890100	I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.
3890100	3895500	All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts
3895500	3896500	for us tonight?
3896500	3897500	No, I'm good.
3897500	3898500	All right.
3898500	3899500	Well, you have a great week.
3899500	3900500	We'll talk to you again.
3900500	3901500	You, too.
3901500	3902500	Bye-bye.
3902500	3905460	1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to give us a call.
3905460	3906940	Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.
3906940	3909660	I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.
3909660	3911140	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3911140	3912140	Who's this?
3912140	3914700	I give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.
3914700	3915780	Well, hello, Rama.
3915780	3916780	How are you?
3916780	3917780	I'm doing good.
3917780	3918780	How's everybody out there?
3918780	3919780	Hello.
3919780	3920780	Good.
3920780	3923580	It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic
3923580	3928380	of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that, you know, you can introduce yourself
3928380	3929380	to the listener.
3929380	3931500	But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length
3931500	3932500	of time.
3932500	3936460	Our buddy in New York City, what is on your mind this week, Rama?
3936460	3941140	Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter the later years, right?
3941140	3942140	Yes.
3942140	3943140	Mm-hmm.
3943140	3944780	Look up Minesweeper, the movie.
3944780	3945780	Okay.
3945780	3947220	I have to see this one.
3947220	3949420	That sounds kind of stupid.
3949420	3950420	You have to see it.
3950420	3952620	It's stupid in a funny way.
3952620	3957260	Well, briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.
3957260	3963220	It's like a parody of, like, an epic movie or something like that, counting, like playing,
3963220	3964660	it's like real-life Minesweeper.
3964660	3968220	It's like, Minesweeper meets, like, a standard army movie.
3968220	3970660	That's what it is.
3970660	3971660	Very cool.
3971660	3972660	Yeah.
3972660	3974100	I like those fake movie trailers.
3974100	3975100	They're funny.
3975100	3976100	Pretty much.
3976100	3982420	Rama, I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something, and maybe I should
3982420	3985660	just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.
3985660	3989340	I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lawns Radio very soon, aren't
3989340	3990340	you?
3990340	3991340	Yeah.
3991340	3992340	It's still in the works.
3992340	3995540	I'm waiting for my co-host, and looks like it's definitely going to happen.
3995540	4000060	We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.
4000060	4001780	Tell us a little bit about your new show.
4001780	4002780	Okay.
4002780	4004520	It's called Anime Jam Sessions.
4004520	4009220	The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime
4009220	4010220	podcast.
4010220	4013020	I was listening to a couple of them, and I didn't like it.
4013020	4017420	I've always felt that if you don't like it, do something about it.
4017420	4018420	Put up or shut up.
4018420	4020260	Thus, I started doing it.
4020260	4024300	I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out, and a lot of people liked it.
4024300	4029380	I have me and my friend Koto Usagi, who's going to be my news reporter girl, and I have
4029380	4030700	some interviews lined up.
4030700	4035660	Basically, we're going to be talking about what's going on in anime, anime movies, anime
4035660	4043100	games, cosplay, upcoming conventions, and just a touch of randomness here and there.
4043100	4044460	Very cool.
4044460	4047060	That will definitely be coming to the station soon.
4047060	4048060	We don't know what night yet.
4048060	4050600	We're still trying to figure that out based on other programs.
4050600	4054540	There's another program that I told a year ago we were going to get on our station, and
4054540	4058740	it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24-hour
4058740	4062380	seven station, but now in 2008, we're trying to go back to that.
4062380	4064980	We got to get all these other guys, and I got to see if they even still want to be on
4064980	4065980	the station.
4065980	4071100	All these other folks are putting together shows, and Dark Soccer, your show coming back
4071100	4072100	at some point?
4072100	4073100	Hopefully, maybe.
4073100	4076580	Well, we've got the computer we're working on, so...
4076580	4079300	What about, and I don't know how much I can say about this, but what about your new project?
4079300	4081300	I was very excited about that, the one you were going to co-host.
4081300	4085040	The new project is in the works.
4085040	4090220	With my computer being down, it's been hard.
4090220	4093700	To those of you that have missed myself, and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were
4093700	4098180	doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon.
4098180	4099180	I hope.
4099180	4100180	That's going to be awesome.
4100180	4101740	I'm looking forward to it, too.
4101740	4104940	So anyhow, so are we going to, and Loki has been talking about, he might even get back
4104940	4105980	into the swing of things.
4105980	4109220	It won't be a show that's on our station, though.
4109220	4111380	Oh, well, F you then.
4111380	4112580	I don't care.
4112580	4116060	It's not just an audio program.
4116060	4121020	And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com,
4121020	4124180	and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.
4124180	4127220	I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw
4127220	4133100	around with your time, send us some samples, because we are looking to aggressively expand
4133100	4137100	our programming in 2008 to really make ourselves a full-fledged station.
4137100	4141460	Because right now, we're kind of a station built around this show, and featuring Travis
4141460	4144020	on Saturday night, who also does a pretty kick-ass show, you know what I mean?
4144020	4145780	There's not a lot else right now.
4145780	4149700	Oh, Diamand has his show, so there's that, too, but there's not a lot.
4149700	4154020	We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.
4154020	4155780	Variety is the spice of life.
4155780	4156780	Exactly.
4156780	4161580	And we're not opposed to, you know, obviously, anime is not video games, but we realize,
4161580	4164660	you know, especially with this program, the fan bases cross over a little bit.
4164660	4168740	So we're not opposed to, you know, and Travis does a lot of sci-fi, also, you know, kind
4168740	4169740	of a cross-section.
4169740	4174880	So we're not opposed to things that aren't 100% game-related, but are kind of like in
4174880	4177860	that same nerdy realm, but just not like G4.
4177860	4181660	Okay, you're not going to see Fastlane repeats on Orange Launch Radio anytime soon, okay?
4181660	4182660	Mm-hmm.
4182660	4183660	Alright.
4183660	4185460	Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?
4185460	4186980	I did.
4186980	4188620	Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.
4188620	4189700	I thought it was awesome.
4189700	4194540	My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture
4194540	4196100	you sent and where you saw it.
4196100	4200780	Well, anywho, me and my friend, Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but
4200780	4205860	when we got there, the machine was off, and we were walking around on our way out, and
4205860	4211740	I see a picture of Mario, and I turn around, and they're at Dave and Buster's Mario Kart
4211740	4212740	GP2.
4212740	4213740	That's right.
4213740	4217100	I heard rumors that was coming, so it's kind of neat to see in arcades.
4217100	4219300	But the question is, is this one fun?
4219300	4220300	Because the other one kind of...
4220300	4221300	Yeah.
4221300	4222300	It wasn't...
4222300	4223820	The first one wasn't that great, I have to admit.
4223820	4225140	I will say this much.
4225140	4229440	If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because
4229440	4234100	I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Racer or anything like
4234100	4235100	that.
4235100	4236820	But I can play, and it's just totally fun.
4236820	4241020	Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick
4241020	4242700	up different weapons and stuff.
4242700	4248420	GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.
4248420	4251860	That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games,
4251860	4254880	if you come in first place, you get a free game.
4254880	4257940	You basically have to pay for each round when you play.
4257940	4259500	That sucks.
4259500	4260500	I would probably...
4260500	4263060	You know what I love at Dave and Buster's that I would probably play instead is that
4263060	4265300	fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.
4265300	4266300	I kick ass.
4266300	4268660	Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there, just playing it.
4268660	4270020	It's just uber fun.
4270020	4273420	And, yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.
4273420	4274420	Absolutely, jumping jackpot.
4274420	4275420	Painting fingers.
4275420	4277860	Alright, Rama, we gotta let you go.
4277860	4279060	Any quick final thoughts?
4279060	4282980	Yeah, about the LAN adapter for GameCube.
4282980	4288420	One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.
4288420	4294420	You had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.
4294420	4295740	You could use that with Double Dash?
4295740	4296740	I forgot.
4296740	4297740	Yes, you can.
4297740	4298740	Eight player play.
4298740	4299740	Yes, you can.
4299740	4300740	Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.
4300740	4303940	Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of man that was
4303940	4304940	ever used.
4304940	4305940	Probably.
4305940	4308820	If we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a
4308820	4314620	hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if they were a few floors
4314620	4315620	down below us.
4315620	4317660	Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.
4317660	4321380	I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.
4321380	4322740	Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.
4322740	4325740	Okay, Rama, we really gotta let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?
4325740	4326740	Bye-bye.
4326740	4329780	If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.
4329780	4331780	Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
4331780	4334140	Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.
4334140	4338900	I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was Gizmodo blog.
4338900	4339900	They were at CES.
4339900	4340900	Did you hear about this?
4340900	4345500	They got some TV-begone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.
4345500	4347820	We actually have a little bit of a clip here.
4347820	4354580	Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?
4354580	4356020	Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.
4356020	4357700	It doesn't work.
4357700	4358700	People are playing this game.
4358700	4364060	Just the TV guy shutting it all off.
4364060	4367700	And if you want to see the full videos, post to gizmodo.com.
4367700	4371580	And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish, and it was.
4371580	4372580	I mean, it's funny.
4372580	4375940	I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way, but
4375940	4379700	you kind of look in retrospect, and you go, what a dick, right?
4379700	4380700	What a dick.
4380700	4382740	And they actually post in the Gizmodo blog.
4382740	4386380	They say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some
4386380	4389460	people's jobs harder, and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.
4389460	4390780	We're sorry.
4390780	4396700	And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh
4396700	4402020	down on this guy who is going around shutting off the computers.
4402020	4405260	We have been informed of inappropriate behavior on the show floor by a credentialed media
4405260	4409040	attendee from the website Gizmodo, owned by Gawker Media, specifically the Gizmodo staffer
4409040	4412820	interfered with the exhibitor booth operations of numerous companies, including disrupting
4412820	4413820	at least one press event.
4413820	4418260	The Gizmodo staffer violated the terms of CES media credentials and caused harm to CES
4418260	4419260	exhibitors.
4419260	4422340	The Gizmodo staffer has been identified and will be barred from attending any future CES
4422340	4423340	events.
4423340	4426560	Additional sanctions against Gizmodo and Gawker Media are under discussion.
4426560	4428660	I say a well-deserved ban.
4428660	4433540	I realize it might have been funny in the moment, and in a dick-jerk kind of way it
4433540	4438860	is funny, but if you're going to be a dick-jerk, expect to get punished like a dick-jerk does.
4438860	4439860	Get jerked back?
4439860	4440860	Yep.
4440860	4446860	So, a well-deserved ban from CES, and the reason why also I say that is because it gives
4446860	4451560	a bad name to bloggers and independent media everywhere when these guys get invited and
4451560	4452560	do this.
4452560	4455920	This is why we get treated like crap at press events.
4455920	4461020	No, this is not why we get treated like crap at press events, but they treat us like crap
4461020	4466260	anyways and then they invite these guys, and I'm not going to say that certain other media
4466260	4470420	outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media
4470420	4477300	outlets came in drunk to certain press events, and that's all I have to say about that.
4477300	4478300	I remember that one.
4478300	4480300	It was interesting.
4480300	4481820	Maybe we should be naming names on this show.
4481820	4484620	Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names
4484620	4486580	of the journalists, but not tonight.
4486580	4488300	We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.
4488300	4493020	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange
4493020	4494020	Launch Radio.
4494020	4495580	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
4495580	4496580	Who's this?
4496580	4498780	This is Ross Deal UT.
4498780	4500080	Ross Deal UT.
4500080	4502300	What is on your mind, buddy?
4502300	4503300	A few things.
4503300	4505420	First off, yeah, I agree.
4505420	4511500	That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.
4511500	4513940	That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.
4513940	4515740	I know.
4515740	4520540	You laugh for 30 seconds and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at
4520540	4521540	this.
4521540	4522540	It really isn't funny in retrospect.
4522540	4523540	That's so funny.
4523540	4524540	Loki, you're just an asshole.
4524540	4535340	Yeah, I was about to say Loki is a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is that doing that
4535340	4541660	during the presentations, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody lost their job over that crap.
4541660	4542660	That's just wrong.
4542660	4547540	Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.
4547540	4555700	And I think that's why CES is saying we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to
4555700	4559780	do against Gawker and all that stuff is because I think they're waiting to see what the response
4559780	4560780	is going to be.
4560780	4564220	And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.
4564220	4566400	They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.
4566400	4569540	But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it.
4569540	4570540	So what?
4570540	4572860	And then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.
4572860	4579620	Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.
4579620	4583020	Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.
4583020	4585020	That could be a problem.
4585020	4588780	It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see.
4588780	4589780	We'll see.
4589780	4590780	Yeah, we'll see.
4590780	4594780	Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.
4594780	4599300	You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?
4599300	4600300	No.
4600300	4601300	That's cool.
4601300	4602300	No, it wasn't.
4602300	4603300	Yeah.
4603300	4611700	Apparently, the FBI went to this kid in Texas that fucked up the exact city, but apparently
4611700	4617500	the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, you know, the radiation
4617500	4618500	in their houses doubled.
4618500	4620500	This was a few years ago.
4620500	4621500	No, no.
4621500	4622500	This was recent.
4622500	4625260	Oh, it happened again?
4625260	4626820	Yeah.
4626820	4630740	It was posted on January 10th, actually.
4630740	4632940	I've read something about something similar a few years ago.
4632940	4634780	Tigerclaw just posted the link in our chat.
4634780	4637500	Apparently, it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.
4637500	4642060	I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else, but it wasn't
4642060	4643060	a game.
4643060	4645060	It was like this 11-year-old genius.
4645060	4646580	Yeah, 11-year-old kid.
4646580	4651860	I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought
4651860	4654940	it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.
4654940	4656420	Let me read this from Kotaku here.
4656420	4659580	The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.
4659580	4661740	He said he started studying physics around the eighth grade.
4661740	4666140	He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.
4666140	4668480	These things are in your tap water, you know, in the dirt.
4668480	4671500	You could hold a Geiger counter up to a banana and get a count off of it.
4671500	4675040	He's always been curious about how things work and likes to do his own experiments.
4675040	4678940	The man decided to create a small-scale nuclear reaction in the same room he plays his video
4678940	4680500	games as his latest experiment.
4680500	4681500	What a weirdo.
4681500	4684020	Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.
4684020	4686660	You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.
4686660	4687940	It's like 30 bucks.
4687940	4688940	Seriously.
4688940	4692340	Yeah, I thought they put him in my little hand.
4692340	4693880	Rockwall, Texas.
4693880	4697140	So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this
4697140	4699580	guy, you know, just in case.
4699580	4704020	And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.
4704020	4706700	You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.
4706700	4711060	Then that's when you blog about it.
4711060	4715340	I agree with SSJ 100 Matt saying in chat, leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill
4715340	4716340	Nye.
4716340	4719140	Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?
4719140	4721820	Zombie Mr. Wizard.
4721820	4722820	There it is.
4722820	4723820	There it is.
4723820	4730740	This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear
4730740	4731740	reactor in.
4731740	4732740	Wait for it.
4732740	4739220	If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.
4739220	4740700	Games made him do it.
4740700	4748500	The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee, and the radiation
4748500	4751020	level was actually fairly safe.
4751020	4752020	That's what I need.
4752020	4754180	A nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.
4754180	4762260	But it was a 15-year-old using graduate level physics textbooks and used vacuum pump manufacturer
4762260	4764660	manuals and scoured the web for two times.
4764660	4767300	Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.
4767300	4769020	They should be going to offer him a job.
4769020	4770820	They should be freaking sending him to college.
4770820	4773780	This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.
4773780	4778100	With all this attention, he's going to be working in a university, so no time at all.
4778100	4780620	We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.
4780620	4781620	All right.
4781620	4782620	Well, here it is.
4782620	4785780	Any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty, on YouTube?
4785780	4791940	Well, one other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three
4791940	4792940	companies.
4792940	4793940	I'm going to be honest with you.
4793940	4796980	I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.
4796980	4804060	The thing is with the 1UP Network is that, really, they're a little more than a tabloid.
4804060	4809580	It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being
4809580	4810980	sensational.
4810980	4812300	I knew that word was going to come into play.
4812300	4817100	I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking sensationalist, which I kind
4817100	4818100	of agree.
4818100	4824040	Listen, I mean, you remember after Gerstmann got fired, the whole thing with the protest
4824040	4827140	in front of the CNET building?
4827140	4829420	You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalist.
4829420	4831620	It's not like they come to press events drunk.
4831620	4833620	Oh, wait, no, no.
4833620	4834620	They do.
4834620	4835620	I'm safe.
4835620	4836620	Yes, they do.
4836620	4838620	They do their podcast drunk.
4838620	4840620	What are you talking about?
4840620	4844100	To be fair, we have two, but you know.
4844100	4845840	Yeah, but also, we don't get paid.
4845840	4847300	Nobody pays us to do this program.
4847300	4848780	We pay to do this program.
4848780	4850020	That's how sick we are.
4850020	4851020	You know what I mean?
4851020	4854220	But I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.
4854220	4860460	These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit
4860460	4863460	in the entire gaming big review industry.
4863460	4866260	And you see it in their reviews.
4866260	4868140	They go out of their way to be negative.
4868140	4872700	You look at, particularly in the EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that
4872700	4875260	quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.
4875260	4878820	They wanted, I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they
4878820	4883900	could say, hey, look how negative we can be, we're not like GameSpot.
4883900	4884900	Interesting perspective.
4884900	4888820	You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because again, I don't really read a lot of
4888820	4889820	these sites.
4889820	4890820	I really don't.
4890820	4893980	Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but like secretly I'm like
4893980	4895700	watching every move they make.
4895700	4896700	But I just don't.
4896700	4900540	I don't, I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.
4900540	4906000	You know, I actually, this is a little off topic, but IGN did, lately their thing is
4906000	4909620	they've been reviewing some of the Destiny games, the data design stuff, you know, the
4909620	4912340	absolute shit on, you know, the Wii.
4912340	4918980	And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man, and
4918980	4922360	of course it got a really low score, and then they did a video review for it.
4922360	4928020	But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally
4928020	4929020	a minute long.
4929020	4930540	He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?
4930540	4932640	It has platforms and jumping.
4932640	4933920	That's about it.
4933920	4936340	And that was the end of the video review.
4936340	4940740	It's like, seriously, don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're gonna do.
4940740	4941740	Take it seriously.
4941740	4945940	Even though the game is crap, you gotta point out, you can do it funny, but point out why
4945940	4949380	it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did win it for
4949380	4950380	you.
4950380	4951380	I mean, that's stupid.
4951380	4957860	Yeah, now that you're talking about that, you know, not enough people are doing good,
4957860	4958860	funny reviews.
4958860	4963060	I mean, you remember the old Alex Avar review for Big Rigs?
4963060	4965260	I mean, that was hilarious.
4965260	4968620	What about the kid from Zero Punctuation, is it?
4968620	4970620	Oh, I love that kid.
4970620	4971620	He's awesome.
4971620	4973740	That's what we need to see more of.
4973740	4979180	I mean, if people would do more witty reviews, you wouldn't see this obsession over the score.
4979180	4980900	People would actually stick around for the content.
4980900	4982700	But has that guy ever done a positive review?
4982700	4986820	I mean, isn't that kind of the joke, that all his reviews like tear apart the games?
4986820	4987820	He likes Pagle.
4987820	4988820	He likes Pagle.
4988820	4989820	He likes Psychonauts.
4989820	4994540	He generally likes Assassin's Creed.
4994540	4998780	The thing is with him is that he'll point out, he looks at the games, he just looks
4998780	5000180	at the games to look at the games.
5000180	5005940	He's not, you know, the fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.
5005940	5008820	I think as long as there's a balance to it.
5008820	5009820	He tells it like it is.
5009820	5012260	Like, I don't like the people who do nothing but negative reviews.
5012260	5016500	I mean, it's kind of like, okay, you know, haha, joke's over, you know, move on.
5016500	5017500	Exactly.
5017500	5018500	Show us both sides.
5018500	5019500	Be balanced.
5019500	5022740	Well, I gotta wrap up, because we want to try and take one more call before we close
5022740	5023740	the show tonight.
5023740	5027300	We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?
5027300	5028860	Embrace false idols.
5028860	5029860	Goodbye.
5029860	5030860	Alright.
5030860	5031860	Bye-bye.
5031860	5036340	So, I guess RasteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.
5036340	5037340	I don't know what to say.
5037340	5038340	Alright.
5038340	5040780	We'll take one more call if we have any time, or I'm sorry, if we have any more people who
5040780	5041780	want to call in.
5041780	5044500	Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5044500	5048100	Meanwhile, any last minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?
5048100	5051860	I don't really have a last minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an
5051860	5053580	exploding baby in it.
5053580	5061140	So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.
5061140	5063820	I'm so happy for you.
5063820	5069180	Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.
5069180	5071220	I look forward to his reviews every week.
5071220	5075840	We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.
5075840	5078340	Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.
5078340	5081420	Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?
5081420	5083340	Um, no.
5083340	5084340	Alright.
5084340	5085700	One more call.
5085700	5086700	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5086700	5087700	Who's this?
5087700	5088700	This is BT.
5088700	5089700	Hey, Dartetsuya.
5089700	5090700	What's on your mind, buddy?
5090700	5091700	Oh, nothing.
5091700	5092700	Not on call.
5092700	5093700	Just chilling?
5093700	5094700	Listening to OLR?
5094700	5095700	Yeah.
5095700	5096700	Just chilling?
5096700	5097700	Oh, yeah.
5097700	5102700	What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?
5102700	5104700	Pretty interesting.
5104700	5107020	That's right.
5107020	5108020	Interesting stuff.
5108020	5111540	Pretty good stuff, yeah.
5111540	5113980	What are games you've been playing this week?
5113980	5119660	Well, actually there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.
5119660	5121700	I don't know if you've ever heard of it.
5121700	5122700	I have not.
5122700	5124180	Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?
5124180	5128460	Well, basically it's like an adventure game.
5128460	5136260	I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games that when you go around and
5136260	5140780	you collect items and kill enemies, sort of like a Castlevania.
5140780	5142980	A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.
5142980	5143980	Oh, that's kind of cool.
5143980	5144980	MSX.
5144980	5147780	I haven't heard that system name in a long time.
5147780	5148780	Yeah.
5148780	5153940	I'm looking at a post you made in our forums on the freeware game thread, and it looks
5153940	5154940	like you're...
5154940	5155940	Yeah, I updated it.
5155940	5159220	You call out a La Mulana, and you say it's an old-school-style adventure game designed
5159220	5161600	to look like an old MSX game.
5161600	5163060	There's all sorts of craziness going on in it.
5163060	5166900	A hidden mini-game that's a nod to both Snatcher and Tokimeki Memorial.
5166900	5169220	That's pretty funny.
5169220	5172740	Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.
5172740	5177420	That's funny.
5177420	5179140	But the game is hard?
5179140	5182340	Oh, yeah.
5182340	5185140	They don't give you any health or anything, I don't think.
5185140	5186140	So there's no cheat mode.
5186140	5187140	No help mode.
5187140	5191380	No, I mean, there was a trick I learned at one of the...
5191380	5193340	There was this video walk-through.
5193340	5198860	There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.
5198860	5199860	So that might help.
5199860	5200860	Wow.
5200860	5201860	This is a lot...
5201860	5203660	I'm looking at the site where this is posted.
5203660	5207300	It looks like somebody says it took 26 hours for him to get through the game.
5207300	5208300	That's crazy.
5208300	5209300	Oh, wow.
5209300	5210300	Yeah.
5210300	5212460	Well, that is a labor of love right there.
5212460	5215820	It even kind of has a... it looks like an old-ass...
5215820	5219540	Oh, yeah, that totally looks like an old MSX game or an NES game.
5219540	5220540	Yeah.
5220540	5221540	Wow, that's cool.
5221540	5222540	So check that out.
5222540	5223540	It's called La Mulana.
5223540	5226580	All right, well, Darktitsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners
5226580	5227580	today?
5227580	5228580	No, not really.
5228580	5230940	I think that's about it.
5230940	5231940	All right.
5231940	5232940	So go play La Mulana.
5232940	5233940	Go play some more.
5233940	5234940	Yeah.
5234940	5235940	All right.
5235940	5236940	Take care, buddy.
5236940	5237940	You too.
5237940	5238940	All right, bye-bye.
5238940	5241780	All right, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and
5241780	5242780	end the show.
5242780	5247100	And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent
5247100	5252100	Hill Origin, which apparently he says that the whole series jumped the shark, and between
5252100	5255420	Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and
5255420	5257300	all this stuff, right?
5257300	5259580	Origins coming out in Plague Station 2 soon.
5259580	5262500	I'm actually going to pick that up, because I didn't bother to get it on the PSP, because
5262500	5265420	I just can't see a scary game on the PSP, but I'll play it on PS2.
5265420	5269820	They also have Twisted Metal head-on coming out on PS2 for 20 bucks.
5269820	5272540	By the way, do you know what I found on the internets?
5272540	5278060	I actually found the soundtrack to Silent Hill Origins, and it's got some kick-ass music
5278060	5279060	in it.
5279060	5280060	Let me see.
5280060	5281660	Totally need to give that to me.
5281660	5283060	I will totally give that to you.
5283060	5284060	Let me see.
5284060	5288620	I'm going to play a little teaser for those of you guys listening, because there's some
5288620	5289620	really kick-ass songs.
5289620	5292780	I mean, it's more Kiryamoka doing some great stuff.
5292780	5293780	Let's see.
5293780	5294780	What was...
5294780	5295780	Oh, this song I think I liked.
5295780	5299020	Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you the name of it, because the songs aren't labeled, but
5299020	5300020	here's one.
5300020	5319420	Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.
5319420	5323700	There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week, so I'm sure there's
5323700	5326180	a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.
5326180	5328780	Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.
5328780	5330780	Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?
5330780	5331780	Nope.
5331780	5332780	Dark Soccer.
5332780	5333780	You got anything?
5333780	5334780	Nope.
5334780	5335780	All good.
5335780	5336780	All right.
5336780	5337780	Well, then we're good.
5337780	5338780	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5338780	5339780	Dark Soccer, we'll start with you tonight.
5339780	5342300	I like these cookies.
5342300	5345140	My final thought is penguins are cute.
5345140	5346700	Loki.
5346700	5348780	This game filler is pretty fun.
5348780	5350660	All right.
5350660	5354140	Thank you guys, everybody, for tuning into our program and downloading us this week.
5354140	5357940	Remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word.
5357940	5361820	Tell two people you know about our show or leave us a positive review on iTunes.
5361820	5366540	We haven't had a positive review post on iTunes in a long time, so please send us one of those
5366540	5370980	or just tell people you know because we have to rely on word of mouth to get the word out
5370980	5374860	about our show because we're not backed by any big corporate website or any of that stuff,
5374860	5380040	so it's really the fans that make this all possible, and to that we say thank you.
5380040	5383580	Because we're so happy that you guys love us, we'll do this all again next week.
5383580	5384940	Sound like a plan?
5384940	5385940	Okay.
5385940	5388220	So next week, by the way, is a three-day weekend.
5388220	5389220	I know.
5389220	5392180	So you never know what kind of chaos might break out on a three-day weekend.
5392180	5394380	If I've got someone to come pick me up, oh hell yeah.
5394380	5395380	Oh hell yeah.
5395380	5400340	It's on next weekend and just in time for the return of the webcam, hopefully, too.
5400340	5403260	So all right.
5403260	5404380	Tune in next week.
5404380	5406020	Same bat time, same bat channel.
