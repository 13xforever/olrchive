00:15.000 --> 00:19.480
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.480 --> 00:25.800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 6th of 2008.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.480
Feels a little weird to be saying that, 2008.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.480
Hopefully I can remember to start actually writing that on my check soon.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.120
As we are taping the show tonight, you know, we tape live,

00:35.120 --> 00:38.880
the Consumer Electronics Show is going on, or I should say is kicking off

00:38.880 --> 00:43.600
with their keynote speeches and Microsoft is delivering theirs right now while we're taping the show.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.000
Loki's been watching, keeping an eye on it during the break and while we were taping part A.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.600
Anything come up yet? I know they're not finished, but has anything come up so far?

00:51.600 --> 00:54.480
Yeah, they just kind of, they briefly went over everything.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.360
They were talking a little bit about some mobile platforms and stuff like that.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.240
In fact, actually that's what they're talking about a new telephone service right now.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.720
And apparently I guess their sync service, you know, the one that he keeps in the commercials for,

01:05.720 --> 01:08.680
is basically going to be ripping off OnStar.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.680
Including, you know, if you get in an accident, sync will call, you know, 911, you know,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.800
and then play them a song or something.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.840
No, they'll tell them that you've been in an accident and get, you know, help and stuff.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.120
But anyways, gaming related stuff, they've announced a whole lot of stuff.

01:26.120 --> 01:33.720
Really the couple things they announced, of course, they've sold 17.7 million units worldwide so far to date.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.960
Did 3.5 billion dollars in business through November.

01:39.960 --> 01:44.520
And right now, of course, passed a 10 million member mark on live.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.280
They did announce that their Xbox Live video marketplace is going to have some new additions,

01:50.280 --> 01:55.720
including ABC and Disney are going to be bringing their TV shows to live.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.360
So they're going to get, you know, Lost and Desperate Housewives.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.120
Lost, Desperate Housewives, that kind of stuff.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.040
Gotcha.

02:02.040 --> 02:08.680
Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding MGM movies as well, they're going to be coming.

02:08.680 --> 02:14.160
In the UK, they're going to be offering their medium room service, which is like a, you know,

02:14.160 --> 02:16.680
their IPTV and that kind of thing.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.320
Apparently, though, there's going to be a company, British Telecommunication, I think, BT,

02:22.320 --> 02:27.120
they're going to be partnering with them to use the 360 as a set-top box.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.000
So basically, you'll be able to watch TV, I guess, through that.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.800
So that's kind of neat.

02:30.800 --> 02:36.480
But they have no, you know, Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.680
Yeah, though, it's still going on.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.720
It's still going on.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.160
Right now, they're doing some phone service and they're showing that you can watch.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.200
What was the thing you were talking about?

02:43.200 --> 02:49.360
Right when we were doing the, not commercial, but the music break between Part A and B here live,

02:49.360 --> 02:52.960
you were mentioning something about a Zune MySpace type thing?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.560
Yeah, they have the Zune Social.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.320
It's going to be, you know, basically a part of their website.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.840
You can create your own page.

02:59.840 --> 03:06.640
You can make, you know, it'll have your Zune pic and your Zune tag and that kind of stuff.

03:06.640 --> 03:12.800
And it'll basically show all your stats, kind of what you're listening to, your top three songs,

03:13.440 --> 03:17.280
you know, songs that you've flagged as your favorites, that kind of thing.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.360
And customers will be able to go through there.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.280
So it's last FM for your Zune?

03:21.280 --> 03:21.840
Sort of, yeah.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.560
And you can listen to songs that other people are listening to.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.640
You can buy those songs and you can visit their friends and,

03:28.640 --> 03:30.640
you know, listen to songs and that kind of thing.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.200
Interesting.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.840
Seems like everybody's trying to get in on that MySpace, though.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.400
Kind of, it's going to, we're going to get social networked out before too long.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.520
I mean, how many of those freaking social network profiles can you have?

03:43.520 --> 03:48.640
Yeah, and right now they're talking about, you know, connected entertainment, I guess,

03:48.640 --> 03:53.520
is their theme right now, talking about being able to, you know, hook everything up between,

03:53.520 --> 04:00.960
you know, the TV, your Windows PC, your mobile PC, your Zune, et cetera.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.440
Interesting.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.640
Now, Sakura Max is in our chat right now at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

04:06.640 --> 04:09.120
and really doesn't give a shit about anything you're saying, Loki.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.800
What Sakura Max wants to know is how many copies of Eye of Judgment have moved?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.200
That's what we really want the update on.

04:15.200 --> 04:15.600
I don't know.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.880
We haven't gotten the new MPD numbers yet.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.640
But we're not close to a million yet, are we?

04:20.640 --> 04:23.200
Fuck, we haven't even broken a hundred thousand yet.

04:24.480 --> 04:24.960
All right.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.800
Let's go ahead and go back to the gaming news then and Loki will keep one eye on the

04:31.360 --> 04:33.600
Consumer Electronics Show speech and let us know.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.240
Just break in.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.840
If anything really big is announced, just break in, okay?

04:35.840 --> 04:36.400
Definitely.

04:36.400 --> 04:36.720
All right.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.880
Anyways, let's start things off, and this is a little bit surprising.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.960
Apparently, Nintendo is no longer shipping the Wavebird to stores right now.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.680
They have kind of phased out that system.

04:48.240 --> 04:53.920
No word though of, you know, I guess I really wish that they would just allow the classic

04:53.920 --> 04:55.440
controller to play GameCube games.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.600
I think that would make things a lot easier because it's a pain in the ass to have a GameCube

04:59.600 --> 05:01.760
controller play GameCube games and stuff.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.560
I don't know.

05:02.560 --> 05:08.480
But right now, apparently, there's no other way, you know, to play your classic games

05:08.480 --> 05:10.960
on the Virtual Console if you don't have a GameCube controller.

05:10.960 --> 05:16.720
I guess you could buy a wired controller or one of those third-party controllers that's

05:16.720 --> 05:18.160
like a Wavebird like I have.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.160
The Wavebird is an amazing piece of hardware too.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.200
I mean, everybody knows that.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.920
It's like a really great game controller and, you know, it was obviously, you know, it was

05:27.920 --> 05:32.800
wireless kind of before you had the Xbox 360 wireless and PS3, you know, 6-axis or whatever.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.800
Just a great peripheral.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.040
It's kind of weird that it's going away now before Smash Brothers Melee is out.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.320
So if you were hoping to control Smash Brothers Melee with a Wavebird, you'd better get your

05:42.320 --> 05:43.840
hands on it if you don't already have one.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.800
Yeah, I've got mine.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.720
I don't have one, sadly.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.800
One of the things I was talking about, real quick, just to break in with the CES stuff.

05:50.800 --> 05:58.960
They were talking about how, I guess, that there's this new phone service that they're

05:58.960 --> 06:00.400
doing that I think is called Tell Me.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.480
It will actually allow you to use your phone.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.040
Like, say for example, it has GPS and stuff.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.640
You walk up to a theater, it will show you on the phone what's playing there and that

06:10.640 --> 06:11.760
kind of stuff and all the information.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.480
You can buy tickets.

06:13.040 --> 06:18.720
One of the other things that they're showing is you can actually use your phone's camera

06:18.720 --> 06:22.080
to point in that building and get directions to how to get to the building.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.920
What the building is and that kind of stuff.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.520
It will know, I guess.

06:28.640 --> 06:29.040
Freaky.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.160
Kind of freaky.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.480
Pretty soon it's going to be the Jetsons flying cars, video phones, all that stuff.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.560
We already have video phones.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.720
I guess we kind of do with the internet.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.920
We have teleconferencing.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.520
Hey, you know, actually, I'll say this.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.960
I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but I've got to say this is pretty awesome.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.840
Maybe I mentioned this last week.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.360
No, I couldn't have because the New Year's thing happened after last week.

06:51.360 --> 06:56.320
But I had a little New Year's get-together here at the place and Shane is obviously a

06:56.320 --> 06:56.960
good friend of mine.

06:56.960 --> 07:02.000
Meek Latavi has been on the show before, he doesn't live here anymore because Konami

07:02.000 --> 07:04.560
folded in the Bay Area, so he went back to Kansas.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.840
So he's back there and he couldn't come to the party.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.720
But we got on the Xbox 360 cam and I hooked up the cam and so we could all wave at him

07:12.720 --> 07:13.440
through the camera.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.520
I was talking on the phone with him at the same time because he doesn't have a headset

07:17.520 --> 07:18.080
or whatever.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.680
So it was kind of like a way for him to see everybody without actually being here.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.800
I just thought that was really neat.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.520
That's kind of a video phone in that regard.

07:25.520 --> 07:32.320
And that's sort of what I was thinking because even now a lot of cameras like that one, Scott,

07:32.320 --> 07:34.720
doesn't that one have a microphone on it?

07:34.720 --> 07:35.760
Well, iSight, oh yeah.

07:36.400 --> 07:42.080
So really all you need is a camera with a microphone and speaker and there you go.

07:43.360 --> 07:49.680
So that was the equivalent you had with the Xbox camera and being on the phone.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.960
It's not too far off to being an everyday thing available in the home, I think.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.880
Yeah, it's kind of surprising we're not already there because I remember that was a big thing

07:58.880 --> 08:01.920
they always talked about like in the 80s and 90s was the video phone.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.560
Kind of interesting.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.240
It's more, I think, something that they've put more in a business-oriented type market

08:08.240 --> 08:12.240
though because I've worked at places that had video teleconferencing.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.400
And sometimes I answer the phone right after I get out of the shower.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.640
People don't need to see that, you know what I mean?

08:18.640 --> 08:22.800
So I have the option of, you know, this is an unlisted wall.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.320
Never call this wall again!

08:26.320 --> 08:27.200
Or a space ball bathroom.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.120
I'll have to have the phone removed from my bathroom.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.960
Oh, space balls.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.120
Oh, oh that's, oh my god.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.280
That's been a long time since I've seen that movie.

08:35.280 --> 08:40.320
All right, anyhow, Dark Tetsuya was asking if we were playing Strip Uno.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.760
No, perv.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.200
But you do bring up a good point because I have joked on this program that Strip Uno

08:47.200 --> 08:50.160
is really the only reason to have an Xbox 360 cam right now.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.360
Well, I found another decent use for it, so there you go.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.520
There was a New York Times story that came out earlier this week that said that pretty

08:59.520 --> 09:04.400
soon on the Nintendo Wii, you are going to be able to download DS games to your Wii.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.160
And we all thought this sounded like a pretty nice idea and something that, you know, seems

09:08.160 --> 09:09.120
kind of logical.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.200
I mean, after all, you can download original Xbox games on your Xbox and you can download

09:13.200 --> 09:15.360
all these other console, you know, games on your Wii.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.440
Why not be able to download DS games as well?

09:17.440 --> 09:24.160
Well, the smacketh was laid downeth and you cannot actually download full DS games coming

09:24.160 --> 09:24.560
to the Wii.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.160
That is not in the future.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.600
What is in the future, however, is what Japan already has, the DS demos being downloaded

09:31.600 --> 09:34.960
from your Wii to the Nintendo DS, which I think we all saw coming.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.480
That functionality is almost already there to an extent.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.560
You can't download them yet, but if you own a copy of Geometry Wars Galaxies, you can

09:42.560 --> 09:46.640
actually beam a copy of Geometry Wars DS version to your DS.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.040
So that functionality is already there in some games.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.680
But no full DS games at this time, which, you know, is fine because that would mean

09:55.680 --> 10:00.160
there would have to be a whole other memory unit, which means they would probably unleash

10:00.160 --> 10:04.320
a, you know, I'll bet you anything if they do remodel the DS, a new DS remodel is going

10:04.320 --> 10:06.640
to come out with some type of onboard memory so they can do that.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.160
But we'll see.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.440
It wouldn't surprise me.

10:09.440 --> 10:09.680
Yeah.

10:09.680 --> 10:17.520
Well, someone decided to be original, as I say this in humongous quote fingers, and bring

10:17.520 --> 10:26.240
out a peripheral for the cell phone to play different games on that is called a Z-Mote

10:27.440 --> 10:29.600
put out by the company called Z2.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.720
It's a Bluetooth.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.560
It looks just like the Wiimote, only smaller, fits in, you know, directly in your palm,

10:36.560 --> 10:43.680
has an analog stick and buttons on the bottom, and it has a functional motion sensing.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.840
But yeah, it's not based off the Wiimote at all.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.640
On the Nintendo Wiimote, isn't the button on the Wiimote referred to as the Z button?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.120
Isn't that the Z button in games?

10:57.120 --> 11:00.080
On the Nunchuck, it's the Z button.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.040
That's what I thought.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.520
When you do a little ground pound in Smash, or in Mario Galaxy, that's the Z button you're

11:05.520 --> 11:06.000
hitting, right?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.880
Mm-hmm.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.880
Yeah, this isn't going to be a lawsuit at all or anything.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.280
No.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.120
Oh, but it's black.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.000
Oh, then that makes all the difference.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.120
And it looks like it's matte.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.400
It's not shiny.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.680
Oh, well, shit.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.760
That just means the parts are cheaper.

11:23.520 --> 11:23.840
Yeah.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.680
But I mean, seriously, what games are you going to play on your cell phone with this?

11:28.240 --> 11:28.720
Come on.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.320
Really, kids.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.840
Maybe if you're trying to play Pac-Man, because I can tell you from experience that Super

11:33.840 --> 11:36.880
Pac-Man on a cell phone is damn near impossible.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.840
Yeah, really.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.800
One thing that is damn near impossible is to get a damn game that's not censored in

11:42.800 --> 11:43.280
some way.

11:43.840 --> 11:49.120
And unfortunately, Metal Slug 3 has been censored in the US on Xbox Live Arcade.

11:49.920 --> 11:58.480
Instead of spewing streams of blood in the zombie stage, you spew streaming something,

11:58.480 --> 11:59.440
some white substance.

11:59.440 --> 11:59.760
Sweat!

12:01.280 --> 12:02.080
White substance.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.440
That's even worse, I think.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.280
But yes, you shoot streams of semen.

12:09.280 --> 12:14.080
Anyways, that's even grosser than blood.

12:14.080 --> 12:21.120
But if you want to fix it so that there's blood again, all you have to do is just basically

12:21.120 --> 12:25.280
trick the game into thinking that you're Japanese by changing your region to Japan.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.320
Leave it to the chat room to call it Bukake Slug 3.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.200
You know what, though?

12:29.200 --> 12:38.320
That's not anything new from SNK, because I've got Samurai Shodown 2 on Neo Geo, and

12:38.320 --> 12:43.040
if you change your region on it, it will change the blood in the game from red to white.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.280
So that's old hat for them.

12:45.280 --> 12:45.840
Interesting.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.440
By the way, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but I did play the Metal Slug

12:51.440 --> 12:55.440
3 on Xbox Live Arcade, and I've got to say, you know, Loki and I especially give Metal

12:55.440 --> 12:59.040
Slug a lot of shit on this program for kind of being the same game over and over.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.920
I did have a shitload of fun with Metal Slug 3.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.840
I almost called it Metal Gear 3.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.280
Metal Slug 3 is actually a shitload of fun, and I bet it will be a lot of fun to play

13:07.280 --> 13:08.000
in co-op mode.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.680
The zombie stage is like my freaking favorite in the whole game.

13:11.680 --> 13:17.760
But nevertheless, the news about a desensitized version of Metal Slug and the fact that things

13:17.760 --> 13:22.560
have to be toned down for us here in America because we can't handle the blood, that just

13:22.560 --> 13:24.080
incites rage within us.

13:24.080 --> 13:28.000
I don't know about you guys, but it motivates us to do a little segment here we call the

13:28.000 --> 13:29.200
FUs of the Week.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.200
I just, I turn into a big emo mess whenever I'm really, really sick because I'm just so

14:05.200 --> 14:11.040
tired all the time, so I was really just crabby and upset, and I hated it.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.360
And I'm feeling better today, but, you know, I have to go back to work tomorrow, and on

14:15.360 --> 14:16.720
top of that, I have to go in early.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.040
But it's a good reason why I'm going in early, because I'm going to my school tomorrow to

14:21.040 --> 14:22.320
see how close I am to graduating.

14:22.320 --> 14:30.560
I might actually qualify for yet my, what, my ninth change of major since starting my

14:30.560 --> 14:31.920
college career ten years ago.

14:34.080 --> 14:41.360
So, and also an FU goes to my right-hand middle finger, because I've started developing the

14:41.360 --> 14:45.120
symptoms of trigger finger in that one as well, so I think that I might have actually

14:45.120 --> 14:50.720
injured something instead of it being some sort of naturally causing thing, because normally

14:50.720 --> 14:55.520
trigger finger sets in if you're older or do a lot of heavy pulling with your hands,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.040
and I don't do either.

14:57.040 --> 15:02.720
I push, and I type, and that's about it, and that's not what causes sugar finger, so I

15:02.720 --> 15:05.040
get to go back and get another shot in my hand, which is going to be fun.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.360
And that's the end.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.960
Loki, do you have anything you want to FU?

15:12.160 --> 15:17.040
I'm not really mad at much of anything other than the really crappy drivers for the Nvidia

15:17.040 --> 15:21.680
cards. Currently the latest graphics drivers that they have now, for whatever reason when

15:21.680 --> 15:26.560
my system boots up, it keeps flashing black every now and then, and I basically have to

15:26.560 --> 15:31.600
switch my resolution down to something lower than switch back up to normal and it stops,

15:31.600 --> 15:35.600
so I don't know why it's doing that because the older drivers didn't do it.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.680
But anyways, so that sucks.

15:37.680 --> 15:43.040
The other thing that kind of really sucks, well, there wasn't really much more announcements,

15:43.040 --> 15:48.400
I guess, at CES, at least the Microsoft thing, that's it.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.920
No Xbox 360 ultimate or anything like that, they're done.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.280
They just basically had Slash come on stage and they played some Guitar Hero 3.

15:56.160 --> 15:56.960
Lame!

15:58.960 --> 16:01.760
Isn't that the way, like, an episode of Scooby Doo would end?

16:01.760 --> 16:02.400
Something like that.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.480
The Slash just comes out and everybody rocks out.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.160
Like a big party.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.760
It was pretty retarded.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.840
Right. My FU of the week goes to whoever stole our garbage can.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.560
There's no fucking garbage can now, thanks to the storm.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.440
I don't know if God stole it, Mother Nature, or one of the neighbors.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.480
I don't know. We are missing a fucking garbage can.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.640
And it's freaky because, like, where are we going to put the trash?

16:25.360 --> 16:26.320
Call them up.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.360
That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.160
It's scary. It's a scary notion.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.680
Or still give an FU to that.

16:31.680 --> 16:36.400
By the way, Robert M. would like to point out the irony in our chat room.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.880
The Dark Sakura gave the finger to her finger.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.320
It is that finger.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.360
It is the middle finger.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.200
It's not pleasant. It doesn't hurt or anything.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.640
It just feels like I can't straighten out my finger once I bend it.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.760
It's like, how am I going to flip people off if my favorite finger is broken?

16:54.960 --> 16:57.920
Tigerclaw says, Skye, perhaps it was stolen by a bum?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.520
You know, that's the scary thing.

16:59.520 --> 17:04.000
Like, maybe it was stolen by a bum, but seriously, why does a bum need a fucking trash can?

17:04.000 --> 17:09.840
And seriously, why would he hike this far into this, like, development here to steal a trash can?

17:09.840 --> 17:12.240
And why not steal the recycle bin? It's bigger.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.600
My guess is it blew away.

17:13.600 --> 17:18.240
It blew away in the storm, and someone said, hey, free trash can!

17:18.240 --> 17:21.920
Well, what day was it the day when you had all the trash cans out the curb?

17:21.920 --> 17:22.560
I mean, was that-

17:22.560 --> 17:24.240
No, it wasn't the same day. We brought them back up.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.640
Oh. Well, that's weird.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.400
It's, yeah, it is very weird.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.120
No, we have no idea. It's just the weirdest thing ever.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.240
That's why you store your trash cans behind the fence.

17:34.240 --> 17:38.240
Well, yeah, we'll be doing that from now on, but still, kind of weird, nonetheless.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.360
Yeah, and I don't understand.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.160
If a bum took it because they wanted to, I don't know, live in it or whatever-

17:44.160 --> 17:46.960
Why would you live in a trash can? I mean, seriously-

17:46.960 --> 17:51.200
Did Oscar the Grouch steal my can? Did Oscar the Grouch need a new home?

17:51.200 --> 17:54.160
Why did he not take the- there's three cans.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.360
There's a recycle, there's a lawn, and a garbage.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.800
The garbage one is the smallest-

17:58.800 --> 18:02.640
Because he lives in a garbage can!

18:02.640 --> 18:04.080
Well, fuck you, Oscar the Grouch!

18:07.360 --> 18:13.280
Anyhow, maybe one of the neighbors just hit it and was waiting for us to get back or something,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.520
because I've been out of town, so has my roommate.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.760
Anyhow, who cares about that anymore?

18:17.760 --> 18:23.440
Let's talk about some PC gaming news, some things announced for PC games this week,

18:23.440 --> 18:29.440
including Gas-Powered Games' next project. It's a game called Demigod,

18:29.440 --> 18:33.200
and this game sounds kind of cool because it's going to mix role-playing,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.560
real-time strategy, and action genres.

18:37.280 --> 18:42.800
It's actually announced a game for Windows Magazine, so this is something for PC gamers.

18:43.520 --> 18:48.880
It's being created by Chris Taylor, or I guess he's spearheading it or what have you,

18:48.880 --> 18:55.440
and apparently it's supposed to be inspired in part by Warcraft 3's modification,

18:55.440 --> 18:56.880
Defense of the Ancients.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.600
It looked, from the screenshots,

18:59.600 --> 19:03.280
it looked almost like an RTS version of Shadow of the Colossus.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.480
Interesting.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.760
Well, they have these Titan things that look like, you know-

19:09.760 --> 19:14.880
I always like hearing about these games that combine these very interesting types of genres,

19:14.880 --> 19:17.680
like RPGs and action, that's going to be kind of interesting.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.480
Well, almost every game is an action game.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.080
It kind of makes me think of Kingdom Hearts, it's like RPG mixed with action, right?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.160
So I'm just kind of interested to see what this is.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.680
Yeah, just think more of an RTS game, that's what it basically looks like.

19:29.680 --> 19:35.200
RTS game, I guess, where your troops or whatever will gain experience and that kind of thing,

19:35.200 --> 19:38.400
and then they fight each other, so that's the action part, I don't know.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.720
Well, no release date announced yet, all we know is that Demigod is coming soon.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.920
Of course, the almighty soon, right?

19:45.920 --> 19:56.080
Well, Rockstar is going to be putting out a little bit more digitally now by working

19:56.080 --> 20:01.680
with Steam's PC download service, so they're going to be putting Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne,

20:01.680 --> 20:08.560
and Midnight Club, those different series, up on that service, so that'd be pretty cool.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.280
That is pretty cool.

20:11.280 --> 20:16.080
That is pretty cool, and I think, if I remember correctly, the first

20:16.080 --> 20:18.800
few games that are going to be on there are going to be pretty cheap.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.480
Like, I think they were like ten bucks.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.840
What is it, like the original Grand Theft Auto, or is it some good stuff?

20:23.840 --> 20:27.040
No, the Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.400
I'll take it.

20:28.960 --> 20:33.680
The first Grand Theft Auto game, and the second, I believe, are available free on their website.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.880
Oh, that's right, they did that some time ago, I forgot about that.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.720
So, you know, if you want to play those, because I remember the original Grand Theft Auto,

20:40.720 --> 20:41.680
that game was fun.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.200
Nothing like what it is today.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.400
No, not at all.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.440
Very, very different.

20:48.960 --> 20:54.400
Anyways, let's see here, Just Cause 2 was announced, or at least some details about it.

20:55.520 --> 21:01.600
They're going to be, I don't know, getting rid of some of the side quests, I guess, in the game,

21:01.600 --> 21:07.280
to kind of simplify it a little bit more, make it more, I don't know, straightforward.

21:07.280 --> 21:13.520
Now, they're saying that they've identified the key areas that they want to improve for Just

21:13.520 --> 21:17.840
Cause 2, they just want to make better use of the huge game world, enhance the stunts,

21:17.840 --> 21:22.880
improve the combat, and reward exploration, which I don't understand how you can reward exploration,

21:22.880 --> 21:24.320
but get rid of some of the side quests.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.840
That's kind of counterintuitive.

21:27.840 --> 21:37.440
But, apparently, the game is not going to be set on the island of San Esperanto anymore.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.560
It's going to be a tropical paradise in Southeast Asia, but it will still have

21:43.360 --> 21:47.440
Rico Rodriguez as the lead character.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.960
I don't know, I didn't really play Just Cause.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.520
I played the demo a lot, and that was fun.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.840
And I know that game had a few glitches where you can fly a plane underwater,

21:55.840 --> 21:58.480
but other than that, it looked pretty cool.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.240
It's so pretty good for a first, you know, a new IP, right?

22:02.240 --> 22:06.640
Yeah, it might be one I might pick up, actually I might pick up the original,

22:06.640 --> 22:08.160
because I think it's dirt cheap right about now.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.040
I think it is dirt cheap.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.560
I think I saw it in a bargain bin the other day.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.200
Well, this isn't coming to a bargain bin anytime soon, because the latest and greatest piece

22:15.200 --> 22:22.480
of technology for you PC gamers is a brand new video card, Nvidia's GeForce 9800 GX2,

22:22.480 --> 22:27.040
a blog called Hard OCP has gotten a peek at the new card.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.320
This card is coming out in late February, early March-ish,

22:30.320 --> 22:36.880
and it's basically going to replace Nvidia's current high-end card, the 8800 Ultra.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.520
Now, I don't follow a whole lot of what this stuff means,

22:39.520 --> 22:43.520
but I imagine for you PC folks that follow this stuff a little better than I do.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.640
You've got one gigabyte frame buffer, two PCBs,

22:48.640 --> 22:54.400
two 65nm GPUs total, and 256 stream processors total.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.560
In other words, fucking great video,

22:56.560 --> 22:59.360
but it'll be outdated next year when something even better comes out.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.480
Well, shit, this stuff's outdated like within a few months.

23:02.480 --> 23:02.960
Really?

23:02.960 --> 23:07.760
The thing is, yeah, well, fuck, I bought a card for my PC and the day after it was outdated.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.280
I traded it in though, so I got a better one.

23:11.280 --> 23:17.200
But yeah, essentially, there's a lot of drama going on with PC graphics cards right now,

23:17.200 --> 23:21.440
because ATI, their cards are nowhere near what Nvidia's are,

23:21.440 --> 23:24.080
and because of that, Nvidia doesn't really have any competition,

23:24.080 --> 23:30.000
so they keep re-releasing their old cards with slightly better processors and that kind of stuff.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.840
So this, essentially, is just two graphics cards shoved on the one card, is what it basically is.

23:35.840 --> 23:41.200
It's like your Core 2, or the quads that they have, the Intel chips,

23:41.200 --> 23:47.600
they're not really a quad-core processor, it's just two Core 2 duos on one processor.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.680
So that's what it is.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.160
It's going to be about 13 inches long, they said, which is fucking huge for a graphics card.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.760
Try fitting that in your case.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.200
But, you know, I'm sure it'll be good.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.720
13 inches long, you say?

23:58.720 --> 24:03.440
Yeah, and I'm sure it'll be, you know, you can quad SLI them,

24:03.440 --> 24:06.720
so if you really want to buy four of these cards, you can run them together.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.600
I don't know why you would, you probably don't need to.

24:09.600 --> 24:15.040
You probably don't need to, but it says 30% faster than the 8800 Ultra.

24:15.040 --> 24:20.880
I know that the card I have right now, which is the 8800 GTS 512, the G92,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.960
that one is a little bit faster than the Ultra, I think, as well.

24:24.960 --> 24:30.640
So save yourself some money, or wait, or buy through a company like EVGA,

24:30.640 --> 24:34.880
where you can step up your cards as new ones come out, so you can always stay with the new stuff.

24:34.880 --> 24:39.280
Dark Sakura, did you hear that I've got one that's 13 inches?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.120
I paid good money for it, too.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.360
I'm sure you did.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.640
Here's what I want to know, Loki.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.000
Will it make WoW run better?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.960
Dude, WoW will run on pretty much anything.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.120
It really will, but it's kind of choc-

24:55.120 --> 24:58.000
Will it make freaking Tabula Rasa run better?

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Because I tried playing a demo of that, and it did not run very well on my computer.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.720
Probably.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.600
Which is strange, because it's not like my computer's that old.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.040
The game's a memory hog.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.120
How about we do something else, Rob?

25:11.120 --> 25:12.480
How about we do some emails?

25:12.480 --> 25:15.680
We are going to get to the mailbag, but something you kids should be thinking about,

25:15.680 --> 25:18.560
because it's coming up very soon, not too far after the mailbag,

25:18.560 --> 25:22.480
we're going to bring back a game we haven't done in a long time tonight on the program,

25:22.480 --> 25:27.760
and that is Listless, and we're actually going to be looking for a collar in a little while.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.320
Not yet, but we're going to be looking for a collar to play with us.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.840
It's Listless in tonight's topic, so you can start thinking about-

25:33.840 --> 25:35.200
Well, maybe I'll save that.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.160
I'll keep that a secret.

25:36.160 --> 25:36.720
Save it.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.120
Maybe-

25:37.120 --> 25:40.320
But if you call in right now, Rob will tell us who it is, and we'll laugh.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
No, I'm not going to do that right now.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.480
But I am kind of wondering, I should get someone to participate in Listless with us,

25:46.480 --> 25:49.200
so I can tell them the topics, then you can start thinking of their list,

25:49.200 --> 25:50.960
because we don't want to have to come up with it on the spot.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.320
So I'm going to say this, if you want to participate in Listless tonight,

25:54.320 --> 25:55.680
and you're available on Skype-

25:55.680 --> 25:58.640
How about a trivia question to answer by private message?

25:58.640 --> 25:59.520
Okay, I like that.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.360
A trivia question to answer by private message.

26:03.040 --> 26:03.440
Okay.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.400
Well, you got to do mails.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.680
They should probably send it to me.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.640
Okay, let's send it to Rob.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.840
All right, send it to me.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.200
What's the trivia question?

26:09.200 --> 26:09.920
Anything I want?

26:11.360 --> 26:12.960
How about-

26:12.960 --> 26:14.480
I hope you pick something I know the answer to.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.920
Oh, well, if you don't know the answer to, I'll tell you anyway.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.240
Okay.

26:19.280 --> 26:19.680
Okay.

26:21.200 --> 26:21.920
Don't make it too hard.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.720
We want somebody to play.

26:22.720 --> 26:22.800
It'll be easy.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.680
What's my favorite color?

26:24.400 --> 26:26.000
What's Dark Soccer's favorite color?

26:26.000 --> 26:26.400
Yeah.

26:26.400 --> 26:26.720
All right.

26:26.720 --> 26:32.160
All right, send me a private message with what you think Dark Soccer's favorite color is.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.400
And the first person to get it will play Listless with us tonight.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.120
That'd be fun.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.360
And I'll tell them the topics they can think of their list.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.800
All right, so send a private message to Sky.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.720
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer is going to open up the old mailbag and get to work.

26:44.720 --> 26:45.600
There's just four.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.560
Um, well, a fifth one was a thank you.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.800
So, Rob, thank you.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.600
Oh, you're welcome.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.160
What did I do?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.360
Oh, okay.

26:55.360 --> 26:55.680
Yeah.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.480
Oh, you're welcome.

26:56.480 --> 27:04.240
Um, the first one, um, comes from, um, I'm just going to say Ryan, who put his full name

27:04.240 --> 27:04.560
on here.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.480
So, and I don't read out everybody's full names.

27:06.480 --> 27:11.440
So, so it says, Hey guys, I was wondering if the operator 11 feeds on OLR can be downloaded

27:11.440 --> 27:12.960
to a computer or a PSP.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.160
Rock on Dragon Force.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.360
Um, not right now.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.520
Um, as we have,

27:19.520 --> 27:28.480
um, as we've stated earlier, operator 11 is having, um, mental retardation, I'm sorry,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.760
technical difficulties.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.360
So we're not, um, going to say much more about them.

27:33.360 --> 27:33.840
Right.

27:35.280 --> 27:40.560
So moving forward, the next email comes from, uh, Martin.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.320
Hello, all our crew.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.720
I just want to ask your opinion about a blaming game.

27:44.720 --> 27:51.840
A gaming cliche that I think is really, really outdated.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.840
I constantly hear many game reviewers and game podcasters talk about how kids are always

27:55.840 --> 28:00.720
trying to explain game systems and gaming to parents buying the current gen systems.

28:00.720 --> 28:05.760
I think that it really must be pointed out that these supposed naive parents grew up

28:05.760 --> 28:11.120
with gaming in their lives, starting with the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES and many cats

28:11.120 --> 28:14.800
gaming since they started myself, including growing up in the eighties.

28:14.800 --> 28:18.560
Yes, it was sometimes a challenge to teach a parent about what a gaming system could

28:18.560 --> 28:23.440
do and their relevance, but gaming has been well established almost every living room

28:23.440 --> 28:24.960
since the 1980s.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.200
I really think that this need to explain to a parent about what a PlayStation or Nintendo

28:29.200 --> 28:33.840
Wii is, is really outdated and just plain foolish to think a good portion of all of

28:33.840 --> 28:39.280
us oldsters have and continue to game in some cases, no more than their kids about gaming.

28:39.280 --> 28:43.920
No more than their kids about gaming don't buy into the hype.

28:43.920 --> 28:48.780
The only parents that do not know what video games are will never get it because they choose

28:48.780 --> 28:50.440
not to know about it.

28:50.440 --> 28:54.360
Martin and all your friends at bunchofdorks.com.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.880
Nice name for a website by the way.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
That's fantastic.

28:56.880 --> 29:02.080
Do you have anything to say about that?

29:02.080 --> 29:05.600
I'm sorry, I was monitoring the trivia question.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
Summarize for me?

29:06.600 --> 29:13.960
Well, basically saying that since there have been video games for as long as many of the

29:13.960 --> 29:21.280
people out there have, I guess, grown up and are now parents themselves, so there shouldn't

29:21.280 --> 29:27.320
be any excuse for a parent not to be aware of what a system is or what it does, but I

29:27.320 --> 29:34.800
also do think that, and I actually do agree that they don't know what it is because they

29:34.800 --> 29:39.440
choose not to know about it, but I think that it's not really the system so much themselves

29:39.440 --> 29:46.600
as the content that they need to be informed about because when we were little, games didn't

29:46.600 --> 29:50.720
look that major, you know what I mean?

29:50.720 --> 29:59.040
True, we had Metal Gear and we had Splatterhouse, but it was all cartoony looking and now it's

29:59.040 --> 30:03.880
so realistic that I think that there does need to be a degree of caution on the part

30:03.880 --> 30:06.180
of the parents.

30:06.180 --> 30:11.920
So in that case, I can see how they might be naive or misinformed or uninformed, but

30:11.920 --> 30:16.880
I don't think it's the system so much that people really need a lot of education on.

30:16.880 --> 30:21.720
What do you think?

30:21.720 --> 30:24.200
So we finally got a winner of our stupid trivia thing, which-

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
I could not guess.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.040
Oh my God, it took forever.

30:28.040 --> 30:32.600
Oh my God, I don't think I've made any secret about it.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.640
So next email, oh it's to me.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.040
Wait, which person sent in that last email?

30:38.040 --> 30:46.680
Oh, that was, I closed it, that was Martin from a bunch of dorks.com, let me see.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.520
I remember, I read this email earlier in the week, sorry, I swear I was paying attention

30:51.520 --> 30:52.520
to the chat room.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.520
I know.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.320
But anyhow, no, you know what's funny about this?

30:55.320 --> 30:58.760
When I was reading this, I kind of thought to myself, I was like, okay, as far as the

30:58.760 --> 31:03.280
Atari 2600 generation goes, not everybody had that.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.200
That's the thing, is that some of us were lucky enough to experience that, but even

31:07.200 --> 31:11.280
I think Atari 2600, not everybody in our generation necessarily experienced.

31:11.280 --> 31:16.520
It was still kind of something that only certain kids on the block had, and in some parts of

31:16.520 --> 31:20.520
the country, you weren't as able to find these as easily.

31:20.520 --> 31:24.800
It was still kind of a luxury item, let's put it that way, as video games are in general

31:24.800 --> 31:33.080
today, but even when I say luxury item, an old system such as a Nintendo 8-bit system

31:33.080 --> 31:38.560
or a PlayStation, those are so cheap now that lots of households have these old video games.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.280
I mean when you met them at the flea market.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.520
Right, but I think sometimes, I guess what I'm trying to say is that perhaps your perspective

31:43.520 --> 31:49.800
is a little bit skewed because you were in this place in your generation where you were

31:49.800 --> 31:54.660
able to have this luxury item, where I think a lot of parents, or people that are now parents

31:54.660 --> 31:59.800
weren't exposed to this when they were young, nevertheless, even if they were, they remember

31:59.800 --> 32:08.840
video games as being Pac-Man, combat, and not Grand Theft Auto, or Manhunt, it was much

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
different back then.

32:09.840 --> 32:15.040
I think that the case with a lot of them is that not everyone has been the hardcore gamer

32:15.040 --> 32:21.360
type, like me and my husband and our person who emailed us, or any of us in this room,

32:21.360 --> 32:29.240
that once we grew up and started working, oh well that's child stuff, we put it away,

32:29.240 --> 32:33.400
we don't do it anymore, well, we are more enlightened.

32:33.400 --> 32:39.960
And it's as fine as a recreation item as any, and we understand that, but there's always

32:39.960 --> 32:44.800
been, I think, when they were growing up with that type of thing, oh, well you're still

32:44.800 --> 32:46.220
doing that.

32:46.220 --> 32:50.360
My mom still says that to me, and I'm like, okay, you sat and played my Nintendo as much

32:50.360 --> 32:54.080
as I did when I had it, so what's your excuse?

32:54.080 --> 33:03.720
And now she wants a Wii, so, my mom wants a Wii, I think that's cute, but at any rate,

33:03.720 --> 33:07.600
that's where I think the difference comes in.

33:07.600 --> 33:12.200
And I think that it's right, those who don't know, it's because they choose not to know,

33:12.200 --> 33:17.700
they haven't educated themselves, so they're all surprised, ew, and they don't have a right

33:17.700 --> 33:20.600
to be.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.880
We can move on now, sorry, sorry I was not paying attention fully the first time.

33:23.880 --> 33:30.420
Aw, this makes me feel slightly better, J-Rod emailed, the one who has a really cool quote

33:30.420 --> 33:36.080
about Olive Garden, says, hey DarkSakura, I know this isn't exactly a gaming question,

33:36.080 --> 33:41.160
but you said you get a sinus infection every single year for New Year's Eve, yes, I'm in

33:41.160 --> 33:45.440
the same boat as you, except whenever I have something like a concert to go to, I'll get

33:45.440 --> 33:47.660
a sinus infection without question.

33:47.660 --> 33:51.200
Someone could ask me to go see a concert tomorrow and I'll develop a sinus infection overnight,

33:51.200 --> 33:52.560
woe is us.

33:52.560 --> 34:00.240
Yeah, well for me, I always get a bad sinus infection at the end of the year, and then

34:00.240 --> 34:05.320
I get like the flu at the beginning of the year, so I think that they just decided to

34:05.320 --> 34:10.560
gang up on me and give me both at once or some crap like that, and I have to read it,

34:10.560 --> 34:12.320
I have to, Rob.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.920
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the Never Ending Salads.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.920
Dude, the Olive Garden is the shit, don't forget Never Ending Breadsticks.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.960
We should just go for salad one day.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.520
Let's go to Olive Garden, cause you wanna come over for movie night, cause I have to

34:24.520 --> 34:28.320
show you Stardust, cause I love that movie so much, let's do Olive Garden that night.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.800
If I'm not completely broke.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.840
We'll do dinner at the Olive Garden!

34:32.840 --> 34:33.840
Okay!

34:33.840 --> 34:34.840
Yee-haw!

34:34.840 --> 34:35.840
Last email!

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
Dun dun dun.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.160
If you can't pay, it'll be my treat, cause I want Never Ending Breadsticks.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.160
Okay.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.160
Alright.

34:41.160 --> 34:42.160
And I'll get you after my payday.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.160
Sweet.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
We'll go to Indian again.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.160
Yes.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.160
I thought I was sick.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.160
All I wanted was Indian food.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.160
Okay.

34:48.160 --> 34:49.160
You know what, Ross Steel?

34:49.160 --> 34:50.160
Damn it.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
I need to have it out with him for a minute here.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.160
Okay.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
Okay, Ross Steel.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
God damn it.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.040
You criticize Loki and his, you know, ways, which I, you know, to some extent I agree

34:57.040 --> 34:58.040
with you.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
Fine.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.040
You criticize me playing WoW.

35:00.040 --> 35:04.900
Maybe I do play, maybe I do play too much WoW, but I draw the line at you criticizing

35:04.900 --> 35:06.360
our love of the Olive Garden.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.760
Dude, the Olive Garden is great.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.520
The Olive Garden is wonderful, and damn you for thinking otherwise.

35:12.520 --> 35:18.200
Although, although, although, one of these days I'm gonna have to take you to Pasquale's.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.080
They're closed on Monday, but they're open on Tuesday.

35:21.080 --> 35:25.240
I hope you get smited with Zuppa Tuscana.

35:25.240 --> 35:29.920
He should get, um, get, uh, uh, Sangreid in the eye.

35:29.920 --> 35:30.920
Exactly.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.200
That would be great.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.760
May a deep-fried ravioli fall from heaven onto your head.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.640
That sounds good too, I love those.

35:38.640 --> 35:42.600
Um, this email is titled Yaris Made Better by Dragonforce.

35:42.600 --> 35:47.480
Hey, O.L.R., I made this video on YouTube and got the inspiration from you guys and

35:47.480 --> 35:48.480
girl.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.720
I think you should actually start that seg-, uh, should actually start that segment.

35:51.720 --> 35:55.080
There are a lot of crappy games out there and someone needs to make them watchable.

35:55.080 --> 35:58.960
Anyway, I think you guys are great and I will keep saying that, cause you are, and keep

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
going strong.

35:59.960 --> 36:06.400
To get the video, search for PKJR92, and I'm saying it out loud so that they know what

36:06.400 --> 36:10.200
to look at, on YouTube, or Yaris, or Dragonforce, or even O.L.R.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.840
Sincerely, PK, is it PKJR92?

36:13.840 --> 36:14.840
Sure why not.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.840
Okay.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.520
Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.920
Is the quote on there?

36:18.920 --> 36:20.680
I've, I've heard that quote before.

36:20.680 --> 36:24.360
And by the way, I did watch the video, and basically he took the trailer for Yaris, the

36:24.360 --> 36:29.160
30 second trailer for Yaris, and put Dragonforce's music behind it, and it's surprisingly effective.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.300
We do approve.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.000
And I will find the link to that YouTube and post it in chat for you all to look at right

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
now.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.040
Well, not right, right now, but, you know.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.040
You know, we got one last email.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.080
I can hear Loki watching it right now.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.080
Yeah.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.080
What do you think?

36:43.080 --> 36:44.080
Doesn't it make the game better?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
We got one last email in.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
All right, sorry.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
We're getting a lot better with it.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
From SakuraMax.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.440
Hey, O.L.R., just email, just mailing to say Happy New Year.

36:50.440 --> 36:54.360
I was running a little late since I didn't have computer access while the New Year special

36:54.360 --> 36:55.360
was running.

36:55.360 --> 36:59.300
This is from SakuraMax, the one who hasn't annoyed you people in a while, you happy?

36:59.300 --> 37:03.920
And a person with mass gamer ADD, who, what to play next?

37:03.920 --> 37:07.040
So, there we have it.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.560
No more emails?

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
Nope.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
Oops, sorry.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.560
I'm watching the video.

37:13.560 --> 37:17.600
No, I was just going to add a little thing that says I approve.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.400
But anyway, see now everybody in the chat room is like, you need to go have real Italian

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
food.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
You need to go have real.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
I have had real Italian food.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
I actually went to a little place in Sacramento.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.120
I don't even know if you guys have heard of this, but I always thought I got a kick out

37:28.120 --> 37:29.120
of this.

37:29.120 --> 37:34.480
It's called Español, which means Spain, but it has really good Italian food.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.480
So there's real Italian places all over.

37:36.480 --> 37:40.400
I bet there are really, really good places in New York, though, and that's where they're

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
offering to take me.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.260
So I'm not going to say no, especially if you're buying.

37:44.260 --> 37:50.080
So anyhow, if you want to send emails, maybe profess your love for the Olive Garden here

37:50.080 --> 37:51.080
on this program.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.960
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.440
You know, if we're not the weather podcast, we're the food podcast, I swear to God.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
Anything but games.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.720
That should be our new tagline.

37:59.720 --> 38:00.720
Anything but games.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.720
We're tired of games.

38:01.720 --> 38:02.720
That's right.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.720
We've been doing games for like six years.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.920
It's time for something new, don't you think?

38:05.920 --> 38:06.920
All right.

38:06.920 --> 38:10.440
We have a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into tonight's

38:10.440 --> 38:11.440
listless.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.800
Loki, I'll let you go first.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
Yes.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.000
Anyways, let's see.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.280
So if you've been playing Team Fortress 2, you may have been noticing that there are

38:21.280 --> 38:26.600
some achievements missing for one of the classes you can play, and that would be the medic.

38:26.600 --> 38:32.520
Well, that's going to be fixed hopefully pretty soon, because GermanSight was listening to

38:32.520 --> 38:37.680
some brand new achievements, 36 new ones actually, for the medic.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.480
So that's kind of neat.

38:39.480 --> 38:45.240
And some of the other ones here, they had heal under fire, which is healing somebody

38:45.240 --> 38:47.320
while on fire.

38:47.320 --> 38:53.400
And let's see here, they have one for healing an engineer, healing teammates who've called

38:53.400 --> 39:03.720
for a medic, Ubering a friend, and they have some other fun stuff like a bonesaw spy caller,

39:03.720 --> 39:08.360
or I'm assuming that's killer, killing an enemy spy with a bonesaw.

39:08.360 --> 39:12.160
Loki, I'm going to interrupt this story to show you the fly swimming for his life in

39:12.160 --> 39:14.620
my coffee right now.

39:14.620 --> 39:18.560
That fly is going to be totally hyped up on caffeine.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.760
The more he swims, the more hyper he gets.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.880
But, goddammit, that just ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee.

39:23.880 --> 39:30.000
Go flies, asshole, asshole fly.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.800
So yeah, hopefully we'll see some of those soon, maybe in an update or something.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.880
Even the chat room is like, Rob's derailing the show tonight, I am.

39:40.880 --> 39:45.600
I do want to say this though, the native Spanish speakers in chat room are yelling at me and

39:45.600 --> 39:50.560
screaming at me, and I should know better, but I only had two years of high school Spanish.

39:50.560 --> 39:56.760
España is Spain, español is a Spaniard, or Spanish.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.480
I don't know any Spanish, and I knew that.

40:00.480 --> 40:05.360
Well sorry, donde esta el baño, that's what I remember.

40:05.360 --> 40:10.560
Somebody on Ragnarok last night was spamming with donde esta la biblioteca.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.200
Ew, they're telling me to drink the coffee, that's fucking gross.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.200
Ew, no.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.160
What the hell is wrong with you people?

40:17.160 --> 40:20.160
Just say that you are, if you don't have a camera.

40:20.160 --> 40:27.360
I'm drinking it right now, mmm, delicious, oh no, I feel that fly in my throat, it's

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
so weird.

40:28.360 --> 40:38.600
Oh my God, he's turning into a fly now, that's so crazy.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.800
So this is how we're starting off 2008, huh?

40:40.800 --> 40:44.860
Dear everyone, Rob is crazy, the end.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.080
We can get away with much more when Op 11 isn't running.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.760
Maybe we'll never have a webcam again.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.920
I can get away with a lot of stuff over here because the camera's never on me.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.080
Well, one week I'm going to just surprise you, and it'll be Jamie Cam.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.080
No way, I'll learn.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.080
And it'll catch you picking your nose.

40:58.080 --> 41:02.100
Or I'll put that camera up there and put another camera hidden somewhere that's actually the

41:02.100 --> 41:03.100
real camera.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
Oh, it's elaborate.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.100
But it'll work.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.100
Candid camera.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.100
All right, anyway.

41:07.100 --> 41:11.160
I'll make that the day I throw up on you.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.960
You know, a lot of folks have been saying this week with all the Xbox Live downtime,

41:14.960 --> 41:17.320
I'm just going to go play PlayStation Network.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.880
Sony's network is free, I'm just going to go play that.

41:19.880 --> 41:24.920
Well, Sony has been polling customers in some of their Asian regions on ways that they can

41:24.920 --> 41:28.960
improve the PC and PSP PlayStation Store.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.880
One of the things that they're polling about?

41:30.880 --> 41:33.760
A monthly subscription plan.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
Hmm.

41:34.760 --> 41:39.800
So possibly is Sony looking into charging a monthly fee for the PlayStation Network?

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
But no.

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
Possibly.

41:41.800 --> 41:42.800
Possibly.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
All right, Loki, go ahead.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.760
You're wanting to jump at the bit here to say it was.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.760
Sorry.

41:46.760 --> 41:51.560
I'm possibly going to be offering a monthly subscription for unlimited download content.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.560
That's right.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.200
Game tap for your PSP, basically.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.200
But with Sony's games.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.200
I like that idea.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.360
That actually isn't a bad idea at all.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.800
I would hand it to Sony if that's the case.

42:00.800 --> 42:07.200
Of course, the trump on that, I guess, is that there isn't really a whole lot of download

42:07.200 --> 42:11.320
content on the PlayStation Network.

42:11.320 --> 42:19.200
Would be a definite way, though, to ensure income from the service on a regular basis.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.920
I'd pay for that for a month, download everything, and then that's it.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.920
Just wait a few months.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.280
What if it's contractual?

42:27.280 --> 42:29.760
I don't think services like that are usually contractual, are they?

42:29.760 --> 42:30.760
Some are.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.760
Well, like game tap isn't it?

42:31.760 --> 42:32.760
It's month-to-month.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.760
All right.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.760
All right.

42:34.760 --> 42:39.400
Well, anyhow, I think it's about time for us to have a list list.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
What do you guys think?

42:40.400 --> 42:44.400
Are we going to have a list list time?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.400
Sure.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.000
All right.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.720
List List is the game where we're going to create the definitive list for something.

42:51.720 --> 42:55.040
You know, lists are big, especially around this time of year as one year has ended and

42:55.040 --> 42:56.040
another begins.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.200
Lists are big, so we're going to make our own list tonight.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.880
I know we have a lot of new listeners since the last time we've done this because we used

43:00.880 --> 43:04.040
to do this game a lot and we probably haven't played it in like four months.

43:04.040 --> 43:08.840
So the way List List works is that we're going to have four panelists, myself, Loki Dark

43:08.840 --> 43:14.640
Soccer and our Mystery Caller, and each of us are going to give you our top three things

43:14.640 --> 43:16.440
that will match the list.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.180
And then here's the twist.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.840
Each one of us takes one thing off the list.

43:20.840 --> 43:23.640
So you have 12 that gets taken down to eight.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.800
So once we're down to eight, then the chat room votes on the top three and that will

43:27.800 --> 43:30.040
bring us the definitive list.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.840
And tonight's topic for the list, if you'd like to start posting your suggestions in

43:33.840 --> 43:40.000
chat, here it is, gadget I'd like to see them announce at Consumer Electronics Show.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.200
It doesn't have to be gaming related, just any type of tech gadget.

43:44.200 --> 43:47.760
So the gadget you would like to see them announce at the Consumer Electronics Show.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.840
It can be real, it can be crazy, anything you want, but that's it right here, tonight's

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
List List.

43:52.840 --> 44:01.320
So let us call the person who correctly guessed Dark Soccer's favorite color.

44:01.320 --> 44:07.680
If I can find them in the list, I suddenly can't find them.

44:07.680 --> 44:16.800
Live radio, folks.

44:16.800 --> 44:20.400
I'm making them call us.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.040
Tell us a little bit about your favorite color.

44:22.040 --> 44:27.840
My favorite color is very, very dark, very, very dark.

44:27.840 --> 44:35.360
That's right, Dark Soccer's favorite color was matte.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.720
Like my soul.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.720
That's right.

44:37.720 --> 44:38.720
Just like your soul.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.680
Okay, I tried calling the person and it's busy.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.080
Oh, here we go.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.080
Are you there?

44:43.080 --> 44:45.360
I'm here, yes I am.

44:45.360 --> 44:48.320
Hooray, introduce yourselves, person who won.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.760
This is SSJ100 Matt.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.600
Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
Hi.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.840
I'm fine, all right.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.440
Are you a big fan of Consumer Electronics Show?

44:56.440 --> 45:00.120
Do you look forward to it every year?

45:00.120 --> 45:06.920
I don't check out the keynotes or anything, but I like to watch what they got showing.

45:06.920 --> 45:08.720
What do you think about what I said earlier in the show?

45:08.720 --> 45:12.440
Is it true that most game nerds are somewhat of tech nerds too?

45:12.440 --> 45:15.320
They like to see the latest tech stuff?

45:15.320 --> 45:21.080
I think you kind of have to be, to tell you the truth, especially with the whole next

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
gen that's going on now.

45:23.080 --> 45:28.400
All right, well tonight's topic is the gadget we would most like to see them announce at

45:28.400 --> 45:29.640
the Consumer Electronics Show.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.640
Do you have a list?

45:30.640 --> 45:31.640
Your top three?

45:31.640 --> 45:33.080
Yeah, I certainly do.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.160
All right, then we're going to kick it off here.

45:35.160 --> 45:41.160
Let's do the background music one more time just because it's so awesome.

45:41.160 --> 45:44.000
And if at any time you need some suggestions, just look at our chat room.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.600
They're lighting up in chat there with their suggestions.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.580
All right, SSJ100 Matt, because you're on the phone, you get to start us off tonight.

45:50.580 --> 45:54.240
What is your number three pick?

45:54.240 --> 46:01.600
My number three pick is the Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0.

46:01.600 --> 46:05.080
And why a Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0?

46:05.080 --> 46:08.080
Because it will come out just in time for Rez HD.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.080
That's a good point.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.680
Rez HD is just around the corner.

46:11.680 --> 46:12.680
That's a good idea.

46:12.680 --> 46:13.680
Who wants to go next?

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
I can go.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.620
Dark Sakura, what is your number three pick?

46:16.620 --> 46:24.920
My number three pick is a remote-directed EMP gun for jamming other people's cell phones.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.880
And why, pray tell, do you need an EMP gun to jam people's cell phones?

46:27.880 --> 46:32.080
For people driving like fucking retards on the road while talking with their phone glued

46:32.080 --> 46:38.560
to their face, or people in front of me in line at the grocery store too busy talking

46:38.560 --> 46:41.620
on their phone to pay attention to what the hell they're doing.

46:41.620 --> 46:44.640
These people need to either die in a fire or hang up the phone.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
Or both.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.640
Preferably not.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
I'd buy it.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.640
Alright, that's actually a good idea.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.840
Alright, I'll go next.

46:50.840 --> 46:53.520
My number three pick, now I don't know if you've ever seen these, have you ever seen

46:53.520 --> 46:58.520
those guns at like Target or things that shoot the big blast of air at people?

46:58.520 --> 46:59.520
Yeah, the air cannons?

46:59.520 --> 47:00.520
I don't know.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.520
Air cannons?

47:01.520 --> 47:02.520
Airzookas.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.520
Airzookas.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
Airzookas?

47:04.520 --> 47:06.200
Okay, Airzookas are so awesome, but I want them to introduce like an Airzooka that will

47:06.200 --> 47:08.320
actually blow somebody over.

47:08.320 --> 47:11.160
Because it has so much power in it.

47:11.160 --> 47:18.320
So I'm going to just call it the Supreme Airzooka.

47:18.320 --> 47:21.360
And I don't know how electronic that gadget is, but I would imagine you'd need a little

47:21.360 --> 47:23.240
battery power to make that thing work.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.680
Alright, Loki, your number three pick.

47:25.680 --> 47:30.320
My number three pick would be kind of a sequel to the iBo.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.280
It's the iPer, and it would be, you know, a robotic cat.

47:35.280 --> 47:36.680
They already have those.

47:36.680 --> 47:41.720
Well, I want one from Sony, because, you know, I need my cat to be able to spy on my other

47:41.720 --> 47:44.600
cat so I can see what's going on, you know.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.080
Sony does have an iBo cat.

47:46.080 --> 47:48.360
They have a gray one and a white one and a black one.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.160
But he can put anything he wants on the list.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.880
You take it off if you don't like it.

47:51.880 --> 47:52.880
Alright.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.880
Fine.

47:53.880 --> 47:54.880
What, iSloth?

47:54.880 --> 47:56.880
I mean, yeah.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.880
iFerret.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.880
iFerret.

47:58.880 --> 47:59.880
Alright, iFerret.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.880
I go with iFerret.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.880
You're going to change it to iFerret.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.880
iFerret.

48:03.880 --> 48:09.680
Alright, we're back to you, SSJ100Matt.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.200
What is your number two pick?

48:12.200 --> 48:18.880
My number two pick is an Apple handheld gaming system.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.940
As is the device of many fanboys' dreams.

48:21.940 --> 48:24.480
Are you an Apple fanboy?

48:24.480 --> 48:25.480
Not really.

48:25.480 --> 48:26.480
Oh, okay.

48:26.480 --> 48:31.400
Well, why then, especially from non-fanboys, should Apple announce a handheld gaming system?

48:31.400 --> 48:34.680
You know what, I think there should be another handheld gaming system in general that's not

48:34.680 --> 48:37.640
the N-Gage.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.760
As RawstealUT says, the Pippin Boy?

48:40.760 --> 48:41.760
Is that what it would be?

48:41.760 --> 48:44.760
Alright, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

48:44.760 --> 48:49.520
A streaming TV for iPhone.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.040
Like the YouTube channel, but like actual episodes of stuff.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.840
I was going to say, YouTube's not good enough for you, huh?

48:53.840 --> 48:57.680
Well, because you can't really find full episodes of stuff on YouTube, and it's like a limited

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
YouTube.

48:58.680 --> 49:03.680
So they need to have like a show service, like for me, because I don't like to sit in

49:03.680 --> 49:06.120
front of the TV because that's just boring to me.

49:06.120 --> 49:08.840
You know, I have to have other stuff going on.

49:08.840 --> 49:13.520
So having it on my iPhone, and I could watch for a little bit and then go do other crap,

49:13.520 --> 49:17.320
and then come back and finish watching it when I'm done, would be perfect for me.

49:17.320 --> 49:21.120
Alright, I'm actually going to take my number two pick from the chat room, because this

49:21.120 --> 49:24.320
is a darn good pick, and we can be as still as we want, right?

49:24.320 --> 49:30.280
So I'm going to suggest that a portal gun be unveiled as CES, so I can have my very

49:30.280 --> 49:31.280
own portal gun.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.160
Because seriously, who couldn't use a portal gun?

49:33.160 --> 49:36.920
I could use one all the time.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.320
So portal gun, there you go.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.680
Loki, what would be the number two pick for you?

49:41.680 --> 49:44.200
My number two pick also happens to come from Portal.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.880
I would like the Aperture Science Sentry Bot.

49:46.880 --> 49:51.400
You know, the ones that say, hello, and then turn the chute at you.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.080
It'd be perfect for the neighbors.

49:53.080 --> 49:58.000
Oh, those things are such assholes, but okay, yeah, those would be good guard dogs.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.600
I'm surprised no one said a companion queue, but I guess we haven't gotten to the number

50:01.600 --> 50:03.480
ones yet, so let's see.

50:03.480 --> 50:07.720
SSJ100Matt, what is the number one thing you would like to see them debut at CES?

50:07.720 --> 50:09.180
New gadget.

50:09.180 --> 50:16.080
My number one pick is the Dreamcast 2.

50:16.080 --> 50:18.920
Sega fanboy, eh?

50:18.920 --> 50:22.800
You know what, I just want to see another Sega system.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.600
I'm not really a fanboy, I just think, you know.

50:26.600 --> 50:29.440
Don't you think it's about time to let go?

50:29.440 --> 50:30.440
No.

50:30.440 --> 50:31.680
Alright, fine.

50:31.680 --> 50:36.840
Alright, Dark Soccer, what would be your number one thing you would like to see them

50:36.840 --> 50:38.600
announce at CES?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.640
Portable Xbox Live Arcade.

50:40.640 --> 50:43.720
Portable Xbox Live Arcade, not a bad choice.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.480
What made you decide to go with that?

50:45.480 --> 50:51.280
Because remember when we were speculating what the interactivity between the Zune and

50:51.280 --> 50:54.280
the Xbox was going to be and we were thinking, because they had the thing where you could

50:54.280 --> 50:58.540
see which of your friends was online at the time and all that, and we had sort of joked

50:58.540 --> 51:01.880
about they should have a way to bring your downloadable content with you.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.840
I think that that would be really awesome.

51:04.840 --> 51:08.200
Did you happen to see, just on a semi-related note, did you happen to see what the number

51:08.200 --> 51:13.000
one most played Xbox Live Arcade game was in 2007, Courtney Major Nelson?

51:13.000 --> 51:14.720
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.920
We were playing that the other night, too.

51:16.920 --> 51:17.920
Good times.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.920
Alright, my number one...

51:18.920 --> 51:19.920
And Smash TV.

51:19.920 --> 51:23.040
Smash TV is good times, too, but that's a little older.

51:23.040 --> 51:28.600
My number one pick thing I would like to see them announce at CES, who wouldn't want one

51:28.600 --> 51:29.600
of these in their house?

51:29.600 --> 51:31.120
It would be the ultimate gadget.

51:31.120 --> 51:34.880
I would like to see them unveil the holodeck.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.160
Seriously, holodecks are awesome.

51:39.160 --> 51:42.880
Alright, Loki, what would be your number one pick gadget you would like to see them unveil

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
at CES?

51:43.880 --> 51:48.960
My number one pick has already been said, which was a portal gun, but that's alright,

51:48.960 --> 51:52.400
because I didn't really have anything that I thought of.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.560
But this would be kind of cool.

51:54.560 --> 52:00.640
I know it's not practical in any sense whatsoever, but we haven't seen anything come from George

52:00.640 --> 52:05.720
Foreman in a while, so I want a George Foreman grill that I can cook an entire cow on at

52:05.720 --> 52:08.720
one time.

52:08.720 --> 52:17.720
That would be great.

52:17.720 --> 52:21.200
And it needs to clean the cow's guts out for you and everything.

52:21.200 --> 52:24.800
What, pray tell, would the George Foreman entire cow grill be called?

52:24.800 --> 52:36.720
It would be George Foreman's self-cleaning cow grill.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.120
I don't know what to say.

52:38.120 --> 52:42.440
This is going to be very hard, because this is a very good list of items that we've built

52:42.440 --> 52:43.440
tonight.

52:43.440 --> 52:47.160
Black Labs does the mean, lean, fat-reducing cow machine.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.080
It would certainly reduce the size of those cows.

52:50.080 --> 52:53.960
Uh, wow.

52:53.960 --> 52:55.600
We said anything.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.960
Very few of these items are actually gaming-related, I'd like to point out, but if it's the theme

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
of our podcast tonight.

52:59.960 --> 53:04.040
Alright, SJ100 Matt, I posted the list there in private message for your reference.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.080
Let me go ahead and read it as it stands now.

53:06.080 --> 53:09.880
I'm going to kill the music, because this is the serious round, because we have twelve

53:09.880 --> 53:13.840
items on the list, but four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

53:13.840 --> 53:19.400
We have Res Trans Vibrator 2.0, Remote EMP Gun for jamming people's cell phones, Supreme

53:19.400 --> 53:26.640
Airzooka, iFerret, Apple Handheld Gaming System, Streaming TV for iPhone, Portal Gun, Aperture

53:26.640 --> 53:32.800
Science Sentry Bot, Dreamcast 2, Portable Xbox Live Arcade, Holodeck, and George Foreman's

53:32.800 --> 53:35.080
self-cleaning cow grill.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.120
Four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

53:37.120 --> 53:41.120
Uh, SJ100 Matt, what is not worthy of the list?

53:41.120 --> 53:44.260
I'm going to go with the Airzooka.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.120
You're a bastard, but that's alright.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.840
I guess it's not that electronic, is it?

53:47.840 --> 53:48.840
Let me see.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.960
Alright, Supreme Airzooka is not worthy of the list.

53:50.960 --> 53:54.760
Yeah, that isn't really an electronic, although I guess you would need electronics in order

53:54.760 --> 53:56.180
to build an aquaver person.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.520
But how awesome would that be?

53:57.520 --> 53:58.520
Come on, seriously.

53:58.520 --> 54:03.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these things is not worthy of the list?

54:03.000 --> 54:10.800
Um, I'm going to say the Apple Handheld Gaming System.

54:10.800 --> 54:15.040
I was expecting Loki to do that.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.040
Just because...

54:16.040 --> 54:19.480
I was going to.

54:19.480 --> 54:22.240
Just because I think that Microsoft would do it better.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
Oh, snap!

54:23.240 --> 54:26.600
Well, but there's also the iPhone, in which in a way they'll probably turn into a gaming

54:26.600 --> 54:27.600
system.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.480
And you know there's going to be stuff coming out on that eventually.

54:29.480 --> 54:35.500
I love my iPhone, don't get me wrong, but I think that when we have a company that's

54:35.500 --> 54:40.960
already established for having quality games out now, I think that's only, you know, inevitable.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.200
Alright, well I've got to get rid of this.

54:43.200 --> 54:47.400
I'm so sorry SSJ100 Matt, we're picking on you tonight, but Dreamcast 2 is not worthy

54:47.400 --> 54:49.680
of the list.

54:49.680 --> 54:53.880
Because it's not going to happen, kids.

54:53.880 --> 54:56.120
None of the things I listed were never going to happen.

54:56.120 --> 55:00.800
A holodeck has a better chance of happening at a future consumer electronics show, or

55:00.800 --> 55:06.720
Loki's fucking cow grill has a better chance than the Dreamcast 2.

55:06.720 --> 55:10.000
Loki, that being said, we're down to nine items on the list.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.800
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

55:11.800 --> 55:14.280
I'm going to have to take off Res Trans Vibrator.

55:14.280 --> 55:20.080
Well, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's one damn game, I mean, if you really...

55:20.080 --> 55:21.080
I'd buy it.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.280
They could just have a vibrator.

55:22.280 --> 55:26.520
I would like to point out, this doesn't happen very often, but the hosts have effectively

55:26.520 --> 55:28.720
eliminated all of SSJ100's lists.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:29.720 --> 55:32.000
Your airzooka got taken off?

55:32.000 --> 55:36.680
No, I know, but the other three, we eliminated SSJ's entire list.

55:36.680 --> 55:37.680
I forgot.

55:37.680 --> 55:38.680
Okay, okay.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.160
No, sorry, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

55:41.160 --> 55:44.560
SSJ100 Matt, I'm very sorry.

55:44.560 --> 55:46.680
Apparently your choices just weren't worthy tonight.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.680
Yeah.

55:47.680 --> 55:48.680
I'm sorry.

55:48.680 --> 55:49.680
Are you going to cry about it?

55:49.680 --> 55:51.320
No, I'm going to go cut myself.

55:51.320 --> 55:56.400
All right, well, I'm sorry that things didn't go your way tonight, but hey, because you

55:56.400 --> 55:59.360
don't have any items on the list, we'll still let you vote for the winner.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.360
How's that sound?

56:00.360 --> 56:01.360
All right.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.360
That sounds good to me.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.480
All right, anything you want to plug before we hang up on you?

56:04.480 --> 56:05.480
Nope.

56:05.480 --> 56:07.280
All right.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.280
Have a good one.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.280
Yep, you too.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.280
All right.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.720
I like it when they don't have anything to plug.

56:12.720 --> 56:13.720
Poor guy.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.680
He got his whole list eliminated by us three bastards.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.120
That hasn't happened very often.

56:18.120 --> 56:22.120
I can only think of one other time in list lists where somebody's entire list got eliminated.

56:22.120 --> 56:25.080
They were mad that I took off the ResTrans vibrator 2.0.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.080
Oh, well.

56:26.080 --> 56:29.520
How do you improve something that vibrates?

56:29.520 --> 56:32.080
I mean, seriously, it's not that complicated.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.080
Poor power.

56:33.080 --> 56:34.080
All right.

56:34.080 --> 56:35.080
Well, here we go.

56:35.080 --> 56:38.400
We are left with eight choices that have been deemed worthy of the list.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.400
Here they are.

56:39.400 --> 56:45.160
The remote EMP gun for jamming people's cell phones, an iFerret, a streaming TV for the

56:45.160 --> 56:51.360
iPhone, a portal gun, an Aperture Science SentryBot, a portable Xbox Live Arcade, a

56:51.360 --> 56:55.280
Holodeck, and a George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.

56:55.280 --> 57:00.780
Please send in your votes via private message for your number one and number two picks.

57:00.780 --> 57:04.280
If you don't label them one and two, I will assume that the first one is your number one

57:04.280 --> 57:05.280
pick.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.680
Send a private message to Sky in the chat.

57:06.680 --> 57:10.660
You have about 10 minutes while we go over these next few stories, so place your votes

57:10.660 --> 57:11.660
now.

57:11.660 --> 57:15.680
Meanwhile, we get back into the gaming news with Dark Sakura.

57:15.680 --> 57:27.320
We have our dear friend who is the god of third-party peripherals, mad cats, making

57:27.320 --> 57:29.740
instruments for Rock Band.

57:29.740 --> 57:37.140
They have a multi-year licensing agreement with MTV Games to do wired and wireless bass

57:37.140 --> 57:45.120
guitars and a percussion set that's got drumsticks and a microphone and stuff.

57:45.120 --> 57:48.400
So it looks like we're going to be seeing those come out eventually.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.400
Awesome.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.760
This is the first half of 2008.

57:52.760 --> 57:57.640
Well, one place you probably won't be able to get a good deal on those would be at Best

57:57.640 --> 58:05.320
Buy and apparently they had a coupon that was in, I guess, one of the local papers for

58:05.320 --> 58:09.520
25% off of three toys.

58:09.520 --> 58:15.400
You basically buy one toy, save 10%, buy two, save 15, buy three, save 25%.

58:15.400 --> 58:23.160
Well, oddly enough, games are listed as under the toy section on the website.

58:23.160 --> 58:29.760
However, if you went into a Best Buy and tried to use that coupon, they would not let you

58:29.760 --> 58:38.920
because they said that games are not a toys and says, let's see here, apparently an employee

58:38.920 --> 58:46.240
at Best Buy said that games and game systems do not apply to that coupon because they're

58:46.240 --> 58:47.240
not toys.

58:47.240 --> 58:50.840
A toy would be like a doll.

58:50.840 --> 58:57.520
Best Buy, ripping people off yet again, awesome.

58:57.520 --> 58:59.280
So what do you think of that?

58:59.280 --> 59:06.200
Is video games a toy or not?

59:06.200 --> 59:10.600
If they're listed under their website as a toy, then yes, I think it would apply as a

59:10.600 --> 59:13.760
toy, but you've got to be more clear on that stuff.

59:13.760 --> 59:19.360
If you're just saying a toy does not apply to video games, that's what they should have

59:19.360 --> 59:24.720
had the fine print on the coupon, but they didn't, I think they should honor it, so that's

59:24.720 --> 59:25.720
their own fault.

59:25.720 --> 59:30.360
And the fact that they're saying, oh, I'm sorry, that's not a toy, well, it doesn't

59:30.360 --> 59:33.120
say it's not and on your website it says it is.

59:33.120 --> 59:37.680
I'm sure, though, if you looked it up on their website in the store, since it's a different

59:37.680 --> 59:42.640
website, their intranet, probably would be otherwise, but I don't know, they rip people

59:42.640 --> 59:46.680
off all the time with this kind of shit.

59:46.680 --> 59:49.440
Bait and switch, got to love it.

59:49.440 --> 59:55.040
All right, well, we're going to give just a couple more minutes for listless votes,

59:55.040 --> 59:56.600
so get those votes in now.

59:56.600 --> 59:59.640
We will announce the winner shortly and we're going to be taking your Skype calls on our

59:59.640 --> 01:00:06.400
Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and pretty

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.880
soon you'll be able to call in from your PSP apparently, but I'm going to ask first, while

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.480
we wait for any last minute votes, if there's any last minute stories that any of the hosts

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.640
would like to cover tonight.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.360
There's not a whole lot.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.200
Sony of course introduced the 16 gigabyte memory stick duo for, you know, obviously

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.480
cameras and PSP and stuff like that.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.440
That's a whole lot of movies on there, or a whole lot of games, depending on how you

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.000
look at it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.400
I don't know, that's pretty much it.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.200
It's been pretty dead.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.380
Yeah, it was a very slow week, I noticed that.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.800
We had less stories in our show role than usual, so that's all right.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.800
Next week will be busier after CES, even though CES isn't really a games show, certainly a

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.320
lot of the tech news.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.720
One thing, speaking of tech, I don't think this came up anywhere, which is strange.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.480
I thought we had it in our role, but I don't know if you heard, but Warner Brothers is

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:07.580
sending their support of HD DVD, which is a huge blow to HD DVD supporters, which sucks

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580
because I'm one of them.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.700
They actually have an HD DVD player, but what can you do?

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.840
In fact, it's the ramifications, because if you think about it, Warner Brothers also owns

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.500
New Line, which is a huge studio.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.140
They did Lord of the Rings, right?

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.160
This is just a huge blow, and they're saying that this could single-handedly turn things

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.380
in Blu-ray's favor.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.280
But something to keep in mind, Paramount is still HD DVD exclusive, and I believe there's

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280
one other studio that's still-

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280
Universal?

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.360
Yeah, HD DVD exclusive, so it isn't necessarily over yet, but that is a very big blow, even

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.480
I'll admit that, because that means the Batman movies and stuff are going to be Blu-ray exclusive,

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.480
which kind of sucks.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:51.100
It was also the thing Kmart did too, saying they weren't going to carry Blu-ray.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.840
Just one more last minute story, and this is kind of stupid, but apparently some guy

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.980
shot his son over an Xbox 360 argument.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:08.440
Apparently a 17-year-old in Pennsylvania wanted his father to look at his Xbox 360 for some

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.560
unknown reason, and the father refused.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.720
An argument ensued, resulting in the kid handing a rifle to his father, telling him to just

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.220
go ahead and shoot him.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.480
So the father did.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.920
Now apparently the kid is sedated in a hospital with a bullet lodged in his skull, and the

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.040
father is in jail.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040
Talk about asshole.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.680
What's the kid doing with a rifle?

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.840
That's one of the many questions I have.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:46.100
Hold on, you know what, I'm sorry, this means we need to fire up something for 2008 here.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:53.240
This is the inaugural stupid award of 2008, I'm sorry.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.000
Like I've heard these arguments before where, you know, somebody is yelling at somebody

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.560
else and goes, I'm sure it says like, why don't you just shoot me, why don't you just

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560
kill me?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.640
Like, that doesn't mean you actually shoot them.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.520
Have you ever heard of like a metaphor?

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:16.080
Congratulations, what's this guy's name?

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.080
Uh, they didn't have his name.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.800
So Unknown Dead 17.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.080
I saw it somewhere, wait, I gotta look at this, I know I saw this somewhere, you have

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.220
to go to the original site that ran it, because I want to say this happened not that far from

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.120
where I've been in Pennsylvania before.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.800
Let's see, where the hell was it?

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:48.160
Uh, person, let's see, 60 year old James Stanley Niedasek shot his 17 year old son.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.840
So congratulations James Stanley, I can't pronounce your last name, you win the first

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.800
stupid award of 2008, courtesy of Orange Launch Radio, for shooting your son in an argument.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800
Ass.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:06.440
Uh, there's a release date for the Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Bully out in the UK, March

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
7th.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.160
We're getting that here too, I believe, right?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.240
Yeah, it's around March.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240
Sweet-ish.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.600
This should be the scholarship edition over here.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.440
Gonna be very nice.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.680
Alright, shall we get to tonight's listless winners?

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.760
It was neck and neck tonight, only one vote separated number one and two.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.800
But everything got a vote tonight, which doesn't happen very often in listless, but somebody

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.560
in chat wanted a little bit of everything.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.660
But in the end there could be only three, so here it is, your top three gadgets you

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.880
would like to see them unveil at CES.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.560
This is the definitive list, no arguing, it's a very scientific method we use here, it's

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.840
done.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:56.040
The number three thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is the holodeck.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:02.880
The number two thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is a portal gun, meaning the

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.720
number one thing you'd like to see at CES either this year or 2009, the George Foreman

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.760
self-cleaning cow grill.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760
Awesome.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.720
It bakes the whole fucking cow.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.320
Beautiful.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.880
Not bad for a last minute pick to fill in the other number one.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.280
Now your only trouble is where do you get a cow?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.160
That's the only downside.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.900
Tip it over and then put it in a bag, I don't know.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.600
That's it, you tip it over into the grill.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.360
Nice.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.400
Alright.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.800
Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line of calls then, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to go ahead and give us a call.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.640
We'll take your calls, we'll take a few of those.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.800
RossdielUT says, Loki, you can get a cow carcass at Publix Easy while here in Florida.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.200
I don't even know what that is, to be honest.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.960
Do you know what that is?

01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960
Nope.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.600
I know, I have no idea what that is.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
What?

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
Oh.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.960
You have to give this to me now while we're trying to take calls on Skype.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
Alright.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Yes, I had to.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.080
Hi, this is RossdielUT.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080
Hello, RossdielUT.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.080
Hi.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.080
Friend, buddy, pal.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.080
Hey there.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080
What's on your mind?

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080
Hey.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.680
Oh, nothing much.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:27.120
First off, Publix is a supermarket chain over here in the Southeast.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.520
Very big.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.340
Very big supermarket chain.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340
They don't have those here.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.880
I mean, you can get, like, a lot of meat at the store, but you can't get the whole damn

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880
cow.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.240
Yeah, I've seen people, I used to work at a Publix once, and yeah, I used to see people

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240
getting the cow carcasses.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240
Wow.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.240
I guess that's what they do for Thanksgiving instead of a turkey.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240
I don't know.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:52.720
That's something I'd like to see them doing on Supermarket Sweep, putting five of those

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.800
cow carcasses right in the car.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.760
You'd need more than one cart, man, those things are fucking huge.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.960
Well that's how they did it on the show, they'd fill up one cart and throw it to their partner

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.600
and they'd get another cart, alright, anyway.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.640
Would Supermarket Sweep not be the best video game ever?

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640
I'm sorry?

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.400
I'm sorry, would Supermarket Sweep not be one of the best video games ever?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.960
Like, that's the kind of shit they need to be doing for Xbox Live.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:18.960
Seriously.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.440
That would be a good Xbox Live or kid game, actually.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.920
I hope Microsoft's listening.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920
I hope you guys are listening.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.360
Alright, what else is on your mind, Ross Deal?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.200
Let's see, in reaction, a couple of things, actually.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:37.720
In reaction to the whole Warner Bros. New Line thing, the CES HD DVD press conference

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
got cancelled.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:44.680
I heard, it's like they've got their tail between their legs going, argh argh argh argh.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.280
Well it's pretty big when you think about it.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:54.840
There's only like three exclusive HD DVD studios left, and Paramount, like I said in the chat,

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.000
they're only exclusive because Microsoft paid them a boatload of money.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.620
I have a bad feeling HD DVD's time is running out, and it kind of makes me sad because I

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:08.740
am an HD DVD owner, but here's my question is, I read somewhere that porn was suddenly

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:14.360
supporting both HD DVD and Blu-ray, but I seem to remember we covered an article.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.640
I've seen pornographic Blu-rays on offer, I've seen them in places.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.560
I could have sworn on this program last year we had a story about that the porn industry

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.960
had gone with HD DVD for some reason.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.480
I don't remember the reason, but they went with HD DVD.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.960
Why did they go back on that?

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.800
Because I always said, whoever gets porn wins the war, and now that porn is going to Blu-ray,

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.960
I'm like, it's over.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.960
Well the problem with porn really is that it's not like like a DVD, now you see porn

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.680
really moving into the downloadable space, so it's perhaps not as important for the

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.040
disc this time around, because it's pretty much all over the internet, there's a site

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
everywhere for it.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040
You know what I mean?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.960
It's not like Xbox Live Marketplace is going to suddenly offer porn, although they ought

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960
to.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.840
Well, not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.760
Why not?

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.760
Don't they have a whole slew of horror films that are like the most supreme horror of horror

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.760
gore fest slash films?

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.760
I mean, if you're going to have one pornographic extremity, why not have another?

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.920
I would consider the amount of violence in those films pornographic to an extent.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920
Why not some titties?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.800
You could say the same thing about Wal-Mart.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.760
They carry those movies and they don't carry porn.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:32.800
Microsoft has an image to protect, but what I was about to say is that you can't go five

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:39.580
steps in either direction online without dipping into a pay site, so that's where I see a lot

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:45.120
of the pornographic market going is online, because you don't have to worry about people

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.720
picketing in front of porn shops or whatever.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.360
It's a lot less trouble than having brick and mortar.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.520
I'm picketing in front of your internet.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.560
I know why they can't do porn on Xbox Live, because it would shut it down again.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.120
I mean, do you think the holidays were bad?

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.440
I mean, the day porn is released on Xbox Live, the internet is going to die.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.520
Oh, then you'll really see those stupid stories.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.560
It's a gateway to porn, because none of the parents are going to be...

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.360
Well, the problem is they already did that with the Wii, so you remember that a few months

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360
back.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.840
My child went to XTube on the Wii.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.760
Anything with any sort of internet capability is going to have pornography.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:34.400
My concern is if it ever went to Xbox Live or a cage, you'd have a bunch of people go

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.080
on and watch some porn, and they go play Halo or Uno with their cameras, and you see them

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080
all.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.980
Well, the PlayStation Network is going to get porn pretty soon, with Home coming out

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.560
there, and you're going to be able to put a TV in your home, and you can put porn and

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.800
stream it off of your, well, 88 hard drive.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.060
I bet anything you're only going to get to put pre-selected video clips that just happen

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.720
to be clips from Sony's latest movies and TV shows.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.520
No, it's going to be stuff that's off your hard drive.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520
It's going to be anything, yeah.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520
Really?

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520
Any available at home.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.520
Yeah.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.640
Are you going to have a virtual porn house in Home?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640
Sure, why not?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640
No, it's going to be fun.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.700
Oh, what I want to know is are they going to be, you throw cocks at people in Home.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.360
Are they going to throw cocks at people?

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Second Life.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.720
Jamie, did you have something you wanted to say to this?

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720
Exactly, everything else is Second Life.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.800
I was just going to say Walmart wasn't exactly the best thing to bring up, since they actually

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.100
sold censored versions of movies.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.320
Not here.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.480
I totally agree with the point that Wal-Mart's just as bigoted as everybody else in this

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.920
sense that they're going to sell the violent movies, but heaven forbid our children see

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920
titties!

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.040
Oh no!

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.000
Heaven forbid we teach them responsible sex at the young age!

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.960
Wal-Mart is a huge contradiction.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:53.720
They'll sell the unrated movies gladly, they'll sell the M-rated games gladly, but they won't

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.280
sell porn and they won't sell music with explicit lyrics.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.160
I never understood that.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160
Never.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.760
I will never forget that fucking Sheryl Crow, of all people, got banned from Wal-Mart because

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.720
she said in one of her songs she had a lyric about somebody buying a gun at a Wal-Mart

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.720
store.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.040
Well, you can, in fact, buy guns at Wal-Mart stores.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.040
Yes, you can.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.040
They have a hunting section.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.920
So Wal-Mart fucking bans Sheryl Crow, because Sheryl Crow poses this huge threat to society.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.880
Like what's going to happen, you know?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.720
She does, however, pose a huge threat to good music.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.240
You know, when I think of hard fucking core music, I think of Sheryl Crow.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240
Exactly.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:40.000
Anyway, last thing before I go, you'll be happy to know that long after it's been released,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.120
they're releasing a Stranglehold map pack.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120
I'd actually heard about that.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.400
I got the email from Midway, except I never played Stranglehold in the first place, so

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400
I forgot about that.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.880
I was about to say, I mean, it wasn't exactly a best-selling game.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.740
Why would anyone care at this point?

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.000
Usually they were already making it, thinking the game was going to be huge, and now it's

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.120
just kind of one of those wah-wah kind of releases, you know?

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.240
Yeah, they kind of have to at this point, huh?

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240
Yeah.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.280
And if you spent the resources on it, if you can make 50 bucks off it, why not?

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.280
Exactly.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.840
It's better than nothing.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.600
Try to recover the cost of the people making it.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.840
All right, well, Rossdiel YouTube, we've got to let you go to take some other calls, but

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.840
thank you very much for your call.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.840
Have a good one, man.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:19.840
Always a lot of fun.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.840
Bye-bye.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.840
Bye-bye.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.640
I think it's so funny, Rossdiel YouTube, because, you know, he's such a critic in chat

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.280
and says a lot of, but when you get him on the phone, he's such a nice guy, oh, laugh

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280
a lot.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280
No, it's cool.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280
All right, let's take some more calls.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.280
Who's this?

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.280
Hello.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.280
This is Arke Rieper in chat.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280
Hi.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280
How are you?

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280
I'm fine.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280
What's on your mind?

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.420
I'm calling from Sweden, actually.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.920
You're calling from Sweden?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.600
It's got to be like four in the morning over there.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.000
I think I'm the first one to actually call from Sweden, maybe.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I think so.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I think he is.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.160
We've had people in, like, England, and I want to say we've had South America, definitely,

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Mexico.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
Argentina.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160
Mexico.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160
I want to say we've had another...

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160
You've had Denmark.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160
Denmark was it, but we haven't had Sweden.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.160
Well, welcome to the show.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.320
Well, good evening, so to say.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.800
Well, I don't know.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:20.960
I was a bit pissed last year, since in your years of years, your best of year, since never

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.440
ever spoke about that the expansion for World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, actually came

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:37.660
out, but then again, I just was like, wait, did that actually got released last year?

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.440
It seems like it was a long time ago.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.440
You're right.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.800
That did come out in January, and as far as PC games go, that was a huge title.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.600
Now, in all fairness, and to cover our rears a little bit, we did talk about BlizzCon.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.280
We talked about the wrath of Lich King.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:58.240
I remember, I don't know actually when I got hooked on your show for some reason, but I've

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:06.180
been listening to your show like, I would say, maybe a year and a half, but then again,

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:14.600
I had some, what is it, since I've upgraded platform from going from Macintosh to PC nowadays,

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:22.960
so I've had, what is it, one and a half year that didn't go that well.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960
Do you play WoW yourself?

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:29.760
Are you really big into Burning Crusade?

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:38.480
I would say that I'm a huge WoW player, since that's basically almost the only thing I played.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.960
What did I buy games last year?

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:51.320
It was Burning Crusade, and I tried out Eve Online this summer, and then I bought the

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.320
Orange Box.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320
Good choice.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.320
Good taste.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.800
And that I share with games, really.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.880
Here's my question, though, to you, because I notice you're mentioning a lot of PC games,

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.280
and we always like to ask our callers who call in from other countries, because I know

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.240
a lot of times here on this program we focus on, here's what's happening in Japan, here's

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.680
what's happening in the U.S.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.080
We try to cover the overseas stuff, but sometimes it's best to kind of hear it firsthand, what

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.760
the gaming scene's like overseas.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.760
For instance, we've kind of heard from callers that have called from Latin and South American

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.360
countries talk about that a lot of the scene is very expensive there.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.960
What would you say the gaming scene is like in Sweden?

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.720
Is it easy to walk into a store and pick up the latest and greatest game or console, or

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.720
is it a challenge?

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.960
That's like a piece of cake.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.240
The only problem is that, well, what?

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:53.920
Games are currently quite fun in one way, since the PS3 is, for the cost of a PS3, you

01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:00.860
can actually get a decent computer and start playing WoW or Orange Box, whatever you want

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.860
to.

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:02.860
Interesting.

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.040
Well, they do say the PS3 is supposed to be a computer.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.800
Well, at least they keep going back and forth on that.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.800
Yes, it's a computer.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.800
No, it's not.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:16.400
And still, I, what is it, they, there was a argument that really that the cell engine,

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.360
which is in the PS3, is not even made for games, so.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:28.680
So I'm assuming that the PlayStation 3 sales in Sweden are similar to that they are here,

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.680
where there's quite still a big pile of them at the store waiting to be moved.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680
Yeah.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.160
Yeah, it really is.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.200
But then it was, oh.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.760
So I guess maybe we aren't so different after all.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.940
When you look at that.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:53.600
Maybe you want to cut me off right now, but anyway, I just want to say, Sky, what is it?

01:17:53.600 --> 01:18:00.480
You have a 7E Druid, which I'm quite impressed in one way, since, well, what?

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:10.920
In a way, just, well related, I've played World of Warcraft on US servers for one year,

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.560
and I never even got to level 40.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.480
Are you playing on a PvP server?

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.960
That's probably why.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.460
PvP servers was, well, was it, it was Warsong.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:34.320
But here's the thing, I've developed the infamous Altiholic disease, which is that you made,

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:41.160
well, one character, and then you get it to get a character of like 35 or something, and

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:46.360
then you play another one, and then you repeat that for quite some time.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:52.200
So basically you have WoW ADD is what we would call it, where you just, you can't focus on

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.200
one character.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.640
I have plenty of friends who do that same thing.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.320
I was like, I haven't got a character past level 8.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:09.920
Although, really, I actually have 63 Mage nowadays.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.720
And well, what is it?

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:18.480
When the Burning Crusade came out, I switched to European servers.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.400
So well, they made it a lot easier to level.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:33.000
But then again, when the 2.3 patch later, that came out just a few months, one month

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.240
ago or something, not even that, made it a lot easier to level.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.360
You know, I don't know what it is, and I do have to wrap up and get going soon, but I

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.820
will say this about Druid is that what's amazing about that class is it's one of the last classes

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.180
I tried playing in WoW, and I think the reason I've stuck with it so long is that you really

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.760
can do a little bit of everything as a Druid, and that's why I have so much fun with it.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:59.360
Because I can spam Moonfire or whatever, but then I can heal, or in a pinch I can flip

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.120
in a bear form and tank, even though I'm not very good at it because I'm spec'd for balance.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.280
But you know, it's kind of interesting.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.240
So yeah, well I know how fun Druid is.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.320
I got one at level 45 at 2.3.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.960
Now you need to take it a little higher.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:24.680
They were speaking about what was the New Year's promises or stuff, and my problem is

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:30.200
that I will say that I will get one character at level 70, but then I just realized that

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:38.360
there's this new MMO that's been announced that's called Warhammer Age of Reckoning,

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:52.520
which is highly anticipated in my ranks, which is Weehoo.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.120
Well it sounds like it could be a big year into 2008.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.900
Hopefully we don't neglect to mention that at this year's end special, or we might get

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.000
another call berating us.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.440
Anyway, we've got to wrap up.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.360
I don't mind letting the international calls go on a long time, though, because I know

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:12.400
you've got to stay up very, very late to listen to our program, and we appreciate it.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400
But thank you so much.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:19.000
Do you have any other quick final thoughts, things you want to share with our listeners?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I don't know.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.920
Just keep on the way to the show.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.040
It's really one of the greatest I have heard so far.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040
Well thank you.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040
I appreciate that.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.240
Hats off for you.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.080
Appreciate it very much.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.640
Thank you so much for staying up and listening to us, a true fan.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.280
Take care, buddy.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:50.880
It is actually my second attempt in listening to you live.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.560
I'm usually not, well since it's the hour, difference is such a huge difference.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:01.120
One of these days, we're going to have to do a show at noon to give our British, not

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.280
just British, but overseas listeners a break, you know, everybody over in those time zones,

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280
you know.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.280
Maybe we'll have to.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280
Sweden, Denmark, all of them.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280
All right.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280
I've got to let you go.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.640
Thanks so much for the call, though.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.480
We love hearing from the international folks.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480
It's awesome.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.760
We'll do one more call if you've got any other calls coming in.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760
Hi.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760
Who's this?

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.760
Hey, it's Ron.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760
What's up, everybody?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760
Hey.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760
How you doing, Rama?

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.760
I'm doing good.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.000
I'm finally recovering from my holidays, and so how about you guys?

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I'm doing fine.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.160
Thank you for the card, by the way, on a personal note.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.160
Hey, no problem.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.440
Jamie, did you get your card yet?

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.620
I have to check the mail.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.240
We have a pile of it, and I've been sort of too sick to look at anything.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.960
You know what's hilarious, Rama?

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.300
Your car actually got wet because of the storms.

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.640
The rain got in my mailbox.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.960
Isn't that crazy?

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
No.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.840
That happened to Dan's friend, Will.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:53.000
He was expecting the title to his truck, and he found it floating in the gutter.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Oh, my God.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.240
Well, it wasn't that bad.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.480
It's just that the wind actually blew open the little flap, and water got in there.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.480
It's crazy.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.480
So, anyway, sorry, Rama.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.480
Enough about me boo-hooing.

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.480
What's on your mind?

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.480
Not much.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.480
I'll make this brief.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.960
I finally got a chance to play Rock Band.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.760
Oh, what did you think of Rock Band?

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.760
It is great.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.760
It has got to be one of the greatest games I've played all year.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.480
I am probably one of the only people on the planet that thinks that Guitar Hero 3 has

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.880
a better song list than Rock Band.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880
I don't know why.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.280
I'm just not as into the songs in Rock Band.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.560
Although, I will say, Rock Band has some great download songs.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.400
I actually like that Attack song a lot, the one you told me to get.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.000
I actually really like that song.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.160
Rock Band's growing on me, but here's my question, because I was just thinking about this earlier

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160
today.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.180
I know it's your call and everything, but I'm deflecting.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:46.440
What do you think they could do for Rock Band 2?

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.360
I have more instruments.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.160
A keyboard would be nice for Rock Band 2.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.480
That I would like to see happen.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.760
You know what I think they should do for Rock Band 2?

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.000
Not have a Rock Band 2.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.120
I think they should come out with Pop Band.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:06.520
And I think in Pop Band they should get rid of maybe the guitar, lose the guitar and put

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.860
the keyboard in instead or something.

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.360
Or lose the bass and put it in the keyboard.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.360
I don't know.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.960
But I would love to see them do a Pop Band game, although I don't know how that would

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960
go over.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.560
Well, if they do a Rock Band 2, maybe one of the controls could be a double axe handle

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560
controller.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.240
That would be pretty rad to have, because that's what my character has.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.440
I have a giant double axe controller with a big unicorn on it, because you can put stickers

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.440
on a guitar.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.440
So I put a big unicorn on it.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.000
It's awesome.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Dan has the tattoo of the snake coming out of the pants.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Nice.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.720
And every time he shows it off, he goes, what's a trouser snake?

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.120
SSJ100 Matt says Polka Band, and Dark Knight says, I gotta have cowbells?

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.120
If there's a Polka Band, it's gotta be Weird Al.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.960
I think I was telling you about this the other day, that our friend was, while she was highly

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:04.000
intoxicated, by the way, walking around with a cup and a pencil playing cowbell.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.960
That's great.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.960
So as a long time, because I know you've been a long time fan of Konami's Bimani series

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.080
and DDR and all that stuff, and I know that's how you kind of first came to our station.

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:23.200
What do you think Konami could do to kind of step it up and give Harmonix a little competition?

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.000
Well, actually bring over more of the Bimani games and fine-tune it more for American audiences

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.880
instead of- Did we lose him?

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880
Hello?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880
Oh, I'm right here.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.880
Sorry.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.880
Sorry.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.800
Fine-tune it for American audiences instead of-

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.400
Instead of putting in rehashes of some of the Japanese songs, like with DDR.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.600
Since I enjoy DDR, I would like to see more American songs in the game.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:55.000
That's just me personally, but I know a lot of the die-hard to leave it the way it is.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.880
Have you heard about that new Konami Bimani game?

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.560
It looks like it's Ju-Beat, but it's pronounced differently.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560
I think it's U-Beat.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560
Yeah, U-Beat.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Have you heard about U-Beat?

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.880
No, I have not.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.160
It's a new Bimani game that's coming out over there.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:15.240
It was just location tested a couple weeks ago, and it looks like it uses 16 monitors

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.240
as the buttons.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.240
I don't know.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.560
It looked like a funky version of Whac-A-Mole to me.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.560
Yeah.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.560
Isn't that kind of what it looked like?

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.560
It was like Whac-A-Mole to music.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.560
It's like a touch screen or something.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.280
That might be kind of interesting.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.280
That would be freaking awesome.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.360
Except how can you play that on a home console?

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.180
So it's something that's only going to be in arcades, if anything.

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.180
Pretty much.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:36.520
One of the things I've noticed is that when me and my roommate, when we play Guitar Hero,

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:40.360
it's like, eh, eh, we have to trade off controllers back and forth.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.920
There's just more than one person here.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.760
I mean with Rock Band, my friend brought it up, it was like for the Christmas party, it

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.120
was like the ultimate party game.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.360
You have a lot of people, you got WarioWare, you got the Mario parties, but you break out

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.060
Rock Band, everybody will just show up and you start playing, you're switching off controllers

01:26:58.060 --> 01:26:59.060
back and forth.

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:03.800
You're just getting together, having a good time, and well, when we have Rock Band, we

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:09.880
called it Rockstar because right on the other side of the room, we have all the alcohols,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.280
all the mixers all set up, so we were definitely having fun with it.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.640
I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the chat room and of course Dark Tetsuya's got to go and

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.920
be smart and says a DS version would work for U-Beat.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:28.600
Anyhow, Rama, I got to let you go, wrap up the show here, any quick final thoughts?

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.800
Two quick things.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.520
My game of the year was Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass, and worst game of the year, Role

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.440
vs. SmackDown 08.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.440
Why those two?

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.240
For me to get into a game, you have to take my full attention.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.720
Any game that can help me kill a 45-minute train ride from homework vice versa is definitely

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.560
up in my book, and Phantom Hourglass was one of the few DS games that were able to have

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560
me do that.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.440
As for Role vs. SmackDown 08, I'm an average wrestling fan, I just didn't like the fact

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.000
that they took so much out of the Wii version compared to the other versions of the game.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.360
Basically, the Wii got the gimped version of the game.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.640
That's why it gets worst game of the year.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.040
I just had to ask because you're one of the two people who didn't say Yaris, so I just

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.040
had to ask.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.040
I don't have a 360 yet.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.040
Ah, there you go.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.200
All right, well, DJ Rama asks, we got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.200
us always.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200
Take care.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.200
All right, you too.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.200
Bye-bye.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.200
Bye.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.200
That's going to do it for calls tonight.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.200
We've had a lot of very long calls tonight, but that's all right.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.080
We heard we had some callers we haven't heard from in a while, callers we hear from regularly,

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.880
Rama, and a caller from overseas that we never heard from before who stayed up very, very,

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.080
very late to listen to our program.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.280
It's quarter to six over there, right?

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.160
We ought to let him go to bed, so we probably should wrap things up.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.280
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.720
And Dark Sakura, we'll start with you, your final thought.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.460
Bye.

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.960
My final thought is I'm going to get a bug lamp for this room and every time it goes

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.520
bzzt, I'm going to laugh.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.520
Loki.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.120
Big rigs over the road racing is really, really, really bad.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.760
All right.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.760
I'll take your word for it because I am not going to play it, although not as bad as I

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760
thought I would be.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.760
All right.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.800
I think there's some where those Wii conspiracy games are even worse.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.920
Thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920
radio.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920
We appreciate it.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.600
We would be nowhere without you guys and your word of mouth.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.880
So if you like what you've heard, please tell two people about our show, spread the word

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.880
about Orange Launch Radio.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.000
If you tell two people, then slowly we'll take over the world because we don't have

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.780
any magazines or websites to get million views a month that we can advertise on.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.280
We literally broadcast out of my garage.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.220
So it's independent radio at its finest.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:48.000
If you don't feel so inclined to tell people, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.320
or Digg or Yahoo podcasts or any of those sites because that works too.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.120
Anyhow, thank you guys so much for tuning in this week.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:01.840
Next week we will be back and we'll have more gaming news and more stuff to come in the

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.540
year 2008.

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.800
Hopefully some surprises here on the program.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.900
I was trying to book some guests for the upcoming shows.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.080
So hopefully we'll have some of those in the next few weeks.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.560
So more to come.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.240
Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.440
She's Dark Sakura.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.520
He's Loki.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.520
And we're out.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.040
