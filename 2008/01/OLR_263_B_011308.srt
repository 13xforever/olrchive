00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

3
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:19,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:26,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this part B of our program.

5
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:29,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

6
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:39,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there's some big news coming from Nintendo Power talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.

7
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:50,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently the game's titled Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,030
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, what do I know?

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a bad thing?

10
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,792
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG?

11
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:58,532
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

12
00:00:58,912 --> 00:00:59,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

13
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:03,240
[SPEAKER_04]: A, Bioware didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:03,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

15
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,141
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree that it doesn't matter.

16
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,102
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if Square does it or, you know.

17
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?

18
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:14,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.

19
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the closest thing I've played to that since.

20
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:17,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss Mario RPG.

21
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,467
[SPEAKER_12]: But the Sonic thing looks pretty good.

22
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:26,489
[SPEAKER_12]: They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.

23
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of neat.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:31,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't know much about it yet, but it should be the next issue, I guess.

27
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:40,558
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.

28
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out, or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?

29
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:52,109
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not done by Sonic Team, it doesn't exist in my universe.

30
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,530
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

32
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:54,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.

33
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:03,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to and one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.

34
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:11,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But some fans are kind of pissed off because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere.

35
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:16,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC, but no love for the Nintendo Wii.

36
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:26,051
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.

37
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:27,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Cue the petition!

38
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:33,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost immediately an internet petition went up, bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.

39
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:36,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're taking a page out of Konami's book there.

40
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:41,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then we'll make the product.

41
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.

42
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.

43
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:53,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, it will largely depend on what the fans want for the future Bionic Commando.

44
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,573
[SPEAKER_04]: If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.

45
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:05,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's got people very happy.

46
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:08,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?

47
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

48
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:17,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007 because everybody said it was great, but I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.

49
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:28,717
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a DS version now where you can basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff and sword fight and kill people and stuff.

50
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers and picking pockets and doing other stuff.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

52
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:38,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use a stylus for interrogating.

53
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:39,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you do?

54
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:40,717
[SPEAKER_04]: You just poke them?

55
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke, poke, poke.

56
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me.

57
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke, poke, poke.

58
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you talk into the speaker part and go, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

59
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:49,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that.

60
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game.

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

62
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,063
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be interesting.

63
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,224
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be kind of cute.

64
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be a prequel.

65
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:58,165
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks kind of neat.

66
00:03:58,645 --> 00:03:58,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

67
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,987
[SPEAKER_12]: The Nyko Wireless Nunchuck.

68
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember we talked about that a little bit ago.

69
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:08,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty useless device, I think.

70
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:14,940
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess if that little cord really bothers you, then great.

71
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,822
[SPEAKER_12]: You can buy this.

72
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:19,304
[SPEAKER_04]: That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.

73
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

74
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,407
[SPEAKER_04]: How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?

75
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

76
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:24,067
$30.

77
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

78
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:31,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I can deal with it for $30.

79
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:36,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, though, it did win a CNET CES Gaming Award

80
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,926
[SPEAKER_12]: for Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.

81
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:44,027
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I forgot to talk about this this week, my game week.

82
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:50,329
[SPEAKER_12]: I played some Ghost Squad and I bought those Nyko Perfect Shots.

83
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,409
[SPEAKER_12]: The ones that look like the little pistols.

84
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are fucking awesome.

85
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:05,052
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing about Ghost Squad and why I love the game even more, they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper so that you don't use the B button as a trigger, you use the Z button so that you're actually firing it correctly.

86
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,012
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

87
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:15,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters, will look to Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.

88
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.

89
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.

90
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, because you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.

91
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,170
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was I going to say about this?

92
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,990
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they get for getting this award?

93
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get a trophy or a plaque or just internet fame?

94
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:32,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Internet fame.

95
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:32,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

96
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about this device on the program.

97
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I want another trophy.

98
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a 2008 trophy.

99
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:01,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you had to go all the way to LA and you had to meet Adam Curry, poor you.

100
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,983
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.

101
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,946
[SPEAKER_07]: With his Bon Jovi hair.

102
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a new 2008 trophy.

103
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So what award can we win?

104
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,211
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.

105
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to look into that to make that happen.

106
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the year is young, and there are the Darwin Awards.

107
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,879
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit of a permanent solution.

108
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give ourselves a stupid award?

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do something really stupid?

110
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:33,603
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?

111
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Robway says, make your own awards show.

112
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are podcasts out there that make their own awards show.

113
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, the Gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.

114
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: You think we could team up with Sony?

115
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,332
[SPEAKER_04]: They got nothing going for them, right?

116
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, forget it.

117
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with the gaming news.

118
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.

119
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:59,962
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.

120
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:01,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could use that too.

121
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit.

122
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:12,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th, if a new one-up column is to be believed.

123
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:17,537
[SPEAKER_04]: The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers both in Japan and abroad.

124
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,080
[SPEAKER_12]: News Trophy

126
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:24,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of airtime, if that, and I'll say something brief.

127
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:25,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so much fun.

128
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:26,670
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

129
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,452
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news, it's on YouTube.

130
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.

131
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:36,194
[SPEAKER_12]: They interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes, and that's what they used.

132
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:37,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's so much fun.

133
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

134
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:40,964
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

135
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:02,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.

136
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get a Golden Globe.

137
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:08,087
[SPEAKER_05]: You get an aluminum foil ball.

138
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and spray-painted gold.

139
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,649
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there you have it.

140
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Orange Lounge Radio Orangies, even though they're gold.

141
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:16,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

142
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:21,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.

143
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight.

144
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:23,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

145
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:26,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag.

146
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And the envelope, please.

147
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wins Orangie number one?

148
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You're funny, Rob.

149
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is from TJ.

150
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:37,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, That's a good excuse.

151
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:38,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I have other crap to do.

152
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:38,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

153
00:09:58,151 --> 00:09:58,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Jenga the Game

154
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.

155
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:29,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.

156
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:30,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just me.

157
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

158
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So, next email.

159
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:43,160
[SPEAKER_07]: With Bioshock, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Wii Play, Super Mario Galaxies, and an iPhone, this must be the best Christmas ever.

160
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know this email's a bit late, but I felt I must comment on how especially kick-ass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.

161
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this the same email or a new one?

162
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:51,648
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a different one.

163
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:52,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, who sent this one in?

164
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:54,469
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's from Osfer.

165
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:55,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

166
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.

167
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,572
[SPEAKER_07]: As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.

168
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:07,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun to play and controls are nothing short of sexy.

169
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:13,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies.

170
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.

171
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:17,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.

172
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:18,798
[SPEAKER_07]: What's Chapter 4, Rob?

173
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 4 is fucking epic

174
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:46,149
[SPEAKER_07]: You play the game to experience it yourself and then watch your jaw hit the floor.

175
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?

176
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:51,375
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

177
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:54,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Not live, no.

178
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:58,063
[SPEAKER_04]: You can listen to the podcast from any touchtone phone.

179
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:00,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something, I want to say like,

180
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:02,689
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do it from a touch-tone phone?

181
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a regular phone?

182
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear the podcast on a phone.

183
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,632
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some service out there, free service, because I know one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.

184
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:12,813
[SPEAKER_04]: She might have signed our podcast up for it.

185
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:13,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

186
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:14,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

187
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,015
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.

188
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:17,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up.

189
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,637
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.

190
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:25,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work, but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.

191
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading, as always.

192
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:29,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

193
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.

194
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: This email comes from Stan.

195
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there.

196
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.

197
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes me wonder why I wasn't listening to you folks before.

198
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:53,106
[SPEAKER_07]: After listening to your year-end wrap-up show, I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.

199
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:53,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do y'all?

200
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit.

201
00:12:58,369 --> 00:12:58,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

202
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:00,907
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys had a booth or something.

203
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:05,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.

204
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we usually do when we do our panels.

205
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:10,734
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, then taping something while there.

206
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.

207
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, actually, that's more what we do is we do the recording.

208
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:20,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone else in Chicago listens to your show, but I'm sure...

209
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,970
[SPEAKER_07]: They're here somewhere, just never looked.

210
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur 3?

211
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I could really use a challenge.

212
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:32,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get Soul Calibur 3 because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.

213
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Soul Calibur 3, but maybe that's just me.

214
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:42,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs to be played during your music portions.

215
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:43,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I read that right?

216
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:49,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands, I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.

217
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a rock band set up.

218
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:57,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride Saxophone Ensemble and a few of us are big gamers and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.

219
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:03,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks, especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.

220
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:09,371
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can guess, a sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.

221
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:18,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tinkered around with arrangements before, but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience, then sure, all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.

222
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So how about it?

223
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?

224
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:23,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say so, dude.

225
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I played saxophone.

226
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not.

227
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:32,640
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation, meaning like 10-minute songs are a little much.

228
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,522
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most.

229
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while.

230
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:42,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have something radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat, I don't see why not.

231
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:43,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't see why not.

232
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet, so I don't see why not.

233
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:51,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

234
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:52,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much.

235
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:53,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great work.

236
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I really get a kick if this was read on the air.

237
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:56,934
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days I'll call in.

238
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

239
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,216
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

240
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a kick.

241
00:14:59,137 --> 00:14:59,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got an orangey.

242
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for emailing us tonight.

243
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,532
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I want to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.

244
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:08,855
[SPEAKER_04]: The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone, it's called Podlines.

245
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:13,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we don't like totally endorse this because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.

246
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:14,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

247
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:15,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done this in a long time.

248
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:16,599
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the phone number.

249
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's area code 650-523-6855.

250
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:24,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.

251
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what happens because I don't know what happens when you call this.

252
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:30,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens or if we get an ad or what.

253
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:38,304
[SPEAKER_04]: OneRingyDingy And it's busy.

254
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:40,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we've been taken off the air.

255
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

256
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he sent in another part to his email.

257
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:45,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

258
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Oops, I forgot, but have any of you watched Street Fighter the later years?

259
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:49,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have.

260
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so damn funny.

261
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:54,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2 will appreciate this.

262
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:58,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.

263
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:58,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, gamers.

264
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay.

265
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:03,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I've watched some of it.

266
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty darn funny.

267
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:06,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

268
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:16,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And last, well, we actually got an email from our good buddy Rob, the two Bs, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.

269
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:17,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

270
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.

271
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:21,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

272
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable cord.

273
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,983
[SPEAKER_07]: for one of his video game pads.

274
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:35,086
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't said what the system was or anything.

275
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:41,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It said that the guy was playing a game and the father was trying to get him to stop.

276
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,754
[SPEAKER_07]: He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.

277
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:52,720
[SPEAKER_07]: The dad took out the power cable and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.

278
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:56,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

279
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.

280
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,560
[SPEAKER_04]: As you should be.

281
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?

282
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

283
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,966
[SPEAKER_04]: You were just mad because he was playing right to speak.

284
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:09,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.

285
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said last email.

286
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and.

287
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fine.

288
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:15,713
[SPEAKER_04]: One more email then.

289
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:16,453
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's important.

290
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Belgium.

291
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:17,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

292
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:18,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

293
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

294
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:24,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming and I am a PC gamer.

295
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,251
[SPEAKER_07]: It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.

296
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:34,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say that I would appreciate very much if you could do a show at noon in your time zone like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.

297
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.

298
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to do that sometime so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.

299
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I always download the podcast to my PSP, so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.

300
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live, it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.

301
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, an interesting story perhaps.

302
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.

303
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:08,384
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.

304
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:12,727
[SPEAKER_07]: With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007, the PS3 sold the most, closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.

305
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:23,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360 is the least popular console and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.

306
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,968
[SPEAKER_07]: After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.

307
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.

308
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made...

309
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,502
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money on a next-generation console.

310
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:46,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the feeling the Xbox Never was a really big success here, and so many people are more inclined to play PlayStation 3, although the 360 might have the best games so far.

311
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the casual gamers are of course going for the Wii over here too.

312
00:18:56,448 --> 00:19:05,997
[SPEAKER_07]: If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose, because it is the most innovative system and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.

313
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Gritz, G-R-T-Z.

314
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's in closing, his name is Martin.

315
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:15,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for the email.

316
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?

317
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:20,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a three-day weekend coming up.

318
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon, though.

319
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get the word out, you know, so people know, you know.

320
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

321
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,399
[SPEAKER_04]: A three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.

322
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,660
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have Marissa up here, too.

323
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

324
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,441
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have Marissa up here, too.

325
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be good.

326
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.

327
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have to check our schedules because I know around, you know, Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know, things might get busy.

328
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

329
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometime in February.

330
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:47,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.

331
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done it before, like for pre-taping.

332
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?

333
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:53,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not.

334
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:54,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not either.

335
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We will make that happen for our overseas listeners.

336
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,211
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.

337
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day week is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?

338
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February?

339
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,153
[SPEAKER_04]: President's Day?

340
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:08,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe so.

341
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:09,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can make it happen around then.

342
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:10,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

343
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:11,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check our schedules.

344
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:12,475
Okay.

345
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:12,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

346
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with one and only Loki.

347
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:24,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

348
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:33,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that, there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it.

349
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,881
[SPEAKER_12]: One of which was shown off at CES.

350
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:43,907
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of

351
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Rock Band Stage Kit GameStop GameStop

352
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:29,570
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out around June for $100 and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show This actually sounds kind of epic You know what though?

353
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,635
[SPEAKER_12]: If I still have $200 in store credit around that time, I'll pick it up.

354
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,717
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be awesome.

355
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:38,159
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do it during the show.

356
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:39,902
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just leave it on during the show.

357
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:40,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

358
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Launch Radio one night.

359
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the webcam's back by then.

360
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:45,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

361
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

362
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:50,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Light Show and Smoke.

363
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:51,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me not to be here for that show.

364
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:52,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, seriously.

365
00:21:53,154 --> 00:22:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can imagine just how, you know, it looks one way on the box, but then when you actually do it in person, it probably... It probably smells like farts or something.

366
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.

367
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:05,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, though.

368
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:10,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to look like somebody... We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.

369
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you do this?

370
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, why would you play this, like, in your living room with smoke and stuff here?

371
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't see the screen anymore.

372
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,303
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's filling up the house full of smoke.

373
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Macman in our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com says, Does it come with some weed, too?

374
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,805
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the true rocker experience.

375
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:28,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

376
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:32,627
[SPEAKER_12]: It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.

377
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,628
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, you know, it's a pretty well-known company.

378
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, but is it $100 funny?

379
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:41,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, how many of these are they really going to sell?

380
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me put it this way.

381
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,812
[SPEAKER_12]: If it is, like, an actual smoke machine, I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that, but...

382
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, you gotta, like, buy the liquid smoke for it, and, you know, that's expensive.

383
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:56,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine!

384
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:58,696
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell are you gonna be doing playing with a smoke machine?

385
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:02,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.

386
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

387
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be funny.

388
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be funny, too, just to do for one show, but Loki, $100 funny.

389
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:10,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

390
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:11,464
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all store credit.

391
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, is it $100 funny?

392
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I need to know.

393
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:18,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of the Judgement instead.

394
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:23,338
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

395
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:52,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.

396
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.

397
00:23:56,068 --> 00:24:03,033
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game.

398
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,974
[SPEAKER_04]: on the DS was going to interact with the ride.

399
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:11,377
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride, you'd unlock a new character or something.

400
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:20,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to kind of go into the park and actually get this, especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.

401
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:26,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of, I guess, application that would download to your DS.

402
00:24:26,986 --> 00:24:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a tour of the park, basically.

403
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:31,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What you could do, imagine this.

404
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you use your...

405
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles

406
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:04,598
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hold on.

407
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:05,359
[SPEAKER_04]: These are hot.

408
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,139
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just out of the oven.

409
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:06,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

410
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,801
[SPEAKER_04]: The show has been interrupted for cookies.

411
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:10,982
Oh, my God.

412
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:12,182
They're so good.

413
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:13,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting to try one.

414
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hot.

415
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

416
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:16,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know they're hot.

417
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

418
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Snickerdoodles are, like, the best cookies ever.

419
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:19,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those are good.

420
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:20,587
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a snickerdoodle?

421
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:22,608
[SPEAKER_07]: They're cinnamon sugar cookies.

422
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,208
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cinnamon.

423
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: They taste like... Thank you, Katie.

424
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she can hear.

425
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:26,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

426
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:27,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

427
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:28,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, where were we?

428
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:29,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm, cookie goodness.

429
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Disney.

430
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:31,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

431
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:33,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

432
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,076
[SPEAKER_06]: How to manage your weight right.

433
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

434
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:38,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can, like, click on an area and see, you know, how long the weight is.

435
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:43,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually go, like, let's say you could click on it.

436
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylus, obviously, right?

437
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:53,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney World, and you could see what their menu is.

438
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:56,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.

439
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:02,005
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.

440
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to call Disney Dining.

441
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:44,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Something else that's really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now is that Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games.

442
00:26:47,015 --> 00:27:01,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games, which is Peggle Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

443
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,273
[SPEAKER_07]: and Portal First Slice.

444
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:16,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And First Slice is actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.

445
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:22,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.

446
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's kind of cool.

447
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:27,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

448
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:32,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So that you can have real life versus competitions and things like that.

449
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:32,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

450
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, chewing on a cookie.

451
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:38,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookies are freaking good.

452
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:39,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways.

453
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:42,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

454
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:55,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.

455
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:03,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how much they're really entitled to.

456
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.

457
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,781
[SPEAKER_12]: One day worth of outages is approximately $13.7.

458
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:15,404
[SPEAKER_12]: So for about the six days of outages, that's $0.82.

459
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:18,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.

460
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:29,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.

461
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:34,029
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.

462
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft.

463
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:39,231
[SPEAKER_04]: 82 cents.

464
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:41,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

465
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.

466
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:47,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it.

467
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,237
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're getting a way better deal this way.

468
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:52,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but at the same time...

469
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,959
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?

470
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.

471
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,961
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?

472
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

473
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't.

474
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: But, anyway.

475
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:07,663
[SPEAKER_04]: No, DarkTestSuyu, you're right.

476
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:10,944
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTestSuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.

477
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:11,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, I'm not.

478
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:12,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

479
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:16,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.

480
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,686
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't owe me anything.

481
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:19,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But a hug.

482
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:20,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like a hug.

483
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:22,769
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

484
00:29:51,781 --> 00:29:52,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who is to blame.

485
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough, just another person, you know, trying to knock video games for making kids fat.

486
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.

487
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know who he's the CEO of?

488
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:25,185
[SPEAKER_04]: McDonald's.

489
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all their blame game thing, trying to, you know, get the...

490
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:38,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing off of them, you know, especially since they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.

491
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:42,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.

492
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo 64 play zones and stuff.

493
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:52,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's not like, you know, granted, he's in the UK, he's in America.

494
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:52,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

495
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Here kid, go play with some old games.

496
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:27,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Do Not Make Kids Fat, or McFlurries and Cones.

497
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:49,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And even, and this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.

498
00:31:49,411 --> 00:32:01,388
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym and it tricked her body right back into, you know, losing again because it's like,

499
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:02,152
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

500
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

501
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:56,143
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever.

502
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:59,786
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.

503
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.

504
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:03,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done that before.

505
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.

506
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.

507
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:12,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So regardless, just saying, it's not you eat it occasionally and not every day.

508
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not where you eat.

509
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what you do and what you eat.

510
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the where, the who, any of that.

511
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what you're doing.

512
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:26,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nobody else's fault but your own.

513
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:30,561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I see it.

514
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just be fat and be beautiful.

515
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:33,342
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're happy?

516
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:34,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Be BB.

517
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:37,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman, or a BBM.

518
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,466
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

519
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:45,150
[SPEAKER_07]: People should be happy the way they are, and I think that a lot of this crap that people go through for...

520
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:51,207
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that is just people being unhappy with themselves.

521
00:33:51,247 --> 00:34:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself, and I know that I don't always do the same thing myself, but the moment that you are happy with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body is going to follow.

522
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you won't care.

523
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites a certain sort of rage within us that can only be...

524
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Crushed by us venting our FUs of the week.

525
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:32,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I accidentally used the old song tonight, but we'll deal.

526
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:32,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

527
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

528
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:36,236
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Rob for using the old music.

529
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:41,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day.

530
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had sort of a disappointing day.

531
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And disappointing is a very good word for it.

532
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:51,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had multiple in a row disappointments.

533
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,196
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want an iMac.

534
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:58,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So F you to me not having an iMac.

535
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go next, if you're done.

536
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: My F you goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today.

537
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first F you to me for putting in the wrong song.

538
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:10,530
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to this cup of coffee for getting cold.

539
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And then F you to me going to the store today without my wallet.

540
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:23,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God I didn't do that.

541
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:29,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're picturing, you know, me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because thank God I was looking for, um,

542
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:30,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

543
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

544
00:35:52,510 --> 00:36:03,280
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to the muscle that's pulled in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.

545
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts when you laugh?

546
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,281
[SPEAKER_12]: It hurts when I laugh.

547
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:13,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I would give you a bit of advice if you were going to rub it clockwise because otherwise you will get constipated.

548
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

549
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

550
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had trouble going lately?

551
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,252
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not had trouble going.

552
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:19,073
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

553
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:24,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion goes clockwise.

554
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually block your digestion by going counterclockwise.

555
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:29,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

556
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:30,578
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn something new every day.

557
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:31,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You really do.

558
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:31,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

559
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:34,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not talk about colon.

560
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.

561
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that a trick I can play on my friends, is run up to people and rub their bellies counterclockwise and go, ha ha, you're constipated?

562
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,273
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it takes everyone.

563
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being a little silly.

564
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:55,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Macman in chat says, it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make Loki laugh.

565
00:36:55,796 --> 00:37:00,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 deaths video and that was painful enough.

566
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put my advice in the chat room now.

567
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:03,839
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

568
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:07,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you need to do your next story, DarkSakura, before you get to advice.

569
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Games first.

570
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Constipation later.

571
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:21,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, coming out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have StarTropics for NES.

572
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It was released on the 11th.

573
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:32,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so we are getting that.

574
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they are getting that

575
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,101
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.

576
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

577
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:42,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a Master System.

578
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:45,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, it was not on Master System.

579
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe it was a Genesis game.

580
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:48,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

581
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:48,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

582
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:51,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Any news yet on... No, I think they're back.

583
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.

584
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?

585
00:37:58,827 --> 00:37:59,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

586
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,127
[SPEAKER_04]: In U.S.?

587
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:01,427
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

588
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:03,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

589
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,257
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, more news

590
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:39,636
[SPEAKER_12]: flat out refusing to give EGM access to early previews or reviews.

591
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:50,639
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, basically he said, you know, warning readers that they're going to get little, late, or no coverage of, you know, these three companies' games.

592
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:55,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And they won't treat these products or companies any differently.

593
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,201
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll just cover them to their best ability without their support.

594
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, after all, they're writing for the reader, not them.

595
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:10,214
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of interesting that he, you know, planned out, called them out.

596
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:17,599
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies because, you know, after the whole Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of heard them.

597
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:22,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of support the calling out of these companies.

598
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:25,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't know.

599
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:33,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is like such huge news, but I think it is kind of big because, you know, somebody's kind of finally taken a step and saying, you know,

600
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:38,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call them out on what they're doing and the fact that

601
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

602
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:11,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative, you know, feedback for them.

603
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:19,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but, you know, and this isn't the first, you know, companies to do this.

604
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:26,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from, you know, EGM as well, and now they're back supporting them.

605
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,610
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

606
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:35,591
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game is going to be exposed to less people, you know,

607
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:38,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Coverage is coverage.

608
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,610
[SPEAKER_12]: You may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.

609
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:48,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind of ruin it.

610
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not be... For instance...

611
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,216
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

612
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

613
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not necessarily Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.

614
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:35,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It is pretty bad.

615
00:41:36,408 --> 00:41:37,389
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't really reviews.

616
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:49,120
[SPEAKER_12]: It was based on previews and stuff because they were being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these bugs in the game and hopefully they get worked out because otherwise it's going to suck.

617
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's an honest opinion.

618
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:56,662
[SPEAKER_12]: And they realize that it's not finished yet, and that's why they phrased it in such a way.

619
00:41:56,742 --> 00:42:01,285
[SPEAKER_12]: But apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you talk about our game, blah, blah, blah.

620
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,547
[SPEAKER_12]: They only want glowing reviews.

621
00:42:03,627 --> 00:42:10,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit it to the magazine, if you don't want anyone doing that.

622
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:13,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.

623
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:15,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do it all like press releases or something like that.

624
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Then everybody can own a game magazine.

625
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:20,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.

626
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:21,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

627
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:28,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when I say public, I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know, literally the public at trade shows and things.

628
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.

629
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:31,073
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

630
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,854
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good customer service, right?

631
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:34,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

632
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:36,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Good customer service.

633
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:42,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're in a PR department, then your customer is the press.

634
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So be careful who you have representing.

635
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:45,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

636
00:42:46,992 --> 00:43:09,945
[SPEAKER_07]: and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer service classes when I worked on the phone, is that for every one person that is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends.

637
00:43:10,565 --> 00:43:15,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like dropping a boulder in a lake or something.

638
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:16,372
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell's wrong with you?

639
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:41,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.

640
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:42,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be nice.

641
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:03,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job and it's a very challenging job.

642
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:07,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to try and help you.

643
00:44:07,788 --> 00:44:08,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're being douchebags.

644
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.

645
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And do not ask for the supervisor first.

646
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:15,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them a chance.

647
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

648
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?

649
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:22,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that was a stupid prank.

650
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:23,418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different.

651
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:25,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Much different.

652
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

653
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:28,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's talk about something else.

654
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:31,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the Diamond Card?

655
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you have one of these, Loki?

656
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do have one of these.

657
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:39,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the Xbox Live Diamond Card, which gets you a discount.

658
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:41,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever used the Diamond Card, out of curiosity?

659
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:41,773
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

660
00:44:42,294 --> 00:44:42,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.

661
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:45,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.

662
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:47,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it won't be free much longer.

663
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:50,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.

664
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the Diamond Card program is moving over to a new...

665
00:44:58,122 --> 00:44:58,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of system.

666
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Passport Unlimited.

667
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:01,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

668
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:14,313
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what you're... Unless you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's not very good.

669
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:17,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.

670
00:45:17,755 --> 00:45:21,477
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing really... I don't know what works for me.

671
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:22,818
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have one because it's neat.

672
00:45:23,629 --> 00:45:28,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.

673
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.

674
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:32,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee.

675
00:45:33,536 --> 00:45:35,978
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think a lot of people will be.

676
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:38,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why you would need to pay a $7 fee.

677
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:41,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

678
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:46,785
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, HitStun in the chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave & Buster's.

679
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:48,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty fun place.

680
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:50,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a second, though.

681
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:52,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just think about this for a second.

682
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,250
[SPEAKER_12]: How are these...

683
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:01,245
[SPEAKER_12]: businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not.

684
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:03,346
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just going to have your card.

685
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:04,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have a barcode?

686
00:46:05,548 --> 00:46:05,688
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

687
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.

688
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:11,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Expiration date?

689
00:46:11,873 --> 00:46:14,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way.

690
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's getting out the card.

691
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,077
[SPEAKER_12]: He's getting out his wallet.

692
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:17,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

693
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:17,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

694
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

695
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:21,618
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they going to know?

696
00:46:21,898 --> 00:46:25,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they know?

697
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, it has the year on it.

698
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

699
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.

700
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:33,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.

701
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:38,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year.

702
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:39,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me see.

703
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:41,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have an expiration date?

704
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:41,805
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does.

705
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:42,485
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does.

706
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Expiration 507, so there you go.

707
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's how they know.

708
00:46:47,654 --> 00:47:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll send something out to all the retailers to say Those things suck anyways because I remember when that program first came around It took me like six months to get mine So, you know, even if you paid the $7 You're already pissed away half a year So, I don't know Well, alright So, I don't know I'd be curious to see if anybody Does anybody in chat Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?

709
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:15,358
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'd like to know Or get some phone calls on that later Meanwhile, while we await that feedback We'll move on to another story

710
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:26,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle and Bust a Move and Bliss Island for the Xbox 360.

711
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.

712
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:33,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

713
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really played it any.

714
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there's also, I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

715
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:46,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Pagel is fun, actually.

716
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.

717
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:53,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say this about the PopCap games.

718
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played are really addicting and fun.

719
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see people at work playing those games all the time on their breaks and stuff.

720
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:07,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, Pagel was confirmed that it is coming out.

721
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:10,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So PopCap did confirm that one.

722
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:10,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

723
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

724
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:12,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Peggle.

725
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,112
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.

726
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you rate them if they're not?

727
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

728
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

729
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:30,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room except SSJ100 Matt says, I still use my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts.

730
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:32,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's the other thing too.

731
00:48:32,297 --> 00:48:40,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?

732
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:42,253
[SPEAKER_12]: They might not, or they may just not care.

733
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So, try it.

734
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:51,516
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive.

735
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,577
[SPEAKER_12]: You may be wondering, what the hell am I going to use this for?

736
00:48:54,117 --> 00:49:04,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out for a while now.

737
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,502
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.

738
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:38,899
[SPEAKER_12]: 5 gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive oh and by the way that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes so before you can play your game you must waste 40 minutes awesome and I know it's not the only game that has you install it to it's hard drive like for example Ratchet and Clank Ridge Racer has the option to do that I'm pretty sure Oblivion does and a bunch of other ones

739
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:42,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

740
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:47,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?

741
00:49:47,548 --> 00:49:47,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

742
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it save that much time by doing so?

743
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:50,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

744
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:51,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

745
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:54,794
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.

746
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:55,855
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn, that game is great.

747
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:56,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

748
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:58,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.

749
00:49:59,618 --> 00:50:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?

750
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

751
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: At all?

752
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:03,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they gotta be making it.

753
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:08,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.

754
00:50:08,857 --> 00:50:09,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

755
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:10,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go back and play.

756
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not Oblivion.

757
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Half-Life 2 or something.

758
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:16,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter 4 when it's released because it looks better and better every day.

759
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:18,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like the look of Street Fighter 4.

760
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:20,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me.

761
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:49,584
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzin has been announced as well but there's some new characters and one of the new ones is Crimson Viper and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine scans that were posted all over the interwebs Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit but with more boobage, like you know King from Art of Fighting and this big pink ponytail but she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her

762
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:51,268
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

763
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:21,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter.

764
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like large-breasted women fighting games.

765
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:25,212
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the first Dead or Alive.

766
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.

767
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.

768
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style.

769
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Never seen in the Street Fighter series.

770
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boobs.

771
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:42,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt that.

772
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:44,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Or probably fighting with her hair.

773
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, wait, wasn't that done before?

774
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:48,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was done before somewhere.

775
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:48,748
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Milia.

776
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:50,543
[SPEAKER_07]: and Guilty Gear.

777
00:51:52,644 --> 00:52:02,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing, at least it's a rumor right now, that there's another Resident Evil arcade game.

778
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:06,251
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.

779
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, there were the Gun Survivor games.

780
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:11,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, those were in the arcade?

781
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:11,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

782
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:12,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, cool.

783
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.

784
00:52:16,121 --> 00:52:21,162
[SPEAKER_07]: That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.

785
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:33,564
[SPEAKER_07]: The voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.

786
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:38,385
[SPEAKER_07]: She said that she really likes playing Jill.

787
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:42,386
[SPEAKER_07]: The quote at the end of what she had to say is,

788
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,194
[SPEAKER_07]: You can bet it'll be on the lookout for the game in arcades there.

789
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:53,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.

790
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:55,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the Gun Survivor games are fun.

791
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:57,988
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit better be coming to a console.

792
00:52:58,429 --> 00:52:59,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the Wii.

793
00:52:59,169 --> 00:52:59,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It should.

794
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.

795
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:07,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii using the gun controller thingy.

796
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:11,997
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.

797
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:16,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't know about Target Terror, but something tells me it's not going to be that good.

798
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:25,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old Gun Survivor games, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?

799
00:53:26,476 --> 00:53:28,217
[SPEAKER_07]: How it had the controller on it?

800
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:41,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game, and you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have your gun.

801
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:46,827
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about how they should do a walkthrough House of the Dead.

802
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,329
[SPEAKER_07]: that use that sort of functionality.

803
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that would work for Gun Survivor.

804
00:53:51,692 --> 00:53:53,934
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.

805
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:56,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

806
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skyplane will be opening soon, by the way.

807
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:02,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call toll-free in the U.S.

808
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:05,535
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

809
00:54:05,595 --> 00:54:08,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype again, Orange Lounge Radio, but one more story before we get to that.

810
00:54:09,178 --> 00:54:14,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the WiiWare service is going to actually come out.

811
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:25,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch date is scheduled,

812
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:29,808
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

813
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,081
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be right up their alley for them to announce something like that.

814
00:54:55,321 --> 00:55:01,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive or something to keep all this crap on that I download.

815
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:05,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.

816
00:55:05,065 --> 00:55:09,467
[SPEAKER_12]: At least allowing you to put them on memory sticks or something like that.

817
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:12,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again.

818
00:55:12,628 --> 00:55:16,490
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the point of having an SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to use it?

819
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,565
[SPEAKER_12]: or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.

820
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?

821
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that a lot, actually.

822
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's silly, but it's fun.

823
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:31,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?

824
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a couple.

825
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of seeing that.

826
00:55:36,892 --> 00:55:39,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.

827
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:42,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.

828
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:46,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.

829
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:47,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

830
00:55:48,926 --> 00:55:52,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.

831
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we've had a problem with our WeConnect.

832
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:55,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

833
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:56,649
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't wanted to.

834
00:55:56,669 --> 00:55:57,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that sucks.

835
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had a hard time updating our software.

836
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:04,592
[SPEAKER_04]: What a bummer.

837
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:11,354
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's open up the Skype line at username OrangeLaunchRadio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

838
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:12,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Skype line is now open.

839
00:56:13,422 --> 00:56:14,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Open for business.

840
00:56:14,402 --> 00:56:17,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.

841
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

842
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:18,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

843
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,665
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Raven Stolfen.

844
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:21,245
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

845
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:24,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I am fine, and I'm so shocked and awed that you got through first somehow.

846
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,487
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a quick finger there dialing in.

847
00:56:27,507 --> 00:56:27,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

848
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:28,547
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

849
00:56:29,308 --> 00:56:29,988
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on my mind?

850
00:56:30,008 --> 00:56:30,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Navarro.

851
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:31,768
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's on my mind.

852
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.

853
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:36,390
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought him up briefly in Part A. What did you want to say?

854
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:38,650
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's a shocker.

855
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,971
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the other guy, Greg Provo left, and now Jeff.

856
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:44,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.

857
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:46,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.

858
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:51,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.

859
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:54,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

860
00:56:54,337 --> 00:57:01,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is just some corporate website and, you know, I mean... True.

861
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:04,962
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have, you know...

862
00:57:05,862 --> 00:57:06,922
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wish I had IGN myself.

863
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:38,424
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think about the editorial from EGM?

864
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that's just a little shocking.

865
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:44,089
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just going like, yeah, F them.

866
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:44,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

867
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, we'll blackball you.

868
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:48,733
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll send you the game.

869
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:49,634
[SPEAKER_09]: We just rate games.

870
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:55,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs to do.

871
00:57:56,246 --> 00:58:07,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was going, rawr, we're going to beat you up, because he was like, we'll review their games anyway, but it just might be slower because, you know, they don't send us the free stuff.

872
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:12,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.

873
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:13,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at what we're doing.

874
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:14,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

875
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I understand.

876
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:19,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not for profit either, and all these guys are, so obviously it's a little different.

877
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:24,161
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you love what you do, you can do it.

878
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:24,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

879
00:58:25,279 --> 00:58:25,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I do.

880
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,701
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand you've got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.

881
00:58:28,982 --> 00:58:30,303
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?

882
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:30,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

883
00:58:31,364 --> 00:58:32,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, one more thing.

884
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:35,567
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking about that four girls finger painting.

885
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:44,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday night, and they kind of dug me.

886
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:47,817
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to get some digs out of me, so I had to watch it live on air.

887
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:50,599
[SPEAKER_09]: This video is really bad, so stay away.

888
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:52,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard things.

889
00:58:53,117 --> 00:58:57,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on PerezHilton.com.

890
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh.

891
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:02,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw his reaction video to it, and it was kind of funny.

892
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:04,163
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one of me now.

893
00:59:04,863 --> 00:59:05,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there really?

894
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:05,964
[SPEAKER_09]: On YouTube?

895
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead, Operator11.

896
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:10,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's on Operator11?

897
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:11,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

898
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:12,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can I find it?

899
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Under my name, just saying return of RavensDolphin.

900
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:18,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, RavensDolphin.

901
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:21,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But how far in the show do I have to look?

902
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:22,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Not far.

903
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:24,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be, like, right there.

904
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:28,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be, like, the second one before the cartoon cast and all that.

905
00:59:28,618 --> 00:59:29,478
[SPEAKER_09]: You can search for it later.

906
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:30,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you the thing.

907
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:32,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you RavensDolphin1 here?

908
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:32,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

909
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm 1.

910
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:35,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Cartoon cast?

911
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about cartoon cast.

912
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Return of RavensDolphin?

913
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.

914
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:41,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.

915
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.

916
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you call it Poop on a Stick?

917
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:46,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of nasty.

918
00:59:47,263 --> 00:59:48,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is nasty!

919
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,684
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, where in the show will I see this?

920
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at the very beginning?

921
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:53,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's only six minutes.

922
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:56,247
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not watching all six minutes.

923
00:59:57,548 --> 01:00:00,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Just speed it up, speed it up, speed it up.

924
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:02,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic, listen to the epic.

925
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:08,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing it right now.

926
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:12,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think he's doing it.

927
01:00:14,016 --> 01:00:15,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, my precious ears.

928
01:00:15,556 --> 01:00:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

929
01:00:16,297 --> 01:00:17,097
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

930
01:00:17,257 --> 01:00:18,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it was loud.

931
01:00:18,638 --> 01:00:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

932
01:00:22,017 --> 01:00:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.

933
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It was chaos, what do you expect?

934
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, alright, forget it.

935
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wasting everybody's time.

936
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:30,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing it from a MacBook.

937
01:00:30,822 --> 01:00:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm wasting everybody's time.

938
01:00:32,823 --> 01:00:34,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with us, Raven Stolfen?

939
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:37,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just that, and bye.

940
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:38,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, buh-bye.

941
01:00:38,026 --> 01:00:42,748
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, forget it, another one's already coming in.

942
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

943
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,070
[SPEAKER_01]: GS68.

944
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?

945
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:50,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with the release of Rock Band, like,

946
01:00:51,866 --> 01:00:56,590
[SPEAKER_01]: As I expected, there are people who think it's the first game to have a drum part.

947
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:09,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people who think it's the first game to use drums.

948
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Play Beatmania

949
01:01:35,678 --> 01:01:42,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in America, and they said it was a rip-off of Guitar Hero, and all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like, What the fuck?

950
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,781
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are stupid!

951
01:01:44,821 --> 01:01:45,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

952
01:01:45,361 --> 01:01:51,663
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get the credit for doing it first.

953
01:01:52,664 --> 01:01:53,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

954
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:59,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on top of rock bands' drums, before anyone calls me a Bambani Alitas, it's...

955
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Drum Media was not the first game to have drums.

956
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:07,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?

957
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:11,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?

958
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:16,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?

959
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:17,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't really think there was anything to it.

960
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:19,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.

961
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:22,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.

962
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:27,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with them.

963
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:29,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?

964
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no... Did they?

965
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.

966
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: No, nothing like that.

967
01:02:35,062 --> 01:02:35,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

968
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

969
01:02:37,903 --> 01:02:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

970
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:40,425
[SPEAKER_04]: When did the first... Well, let's see.

971
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,365
[SPEAKER_04]: If Drumscape was out in 96...

972
01:02:42,902 --> 01:02:45,104
[SPEAKER_04]: The first DDR was out in 98, so I don't know.

973
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:48,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think it was 97 or so.

974
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.

975
01:02:53,429 --> 01:03:00,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to tag it with the... Well, DarkTek Studio did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.

976
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:03,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it was around the same time as Drum Mania.

977
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:06,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless, I mean, I get your point.

978
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:11,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Even so, you could say that I'm sure there were older games that even...

979
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

980
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:42,742
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of drum games already out there, it's just that Rock Band gave it a different twist.

981
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:52,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tell me that Rock Band was not, like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having with that.

982
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:55,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.

983
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I said this before Rock Band came out.

984
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.

985
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:08,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could have had.

986
01:04:08,499 --> 01:04:09,880
[SPEAKER_04]: If they just wouldn't put the effort into it.

987
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:12,022
[SPEAKER_01]: But, it's a risk they don't want to take.

988
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:23,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix, I mean, sure they're Konami's rivals for its music games, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.

989
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:30,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do accomplishments or high scores.

990
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:33,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, that's kind of obscure, though.

991
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:37,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.

992
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:38,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That just seems like a logical thing to me.

993
01:04:38,968 --> 01:04:46,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's lots of games that... I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download, if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.

994
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:49,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.

995
01:04:50,535 --> 01:04:56,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So... All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

996
01:04:57,158 --> 01:04:57,779
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm good.

997
01:04:58,259 --> 01:04:59,360
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, you have a great week.

998
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk to you again.

999
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,081
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

1000
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:01,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

1001
01:05:02,925 --> 01:05:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.

1002
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.

1003
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:09,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.

1004
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:11,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1005
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:11,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1006
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:14,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.

1007
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:15,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, Ranma.

1008
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:16,168
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1009
01:05:17,089 --> 01:05:17,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing good.

1010
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:18,489
[SPEAKER_11]: How's everybody out there?

1011
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:19,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

1012
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:26,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that –

1013
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:28,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You can introduce yourself to the listener.

1014
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:31,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length of time.

1015
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy in New York City.

1016
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,490
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind this week, Ranma?

1017
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter at a later years, right?

1018
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:41,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1019
01:05:42,893 --> 01:05:44,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Look up Minesweeper, the movie.

1020
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:45,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1021
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:47,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to see this one.

1022
01:05:47,135 --> 01:05:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of stupid.

1023
01:05:49,356 --> 01:05:50,196
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to see it.

1024
01:05:50,316 --> 01:05:52,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It's stupid in a funny way.

1025
01:05:53,538 --> 01:05:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.

1026
01:05:57,196 --> 01:05:58,457
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1027
01:06:19,011 --> 01:06:25,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something and maybe I should just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.

1028
01:06:25,974 --> 01:06:28,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lounge Radio very soon, aren't you?

1029
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:31,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's still in works.

1030
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:35,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting for my co-host and it looks like it's definitely going to happen.

1031
01:06:35,598 --> 01:06:39,779
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.

1032
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about your new show.

1033
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:44,138
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Anime Jam Sessions.

1034
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:49,644
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime podcast.

1035
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I started listening to a couple of them and I didn't like it.

1036
01:06:53,128 --> 01:06:56,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always felt that if you don't like it,

1037
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:23,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Do something about it, put up or shut up And thus I started doing it I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out And a lot of people liked it So I have me and my friend Kuro Usagi Who's going to be my news reporter girl And I have some interviews lined up And basically we're going to be talking about What's going on in anime, anime movies, anime games Cosplay, upcoming conventions And just a touch of randomness here and there Very cool

1038
01:07:24,116 --> 01:07:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that will definitely be coming to the station soon we don't know what night yet we're still trying to figure that out based on other programs like there's another program that I told like a year ago we were going to get on our station and it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24 hour 7 station but now in 2008 we're trying to kind of go back to that so

1039
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:43,708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1040
01:08:08,764 --> 01:08:18,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And to those of you that have missed myself and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon, I hope.

1041
01:08:18,587 --> 01:08:19,708
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.

1042
01:08:19,968 --> 01:08:21,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to it, too.

1043
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:25,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki has been talking about he might even get back into the swing of things.

1044
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:28,771
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be a show that's on our station, though.

1045
01:08:29,655 --> 01:08:32,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, F you then.

1046
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,536
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just an audio program.

1047
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:43,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com, and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.

1048
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw around with your time.

1049
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:51,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us some samples, because we are looking to address – I should put it this way.

1050
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:55,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.

1051
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Variety is the spice of life

1052
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:44,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?

1053
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1054
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.

1055
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:49,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was awesome.

1056
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:55,507
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture you sent and where you saw it.

1057
01:09:56,728 --> 01:10:06,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Anywho, me and my friend Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but when we got there, the machining was off, and we're walking around on our way out, and I see...

1058
01:10:06,894 --> 01:10:07,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Kart GP2

1059
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:24,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say this much.

1060
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:34,088
[SPEAKER_11]: If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Race or anything like that.

1061
01:10:34,348 --> 01:10:36,789
[SPEAKER_11]: This, I can play, and it's just totally fun.

1062
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:42,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick up different weapons and stuff.

1063
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.

1064
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:53,532
[SPEAKER_11]: That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games, if you come in first place, you get a free game.

1065
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:57,586
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically have to pay for each round when you play.

1066
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:58,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

1067
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:04,911
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I love at Dave & Buster's that I would probably play instead is that fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.

1068
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:08,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there just playing it.

1069
01:11:08,593 --> 01:11:09,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just uber fun.

1070
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:13,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.

1071
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:13,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1072
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:14,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Painting finger.

1073
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:17,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.

1074
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:18,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Any quick final thoughts?

1075
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,318
[SPEAKER_11]: about the LAN adapter for GameCube.

1076
01:11:22,898 --> 01:11:27,222
[SPEAKER_11]: One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.

1077
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:33,588
[SPEAKER_11]: We had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.

1078
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:35,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use that with Double Dash?

1079
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

1080
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can.

1081
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:37,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight-player play.

1082
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:38,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can.

1083
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:40,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.

1084
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:44,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of mana it was ever used.

1085
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:55,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, if we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if somebody was like, if they were like a few floors down below us.

1086
01:11:56,164 --> 01:11:57,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.

1087
01:11:57,725 --> 01:12:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.

1088
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:02,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.

1089
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:05,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Ranma, we really got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

1090
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:06,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1091
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,612
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

1092
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:11,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

1093
01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.

1094
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:15,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys heard about this.

1095
01:12:15,646 --> 01:12:18,268
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was Gizmodo blog.

1096
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They were at CES.

1097
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about this?

1098
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:25,732
[SPEAKER_04]: They got some TV Be Gone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.

1099
01:12:25,772 --> 01:12:27,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a little bit of a clip here.

1100
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:34,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?

1101
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:35,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.

1102
01:12:35,998 --> 01:12:36,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work.

1103
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: People are playing this game.

1104
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:39,860
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using the TV, shutting it all off.

1105
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:50,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to see the full videos, post it at gizmodo.com And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish.

1106
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:51,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was.

1107
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:52,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's funny.

1108
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:55,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way.

1109
01:12:55,865 --> 01:12:58,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But you kind of look in retrospect and you go, what a dick.

1110
01:12:58,869 --> 01:12:59,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1111
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,071
[SPEAKER_04]: What a dick.

1112
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:08,940
[SPEAKER_04]: and they actually post in the Go's Moto blog, they say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some people's jobs harder and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.

1113
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry.

1114
01:13:10,701 --> 01:13:17,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh down.

1115
01:13:18,246 --> 01:13:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1116
01:13:46,684 --> 01:13:48,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I say a well-deserved ban.

1117
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it might have been funny in the moment.

1118
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:54,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in a dick jerk kind of way, it is funny.

1119
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:58,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you're going to be a dick jerk, expect to get punished like a dick jerk does.

1120
01:13:58,759 --> 01:13:59,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Get jerked back.

1121
01:13:59,760 --> 01:13:59,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1122
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:03,705
[SPEAKER_04]: A well-deserved ban from CES.

1123
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:37,447
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'm not going to say that certain other media outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media outlets came in drunk to certain press events and that's all I have to say about that.

1124
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one.

1125
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:39,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting.

1126
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:41,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should be naming names on this show.

1127
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:46,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names of the journalists, but not tonight.

1128
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.

1129
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:53,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1130
01:14:54,058 --> 01:14:55,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1131
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:55,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1132
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,661
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ross Steel, UT.

1133
01:14:58,901 --> 01:14:59,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel, UT.

1134
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:00,842
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind, buddy?

1135
01:15:02,563 --> 01:15:03,243
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things.

1136
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:04,664
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, yeah, I agree.

1137
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:11,368
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.

1138
01:15:11,388 --> 01:15:13,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.

1139
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:20,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's kind of one of those, you laugh for 30 seconds, and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at this.

1140
01:15:20,653 --> 01:15:23,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it really isn't funny, like, in retrospect, you know?

1141
01:15:23,354 --> 01:15:23,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's so funny.

1142
01:15:24,915 --> 01:15:25,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're just an asshole.

1143
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was about to say, Loki's a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is... Oh, snap!

1144
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:33,238
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway, what do you want?

1145
01:15:34,258 --> 01:15:39,080
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, man, doing that during the presentations, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody locked a job over that crap, you know?

1146
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,742
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, that's just wrong, you know?

1147
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:47,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.

1148
01:15:47,485 --> 01:16:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's why CES is saying, we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to do against Gawker and all that stuff, is because I think they're waiting to see what the response is going to be.

1149
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:04,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.

1150
01:16:04,135 --> 01:16:06,037
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.

1151
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it, so what?

1152
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.

1153
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.

1154
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:22,623
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.

1155
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:23,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1156
01:16:23,384 --> 01:16:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that could be a problem.

1157
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:29,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see, we'll see.

1158
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:30,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see.

1159
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:34,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.

1160
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?

1161
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:39,414
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1162
01:16:39,434 --> 01:16:39,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1163
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:40,739
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1164
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:58,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently the FBI went to this kid in Texas, I forgot the exact city, but apparently the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, the radiation in their houses doubled.

1165
01:16:59,029 --> 01:17:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a few years ago.

1166
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:02,271
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this was recent.

1167
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:03,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it happened again?

1168
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:09,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was posted on January 10th, actually.

1169
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:12,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read something about something similar a few years ago.

1170
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:14,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw just posted the link in our chat.

1171
01:17:14,808 --> 01:17:16,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.

1172
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else.

1173
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:24,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a gamer, it was this 11-year-old genius.

1174
01:17:25,499 --> 01:17:34,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.

1175
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:36,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read this from Kotaku here.

1176
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.

1177
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he started studying physics around the 8th grade.

1178
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:45,099
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.

1179
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:46,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.

1180
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:47,886
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.

1181
01:17:47,906 --> 01:17:48,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 30 bucks.

1182
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:48,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1183
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I thought they cut them like little cans.

1184
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockwall, Texas.

1185
01:18:13,839 --> 01:18:18,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this guy, you know, just in case.

1186
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:22,985
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.

1187
01:18:24,006 --> 01:18:26,568
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.

1188
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:27,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Then that's when you blog about it.

1189
01:18:27,989 --> 01:18:33,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this, um... I agree with what SSJ100Matt's saying in chat.

1190
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye.

1191
01:18:36,595 --> 01:18:37,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?

1192
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:40,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombie Mr. Wizard, huh?

1193
01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:42,788
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is, there it is.

1194
01:18:42,808 --> 01:18:51,356
[SPEAKER_07]: This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear reactor in.

1195
01:18:51,496 --> 01:18:52,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait for it.

1196
01:18:52,196 --> 01:18:57,081
[SPEAKER_12]: If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.

1197
01:18:58,942 --> 01:18:59,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Games made him do it.

1198
01:19:00,684 --> 01:19:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee.

1199
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:10,669
[SPEAKER_07]: and the radiation level was actually fairly safe.

1200
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:14,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I need, a nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.

1201
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,521
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a 15 year old using graduate level physics textbooks.

1202
01:19:19,165 --> 01:19:24,588
[SPEAKER_07]: and used vacuum pump manufacturer manuals and scoured the web for cheap.

1203
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:27,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.

1204
01:19:27,289 --> 01:19:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be going to offer him a job.

1205
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,671
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be freaking sending him to college.

1206
01:19:30,691 --> 01:19:30,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

1207
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,453
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.

1208
01:19:33,513 --> 01:19:36,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with all this attention, he's going to be working in a university.

1209
01:19:36,534 --> 01:19:37,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on no time at all.

1210
01:19:38,035 --> 01:19:40,456
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.

1211
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:41,237
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1212
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:43,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty?

1213
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:43,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

1214
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:52,076
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three companies.

1215
01:19:52,116 --> 01:19:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you.

1216
01:19:53,437 --> 01:19:56,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.

1217
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,885
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is with the 1UP Network is that really they're little more than a tabloid.

1218
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:10,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being sensational.

1219
01:20:11,091 --> 01:20:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that word was going to come into play.

1220
01:20:12,352 --> 01:20:14,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking like sensationalist.

1221
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yeah, I kind of agree.

1222
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember after Gershman got fired, the whole thing with the protest in front of the CNET building?

1223
01:20:27,093 --> 01:20:29,155
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalists.

1224
01:20:29,196 --> 01:20:31,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not like they come to press events drunk.

1225
01:20:31,338 --> 01:20:33,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait, no, no, they do.

1226
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

1227
01:20:37,029 --> 01:20:38,530
[SPEAKER_03]: They do their podcast drunk.

1228
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:41,671
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

1229
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:43,753
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, we have too, but you know.

1230
01:20:44,233 --> 01:20:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but also we don't get paid.

1231
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:47,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody pays us to do this program.

1232
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: We pay to do this program.

1233
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:49,535
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how sick we are.

1234
01:20:49,996 --> 01:20:51,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1235
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:54,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.

1236
01:20:54,118 --> 01:21:03,282
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit in the entire gaming big review industry, you know?

1237
01:21:04,623 --> 01:21:06,124
[SPEAKER_03]: and you see it in their reviews.

1238
01:21:06,184 --> 01:21:07,926
[SPEAKER_03]: They go out of their way to be negative.

1239
01:21:08,026 --> 01:21:15,653
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at, particularly in EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that, quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.

1240
01:21:16,233 --> 01:21:20,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they could say, hey, look how negative we can be.

1241
01:21:20,497 --> 01:21:21,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not like GameSpot.

1242
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:24,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting perspective.

1243
01:21:24,526 --> 01:21:29,229
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because, again, I don't really read a lot of these sites.

1244
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:30,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

1245
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:35,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but, like, secretly I'm, like, watching every move they make.

1246
01:21:35,554 --> 01:21:36,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't.

1247
01:21:36,634 --> 01:21:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.

1248
01:21:40,457 --> 01:21:51,925
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I... Actually, this is a little off-topic, but IGN did... Lately, their thing is they've been revealing some of the Destiny-era games, the data design stuff, you know, the absolute shit on, you know, the Wii, and...

1249
01:21:52,245 --> 01:21:58,268
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man.

1250
01:21:58,728 --> 01:22:00,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course it got a really low score.

1251
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:02,230
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they did a video review for it.

1252
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:08,613
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally a minute long.

1253
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,474
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?

1254
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:12,015
[SPEAKER_12]: It has platforms and jumping.

1255
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:13,296
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about it.

1256
01:22:13,856 --> 01:22:15,997
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the end of the video review.

1257
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:17,198
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, seriously.

1258
01:22:17,825 --> 01:22:20,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're going to do.

1259
01:22:20,627 --> 01:22:21,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Take it seriously.

1260
01:22:21,747 --> 01:22:29,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though the game is crap, you've got to point out, you can do it funny, but point out why it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did one for you.

1261
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's stupid.

1262
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:38,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now that you're talking about that, not enough people are doing good, funny reviews.

1263
01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember the old Alex Navarro review for Big Rigs?

1264
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was hilarious.

1265
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:45,691
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes Peggle.

1266
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:46,452
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes Psychonauts.

1267
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:14,199
[SPEAKER_03]: He generally likes Assassin's Creed.

1268
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing with him is that he'll point out... He looks at the games.

1269
01:23:18,386 --> 01:23:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: He just looks at the games to look at the games.

1270
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:21,691
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not, you know...

1271
01:23:23,025 --> 01:23:25,767
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.

1272
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as long as there's a balance to it.

1273
01:23:28,388 --> 01:23:29,889
[SPEAKER_04]: He tells it like it is.

1274
01:23:29,949 --> 01:23:32,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the people that do nothing but negative reviews.

1275
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:35,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, okay, haha, joke's over.

1276
01:23:36,072 --> 01:23:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Move on.

1277
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:38,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us both sides.

1278
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:38,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Be balanced.

1279
01:23:39,173 --> 01:23:43,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steele, I've got to wrap up because we want to try and take one more call before we close the show tonight.

1280
01:23:43,295 --> 01:23:45,596
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?

1281
01:23:47,297 --> 01:23:48,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Embrace false idols.

1282
01:23:48,218 --> 01:23:48,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.

1283
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1284
01:23:53,769 --> 01:23:56,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess RawSteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.

1285
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:56,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say.

1286
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:57,231
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1287
01:23:57,772 --> 01:23:59,172
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take one more call if we have any time.

1288
01:23:59,593 --> 01:24:01,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, if we have any more people who want to call in.

1289
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:04,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1290
01:24:05,036 --> 01:24:07,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, any last-minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?

1291
01:24:08,178 --> 01:24:13,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have a last-minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an exploding baby in it.

1292
01:24:13,521 --> 01:24:19,445
[SPEAKER_12]: So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.

1293
01:24:21,226 --> 01:24:22,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy for you.

1294
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.

1295
01:24:29,222 --> 01:24:31,123
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to his reviews every week.

1296
01:24:31,183 --> 01:24:34,745
[SPEAKER_12]: We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.

1297
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:38,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.

1298
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?

1299
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

1300
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:40,727
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1301
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:45,670
[SPEAKER_04]: One more call.

1302
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1303
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1304
01:24:48,191 --> 01:24:48,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DT.

1305
01:24:49,011 --> 01:24:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dartetsuya.

1306
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:51,032
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1307
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:53,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nothing.

1308
01:24:53,184 --> 01:24:55,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I'd call.

1309
01:24:56,005 --> 01:24:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chilling?

1310
01:24:56,846 --> 01:24:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Listening to OLR?

1311
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:58,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chilling?

1312
01:24:58,867 --> 01:24:59,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1313
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,069
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?

1314
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:05,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty interesting.

1315
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1316
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:07,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting stuff.

1317
01:25:08,994 --> 01:25:10,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good stuff, yeah.

1318
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:12,716
[SPEAKER_04]: What games have you been playing this week?

1319
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:20,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.

1320
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:21,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

1321
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:22,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.

1322
01:25:22,303 --> 01:25:23,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

1323
01:25:25,004 --> 01:25:29,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, it's like an adventure game.

1324
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:33,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games.

1325
01:25:33,426 --> 01:25:38,187
[SPEAKER_10]: And you go around and you collect items and kill enemies.

1326
01:25:38,747 --> 01:25:40,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of like Castlevania.

1327
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,448
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.

1328
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:43,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I updated it.

1329
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:44,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny.

1330
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:16,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.

1331
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:18,119
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game is hard?

1332
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:21,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1333
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,420
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't give you, like, any help or anything, I don't think.

1334
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no cheat mode, no help mode?

1335
01:26:28,122 --> 01:26:30,482
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean, there was a trick I learned.

1336
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:33,383
[SPEAKER_10]: There was this video walkthrough.

1337
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:36,984
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.

1338
01:26:38,785 --> 01:26:39,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might help.

1339
01:26:40,506 --> 01:26:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

1340
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:43,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

1341
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:09,710
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.

1342
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:10,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's about it.

1343
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1344
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:13,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So go play La Mulana.

1345
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play some more.

1346
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:15,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1347
01:27:15,214 --> 01:27:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1348
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:15,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1349
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:17,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1350
01:27:17,195 --> 01:27:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1351
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:17,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1352
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:19,137
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1353
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:22,159
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and end the show.

1354
01:27:22,559 --> 01:27:36,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent Hill Origin, which apparently he says the whole series jumped the shark, and between Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and all this stuff, right?

1355
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:38,073
[SPEAKER_12]: SILENT HILL ORIGINS

1356
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:19,516
[SPEAKER_04]: for those of you guys listening because there's some really kick-ass songs I mean it's it's more Akira Yamaoka doing some great stuff let's see what was oh this song I think I liked unfortunately I couldn't tell you the name of it because the songs aren't labeled but here's one

1357
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.

1358
01:28:39,312 --> 01:28:41,893
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week.

1359
01:28:42,413 --> 01:28:45,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.

1360
01:28:46,115 --> 01:28:48,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.

1361
01:28:48,776 --> 01:28:50,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?

1362
01:28:50,877 --> 01:28:51,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, I don't have anything.

1363
01:28:51,918 --> 01:28:52,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything?

1364
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:53,138
[SPEAKER_04]: All good.

1365
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:54,479
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, then we're good.

1366
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:56,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1367
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,641
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.

1368
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:00,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I like these cookies.

1369
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:04,604
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is penguins are cute.

1370
01:29:05,084 --> 01:29:05,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1371
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,171
[SPEAKER_04]: This game filler is pretty fun.

1372
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,700

[SPEAKER_04]: See ya.

01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,903
