00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,600
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this Part B of our program.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,100
So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Yes, there is some big news coming from Nintendo Power

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,100
talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,400
And apparently the game's title is Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,900
and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,200
and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me, but, you know, what do I know?

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
Is that a bad thing?

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,700
Uh, no, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG? Seriously.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,400
Well, A, BioWare didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
So?

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,200
No, I agree that it doesn't matter.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't care if Square does it or, you know, BioWare.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,500
But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,200
Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
They were the closest thing I've played to that since.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
I miss Mario RPG.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,500
And, um, but the Sonic thing looks pretty good.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,200
They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
So that's kind of neat.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,500
Oh, that's kind of cool.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Uh, I don't know.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,900
Don't know much about it yet, but, um, should be the next issue, I guess.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Dark Soccer, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,700
Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out,

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,500
If it's not done by Sonic Team,

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
it doesn't exist in my universe. How's that?

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,100
Oh, snap.

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
Well said.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,700
Alright, well, uh, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to,

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,100
and, uh, one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,600
But some fans are kind of pissed off,

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,100
because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw,

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,800
and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere?

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,500
Well, it's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC,

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,700
but no love for the Nintendo Wii.

42
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,100
However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,500
would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
Cue the petition!

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,500
Almost immediately an internet petition went up,

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,700
So they're taking a page out of, uh, Konami's book there.

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then, uh, we'll make the product.

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,300
Well, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Quote,

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,600
It will largely depend on what the fans want for the future of Bionic Commando.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,000
If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's had people very happy.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Um, anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Not yet, it's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,500
because everybody said it was great, but I just, I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,100
Well, there's a DS version now, where you can, um, basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff,

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,200
and sword fight, and kill people, and stuff.

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,800
But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers, and picking pockets, and doing other stuff.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Wait, wait, you can use a stylus for interrogating informers, so what do you do, you just poke them?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Poke, poke, poke, poke, tell me!

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Poke, poke, poke, poke!

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,700
And then you talk into the, um, the speaker part, and go,

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,000
bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother!

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Like that.

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game!

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,300
I know, it could be interesting, I think it'd be kind of cute.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,600
It's supposed to be a prequel, looks kind of neat.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I don't know.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Um, the Nyko Wireless Nunchak, I remember we talked about that a little bit ago,

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,600
um, pretty useless device, I think, but I guess if you, that little cord really bothers you,

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,300
um, then great, you can buy this.

74
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,800
Anyways...

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,600
That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Whatever, okay, so...

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
That's what I want to know.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,500
Uh, $30.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,400
Never mind, I can deal with it for $30.

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,900
Yeah, and, um, so, apparently though, it did win a, uh, CNET CES Gaming Award.

82
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
For, uh, Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.

83
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,100
You know, I kind of, I forgot to talk about this this week, my gaming week,

84
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,900
I played, um, some Ghost Squad, and I bought those, um,

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,500
Nyko Perfect Shots, the ones that look like the little pistols.

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,900
Those are fucking awesome.

87
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,200
And, the other thing about Ghost Squad, and why I love the game even more,

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,700
they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper, so that you don't use the B button as a trigger,

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
you use the Z button, so that you're actually firing it correctly.

90
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,800
So, hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters,

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,500
will look to, uh, Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,200
Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,300
He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.

94
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,000
That's true, because, you know, you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,300
Um, what else was I going to say about this?

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
What did they get for getting this award?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Did you get a trophy, or a plaque, or just internet fame?

98
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,100
Internet fame.

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,500
I see. Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about the device on the program.

100
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,800
Maybe a plaque, who knows.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
A trophy?

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
I want to win a trophy!

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Are there any award shows coming up where you can win a trophy in?

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,600
I want a trophy.

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,100
I have a trophy for us.

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,700
That's from, like, 2005, and it's at your house.

107
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,200
I want a trophy here.

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,400
I can bring that one here.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,200
You should bring that one here. But I want another trophy.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
I want a 2008 trophy.

111
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
But I went all the way for that trophy.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know, you had to go all the way to L.A. and you had to meet Adam Curry. Poor you.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,100
No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
Look, no, I-

115
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,100
With his Bon Jovi hair.

116
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,700
I want a new 2008 trophy.

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,100
So what award can we win?

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,400
There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.

119
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I'll have to look into that to make that happen.

120
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,200
Well, the year is young and, you know, there are the Darwin Awards.

121
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,900
It's a little bit of a permanent solution.

122
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Can we give ourselves a stupid award? Can we do something really stupid?

123
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,700
But, you know, we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?

124
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Rob Way says, make your own award show.

125
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Well, there are, you know, there are podcasts out there that make their own award show.

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,000
Hell, the gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,200
You think we could team up with Sony? They got nothing going for them, right?

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Alright, forget it. Let's move on with the gaming news.

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Yeah, I could use that too.

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,800
So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit,

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
but we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th,

134
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,800
if a new one-up column is to be believed.

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,200
The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers,

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
both in Japan and abroad.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
North Americans can expect to see the game on May 20th,

138
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,400
by which time presumably they'll have that plus-sized Western Balance Board

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
properly stress-tested and ready for use.

140
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,600
However, the interesting thing about that was that that little drop date

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
had never been mentioned before.

142
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,800
So, is May 20th the day that this game will come out?

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
If it is the day, then hooray, they got it correct.

144
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
If it's not the day, they can just say, oh, it's been delayed.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Loki, from the distribution angle,

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
do you have any insider information possibly on this?

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Nope, haven't heard a thing.

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Interesting.

149
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,600
At least not on that game.

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, I'm looking forward to this game, you know,

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
just because I think it'll be fun.

152
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Maybe Loki and I can have a contest as we both want to play some Wii Fit.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
Maybe we can have that OLR Biggest Loser contest

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
we've been talking about for a long time.

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Maybe Loki and I will get fit with Wii Fit.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
We can have like a blog and shit.

157
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Yeah, we can be on the news.

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Yay!

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Because people losing weight on a weight loss game,

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
that's so fucking new.

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
And there we go, we get a trophy for being on the news.

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
News trophy.

163
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of air time

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
if that, and I'll say something brief.

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, it's so much fun.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Alright, by the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news,

167
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
it's on YouTube.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,200
Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
It's great.

170
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
And like, they interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes,

171
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
and that's what they used.

172
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Oh, it's so much fun.

173
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Alright, let's give out some trophies right now to our listeners.

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Our listeners are awesome, and we wouldn't be here without you guys.

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
And we always invite you to interact with our program,

176
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,200
whether it be through the chat room or through our email.

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,600
It's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,200
and Dark Sakura will be giving you a trophy in spirit

179
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,800
every time she reads one of your emails tonight, won't you, Dark Sakura?

180
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
In fact, you'll actually be winning a Golden Globe.

181
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.

182
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't get a Golden Globe.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,200
You get an aluminum foil ball.

184
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,400
Okay, and spray-painted gold.

185
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Alright, so there you have it.

186
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
So, the Orange Lounge Radio Oranges, even though they're gold.

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,800
Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight, I don't know.

189
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag and the envelope, please.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Who wins orangie number one?

191
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,600
You're funny, Rob.

192
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
The first one is from TJ.

193
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
It says, hey, before I begin, I want to say that I love your show

194
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,000
and wish I could catch it live, but unfortunately I have other crap to do.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,400
That's a good excuse. I have other crap to do.

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Regardless, I try and catch the podcast as often as possible.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,800
I couldn't help noticing that nobody mentioned my opinion on the year's worst game.

198
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
I work part-time at a GameStop. I'm sorry.

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
And the one game that sold zero units during December was Jenga for the Wii.

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I mean, come on. Everyone's bored with the original game.

201
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
It's not going to do shit on the Wii.

202
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Anyway, I just wanted to get that out there and keep up the good work.

203
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
TJ.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Thank you, TJ. The only reason I didn't mention Jenga

205
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
is that I had completely erased it from my memory.

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I'd like to thank you personally for bringing it back into my existence, you jerk.

207
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Jenga's a game. Horrible.

208
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.

211
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't know if it's just me.

212
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
So there you have it.

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Next email.

214
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
With Bioshock Mass Effect Call of Duty 4, we play Super Mario Galaxies and an iPhone.

215
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
This must be the best Christmas ever.

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, I know this email's a bit late,

217
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
but I felt I must comment on how especially kickass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.

218
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Wait, is this the same email or a new one?

219
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
This is a different one.

220
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Oh, who sent this one in?

221
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
This one's from Ospher.

222
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Oh, okay.

223
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.

224
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.

225
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
It's so much fun to play and control, and controls are nothing short of sexy.

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Ooh.

227
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies,

228
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
and some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.

229
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.

230
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
What's Chapter 4, Rob?

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Wait, in Mario Galaxy?

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I don't want to spoil anything,

233
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,600
but the soundtrack is out there on the internet, so take a look.

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
On your favorite torrent site.

235
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Not that I endorse that sort of thing.

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Look on your iPhone!

237
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
But it is out there.

238
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Okay.

239
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Next paragraph.

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
As for Call of Duty 4, it's just as Rob said, it's fucking epic.

241
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,600
You play the game to experience it yourself, and then watch your jaw hit the floor.

242
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?

243
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
No.

244
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Not live, no.

245
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
You can listen to the podcast from any touch-tone phone.

246
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
It's something I want to say, like...

247
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You can't do it from a touch-tone phone, like a regular phone.

248
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
You can hear it, you can hear the podcast on a phone.

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
There's some service out there, free service,

250
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
because I know, because one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.

251
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
She might have signed our podcast up for it, I don't even know, I don't remember.

252
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.

253
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I'll look it up.

254
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.

255
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work,

256
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,600
but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Thanks for reading, as always, Ospher sent from my iPhone.

258
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,600
You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.

259
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
This email comes from Stan.

260
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Hi there.

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
It makes me wonder why I was listening to you folks before.

263
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
After listening to your year-end wrap-up show,

264
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.

265
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Well, do y'all?

266
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit,

267
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
and if you guys had a booth or something.

268
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool

269
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.

270
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
That's what we usually do when we do our panels.

271
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
If not, then taping something while there,

272
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I mean, actually, that's more what we do as we do the recording.

274
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I don't know if anyone else in Chicago that listens to your show,

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
but I'm sure they're here somewhere just never looked.

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur III?

277
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I could really use a challenge.

278
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I didn't get Soul Calibur III because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.

279
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I like Soul Calibur III, but maybe that's just me.

280
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs

281
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
to be played during your music portions.

282
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Did I read that right?

283
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Some of you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands,

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.

285
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
You know, a rock band setup.

286
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride saxophone ensemble,

287
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
and a few of us are big gamers,

288
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.

289
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Right now, I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks,

290
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,600
especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
As you can guess, the sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.

292
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
I've tinkered around with arrangements before,

293
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,600
but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience,

294
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
then I'm sure all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
So how about it?

296
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I would say so, dude. I played saxophone.

298
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I don't see why not.

299
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation,

300
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
meaning like ten-minute songs are a little much,

301
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
but if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most,

302
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while,

303
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
but if you have something, you know, radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat,

304
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I don't see why not. Yeah, I don't see why not.

305
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet,

306
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
so I don't see why not.

307
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Anyway, thanks so much. Keep up the great work.

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I really get a kick if this was read on the air.

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
One of these days, I'll call in.

310
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
You should.

311
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
There you go. You got a kick.

312
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
And you got an orangey.

313
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Yes, you do.

314
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Just for emailing us tonight.

315
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
By the way, I wanted to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.

316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone,

317
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
it's called Podlines.

318
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Now, we don't like totally endorse this,

319
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.

320
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I don't know. I haven't done this in a long time.

321
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
But here's the phone number.

322
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,600
It's area code 650-523-6855.

323
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.

324
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Let's see what happens,

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
because I don't know what happens when you call this.

326
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens,

327
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
or if we get an ad or what.

328
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,600
One ringy dingy.

329
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
And it's busy.

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I guess we've been taken off the air.

331
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I don't know.

332
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Well, he sent in another part to his email.

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
All right, fine.

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
It says, oops, I forgot,

335
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
but have any of you watched the Street Fighter the later years?

336
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Yes, I have.

337
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
It's so damn funny.

338
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2

339
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
will appreciate this.

340
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.

341
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Yay, gamers.

342
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
It's like, okay.

343
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I've watched some of it.

344
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
It's pretty darn funny.

345
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Good times.

346
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Well, we actually got an email from our good buddy, Rob,

347
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
the two B's, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.

348
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Really?

349
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.

350
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Cool.

351
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested

352
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable

353
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
for one of his video game pads.

354
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
They haven't said what the system was or anything.

355
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It said that the guy was playing a game

356
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
and the father was trying to get him to stop.

357
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.

358
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
The dad took out the power cable

359
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,600
and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.

360
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Interesting.

361
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.

362
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
As you should be.

363
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?

364
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
He was mad because he was playing right to speak.

365
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.

366
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
No, I said last email.

367
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh, and?

368
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Oh, fine.

369
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
One more email then.

370
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
This one's important.

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
It's from Belgium.

372
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Oh, cool.

373
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Yes.

374
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Hey, Sky, DarkSakura and Loki.

375
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming

376
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
and I am a PC gamer.

377
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.

378
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I just want to say that I would appreciate very much

379
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
if you could do a show at noon in your time zone

380
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.

381
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep

382
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,600
and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.

383
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I would love to do that sometime,

384
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.

385
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I always download the podcast on my PSP,

386
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.

387
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live,

388
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.

389
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Also, an interesting story perhaps.

390
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.

391
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.

392
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007,

393
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
the PS3 sold the most closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.

394
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Xbox 360 is the least popular console,

395
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,600
and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.

396
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.

397
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.

398
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made a lot of people

399
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money

400
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
on a next-generation console.

401
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I have the feeling the Xbox never was a really big success here,

402
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
and so many people are more inclined to play a PlayStation 3,

403
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
although the 360 might have the best games so far.

404
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Also, the casual gamers are, of course, going for the Wii over here, too.

405
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose,

406
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
because it is the most innovative system,

407
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,600
and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.

408
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Grits, G-R-T-Z.

409
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Oh, I'm sorry. That's in closing. His name is Martin.

410
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, thank you for the e-mail.

411
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?

412
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I have a three-day weekend coming up.

413
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Too soon, though. We want to get the word out so people know.

414
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah, I know, a three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.

415
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
We might have Marissa up here, too.

416
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Huh?

417
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
We might have Marissa up here, too.

418
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, that would be good.

419
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.

420
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
We'll just have to check our schedules,

421
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
because I know around Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know,

422
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
things might get busy, but we'll see.

423
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Sometime in February. I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.

424
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
We've done it before, like for pre-taping.

425
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?

426
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I don't see why not.

427
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I don't see why not either.

428
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
We will make that happen for our overseas listeners,

429
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
but we'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.

430
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day weekend is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?

431
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February, President's Day?

432
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I do believe so.

433
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Maybe we can make it happen around then.

434
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Maybe.

435
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
We'll check our schedules.

436
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay.

437
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
All right.

438
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email,

439
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

440
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with the one and only Loki.

441
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Yes.

442
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that,

443
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it,

444
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
one of which was shown off at CES.

445
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:45,600
It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of souped up for Rock Band.

446
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,600
It's got the four drums, and then it's got three cymbals as well, mapped to yellow, blue, and green.

447
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
So that's kind of neat.

448
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,600
No word on when it's going to come out or how much it is, but cool nonetheless.

449
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Now, one thing that's not so cool but kind of weird is this Rock Band stage kit that was spotted on GameStop,

450
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:25,600
and apparently it's coming out around June for $100, and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show.

451
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
This actually sounds kind of epic.

452
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
You know what, though?

453
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh, Lordy.

454
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I still have $200 in store credit around that time. I'll pick it up.

455
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
That would be awesome.

456
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
We'll do it during the show. We'll just leave it on during the show.

457
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
That's right. We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Lawns Radio one night.

458
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Hopefully the webcam's back by then.

459
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
That would be awesome. A light show and smoke.

460
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Remind me not to be here for that show.

461
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I know, seriously, because you can imagine just how it looks one way on the box,

462
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,600
but then when you actually do it in person, it probably smells like farts or something.

463
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.

464
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Seriously, though.

465
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,600
We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.

466
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Why would you do this?

467
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I mean, why would you play this in your living room with smoke and stuff here?

468
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I can't see the screen anymore.

469
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
It's filling up the house full of smoke.

470
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Mac Man in our chat room at chat.orangeslawnsradio.com says,

471
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Does it come with some weed, too? That would be the true rocker experience.

472
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
I don't know.

473
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,600
It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.

474
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It's a pretty well-known company.

475
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
It's funny, but is it $100 funny?

476
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
How many of these are they really going to sell?

477
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Let me put it this way. If it is an actual smoke machine,

478
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that,

479
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,600
but, dude, you got to buy the liquid smoke for it, and that's expensive.

480
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine.

481
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
What the hell are you going to be doing playing with the smoke machine?

482
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,600
You can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.

483
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I don't know. I think it would be funny.

484
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I think it would be funny, too, just to do for one show, but, Loki, $100 funny?

485
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I don't know.

486
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
It's all store credit.

487
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Chat room, is it $100 funny? That's what I need to know.

488
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of Judgment instead.

489
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
I don't think so.

490
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Ain't going to happen.

491
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Eye of Judgment rock band smoke machine.

492
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Sometimes it's just too hard to tell.

493
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Loki, I know what you should do.

494
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,600
You should give me that money, and I'm going to put it towards my Disney World trip

495
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
that Dark Soccer and I are going to take.

496
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Right, Dark Soccer?

497
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Yes.

498
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
All right.

499
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Disney World is the place that Dark Soccer and I have to visit someday.

500
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
The cool thing is that maybe this will be up and running by the time we go there.

501
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Now, this is just a rumor, but I think this is awesome.

502
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.

503
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Now, this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.

504
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:03,600
You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game

505
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
on the DS was going to interact with the ride.

506
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride,

507
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
you'd unlock a new character or something.

508
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to go into the park and actually get this,

509
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,600
especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.

510
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of application

511
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
that would download to your DS.

512
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
It would be a tour of the park, basically.

513
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
What you could do, imagine this.

514
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Let's say you use your stylus to click on New Orleans Square.

515
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
You click on that, and then you can actually click on the Haunted Mansion

516
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
and see that the wait time for that ride is 20 minutes.

517
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Smart.

518
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,600
That's a really kick-ass application, I think, in many ways.

519
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Oh, thank you.

520
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Sorry, we're being brought cookies right now that are being made.

521
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I don't want to drop them like I did the coffee.

522
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
What kind of cookies are these?

523
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Snickerdoodles.

524
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Snickerdoodles.

525
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, I get all three then.

526
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
No.

527
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm just kidding.

528
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
No, you can get me one.

529
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
All right, hold on.

530
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
These are hot.

531
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
These are just out of the oven.

532
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,600
All right, guys, the show has been interrupted for cookies.

533
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Oh, my gosh, they're so good.

534
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm waiting to try one.

535
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, hot.

536
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Hold on.

537
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah, I know they're hot.

538
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Hold on.

539
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Snickerdoodles are like the best cookies.

540
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh, those are good.

541
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
What's a snickerdoodle?

542
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
They're cinnamon sugar cookies.

543
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
They're cinnamon.

544
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
They taste like, thank you, Katie.

545
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Oh, she can hear it good.

546
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
All right.

547
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
So anyway, where were we?

548
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Cookie goodness.

549
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
No, Disney.

550
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Let's see.

551
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Haunted Mansion wait ride.

552
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Oh, yeah.

553
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
So you can click on an area and see how long the wait is.

554
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
And you can actually go, let's say you could click on it.

555
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylist, obviously, right?

556
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,180
You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney

557
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,600
World, and you could see what their menu is.

558
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.

559
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,600
If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.

560
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You have to call Disney Dining.

561
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
No, I know.

562
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I know.

563
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
But anyway, I think that's kind of rad.

564
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
That would be an awesome thing.

565
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I mean, can you imagine if they did this?

566
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,880
Like, me, you, Chris, Megsy would all have to make a trip and just have our DSs out the

567
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
whole time.

568
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Like, okay, what's got a short wait right now?

569
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Let's go to Indy.

570
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Right?

571
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
It'd be fun.

572
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,720
That would be a very smart thing, but we go to Disneyland much more than we go to Disney

573
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
World.

574
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,880
But someday, someday we have to make it to Disney World.

575
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,080
I'm actually planning on going sometime this year, which is partly why we didn't renew

576
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,480
my annual pass.

577
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,600
Sounds like fun, though.

578
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,280
Well, something else is really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now.

579
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:46,880
Is it Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games?

580
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games,

581
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:01,840
which is PEGL Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

582
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,600
and Portal First Slice.

583
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:17,920
And First Slice, it's actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.

584
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,360
So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.

585
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
But it's kind of cool.

586
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,360
And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike, so

587
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,200
they can have real-life versus competitions and things like that.

588
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Cool.

589
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Sorry, chewing on a cookie.

590
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,000
I know, cookies are freaking good.

591
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Anyways, let's see, last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are

592
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:56,040
trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.

593
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,240
Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how

594
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
much they're really entitled to.

595
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,460
And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.

596
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,080
One day worth of outages is approximately 13.7 cents.

597
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,080
So for about the six days of outages, that's 82 cents.

598
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.

599
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,820
So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.

600
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,840
And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.

601
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,680
And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft, 82 cents.

602
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,880
No, I'm just kidding.

603
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,240
They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.

604
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,800
Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it, so you're getting a way better deal

605
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
this way.

606
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,720
Yeah, but at the same time, how do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?

607
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,360
I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.

608
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,920
How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?

609
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Just saying.

610
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
You don't know.

611
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
You don't.

612
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
But anyway.

613
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
No, Darktitsuyu, you're right.

614
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,080
Darktitsuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.

615
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
You're right, I'm not.

616
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
It's stupid.

617
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,560
Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.

618
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,200
They don't owe me anything but a hug.

619
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,800
I would like a hug and reassurance that everything will be okay soon.

620
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,320
Anyhow, you would think that maybe more news on the lawsuit would invoke our FUs of the

621
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,240
week or possibly win a stupid award, but my God, how could we when there was this news

622
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,880
that came out this week?

623
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:45,400
And this has to do with a certain CEO in the UK named Steve Easterbrook.

624
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:51,680
He made a quote this week blaming video games for the obesity epidemic.

625
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
I don't know who is to blame.

626
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,640
The issue of obesity is complex and is absolutely one our society is facing.

627
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,320
There's no denial about that, but if you break it down, I think there's an education piece.

628
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,800
How can we better communicate to individuals the importance of a balanced diet and taking

629
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
care of themselves?

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,520
Then there's a lifestyle element.

631
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,700
There's fewer green spaces and kids are sat home playing computer games on the TV when

632
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,680
in the past they'd have been burning off energy outside.

633
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,040
Okay, fair enough.

634
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,840
Just another person trying to knock video games for making kids fat.

635
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,280
But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.

636
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,600
Do you know who he's the CEO of?

637
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
McDonald's.

638
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:35,080
It's all their blame game thing trying to get the thing off of them, especially since

639
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,480
they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.

640
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,760
So I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.

641
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,880
I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo

642
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,600
64 play zones and stuff, so it's not like, granted, he's in the UK and it's America.

643
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Here, kid, go play with some old games.

644
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,600
They still have Nintendo 64 after all these years.

645
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,520
Don't they have a DS wireless station too?

646
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,480
I seem to remember that was big news last year.

647
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,720
But anyhow, regardless, despite that hypocrisy where McDonald's actually endorses video games

648
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,560
in their stores, there's just that whole thing about, okay, well, so the video games make

649
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,800
kids fat, but the chicken McNuggets and hot apple pies with the molten lava in the center

650
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,600
of them do not make kids fat, or McFlurries and cones.

651
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
You know what it is?

652
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What?

653
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,140
And actually, he did say it himself.

654
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,680
It's a matter of lifestyle.

655
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,000
You can sit around all day and play a game, or you can get out and engage in a sport,

656
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,280
but also it has to do with what you're eating.

657
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,520
And this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.

658
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,560
She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her

659
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,480
plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym,

660
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,320
and it tricked her body right back into losing again because it's like, okay, well, I'm no

661
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,240
longer on this little amount of food, I'm on this much food, and so it went right back

662
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
into burning.

663
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,840
I mean, you've got to eat to lose, is how it works.

664
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,720
McDonald's can be a part of a healthy diet.

665
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
It can.

666
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,480
Well, especially they've enacted so many different choices that they have.

667
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,520
You can get apples, as long as you don't dip them in caramel sauce.

668
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,440
I freaking love that apple walnut salad thingy they have there.

669
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,720
Be careful of the yogurt dressing.

670
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Yeah.

671
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,680
Well, not just that, but the walnuts themselves aren't that healthy, but certainly more healthy

672
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,120
than a quarter pounder with cheese, right?

673
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,220
Well, yeah, and it's all a matter of not only looking at the content of your food but looking

674
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,280
at how much of it you are eating.

675
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Right.

676
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,400
I mean, you can even go and have a freaking Chicken McNuggets meal as long as you have

677
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,100
it once a week and you don't get super-sized french fries.

678
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,480
You have your six nuggets and small fries.

679
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,640
No, you don't eat the french fries.

680
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Or whatever.

681
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,920
If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.

682
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.

683
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I've done that before.

684
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,000
Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.

685
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,080
I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.

686
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,920
So regardless, just saying, you know, it's not like you eat it occasionally and not every

687
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
day.

688
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
You're fine.

689
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
It's not where you eat.

690
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,360
It's not, you know, it's what you do and what you eat.

691
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,440
It's not the where, the who, the any of that.

692
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,100
It's what you're doing.

693
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,840
It's nobody else's fault but your own.

694
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,160
That's how I say it.

695
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Or just be fat and be beautiful.

696
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
If you're happy.

697
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Be BB.

698
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,440
Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman or a BBM.

699
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
You know what?

700
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,840
People should be happy the way they are and I think that a lot of this, you know, crap

701
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,040
that people go through for, you know, the yo-yo diets and all of that is just people

702
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
being unhappy with themselves.

703
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,440
And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself and, you know, and I know

704
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,720
that I don't always, you know, do the same thing myself but the moment that you are happy

705
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,880
with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body

706
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
is going to follow.

707
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
All right.

708
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Well, anyway.

709
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Or you won't care.

710
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,040
Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites

711
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,920
a certain sort of rage within us that can only be crushed by us venting our FUs of the

712
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,920
week.

713
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:32,240
I accidentally used the old song tonight but we'll deal.

714
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Sorry.

715
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Dark Sakura.

716
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't know if you're using the old music.

717
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,800
Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day, I've had sort of a disappointing day and disappointing

718
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
is a very good word for it.

719
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,600
I've had multiple in a row disappointments and I want an iMac so FU to me not having

720
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,960
an iMac.

721
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,680
I'll go next if you're done.

722
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,680
My FU goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today, well, first FU to me for putting

723
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
in the wrong song.

724
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,560
FU to this cup of coffee for getting cold and then FU to me going to the store today

725
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,880
without my wallet.

726
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,320
That's a bit embarrassing if you go to the front with a full thing of groceries and you

727
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
don't have your wallet.

728
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,600
Thank God I didn't do that.

729
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,960
So if you're picturing me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because

730
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,080
thank God I was looking for something at the store to deal with the fly problem we have

731
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,920
here in the studio and while I was browsing, that was the first thing I was looking at

732
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,240
and I got a phone call while I was browsing and as I reached for my phone, that was the

733
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,000
moment I realized, hey, wait a minute, my phone's here but my wallet's not so thankfully

734
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,800
I just put the cart back empty and snuck out of the store like nothing ever happened in

735
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
the first place.

736
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,800
But that still was a waste of gas.

737
00:35:51,800 --> 00:36:02,320
FU to the muscle that's cold in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me

738
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.

739
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
It hurts when you laugh?

740
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
It hurts when I laugh.

741
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,320
I will give you a bit of advice if you are going to rub it good clockwise because otherwise

742
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,160
you will get a constitution.

743
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
It's true.

744
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,720
Have you had trouble going lately?

745
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,440
No, I have not had trouble going.

746
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,880
No, no, no, no.

747
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,880
I have actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion

748
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,440
grows clockwise and you can actually block your digestion by going counter-clockwise

749
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,720
if you are looking at your stomach.

750
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
You learn something new every day.

751
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
You really do.

752
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
You can actually handle it.

753
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I want really good.

754
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Yeah.

755
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,920
Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.

756
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,360
Is that a trick I can play on my friends is run up to people and rub their bellies counter-clockwise

757
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,080
and go, ha ha, you're constipated.

758
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,160
No, it takes everyone.

759
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm just being a little silly.

760
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,600
Although Mac Man in chat says it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make

761
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Loki laugh.

762
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:01,120
I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 Deaths video and that was painful enough.

763
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm going to put my advice in the chat window.

764
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
All right.

765
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,240
You need to do your next story, Dark Soccer, before you get to advice.

766
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,120
Games first, constipation later.

767
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:23,160
Starting out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have Star Tropics for NES.

768
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,240
It was released on the 11th.

769
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:35,120
Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so they are getting that, which

770
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,280
is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.

771
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
It was a master system.

772
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,920
Actually, no, it was not on Master System.

773
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,080
I do believe it was a Genesis game.

774
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Any news yet?

775
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
No, I take that back.

776
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,040
It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.

777
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,760
Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?

778
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
I have no idea.

779
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
In the US?

780
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
All right.

781
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,440
Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

782
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
In the meantime, more news.

783
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:16,320
In the latest editorial for EGM, the editor-in-chief, Dan Hsu, actually called out three companies

784
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,320
for allegedly refusing to work with the magazine due to negative reviews of their games.

785
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,960
According to him, the three companies involved with that would be Midway's Mortal Kombat

786
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:37,080
team, the Sony Sports Division, and Ubisoft, and they're flat-out refusing to give EGM

787
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,800
access to early previews or reviews, and so basically he said, warning readers, that they're

788
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,240
going to get little, late, or no coverage of these three companies' games, and they

789
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,780
won't treat these products or companies any differently, they'll just cover them to their

790
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:04,240
best ability without their support, because after all, they're writing for the reader,

791
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,320
not them.

792
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,240
So that's kind of interesting that he called them out.

793
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,320
I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies, because after the whole

794
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,720
Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of herd them.

795
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,440
I kind of support the calling out of these companies, yeah, so I don't know.

796
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,540
Part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is such huge news, but I think it

797
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:35,880
is kind of big, because somebody's kind of finally taking a step and saying, let's call

798
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,920
them out on what they're doing, and the fact that if they get negative reviews, they leave

799
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,860
the room with their panties in a huff, but I'm just surprised that somebody would do

800
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:49,160
this to a company like EGM, Ziff Davis, who has the one-up, they have a lot of muscles,

801
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,720
so that seems kind of counterproductive.

802
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,920
Your company is going to put out a game that's not well-liked once in a while, but the same

803
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,080
thing happens with movie studios, and does 20th Century Fox stop showing their movies

804
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,800
to Roger Ebert just because they don't like one of his reviews?

805
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
No?

806
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
You just, you deal.

807
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,760
Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative feedback

808
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
for them.

809
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,680
I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but this isn't the first companies

810
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
to do this.

811
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,600
Apparently, Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from EGM as well, and now they're

812
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,160
back supporting them, so...

813
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
I don't know.

814
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,000
It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game's

815
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,680
going to be exposed to less people, you know?

816
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,160
Coverage is coverage, you know, you may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.

817
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,180
Sometimes too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind

818
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
of ruin it.

819
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,200
Like, you know, it might not be, like, for instance, I did not have a positive experience

820
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,520
with Capcom at one E3, but that's because they had one douchey person representing them

821
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,280
that kind of treated me kind of mean and looked down on me because I wasn't a journalist from

822
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,120
some big, huge magazine or whatever, but I had some shitty little podcast, right?

823
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,880
So that kind of tarnished Capcom's image, but I'm sure there's a lot of great people

824
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,080
that work for that company, and they do put out a lot of very solid games, but it did

825
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,040
kind of leave you this taste in my mouth of, like, wow, Capcom kind of fucking sucks, but

826
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,060
it obviously didn't impact the amount of news or coverage we did on this program, but sometimes

827
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,480
one douchey person can really, you know, so I kind of wonder, maybe it's not necessarily

828
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,320
Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their

829
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,560
feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.

830
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,920
It is pretty bad, and it's all, it wasn't really reviews, it was based on, like, previews

831
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,360
and stuff, because they're being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these

832
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,280
bugs in the game, you know, and hopefully they get worked out, because otherwise, you

833
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,100
know, it's gonna suck.

834
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,880
And I think that's an honest opinion.

835
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,800
And they realize that it's, you know, not finished yet, and that's why they phrased

836
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,520
it in such a way, but, you know, apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you

837
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,480
talk about our game, blah, blah, blah, you know, they only want glowing reviews.

838
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,000
Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit

839
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,240
it to the magazine, then, if you don't want anyone doing that.

840
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,480
Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.

841
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,400
We'll just do it all like press releases or something like that.

842
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,600
Then everybody can own a game magazine.

843
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,200
Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, period.

844
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,480
I mean, when I say public I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know,

845
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,300
literally the public at trade shows and things.

846
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,680
Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, that's all.

847
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,640
That's good customer service, right?

848
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,980
I don't know.

849
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
Right.

850
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,000
Good customer service.

851
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,460
Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're

852
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,700
in a PR department, then your customer is the press, so be careful who you have representing.

853
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,980
Well, and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer

854
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:59,860
service classes when I, you know, worked on the phone, is that for every one person that

855
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,580
is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to

856
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,180
talk to their friends, and they're going to talk to their friends, and they're going to

857
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
talk to their friends.

858
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,920
It's sort of like dropping, you know, a boulder in a lake or something.

859
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,660
Eventually it's going to cause enough waves.

860
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,580
Something I don't talk about a lot on this program, but my day job, I actually am a trainer

861
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,980
for customer service for our call center for a major health insurance company.

862
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:32,580
So you know, I definitely, it always makes me frown when I see poor customer service,

863
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,900
whether it be at a, you know, at a Safeway, Bel Air grocery store type thing, or a, you

864
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
know, video game trade show.

865
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,220
What the hell is wrong with you?

866
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,220
It's easy.

867
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Just be nice.

868
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,220
It's a tough job.

869
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,860
Customer service is a tough job, and so I never, like whenever I call in, if I'm like

870
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,860
totally pissed off, like the, you know, let's say the cable's down or whatever, you know,

871
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,140
it's been down for a long time or whatever, and I call in, I never get mad at the rep.

872
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,940
I just go, I'm really upset about this situation.

873
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,040
What can we do to resolve the situation?

874
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,460
You know, I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job, and it's

875
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
a very challenging job.

876
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,660
And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to

877
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660
try and help you.

878
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,060
Unless they're being douchebags.

879
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,780
Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.

880
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,180
And do not ask for the supervisor first.

881
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Give them a chance.

882
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
Exactly.

883
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,620
SSJ100Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?

884
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,940
Yeah, but that was just a, that was a stupid prank.

885
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
That's different.

886
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Much different.

887
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,940
All right.

888
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,740
Anyhow, let's talk about something else.

889
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,060
Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the diamond card?

890
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,060
Don't you have one of these, Loki?

891
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,060
Yes, I do have one of these.

892
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,540
I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the

893
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,860
Xbox Live diamond card, which gets you discount.

894
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,660
Have you ever used the diamond card out of curiosity?

895
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
No.

896
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
That's what I thought.

897
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,740
I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.

898
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,700
Well, it won't be free much longer.

899
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,560
It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.

900
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,620
Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the diamond

901
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,340
card program is moving over to a new kind of system.

902
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
It's the Passport Unlimited.

903
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,340
So anyhow.

904
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,860
To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what your, unless

905
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:13,660
you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's

906
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,660
not very good.

907
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,800
I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.

908
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,660
It's nothing really, I don't know, it works for me.

909
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,380
I just have one because it's neat.

910
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,660
Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.

911
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,700
I am assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.

912
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:36,500
Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee, and I don't think a lot of people will be.

913
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,780
I don't see why he would need to pay a $7 fee.

914
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,220
Well I don't know if somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, Hitstun in the

915
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,980
chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave and Buster's.

916
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,980
That's a pretty fun place.

917
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,980
Wait a second though.

918
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,840
Let's just think about this for a second.

919
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,380
How are these businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the

920
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,180
diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not?

921
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,780
You're just going to have your card.

922
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,580
Does it have a barcode?

923
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,860
I don't know.

924
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,080
It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.

925
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Expiration date?

926
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,940
I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way...

927
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,940
Loki's getting out the card.

928
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,940
He's getting out his wallet.

929
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,940
He's getting out the card.

930
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
Let's see here.

931
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
Hold on.

932
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,940
That's a good question.

933
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,980
How are they going to know?

934
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,820
It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they

935
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,820
know?

936
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
Oh wait, it has the year on it.

937
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,820
I don't know.

938
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,740
Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.

939
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,940
I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.

940
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,940
They use their student ID years later.

941
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,820
It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year, so...

942
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
But it does have a...

943
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,340
Wait, let me see.

944
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,340
It doesn't have an expiration date?

945
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,340
No, it does.

946
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,340
No, it does.

947
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,340
Expiration 507.

948
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,540
So there you go.

949
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,740
Maybe that's all they know.

950
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,460
They'll send something out to all the retailers that say...

951
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,820
Those things suck anyways, because I remember when that program first came around, it took

952
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:58,740
me like six months to get mine, so even if you paid the $7, you're already pissed away

953
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,740
half a year, so I don't know.

954
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,780
Oh, alright.

955
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,220
So I don't know.

956
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,200
I'd be curious to see if anybody in chat...

957
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,060
Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?

958
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,780
That's what I'd like to know, or get some phone calls on that later.

959
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,980
Meanwhile, while we await that feedback, we'll move on to another story.

960
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:25,500
Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle, and Bust-A-Move, and Bliss Island for the

961
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,820
Xbox 360.

962
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,500
Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.

963
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,980
I don't know, I haven't really played it any, but then there's also...

964
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,340
I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

965
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,700
Peggle is fun, actually.

966
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,220
It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.

967
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,380
You know, I'll say this about the PopCap games.

968
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,580
Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played

969
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,120
are really addicting and fun, and you know, I see people at work playing those games all

970
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,820
the time on their breaks and stuff.

971
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,300
I was going to say, Peggle was confirmed that it is coming out, so PopCap did confirm that

972
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,300
one.

973
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Wow.

974
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
It's fun!

975
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,300
I like Peggle.

976
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,860
So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.

977
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,060
Why would you rate them if they're not?

978
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
Exactly.

979
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,060
Exactly.

980
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,420
Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room, except SSJ100Matt says, I still use

981
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,900
my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts, so...

982
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,300
Yeah, that's the other thing, too.

983
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,980
I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really

984
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,540
going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?

985
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,540
They might not.

986
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:47,340
Or they may just not care, so try it.

987
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:52,220
So with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive, you may be wondering,

988
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,860
what the hell am I going to use this for?

989
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:59,020
Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't

990
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,240
really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out

991
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,700
for a while now.

992
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,420
But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.

993
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,780
Five gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive.

994
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:19,180
Oh, and by the way, that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes.

995
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:25,260
So before you can play your game, you must waste 40 minutes.

996
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,780
Awesome.

997
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,220
And I know that's not the only game that has you install it to its hard drive.

998
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,820
Like for example, Ratchet and Clank, Ridge Racer has the option to do that, I'm pretty

999
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,460
sure Oblivion does, and a bunch of other ones.

1000
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,060
Cool.

1001
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,460
Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?

1002
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460
I think so.

1003
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,980
Does it save that much time by doing so?

1004
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,980
I don't know.

1005
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,980
Probably not.

1006
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,700
You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.

1007
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,060
God damn, that game is great.

1008
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,060
It really is.

1009
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,660
You have to do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.

1010
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,540
Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?

1011
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,540
No.

1012
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,540
At all?

1013
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,540
You know they've got to be making it.

1014
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,180
Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.

1015
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,180
Why?

1016
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,940
I want to go back and play.

1017
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,940
That's not Oblivion.

1018
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
Half-Life 2 or something.

1019
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,940
Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter IV when it's released, because it looks better and

1020
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
better every day.

1021
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,340
I actually like the look of Street Fighter IV.

1022
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,780
I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me, and of course

1023
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,980
Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love,

1024
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,620
like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzim has been announced as well.

1025
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,620
But there's some new characters.

1026
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,560
One of the new ones is Crimson Viper, and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine

1027
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,180
scans that were posted all over the interwebs.

1028
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,740
Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit, but with more boobage,

1029
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,300
like you know King from Art of Fighting, and this big pink ponytail.

1030
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,380
But she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her.

1031
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,580
So she looks like she could be fun.

1032
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:58,420
Dark Soccer, you could probably cosplay that, you know, with the glasses look and everything.

1033
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,420
That's quite alright.

1034
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,420
You don't want to do the boobage?

1035
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,420
Well, I have before.

1036
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:10,220
No, I've cosplayed Biken before from Guilty Gear, because I remember Evan helped me with

1037
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,220
Claw.

1038
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,220
Oh, true true.

1039
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,820
We stayed up for three days working on it.

1040
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,460
They just need to come out with Namco and Capcom need to kind of come together, and

1041
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:25,340
also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter, just like large-breasted women fighting games.

1042
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,380
And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.

1043
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,140
Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.

1044
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,840
Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style, never seen in the Street

1045
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Fighter series.

1046
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,260
Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boops.

1047
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,320
I doubt that.

1048
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,500
Or probably fighting with her hair, although, wait, wasn't that done before?

1049
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,140
I think that was done before somewhere.

1050
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,980
That was Milia in Guilty Gear.

1051
00:51:51,980 --> 00:52:00,160
Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing... at least it's a rumor right now that there's

1052
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,420
another Resident Evil arcade game.

1053
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,540
I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.

1054
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,300
Well, yeah, there were the gun survivor games.

1055
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,180
Oh, those were in the arcade?

1056
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,180
Yeah.

1057
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Oh, cool.

1058
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,220
I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.

1059
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,780
That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.

1060
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:29,900
But the voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working

1061
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:36,540
for M on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.

1062
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,740
She said that she really likes playing Jill.

1063
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,420
And the quote at the end of what she had to say is, you can bet it'll be on the lookout

1064
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:49,060
for the game in arcades there.

1065
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,660
They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.

1066
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,180
I don't know, the gun survivor games are fun.

1067
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,340
That should better be coming to a console.

1068
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
I hope the Wii.

1069
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,340
It should.

1070
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,700
I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.

1071
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,300
Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii with

1072
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,720
the using the gun controller thingy.

1073
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,260
And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.

1074
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,380
Because I don't know about target terror, but something tells me it's not going to be

1075
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,380
that good.

1076
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:23,580
Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old gun survivor games,

1077
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,540
that they, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?

1078
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,620
How it had the controller on it?

1079
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,740
I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've

1080
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,820
got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game.

1081
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,260
And you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have

1082
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,260
your gun.

1083
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:48,340
We were talking about how they should do a walk through House of the Dead that used that

1084
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,340
sort of functionality.

1085
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,780
I think that that would work for a gun survivor.

1086
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,980
That's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.

1087
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Very cool.

1088
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,760
The Skype line will be opening soon, by the way.

1089
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,940
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can always give us a call toll free

1090
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,820
in the U.S. and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1091
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,220
Username on Skype again, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one more story before we get to that.

1092
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,980
So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the Wii

1093
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,360
Ware service is going to actually come out.

1094
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,140
Now a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine

1095
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,780
Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch

1096
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,240
date is scheduled for this March.

1097
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,220
So with, I know, Game Developers Conference right around the corner, maybe that's something

1098
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,860
that they'll talk about since, you know, that would be something that developers would be

1099
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,660
interested in, maybe.

1100
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,940
Oh, that's true.

1101
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,140
That's a really good point, is that possibly that's something we'll be seeing around Game

1102
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,140
Developers Conference.

1103
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,140
I hope so.

1104
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,380
That would make sense, because, you know, something that they can produce games cheaply

1105
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,060
on their service, it would be right up their alley for them to announce something like

1106
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
that.

1107
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,080
I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive

1108
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,700
or something to keep all this crap on that I download.

1109
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,180
I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.

1110
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,620
At least allowing you to put them on, like, memory sticks or something like that.

1111
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,380
Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again doesn't work

1112
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,380
for me.

1113
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,060
What's the point of having a damn SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to

1114
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,380
use it?

1115
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,580
Or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.

1116
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,380
So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?

1117
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,820
I've done that a lot, actually.

1118
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,020
A little silly.

1119
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,020
It's silly, but it's fun.

1120
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,580
So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?

1121
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,580
Only a couple.

1122
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,380
I don't have a lot of friends, I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of

1123
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,380
seeing that.

1124
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,660
I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.

1125
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,460
I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.

1126
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,660
I have it, nah nah nah.

1127
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,060
I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.

1128
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Okay.

1129
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,620
I'd be like, Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.

1130
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,860
Actually, we've had a problem with our Wii Connect.

1131
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,860
Oh no.

1132
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,860
It hasn't wanted to.

1133
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Oh, that sucks.

1134
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,580
So we've had a hard time updating our software.

1135
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,260
So, ew.

1136
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,260
What a bummer.

1137
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,260
All right.

1138
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,460
Well, let's open up the Skype line at username Orange Launch Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1139
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,460
Our Skype line is now open for business.

1140
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,060
And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.

1141
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,060
Hi.

1142
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,060
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

1143
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,060
Who's this?

1144
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,060
This is Ravenstaufen.

1145
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,060
How are you?

1146
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,060
I'm fine.

1147
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,980
And I'm so shocked and odd that you got through first somehow.

1148
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,980
Hello.

1149
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,420
You got a quick finger there dialing in.

1150
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,420
That's all right.

1151
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,420
What's on your mind, buddy?

1152
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,420
What's on my mind?

1153
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,420
Alex Navarro.

1154
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,420
What's on your mind?

1155
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,900
Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.

1156
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,460
We brought him up briefly in part A. What did you want to say?

1157
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,780
You know, that's a shocker.

1158
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,060
You know, the other guy, Greg Provo, left and now Jeff.

1159
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,780
It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.

1160
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,660
It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.

1161
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:53,660
And you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.

1162
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,660
I don't know.

1163
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,100
Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is

1164
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:04,780
just some corporate website and you know, I mean, I don't, I don't really have, you

1165
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,300
know, attachments to reviewers, you know what I mean?

1166
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,060
It's just, I guess you could say, okay, this just continues that fallout from what was

1167
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:20,380
a huge thing that happened in the journalistic industry as a whole late last year, but I

1168
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
don't know.

1169
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,060
I'm kind of over it at this point.

1170
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,060
You know, I think, I think lots of lessons have been learned here that aren't soon to

1171
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,260
be repeated, especially now this whole, you know, now it's, oh, we're not afraid to name

1172
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,540
names after this week.

1173
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,540
You know what I mean?

1174
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,540
What do you think about all that?

1175
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,260
I just watch IGN myself.

1176
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,500
What do you think about the editorial from EGM?

1177
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,260
I just think that's just a little shocking.

1178
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,100
He's just going like, yeah, F them.

1179
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
I don't care.

1180
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,100
Yeah.

1181
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,540
You know, we're blackball you.

1182
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,800
Just send, we'll send you the game.

1183
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
We just rate games.

1184
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,620
So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs

1185
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,620
to do.

1186
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,560
Well, it was kind of, but it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was

1187
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,980
going rawr, we're going to beat you up because he was like, well, we'll review their games

1188
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:09,140
anyway, but it just might be slower because you know, they don't send us the free stuff.

1189
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:12,820
But I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.

1190
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,180
I mean, look at what we're doing.

1191
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,180
Hello.

1192
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,280
You know, but I understand we don't, we're not for profit either and all these guys are.

1193
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,780
So obviously it's a little different, but you know, if you love what you do, you can

1194
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,780
do it.

1195
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,780
I know I do.

1196
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,180
But I understand you got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.

1197
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,860
So what else did you want to share with us Raven's Dolphin?

1198
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Anything else?

1199
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,860
Yes.

1200
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,860
One more thing.

1201
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,740
You were talking about that four girls finger painting.

1202
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:41,180
I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday

1203
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,180
night and they kind of dug me.

1204
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,780
They had to get some digs out of me.

1205
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,940
So I had to watch it live on air.

1206
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,020
So this video is really bad.

1207
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,660
So stay away.

1208
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,820
I've heard things.

1209
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,360
I actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on Perez

1210
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,360
Hilton.com.

1211
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,360
Don't laugh.

1212
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,780
And I saw his reaction video to it and it was kind of funny.

1213
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,860
So is there really on YouTube?

1214
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,780
Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead operator 11.

1215
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,540
Oh, it's on operator 11.

1216
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,300
Really where can I find it?

1217
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:19,860
Under my name, just saying return of Raven's Dolphin under my account.

1218
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,220
How far in the show do I have to look?

1219
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,220
Not far.

1220
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,220
It should be like right there.

1221
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:28,940
It should be like the second one before failure, before the cartoon cast and all that.

1222
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
Search for it later.

1223
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
I'll give you the thing.

1224
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,500
Are you Raven's Dolphin one here?

1225
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Let's see.

1226
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Did you?

1227
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Yeah, I'm one.

1228
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Cartoon cast?

1229
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,500
I don't care about cartoon cast.

1230
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,500
Where's return of Raven's Dolphin?

1231
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Poop on a stick.

1232
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Return of dolphin.

1233
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Poop on a stick.

1234
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Return of dolphin.

1235
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Oh, there it is.

1236
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
Why did you call it poop on a stick?

1237
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
That's kind of nasty.

1238
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Because it is nasty.

1239
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,500
All right.

1240
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,860
Where, where in the show will I see this?

1241
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,420
Right at the very beginning?

1242
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,100
Yeah, it's only six minutes.

1243
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,460
We're not watching all six minutes.

1244
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,460
Just speed it up.

1245
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,460
Speed it up.

1246
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,460
Speed it up.

1247
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,460
It's epic.

1248
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,460
It should be epic.

1249
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,460
I'm doing it right now.

1250
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,460
I'm doing it right now.

1251
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,460
Oh, I think he's doing it.

1252
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,460
Wow, my precious ears.

1253
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,460
I'm sorry.

1254
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,460
That's all right.

1255
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,460
I said it was loud.

1256
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,460
That's all right.

1257
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:25,180
Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.

1258
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,180
It was chaos.

1259
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,180
What do you expect?

1260
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,340
But, I mean, all right.

1261
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,340
Forget it.

1262
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
I'm wasting everybody's time.

1263
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,340
I was doing it from a MacBook.

1264
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
All right.

1265
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
I'm wasting everybody's time.

1266
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,100
Anything else you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?

1267
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Not just that.

1268
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
And bye.

1269
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,100
All right.

1270
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,100
All right.

1271
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,100
If you want to give us a call.

1272
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,100
Forget it.

1273
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,100
Another one's already coming in.

1274
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,100
Hi.

1275
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,100
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1276
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,100
Who's this?

1277
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,100
GS68.

1278
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Hi, GS68.

1279
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,100
What's on your mind?

1280
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:55,020
Well, with the release of Rock Band, as I expected, there are people who think it's

1281
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,500
the first game to have a drum part.

1282
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Wait.

1283
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
I'm sorry.

1284
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
We're in the back.

1285
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
You're a little quiet.

1286
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Get close to your microphone and repeat that.

1287
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
I'm sorry.

1288
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,220
Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people

1289
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,260
who think it's the first game to use drums.

1290
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,260
Oh, yeah.

1291
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,260
Of course.

1292
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,260
Yeah.

1293
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,780
I mean, didn't the same thing happen with Guitar Hero?

1294
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,540
Like, remember how all these awards were lavished upon Guitar Hero for being original?

1295
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah.

1296
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,540
Just an original game, et cetera.

1297
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:24,420
And to be fair, it did, you know, I would say there was a lot original about Guitar

1298
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,420
Hero.

1299
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,060
It wasn't the first game to ever use a guitar, but it was the first one to be so successful.

1300
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,540
But then, remember this?

1301
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:36,180
Remember when, I think it was X-Play, then did a review of Beatmania here in America,

1302
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,540
and they said it was a ripoff of Guitar Hero?

1303
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,340
And like, all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like,

1304
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,340
what the fuck?

1305
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,340
You guys are stupid.

1306
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,340
Right?

1307
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:50,500
It's just kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get

1308
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,660
the credit for doing it first.

1309
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,660
Of course.

1310
01:01:53,660 --> 01:02:00,900
Well, on top of Rock Band's drums, before anyone calls me up and money elite this, Drummino

1311
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,660
is not the first game to have drums.

1312
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:08,500
Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?

1313
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,720
You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?

1314
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,140
Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?

1315
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,460
Like I don't really think there was anything to it.

1316
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,980
Like I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.

1317
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,140
Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.

1318
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:27,540
You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with

1319
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,540
them.

1320
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?

1321
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,540
Bad songs?

1322
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,540
Did they?

1323
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,980
I don't know, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.

1324
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,980
There's nothing like that.

1325
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,980
Interesting.

1326
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,780
I'm not sure.

1327
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,780
When did the first...

1328
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
Well, let's see.

1329
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,700
If Drumscape was out in 96, the first DDR was out in 98.

1330
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,700
So I don't know.

1331
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,220
Actually, I think it was 97 or so.

1332
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:53,220
I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.

1333
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,740
I had to tag it with the tag.

1334
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,460
Well Darktad soon did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.

1335
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,820
So maybe it was around the same time as DrumMania.

1336
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:08,820
But regardless, I mean, I get your point, is that maybe, you know, even so, you could

1337
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:14,180
say that I'm sure there were older games that even made use of drums.

1338
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,620
Maybe not like a full drum peripheral, but I'm trying to think of like older games.

1339
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:22,740
This whole topic came back to me as a recent gif after recent Rockman, and someone's like,

1340
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:29,980
oh, there's another game besides Donkey Kong that uses drums, and that had me face-powling

1341
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,980
for a bit.

1342
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,980
Well, there's also Taiko no Tatujin.

1343
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:33,980
Let's not forget that.

1344
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:34,980
That's kind of a drum game.

1345
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,180
I mean, it's not like a drum set, but certainly it's drums.

1346
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,100
So there's plenty of drum games already out there.

1347
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,420
It's just that Rockband gave it a different twist.

1348
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,180
You can't tell me that Rockband was not like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix

1349
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,100
thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having

1350
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,100
with that.

1351
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,460
But props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.

1352
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,500
I said this before Rockband came out.

1353
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,020
If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.

1354
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,820
And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could

1355
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,780
have had if they just would have put the effort into it.

1356
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,820
But it's a risk they don't want to take.

1357
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,780
I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix and Sugar, Konami's Marvel's Forest music

1358
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:23,340
game is good, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.

1359
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:28,560
It's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do

1360
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,860
accomplishments or high scores.

1361
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,980
That's kind of obscure, though.

1362
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,380
I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.

1363
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,940
That just seems like a logical thing to me.

1364
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,060
I mean, there's lots of games that, I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download,

1365
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,140
if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.

1366
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,100
I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.

1367
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:55,500
All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts

1368
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
for us tonight?

1369
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
No, I'm good.

1370
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,500
All right.

1371
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Well, you have a great week.

1372
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,500
We'll talk to you again.

1373
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,500
You, too.

1374
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Bye-bye.

1375
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,460
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to give us a call.

1376
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,940
Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.

1377
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,660
I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.

1378
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1379
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,140
Who's this?

1380
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,700
I give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.

1381
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,780
Well, hello, Rama.

1382
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,780
How are you?

1383
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,780
I'm doing good.

1384
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,780
How's everybody out there?

1385
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
Hello.

1386
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,780
Good.

1387
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,580
It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic

1388
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:28,380
of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that, you know, you can introduce yourself

1389
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,380
to the listener.

1390
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,500
But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length

1391
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
of time.

1392
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,460
Our buddy in New York City, what is on your mind this week, Rama?

1393
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,140
Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter the later years, right?

1394
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,140
Yes.

1395
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,140
Mm-hmm.

1396
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,780
Look up Minesweeper, the movie.

1397
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,780
Okay.

1398
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,220
I have to see this one.

1399
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,420
That sounds kind of stupid.

1400
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,420
You have to see it.

1401
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,620
It's stupid in a funny way.

1402
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:57,260
Well, briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.

1403
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:03,220
It's like a parody of, like, an epic movie or something like that, counting, like playing,

1404
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,660
it's like real-life Minesweeper.

1405
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,220
It's like, Minesweeper meets, like, a standard army movie.

1406
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,660
That's what it is.

1407
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,660
Very cool.

1408
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,660
Yeah.

1409
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,100
I like those fake movie trailers.

1410
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,100
They're funny.

1411
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,100
Pretty much.

1412
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:22,420
Rama, I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something, and maybe I should

1413
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,660
just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.

1414
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,340
I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lawns Radio very soon, aren't

1415
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,340
you?

1416
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,340
Yeah.

1417
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,340
It's still in the works.

1418
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,540
I'm waiting for my co-host, and looks like it's definitely going to happen.

1419
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:40,060
We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.

1420
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,780
Tell us a little bit about your new show.

1421
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,780
Okay.

1422
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,520
It's called Anime Jam Sessions.

1423
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,220
The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime

1424
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,220
podcast.

1425
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,020
I was listening to a couple of them, and I didn't like it.

1426
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,420
I've always felt that if you don't like it, do something about it.

1427
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,420
Put up or shut up.

1428
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,260
Thus, I started doing it.

1429
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:04,300
I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out, and a lot of people liked it.

1430
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,380
I have me and my friend Koto Usagi, who's going to be my news reporter girl, and I have

1431
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,700
some interviews lined up.

1432
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,660
Basically, we're going to be talking about what's going on in anime, anime movies, anime

1433
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:23,100
games, cosplay, upcoming conventions, and just a touch of randomness here and there.

1434
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,460
Very cool.

1435
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,060
That will definitely be coming to the station soon.

1436
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,060
We don't know what night yet.

1437
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,600
We're still trying to figure that out based on other programs.

1438
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,540
There's another program that I told a year ago we were going to get on our station, and

1439
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,740
it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24-hour

1440
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,380
seven station, but now in 2008, we're trying to go back to that.

1441
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:44,980
We got to get all these other guys, and I got to see if they even still want to be on

1442
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:45,980
the station.

1443
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:51,100
All these other folks are putting together shows, and Dark Soccer, your show coming back

1444
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,100
at some point?

1445
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,100
Hopefully, maybe.

1446
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,580
Well, we've got the computer we're working on, so...

1447
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,300
What about, and I don't know how much I can say about this, but what about your new project?

1448
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,300
I was very excited about that, the one you were going to co-host.

1449
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,040
The new project is in the works.

1450
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:10,220
With my computer being down, it's been hard.

1451
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,700
To those of you that have missed myself, and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were

1452
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:18,180
doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon.

1453
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,180
I hope.

1454
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,180
That's going to be awesome.

1455
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,740
I'm looking forward to it, too.

1456
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,940
So anyhow, so are we going to, and Loki has been talking about, he might even get back

1457
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:25,980
into the swing of things.

1458
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:29,220
It won't be a show that's on our station, though.

1459
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,380
Oh, well, F you then.

1460
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,580
I don't care.

1461
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,060
It's not just an audio program.

1462
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:41,020
And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com,

1463
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,180
and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.

1464
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,220
I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw

1465
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:53,100
around with your time, send us some samples, because we are looking to aggressively expand

1466
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,100
our programming in 2008 to really make ourselves a full-fledged station.

1467
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,460
Because right now, we're kind of a station built around this show, and featuring Travis

1468
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,020
on Saturday night, who also does a pretty kick-ass show, you know what I mean?

1469
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,780
There's not a lot else right now.

1470
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,700
Oh, Diamand has his show, so there's that, too, but there's not a lot.

1471
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:14,020
We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.

1472
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,780
Variety is the spice of life.

1473
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,780
Exactly.

1474
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:21,580
And we're not opposed to, you know, obviously, anime is not video games, but we realize,

1475
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,660
you know, especially with this program, the fan bases cross over a little bit.

1476
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,740
So we're not opposed to, you know, and Travis does a lot of sci-fi, also, you know, kind

1477
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,740
of a cross-section.

1478
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:34,880
So we're not opposed to things that aren't 100% game-related, but are kind of like in

1479
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,860
that same nerdy realm, but just not like G4.

1480
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,660
Okay, you're not going to see Fastlane repeats on Orange Launch Radio anytime soon, okay?

1481
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,660
Mm-hmm.

1482
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,660
Alright.

1483
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,460
Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?

1484
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,980
I did.

1485
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,620
Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.

1486
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,700
I thought it was awesome.

1487
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:54,540
My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture

1488
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,100
you sent and where you saw it.

1489
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,780
Well, anywho, me and my friend, Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but

1490
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:05,860
when we got there, the machine was off, and we were walking around on our way out, and

1491
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:11,740
I see a picture of Mario, and I turn around, and they're at Dave and Buster's Mario Kart

1492
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,740
GP2.

1493
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,740
That's right.

1494
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:17,100
I heard rumors that was coming, so it's kind of neat to see in arcades.

1495
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,300
But the question is, is this one fun?

1496
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,300
Because the other one kind of...

1497
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,300
Yeah.

1498
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,300
It wasn't...

1499
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,820
The first one wasn't that great, I have to admit.

1500
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,140
I will say this much.

1501
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,440
If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because

1502
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,100
I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Racer or anything like

1503
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,100
that.

1504
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,820
But I can play, and it's just totally fun.

1505
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:41,020
Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick

1506
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,700
up different weapons and stuff.

1507
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:48,420
GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.

1508
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,860
That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games,

1509
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,880
if you come in first place, you get a free game.

1510
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,940
You basically have to pay for each round when you play.

1511
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,500
That sucks.

1512
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,500
I would probably...

1513
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,060
You know what I love at Dave and Buster's that I would probably play instead is that

1514
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,300
fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.

1515
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,300
I kick ass.

1516
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,660
Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there, just playing it.

1517
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,020
It's just uber fun.

1518
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,420
And, yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.

1519
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,420
Absolutely, jumping jackpot.

1520
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,420
Painting fingers.

1521
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,860
Alright, Rama, we gotta let you go.

1522
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,060
Any quick final thoughts?

1523
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,980
Yeah, about the LAN adapter for GameCube.

1524
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:28,420
One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.

1525
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:34,420
You had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.

1526
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,740
You could use that with Double Dash?

1527
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,740
I forgot.

1528
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,740
Yes, you can.

1529
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,740
Eight player play.

1530
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,740
Yes, you can.

1531
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,740
Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.

1532
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,940
Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of man that was

1533
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,940
ever used.

1534
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,940
Probably.

1535
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,820
If we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a

1536
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:54,620
hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if they were a few floors

1537
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,620
down below us.

1538
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,660
Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.

1539
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,380
I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.

1540
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,740
Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.

1541
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:05,740
Okay, Rama, we really gotta let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

1542
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,740
Bye-bye.

1543
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,780
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

1544
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,780
Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

1545
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,140
Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.

1546
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:18,900
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was Gizmodo blog.

1547
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,900
They were at CES.

1548
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,900
Did you hear about this?

1549
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:25,500
They got some TV-begone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.

1550
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,820
We actually have a little bit of a clip here.

1551
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:34,580
Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?

1552
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,020
Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.

1553
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,700
It doesn't work.

1554
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,700
People are playing this game.

1555
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:44,060
Just the TV guy shutting it all off.

1556
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,700
And if you want to see the full videos, post to gizmodo.com.

1557
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,580
And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish, and it was.

1558
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,580
I mean, it's funny.

1559
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,940
I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way, but

1560
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,700
you kind of look in retrospect, and you go, what a dick, right?

1561
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,700
What a dick.

1562
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,740
And they actually post in the Gizmodo blog.

1563
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,380
They say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some

1564
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,460
people's jobs harder, and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.

1565
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,780
We're sorry.

1566
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:16,700
And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh

1567
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:22,020
down on this guy who is going around shutting off the computers.

1568
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,260
We have been informed of inappropriate behavior on the show floor by a credentialed media

1569
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,040
attendee from the website Gizmodo, owned by Gawker Media, specifically the Gizmodo staffer

1570
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,820
interfered with the exhibitor booth operations of numerous companies, including disrupting

1571
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:33,820
at least one press event.

1572
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:38,260
The Gizmodo staffer violated the terms of CES media credentials and caused harm to CES

1573
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,260
exhibitors.

1574
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,340
The Gizmodo staffer has been identified and will be barred from attending any future CES

1575
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:43,340
events.

1576
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,560
Additional sanctions against Gizmodo and Gawker Media are under discussion.

1577
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,660
I say a well-deserved ban.

1578
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,540
I realize it might have been funny in the moment, and in a dick-jerk kind of way it

1579
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:58,860
is funny, but if you're going to be a dick-jerk, expect to get punished like a dick-jerk does.

1580
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
Get jerked back?

1581
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,860
Yep.

1582
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:06,860
So, a well-deserved ban from CES, and the reason why also I say that is because it gives

1583
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:11,560
a bad name to bloggers and independent media everywhere when these guys get invited and

1584
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,560
do this.

1585
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,920
This is why we get treated like crap at press events.

1586
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:21,020
No, this is not why we get treated like crap at press events, but they treat us like crap

1587
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,260
anyways and then they invite these guys, and I'm not going to say that certain other media

1588
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,420
outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media

1589
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:37,300
outlets came in drunk to certain press events, and that's all I have to say about that.

1590
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
I remember that one.

1591
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,300
It was interesting.

1592
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,820
Maybe we should be naming names on this show.

1593
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,620
Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names

1594
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,580
of the journalists, but not tonight.

1595
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,300
We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.

1596
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,020
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange

1597
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,020
Launch Radio.

1598
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,580
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1599
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,580
Who's this?

1600
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,780
This is Ross Deal UT.

1601
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,080
Ross Deal UT.

1602
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,300
What is on your mind, buddy?

1603
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,300
A few things.

1604
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,420
First off, yeah, I agree.

1605
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:11,500
That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.

1606
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,940
That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.

1607
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,740
I know.

1608
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:20,540
You laugh for 30 seconds and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at

1609
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,540
this.

1610
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,540
It really isn't funny in retrospect.

1611
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,540
That's so funny.

1612
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,540
Loki, you're just an asshole.

1613
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:35,340
Yeah, I was about to say Loki is a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is that doing that

1614
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:41,660
during the presentations, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody lost their job over that crap.

1615
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,660
That's just wrong.

1616
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:47,540
Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.

1617
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:55,700
And I think that's why CES is saying we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to

1618
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,780
do against Gawker and all that stuff is because I think they're waiting to see what the response

1619
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,780
is going to be.

1620
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:04,220
And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.

1621
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,400
They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.

1622
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,540
But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it.

1623
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,540
So what?

1624
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,860
And then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.

1625
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:19,620
Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.

1626
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,020
Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.

1627
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,020
That could be a problem.

1628
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:28,780
It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see.

1629
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,780
We'll see.

1630
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,780
Yeah, we'll see.

1631
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:34,780
Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.

1632
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:39,300
You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?

1633
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,300
No.

1634
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,300
That's cool.

1635
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,300
No, it wasn't.

1636
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
Yeah.

1637
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:51,700
Apparently, the FBI went to this kid in Texas that fucked up the exact city, but apparently

1638
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:57,500
the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, you know, the radiation

1639
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,500
in their houses doubled.

1640
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,500
This was a few years ago.

1641
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,500
No, no.

1642
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
This was recent.

1643
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,260
Oh, it happened again?

1644
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,820
Yeah.

1645
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:10,740
It was posted on January 10th, actually.

1646
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,940
I've read something about something similar a few years ago.

1647
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,780
Tigerclaw just posted the link in our chat.

1648
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,500
Apparently, it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.

1649
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,060
I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else, but it wasn't

1650
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,060
a game.

1651
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,060
It was like this 11-year-old genius.

1652
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,580
Yeah, 11-year-old kid.

1653
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:31,860
I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought

1654
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,940
it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.

1655
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,420
Let me read this from Kotaku here.

1656
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,580
The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.

1657
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,740
He said he started studying physics around the eighth grade.

1658
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,140
He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.

1659
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,480
These things are in your tap water, you know, in the dirt.

1660
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,500
You could hold a Geiger counter up to a banana and get a count off of it.

1661
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,040
He's always been curious about how things work and likes to do his own experiments.

1662
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,940
The man decided to create a small-scale nuclear reaction in the same room he plays his video

1663
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,500
games as his latest experiment.

1664
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,500
What a weirdo.

1665
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,020
Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.

1666
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,660
You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.

1667
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,940
It's like 30 bucks.

1668
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,940
Seriously.

1669
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,340
Yeah, I thought they put him in my little hand.

1670
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,880
Rockwall, Texas.

1671
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,140
So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this

1672
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:19,580
guy, you know, just in case.

1673
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:24,020
And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.

1674
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,700
You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.

1675
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,060
Then that's when you blog about it.

1676
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:35,340
I agree with SSJ 100 Matt saying in chat, leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill

1677
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,340
Nye.

1678
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:39,140
Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?

1679
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,820
Zombie Mr. Wizard.

1680
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,820
There it is.

1681
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:43,820
There it is.

1682
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:50,740
This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear

1683
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,740
reactor in.

1684
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,740
Wait for it.

1685
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:59,220
If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.

1686
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,700
Games made him do it.

1687
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:08,500
The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee, and the radiation

1688
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,020
level was actually fairly safe.

1689
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,020
That's what I need.

1690
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,180
A nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.

1691
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:22,260
But it was a 15-year-old using graduate level physics textbooks and used vacuum pump manufacturer

1692
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,660
manuals and scoured the web for two times.

1693
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,300
Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.

1694
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,020
They should be going to offer him a job.

1695
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,820
They should be freaking sending him to college.

1696
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,780
This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.

1697
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:38,100
With all this attention, he's going to be working in a university, so no time at all.

1698
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,620
We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.

1699
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,620
All right.

1700
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,620
Well, here it is.

1701
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,780
Any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty, on YouTube?

1702
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:51,940
Well, one other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three

1703
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:52,940
companies.

1704
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:53,940
I'm going to be honest with you.

1705
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,980
I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.

1706
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:04,060
The thing is with the 1UP Network is that, really, they're a little more than a tabloid.

1707
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:09,580
It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being

1708
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,980
sensational.

1709
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,300
I knew that word was going to come into play.

1710
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,100
I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking sensationalist, which I kind

1711
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
of agree.

1712
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:24,040
Listen, I mean, you remember after Gerstmann got fired, the whole thing with the protest

1713
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,140
in front of the CNET building?

1714
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,420
You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalist.

1715
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,620
It's not like they come to press events drunk.

1716
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,620
Oh, wait, no, no.

1717
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,620
They do.

1718
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,620
I'm safe.

1719
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,620
Yes, they do.

1720
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,620
They do their podcast drunk.

1721
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,620
What are you talking about?

1722
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:44,100
To be fair, we have two, but you know.

1723
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,840
Yeah, but also, we don't get paid.

1724
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,300
Nobody pays us to do this program.

1725
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,780
We pay to do this program.

1726
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,020
That's how sick we are.

1727
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,020
You know what I mean?

1728
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:54,220
But I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.

1729
01:20:54,220 --> 01:21:00,460
These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit

1730
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,460
in the entire gaming big review industry.

1731
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:06,260
And you see it in their reviews.

1732
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,140
They go out of their way to be negative.

1733
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:12,700
You look at, particularly in the EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that

1734
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,260
quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.

1735
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,820
They wanted, I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they

1736
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:23,900
could say, hey, look how negative we can be, we're not like GameSpot.

1737
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:24,900
Interesting perspective.

1738
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,820
You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because again, I don't really read a lot of

1739
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,820
these sites.

1740
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:30,820
I really don't.

1741
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,980
Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but like secretly I'm like

1742
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,700
watching every move they make.

1743
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,700
But I just don't.

1744
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,540
I don't, I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.

1745
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:46,000
You know, I actually, this is a little off topic, but IGN did, lately their thing is

1746
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,620
they've been reviewing some of the Destiny games, the data design stuff, you know, the

1747
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,340
absolute shit on, you know, the Wii.

1748
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:58,980
And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man, and

1749
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,360
of course it got a really low score, and then they did a video review for it.

1750
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:08,020
But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally

1751
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,020
a minute long.

1752
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,540
He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?

1753
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:12,640
It has platforms and jumping.

1754
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,920
That's about it.

1755
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,340
And that was the end of the video review.

1756
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:20,740
It's like, seriously, don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're gonna do.

1757
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,740
Take it seriously.

1758
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,940
Even though the game is crap, you gotta point out, you can do it funny, but point out why

1759
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:29,380
it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did win it for

1760
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,380
you.

1761
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,380
I mean, that's stupid.

1762
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:37,860
Yeah, now that you're talking about that, you know, not enough people are doing good,

1763
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,860
funny reviews.

1764
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:43,060
I mean, you remember the old Alex Avar review for Big Rigs?

1765
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,260
I mean, that was hilarious.

1766
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,620
What about the kid from Zero Punctuation, is it?

1767
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,620
Oh, I love that kid.

1768
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,620
He's awesome.

1769
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,740
That's what we need to see more of.

1770
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:59,180
I mean, if people would do more witty reviews, you wouldn't see this obsession over the score.

1771
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,900
People would actually stick around for the content.

1772
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,700
But has that guy ever done a positive review?

1773
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,820
I mean, isn't that kind of the joke, that all his reviews like tear apart the games?

1774
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,820
He likes Pagle.

1775
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,820
He likes Pagle.

1776
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:09,820
He likes Psychonauts.

1777
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:14,540
He generally likes Assassin's Creed.

1778
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:18,780
The thing is with him is that he'll point out, he looks at the games, he just looks

1779
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,180
at the games to look at the games.

1780
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:25,940
He's not, you know, the fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.

1781
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,820
I think as long as there's a balance to it.

1782
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,820
He tells it like it is.

1783
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:32,260
Like, I don't like the people who do nothing but negative reviews.

1784
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:36,500
I mean, it's kind of like, okay, you know, haha, joke's over, you know, move on.

1785
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,500
Exactly.

1786
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,500
Show us both sides.

1787
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Be balanced.

1788
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,740
Well, I gotta wrap up, because we want to try and take one more call before we close

1789
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,740
the show tonight.

1790
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:47,300
We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?

1791
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,860
Embrace false idols.

1792
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:49,860
Goodbye.

1793
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,860
Alright.

1794
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:51,860
Bye-bye.

1795
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:56,340
So, I guess RasteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.

1796
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,340
I don't know what to say.

1797
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,340
Alright.

1798
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,780
We'll take one more call if we have any time, or I'm sorry, if we have any more people who

1799
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,780
want to call in.

1800
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,500
Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1801
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,100
Meanwhile, any last minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?

1802
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,860
I don't really have a last minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an

1803
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,580
exploding baby in it.

1804
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:21,140
So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.

1805
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,820
I'm so happy for you.

1806
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:29,180
Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.

1807
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,220
I look forward to his reviews every week.

1808
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,840
We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.

1809
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,340
Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.

1810
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,420
Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?

1811
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,340
Um, no.

1812
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:44,340
Alright.

1813
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,700
One more call.

1814
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1815
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,700
Who's this?

1816
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,700
This is BT.

1817
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,700
Hey, Dartetsuya.

1818
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,700
What's on your mind, buddy?

1819
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,700
Oh, nothing.

1820
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,700
Not on call.

1821
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,700
Just chilling?

1822
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:54,700
Listening to OLR?

1823
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:55,700
Yeah.

1824
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,700
Just chilling?

1825
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,700
Oh, yeah.

1826
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:02,700
What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?

1827
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,700
Pretty interesting.

1828
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,020
That's right.

1829
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,020
Interesting stuff.

1830
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:11,540
Pretty good stuff, yeah.

1831
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,980
What are games you've been playing this week?

1832
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:19,660
Well, actually there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.

1833
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,700
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

1834
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,700
I have not.

1835
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,180
Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

1836
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:28,460
Well, basically it's like an adventure game.

1837
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:36,260
I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games that when you go around and

1838
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,780
you collect items and kill enemies, sort of like a Castlevania.

1839
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,980
A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.

1840
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:43,980
Oh, that's kind of cool.

1841
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,980
MSX.

1842
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,780
I haven't heard that system name in a long time.

1843
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,780
Yeah.

1844
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:53,940
I'm looking at a post you made in our forums on the freeware game thread, and it looks

1845
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,940
like you're...

1846
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:55,940
Yeah, I updated it.

1847
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:59,220
You call out a La Mulana, and you say it's an old-school-style adventure game designed

1848
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,600
to look like an old MSX game.

1849
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,060
There's all sorts of craziness going on in it.

1850
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,900
A hidden mini-game that's a nod to both Snatcher and Tokimeki Memorial.

1851
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,220
That's pretty funny.

1852
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:12,740
Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.

1853
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:17,420
That's funny.

1854
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,140
But the game is hard?

1855
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:22,340
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:25,140
They don't give you any health or anything, I don't think.

1857
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,140
So there's no cheat mode.

1858
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,140
No help mode.

1859
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,380
No, I mean, there was a trick I learned at one of the...

1860
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,340
There was this video walk-through.

1861
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:38,860
There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.

1862
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,860
So that might help.

1863
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,860
Wow.

1864
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,860
This is a lot...

1865
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,660
I'm looking at the site where this is posted.

1866
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:47,300
It looks like somebody says it took 26 hours for him to get through the game.

1867
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,300
That's crazy.

1868
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,300
Oh, wow.

1869
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,300
Yeah.

1870
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,460
Well, that is a labor of love right there.

1871
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:55,820
It even kind of has a... it looks like an old-ass...

1872
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:59,540
Oh, yeah, that totally looks like an old MSX game or an NES game.

1873
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,540
Yeah.

1874
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,540
Wow, that's cool.

1875
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,540
So check that out.

1876
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,540
It's called La Mulana.

1877
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,580
All right, well, Darktitsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners

1878
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:07,580
today?

1879
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,580
No, not really.

1880
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,940
I think that's about it.

1881
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:11,940
All right.

1882
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,940
So go play La Mulana.

1883
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:13,940
Go play some more.

1884
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:14,940
Yeah.

1885
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,940
All right.

1886
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:16,940
Take care, buddy.

1887
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,940
You too.

1888
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,940
All right, bye-bye.

1889
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,780
All right, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and

1890
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,780
end the show.

1891
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,100
And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent

1892
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:32,100
Hill Origin, which apparently he says that the whole series jumped the shark, and between

1893
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,420
Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and

1894
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,300
all this stuff, right?

1895
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,580
Origins coming out in Plague Station 2 soon.

1896
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,500
I'm actually going to pick that up, because I didn't bother to get it on the PSP, because

1897
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,420
I just can't see a scary game on the PSP, but I'll play it on PS2.

1898
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,820
They also have Twisted Metal head-on coming out on PS2 for 20 bucks.

1899
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:52,540
By the way, do you know what I found on the internets?

1900
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:58,060
I actually found the soundtrack to Silent Hill Origins, and it's got some kick-ass music

1901
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,060
in it.

1902
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,060
Let me see.

1903
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,660
Totally need to give that to me.

1904
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,060
I will totally give that to you.

1905
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,060
Let me see.

1906
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:08,620
I'm going to play a little teaser for those of you guys listening, because there's some

1907
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,620
really kick-ass songs.

1908
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,780
I mean, it's more Kiryamoka doing some great stuff.

1909
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:13,780
Let's see.

1910
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,780
What was...

1911
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,780
Oh, this song I think I liked.

1912
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:19,020
Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you the name of it, because the songs aren't labeled, but

1913
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,020
here's one.

1914
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:39,420
Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.

1915
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,700
There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week, so I'm sure there's

1916
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,180
a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.

1917
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,780
Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.

1918
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,780
Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?

1919
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,780
Nope.

1920
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,780
Dark Soccer.

1921
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,780
You got anything?

1922
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,780
Nope.

1923
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,780
All good.

1924
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,780
All right.

1925
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,780
Well, then we're good.

1926
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:58,780
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1927
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,780
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you tonight.

1928
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:02,300
I like these cookies.

1929
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,140
My final thought is penguins are cute.

1930
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,700
Loki.

1931
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,780
This game filler is pretty fun.

1932
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,660
All right.

1933
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:14,140
Thank you guys, everybody, for tuning into our program and downloading us this week.

1934
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,940
Remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word.

1935
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:21,820
Tell two people you know about our show or leave us a positive review on iTunes.

1936
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:26,540
We haven't had a positive review post on iTunes in a long time, so please send us one of those

1937
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:30,980
or just tell people you know because we have to rely on word of mouth to get the word out

1938
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:34,860
about our show because we're not backed by any big corporate website or any of that stuff,

1939
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:40,040
so it's really the fans that make this all possible, and to that we say thank you.

1940
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,580
Because we're so happy that you guys love us, we'll do this all again next week.

1941
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,940
Sound like a plan?

1942
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:45,940
Okay.

1943
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,220
So next week, by the way, is a three-day weekend.

1944
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,220
I know.

1945
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:52,180
So you never know what kind of chaos might break out on a three-day weekend.

1946
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,380
If I've got someone to come pick me up, oh hell yeah.

1947
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,380
Oh hell yeah.

1948
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:00,340
It's on next weekend and just in time for the return of the webcam, hopefully, too.

1949
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:03,260
So all right.

1950
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,380
Tune in next week.

1951
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,020
Same bat time, same bat channel.

1952
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,020
See ya.

1953
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,020
