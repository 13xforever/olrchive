0	5720	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5720	11640	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11640	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19480	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19480	25800	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 6th of 2008.
25800	28480	Feels a little weird to be saying that, 2008.
28480	31480	Hopefully I can remember to start actually writing that on my check soon.
31480	35120	As we are taping the show tonight, you know, we tape live,
35120	38880	the Consumer Electronics Show is going on, or I should say is kicking off
38880	43600	with their keynote speeches and Microsoft is delivering theirs right now while we're taping the show.
43600	48000	Loki's been watching, keeping an eye on it during the break and while we were taping part A.
48000	51600	Anything come up yet? I know they're not finished, but has anything come up so far?
51600	54480	Yeah, they just kind of, they briefly went over everything.
54480	58360	They were talking a little bit about some mobile platforms and stuff like that.
58360	62240	In fact, actually that's what they're talking about a new telephone service right now.
62240	65720	And apparently I guess their sync service, you know, the one that he keeps in the commercials for,
65720	68680	is basically going to be ripping off OnStar.
68680	73680	Including, you know, if you get in an accident, sync will call, you know, 911, you know,
73680	76800	and then play them a song or something.
76800	80840	No, they'll tell them that you've been in an accident and get, you know, help and stuff.
80840	86120	But anyways, gaming related stuff, they've announced a whole lot of stuff.
86120	93720	Really the couple things they announced, of course, they've sold 17.7 million units worldwide so far to date.
93720	99960	Did 3.5 billion dollars in business through November.
99960	104520	And right now, of course, passed a 10 million member mark on live.
104520	110280	They did announce that their Xbox Live video marketplace is going to have some new additions,
110280	115720	including ABC and Disney are going to be bringing their TV shows to live.
115720	118360	So they're going to get, you know, Lost and Desperate Housewives.
118360	120120	Lost, Desperate Housewives, that kind of stuff.
120120	122040	Gotcha.
122040	128680	Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding MGM movies as well, they're going to be coming.
128680	134160	In the UK, they're going to be offering their medium room service, which is like a, you know,
134160	136680	their IPTV and that kind of thing.
136680	142320	Apparently, though, there's going to be a company, British Telecommunication, I think, BT,
142320	147120	they're going to be partnering with them to use the 360 as a set-top box.
147120	150000	So basically, you'll be able to watch TV, I guess, through that.
150000	150800	So that's kind of neat.
150800	156480	But they have no, you know, Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.
156480	157680	Yeah, though, it's still going on.
157680	158720	It's still going on.
158720	162160	Right now, they're doing some phone service and they're showing that you can watch.
162160	163200	What was the thing you were talking about?
163200	169360	Right when we were doing the, not commercial, but the music break between Part A and B here live,
169360	172960	you were mentioning something about a Zune MySpace type thing?
172960	174560	Yeah, they have the Zune Social.
174560	178320	It's going to be, you know, basically a part of their website.
178320	179840	You can create your own page.
179840	186640	You can make, you know, it'll have your Zune pic and your Zune tag and that kind of stuff.
186640	192800	And it'll basically show all your stats, kind of what you're listening to, your top three songs,
193440	197280	you know, songs that you've flagged as your favorites, that kind of thing.
197280	199360	And customers will be able to go through there.
199360	201280	So it's last FM for your Zune?
201280	201840	Sort of, yeah.
201840	204560	And you can listen to songs that other people are listening to.
204560	208640	You can buy those songs and you can visit their friends and,
208640	210640	you know, listen to songs and that kind of thing.
212400	213200	Interesting.
213200	215840	Seems like everybody's trying to get in on that MySpace, though.
216400	220400	Kind of, it's going to, we're going to get social networked out before too long.
220400	223520	I mean, how many of those freaking social network profiles can you have?
223520	228640	Yeah, and right now they're talking about, you know, connected entertainment, I guess,
228640	233520	is their theme right now, talking about being able to, you know, hook everything up between,
233520	240960	you know, the TV, your Windows PC, your mobile PC, your Zune, et cetera.
240960	241440	Interesting.
242560	246640	Now, Sakura Max is in our chat right now at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
246640	249120	and really doesn't give a shit about anything you're saying, Loki.
249120	252800	What Sakura Max wants to know is how many copies of Eye of Judgment have moved?
252800	255200	That's what we really want the update on.
255200	255600	I don't know.
255600	258880	We haven't gotten the new MPD numbers yet.
258880	260640	But we're not close to a million yet, are we?
260640	263200	Fuck, we haven't even broken a hundred thousand yet.
264480	264960	All right.
266400	270800	Let's go ahead and go back to the gaming news then and Loki will keep one eye on the
271360	273600	Consumer Electronics Show speech and let us know.
273600	274240	Just break in.
274240	275840	If anything really big is announced, just break in, okay?
275840	276400	Definitely.
276400	276720	All right.
276720	280880	Anyways, let's start things off, and this is a little bit surprising.
280880	284960	Apparently, Nintendo is no longer shipping the Wavebird to stores right now.
285760	287680	They have kind of phased out that system.
288240	293920	No word though of, you know, I guess I really wish that they would just allow the classic
293920	295440	controller to play GameCube games.
295440	299600	I think that would make things a lot easier because it's a pain in the ass to have a GameCube
299600	301760	controller play GameCube games and stuff.
301760	302560	I don't know.
302560	308480	But right now, apparently, there's no other way, you know, to play your classic games
308480	310960	on the Virtual Console if you don't have a GameCube controller.
310960	316720	I guess you could buy a wired controller or one of those third-party controllers that's
316720	318160	like a Wavebird like I have.
319360	322160	The Wavebird is an amazing piece of hardware too.
322160	323200	I mean, everybody knows that.
323200	327920	It's like a really great game controller and, you know, it was obviously, you know, it was
327920	332800	wireless kind of before you had the Xbox 360 wireless and PS3, you know, 6-axis or whatever.
333840	334800	Just a great peripheral.
334800	339040	It's kind of weird that it's going away now before Smash Brothers Melee is out.
339040	342320	So if you were hoping to control Smash Brothers Melee with a Wavebird, you'd better get your
342320	343840	hands on it if you don't already have one.
343840	344800	Yeah, I've got mine.
345440	346720	I don't have one, sadly.
346720	350800	One of the things I was talking about, real quick, just to break in with the CES stuff.
350800	358960	They were talking about how, I guess, that there's this new phone service that they're
358960	360400	doing that I think is called Tell Me.
360400	364480	It will actually allow you to use your phone.
364480	367040	Like, say for example, it has GPS and stuff.
367040	370640	You walk up to a theater, it will show you on the phone what's playing there and that
370640	371760	kind of stuff and all the information.
371760	372480	You can buy tickets.
373040	378720	One of the other things that they're showing is you can actually use your phone's camera
378720	382080	to point in that building and get directions to how to get to the building.
383600	385920	What the building is and that kind of stuff.
385920	387520	It will know, I guess.
388640	389040	Freaky.
389040	390160	Kind of freaky.
390160	394480	Pretty soon it's going to be the Jetsons flying cars, video phones, all that stuff.
395200	396560	We already have video phones.
396560	398720	I guess we kind of do with the internet.
398720	399920	We have teleconferencing.
399920	401520	Hey, you know, actually, I'll say this.
402080	404960	I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but I've got to say this is pretty awesome.
406080	407840	Maybe I mentioned this last week.
407840	411360	No, I couldn't have because the New Year's thing happened after last week.
411360	416320	But I had a little New Year's get-together here at the place and Shane is obviously a
416320	416960	good friend of mine.
416960	422000	Meek Latavi has been on the show before, he doesn't live here anymore because Konami
422000	424560	folded in the Bay Area, so he went back to Kansas.
424560	427840	So he's back there and he couldn't come to the party.
427840	432720	But we got on the Xbox 360 cam and I hooked up the cam and so we could all wave at him
432720	433440	through the camera.
435040	437520	I was talking on the phone with him at the same time because he doesn't have a headset
437520	438080	or whatever.
438080	441680	So it was kind of like a way for him to see everybody without actually being here.
441680	442800	I just thought that was really neat.
443360	445520	That's kind of a video phone in that regard.
445520	452320	And that's sort of what I was thinking because even now a lot of cameras like that one, Scott,
452320	454720	doesn't that one have a microphone on it?
454720	455760	Well, iSight, oh yeah.
456400	462080	So really all you need is a camera with a microphone and speaker and there you go.
463360	469680	So that was the equivalent you had with the Xbox camera and being on the phone.
470400	474960	It's not too far off to being an everyday thing available in the home, I think.
474960	478880	Yeah, it's kind of surprising we're not already there because I remember that was a big thing
478880	481920	they always talked about like in the 80s and 90s was the video phone.
481920	482560	Kind of interesting.
482560	488240	It's more, I think, something that they've put more in a business-oriented type market
488240	492240	though because I've worked at places that had video teleconferencing.
493440	496400	And sometimes I answer the phone right after I get out of the shower.
496400	498640	People don't need to see that, you know what I mean?
498640	502800	So I have the option of, you know, this is an unlisted wall.
502800	506320	Never call this wall again!
506320	507200	Or a space ball bathroom.
507200	509120	I'll have to have the phone removed from my bathroom.
509120	510960	Oh, space balls.
510960	513120	Oh, oh that's, oh my god.
513120	515280	That's been a long time since I've seen that movie.
515280	520320	All right, anyhow, Dark Tetsuya was asking if we were playing Strip Uno.
520320	521760	No, perv.
523120	527200	But you do bring up a good point because I have joked on this program that Strip Uno
527200	530160	is really the only reason to have an Xbox 360 cam right now.
530160	533360	Well, I found another decent use for it, so there you go.
535040	539520	There was a New York Times story that came out earlier this week that said that pretty
539520	544400	soon on the Nintendo Wii, you are going to be able to download DS games to your Wii.
544400	548160	And we all thought this sounded like a pretty nice idea and something that, you know, seems
548160	549120	kind of logical.
549120	553200	I mean, after all, you can download original Xbox games on your Xbox and you can download
553200	555360	all these other console, you know, games on your Wii.
555360	557440	Why not be able to download DS games as well?
557440	564160	Well, the smacketh was laid downeth and you cannot actually download full DS games coming
564160	564560	to the Wii.
564560	566160	That is not in the future.
566160	571600	What is in the future, however, is what Japan already has, the DS demos being downloaded
571600	574960	from your Wii to the Nintendo DS, which I think we all saw coming.
575840	578480	That functionality is almost already there to an extent.
578480	582560	You can't download them yet, but if you own a copy of Geometry Wars Galaxies, you can
582560	586640	actually beam a copy of Geometry Wars DS version to your DS.
586640	589040	So that functionality is already there in some games.
591360	595680	But no full DS games at this time, which, you know, is fine because that would mean
595680	600160	there would have to be a whole other memory unit, which means they would probably unleash
600160	604320	a, you know, I'll bet you anything if they do remodel the DS, a new DS remodel is going
604320	606640	to come out with some type of onboard memory so they can do that.
607280	608160	But we'll see.
608160	609440	It wouldn't surprise me.
609440	609680	Yeah.
609680	617520	Well, someone decided to be original, as I say this in humongous quote fingers, and bring
617520	626240	out a peripheral for the cell phone to play different games on that is called a Z-Mote
627440	629600	put out by the company called Z2.
629600	630720	It's a Bluetooth.
631840	636560	It looks just like the Wiimote, only smaller, fits in, you know, directly in your palm,
636560	643680	has an analog stick and buttons on the bottom, and it has a functional motion sensing.
646640	649840	But yeah, it's not based off the Wiimote at all.
649840	654640	On the Nintendo Wiimote, isn't the button on the Wiimote referred to as the Z button?
655440	657120	Isn't that the Z button in games?
657120	660080	On the Nunchuck, it's the Z button.
660080	661040	That's what I thought.
661040	665520	When you do a little ground pound in Smash, or in Mario Galaxy, that's the Z button you're
665520	666000	hitting, right?
666000	666880	Mm-hmm.
666880	668880	Yeah, this isn't going to be a lawsuit at all or anything.
668880	669280	No.
669280	671120	Oh, but it's black.
672240	674000	Oh, then that makes all the difference.
674000	675120	And it looks like it's matte.
675120	676400	It's not shiny.
676400	677680	Oh, well, shit.
678240	679760	That just means the parts are cheaper.
683520	683840	Yeah.
684720	687680	But I mean, seriously, what games are you going to play on your cell phone with this?
688240	688720	Come on.
689680	690320	Really, kids.
690320	693840	Maybe if you're trying to play Pac-Man, because I can tell you from experience that Super
693840	696880	Pac-Man on a cell phone is damn near impossible.
696880	697840	Yeah, really.
698880	702800	One thing that is damn near impossible is to get a damn game that's not censored in
702800	703280	some way.
703840	709120	And unfortunately, Metal Slug 3 has been censored in the US on Xbox Live Arcade.
709920	718480	Instead of spewing streams of blood in the zombie stage, you spew streaming something,
718480	719440	some white substance.
719440	719760	Sweat!
721280	722080	White substance.
722080	723440	That's even worse, I think.
723440	729280	But yes, you shoot streams of semen.
729280	734080	Anyways, that's even grosser than blood.
734080	741120	But if you want to fix it so that there's blood again, all you have to do is just basically
741120	745280	trick the game into thinking that you're Japanese by changing your region to Japan.
745280	748320	Leave it to the chat room to call it Bukake Slug 3.
748320	749200	You know what, though?
749200	758320	That's not anything new from SNK, because I've got Samurai Shodown 2 on Neo Geo, and
758320	763040	if you change your region on it, it will change the blood in the game from red to white.
763040	765280	So that's old hat for them.
765280	765840	Interesting.
767920	771440	By the way, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but I did play the Metal Slug
771440	775440	3 on Xbox Live Arcade, and I've got to say, you know, Loki and I especially give Metal
775440	779040	Slug a lot of shit on this program for kind of being the same game over and over.
779040	781920	I did have a shitload of fun with Metal Slug 3.
781920	783840	I almost called it Metal Gear 3.
783840	787280	Metal Slug 3 is actually a shitload of fun, and I bet it will be a lot of fun to play
787280	788000	in co-op mode.
788800	791680	The zombie stage is like my freaking favorite in the whole game.
791680	797760	But nevertheless, the news about a desensitized version of Metal Slug and the fact that things
797760	802560	have to be toned down for us here in America because we can't handle the blood, that just
802560	804080	incites rage within us.
804080	808000	I don't know about you guys, but it motivates us to do a little segment here we call the
808000	809200	FUs of the Week.
838000	845200	I just, I turn into a big emo mess whenever I'm really, really sick because I'm just so
845200	851040	tired all the time, so I was really just crabby and upset, and I hated it.
851040	855360	And I'm feeling better today, but, you know, I have to go back to work tomorrow, and on
855360	856720	top of that, I have to go in early.
857600	861040	But it's a good reason why I'm going in early, because I'm going to my school tomorrow to
861040	862320	see how close I am to graduating.
862320	870560	I might actually qualify for yet my, what, my ninth change of major since starting my
870560	871920	college career ten years ago.
874080	881360	So, and also an FU goes to my right-hand middle finger, because I've started developing the
881360	885120	symptoms of trigger finger in that one as well, so I think that I might have actually
885120	890720	injured something instead of it being some sort of naturally causing thing, because normally
890720	895520	trigger finger sets in if you're older or do a lot of heavy pulling with your hands,
895520	897040	and I don't do either.
897040	902720	I push, and I type, and that's about it, and that's not what causes sugar finger, so I
902720	905040	get to go back and get another shot in my hand, which is going to be fun.
906560	907360	And that's the end.
909280	910960	Loki, do you have anything you want to FU?
912160	917040	I'm not really mad at much of anything other than the really crappy drivers for the Nvidia
917040	921680	cards. Currently the latest graphics drivers that they have now, for whatever reason when
921680	926560	my system boots up, it keeps flashing black every now and then, and I basically have to
926560	931600	switch my resolution down to something lower than switch back up to normal and it stops,
931600	935600	so I don't know why it's doing that because the older drivers didn't do it.
935600	937680	But anyways, so that sucks.
937680	943040	The other thing that kind of really sucks, well, there wasn't really much more announcements,
943040	948400	I guess, at CES, at least the Microsoft thing, that's it.
948400	951920	No Xbox 360 ultimate or anything like that, they're done.
951920	955280	They just basically had Slash come on stage and they played some Guitar Hero 3.
956160	956960	Lame!
958960	961760	Isn't that the way, like, an episode of Scooby Doo would end?
961760	962400	Something like that.
962400	964480	The Slash just comes out and everybody rocks out.
965280	966160	Like a big party.
968080	969760	It was pretty retarded.
969760	973840	Right. My FU of the week goes to whoever stole our garbage can.
973840	976560	There's no fucking garbage can now, thanks to the storm.
976560	979440	I don't know if God stole it, Mother Nature, or one of the neighbors.
979440	982480	I don't know. We are missing a fucking garbage can.
982480	984640	And it's freaky because, like, where are we going to put the trash?
985360	986320	Call them up.
986320	987360	That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.
987920	990160	It's scary. It's a scary notion.
990160	991680	Or still give an FU to that.
991680	996400	By the way, Robert M. would like to point out the irony in our chat room.
996400	1000880	The Dark Sakura gave the finger to her finger.
1000880	1002320	It is that finger.
1002320	1003360	It is the middle finger.
1004400	1007200	It's not pleasant. It doesn't hurt or anything.
1007200	1010640	It just feels like I can't straighten out my finger once I bend it.
1010640	1013760	It's like, how am I going to flip people off if my favorite finger is broken?
1014960	1017920	Tigerclaw says, Skye, perhaps it was stolen by a bum?
1017920	1019520	You know, that's the scary thing.
1019520	1024000	Like, maybe it was stolen by a bum, but seriously, why does a bum need a fucking trash can?
1024000	1029840	And seriously, why would he hike this far into this, like, development here to steal a trash can?
1029840	1032240	And why not steal the recycle bin? It's bigger.
1032240	1033600	My guess is it blew away.
1033600	1038240	It blew away in the storm, and someone said, hey, free trash can!
1038240	1041920	Well, what day was it the day when you had all the trash cans out the curb?
1041920	1042560	I mean, was that-
1042560	1044240	No, it wasn't the same day. We brought them back up.
1044800	1046640	Oh. Well, that's weird.
1046640	1048400	It's, yeah, it is very weird.
1048400	1051120	No, we have no idea. It's just the weirdest thing ever.
1051120	1054240	That's why you store your trash cans behind the fence.
1054240	1058240	Well, yeah, we'll be doing that from now on, but still, kind of weird, nonetheless.
1060480	1061360	Yeah, and I don't understand.
1061360	1064160	If a bum took it because they wanted to, I don't know, live in it or whatever-
1064160	1066960	Why would you live in a trash can? I mean, seriously-
1066960	1071200	Did Oscar the Grouch steal my can? Did Oscar the Grouch need a new home?
1071200	1074160	Why did he not take the- there's three cans.
1074160	1077360	There's a recycle, there's a lawn, and a garbage.
1077360	1078800	The garbage one is the smallest-
1078800	1082640	Because he lives in a garbage can!
1082640	1084080	Well, fuck you, Oscar the Grouch!
1087360	1093280	Anyhow, maybe one of the neighbors just hit it and was waiting for us to get back or something,
1093280	1095520	because I've been out of town, so has my roommate.
1095520	1097760	Anyhow, who cares about that anymore?
1097760	1103440	Let's talk about some PC gaming news, some things announced for PC games this week,
1103440	1109440	including Gas-Powered Games' next project. It's a game called Demigod,
1109440	1113200	and this game sounds kind of cool because it's going to mix role-playing,
1113200	1116560	real-time strategy, and action genres.
1117280	1122800	It's actually announced a game for Windows Magazine, so this is something for PC gamers.
1123520	1128880	It's being created by Chris Taylor, or I guess he's spearheading it or what have you,
1128880	1135440	and apparently it's supposed to be inspired in part by Warcraft 3's modification,
1135440	1136880	Defense of the Ancients.
1138080	1139600	It looked, from the screenshots,
1139600	1143280	it looked almost like an RTS version of Shadow of the Colossus.
1143840	1144480	Interesting.
1145360	1149760	Well, they have these Titan things that look like, you know-
1149760	1154880	I always like hearing about these games that combine these very interesting types of genres,
1154880	1157680	like RPGs and action, that's going to be kind of interesting.
1157680	1160480	Well, almost every game is an action game.
1160480	1164080	It kind of makes me think of Kingdom Hearts, it's like RPG mixed with action, right?
1164080	1166160	So I'm just kind of interested to see what this is.
1166160	1169680	Yeah, just think more of an RTS game, that's what it basically looks like.
1169680	1175200	RTS game, I guess, where your troops or whatever will gain experience and that kind of thing,
1175200	1178400	and then they fight each other, so that's the action part, I don't know.
1178400	1182720	Well, no release date announced yet, all we know is that Demigod is coming soon.
1183680	1185920	Of course, the almighty soon, right?
1185920	1196080	Well, Rockstar is going to be putting out a little bit more digitally now by working
1196080	1201680	with Steam's PC download service, so they're going to be putting Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne,
1201680	1208560	and Midnight Club, those different series, up on that service, so that'd be pretty cool.
1210240	1211280	That is pretty cool.
1211280	1216080	That is pretty cool, and I think, if I remember correctly, the first
1216080	1218800	few games that are going to be on there are going to be pretty cheap.
1218800	1220480	Like, I think they were like ten bucks.
1221600	1223840	What is it, like the original Grand Theft Auto, or is it some good stuff?
1223840	1227040	No, the Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.
1227840	1228400	I'll take it.
1228960	1233680	The first Grand Theft Auto game, and the second, I believe, are available free on their website.
1234240	1236880	Oh, that's right, they did that some time ago, I forgot about that.
1236880	1240720	So, you know, if you want to play those, because I remember the original Grand Theft Auto,
1240720	1241680	that game was fun.
1243520	1245200	Nothing like what it is today.
1245200	1246400	No, not at all.
1246400	1247440	Very, very different.
1248960	1254400	Anyways, let's see here, Just Cause 2 was announced, or at least some details about it.
1255520	1261600	They're going to be, I don't know, getting rid of some of the side quests, I guess, in the game,
1261600	1267280	to kind of simplify it a little bit more, make it more, I don't know, straightforward.
1267280	1273520	Now, they're saying that they've identified the key areas that they want to improve for Just
1273520	1277840	Cause 2, they just want to make better use of the huge game world, enhance the stunts,
1277840	1282880	improve the combat, and reward exploration, which I don't understand how you can reward exploration,
1282880	1284320	but get rid of some of the side quests.
1284960	1287840	That's kind of counterintuitive.
1287840	1297440	But, apparently, the game is not going to be set on the island of San Esperanto anymore.
1297440	1302560	It's going to be a tropical paradise in Southeast Asia, but it will still have
1303360	1307440	Rico Rodriguez as the lead character.
1307440	1308960	I don't know, I didn't really play Just Cause.
1309680	1311520	I played the demo a lot, and that was fun.
1312480	1315840	And I know that game had a few glitches where you can fly a plane underwater,
1315840	1318480	but other than that, it looked pretty cool.
1318480	1322240	It's so pretty good for a first, you know, a new IP, right?
1322240	1326640	Yeah, it might be one I might pick up, actually I might pick up the original,
1326640	1328160	because I think it's dirt cheap right about now.
1328160	1329040	I think it is dirt cheap.
1329040	1330560	I think I saw it in a bargain bin the other day.
1331760	1335200	Well, this isn't coming to a bargain bin anytime soon, because the latest and greatest piece
1335200	1342480	of technology for you PC gamers is a brand new video card, Nvidia's GeForce 9800 GX2,
1342480	1347040	a blog called Hard OCP has gotten a peek at the new card.
1347040	1350320	This card is coming out in late February, early March-ish,
1350320	1356880	and it's basically going to replace Nvidia's current high-end card, the 8800 Ultra.
1356880	1359520	Now, I don't follow a whole lot of what this stuff means,
1359520	1363520	but I imagine for you PC folks that follow this stuff a little better than I do.
1364400	1368640	You've got one gigabyte frame buffer, two PCBs,
1368640	1374400	two 65nm GPUs total, and 256 stream processors total.
1374400	1376560	In other words, fucking great video,
1376560	1379360	but it'll be outdated next year when something even better comes out.
1379360	1382480	Well, shit, this stuff's outdated like within a few months.
1382480	1382960	Really?
1382960	1387760	The thing is, yeah, well, fuck, I bought a card for my PC and the day after it was outdated.
1389120	1391280	I traded it in though, so I got a better one.
1391280	1397200	But yeah, essentially, there's a lot of drama going on with PC graphics cards right now,
1397200	1401440	because ATI, their cards are nowhere near what Nvidia's are,
1401440	1404080	and because of that, Nvidia doesn't really have any competition,
1404080	1410000	so they keep re-releasing their old cards with slightly better processors and that kind of stuff.
1410000	1415840	So this, essentially, is just two graphics cards shoved on the one card, is what it basically is.
1415840	1421200	It's like your Core 2, or the quads that they have, the Intel chips,
1421200	1427600	they're not really a quad-core processor, it's just two Core 2 duos on one processor.
1428800	1429680	So that's what it is.
1429680	1434160	It's going to be about 13 inches long, they said, which is fucking huge for a graphics card.
1434160	1435760	Try fitting that in your case.
1435760	1437200	But, you know, I'm sure it'll be good.
1437200	1438720	13 inches long, you say?
1438720	1443440	Yeah, and I'm sure it'll be, you know, you can quad SLI them,
1443440	1446720	so if you really want to buy four of these cards, you can run them together.
1447360	1449600	I don't know why you would, you probably don't need to.
1449600	1455040	You probably don't need to, but it says 30% faster than the 8800 Ultra.
1455040	1460880	I know that the card I have right now, which is the 8800 GTS 512, the G92,
1461760	1464960	that one is a little bit faster than the Ultra, I think, as well.
1464960	1470640	So save yourself some money, or wait, or buy through a company like EVGA,
1470640	1474880	where you can step up your cards as new ones come out, so you can always stay with the new stuff.
1474880	1479280	Dark Sakura, did you hear that I've got one that's 13 inches?
1481680	1483120	I paid good money for it, too.
1483920	1485360	I'm sure you did.
1485360	1486640	Here's what I want to know, Loki.
1486640	1488000	Will it make WoW run better?
1490320	1492960	Dude, WoW will run on pretty much anything.
1492960	1495120	It really will, but it's kind of choc-
1495120	1498000	Will it make freaking Tabula Rasa run better?
1498000	1502000	Because I tried playing a demo of that, and it did not run very well on my computer.
1502000	1502720	Probably.
1502720	1505600	Which is strange, because it's not like my computer's that old.
1505600	1507040	The game's a memory hog.
1509760	1511120	How about we do something else, Rob?
1511120	1512480	How about we do some emails?
1512480	1515680	We are going to get to the mailbag, but something you kids should be thinking about,
1515680	1518560	because it's coming up very soon, not too far after the mailbag,
1518560	1522480	we're going to bring back a game we haven't done in a long time tonight on the program,
1522480	1527760	and that is Listless, and we're actually going to be looking for a collar in a little while.
1527760	1530320	Not yet, but we're going to be looking for a collar to play with us.
1530320	1533840	It's Listless in tonight's topic, so you can start thinking about-
1533840	1535200	Well, maybe I'll save that.
1535200	1536160	I'll keep that a secret.
1536160	1536720	Save it.
1536720	1537120	Maybe-
1537120	1540320	But if you call in right now, Rob will tell us who it is, and we'll laugh.
1540320	1542320	No, I'm not going to do that right now.
1542320	1546480	But I am kind of wondering, I should get someone to participate in Listless with us,
1546480	1549200	so I can tell them the topics, then you can start thinking of their list,
1549200	1550960	because we don't want to have to come up with it on the spot.
1550960	1554320	So I'm going to say this, if you want to participate in Listless tonight,
1554320	1555680	and you're available on Skype-
1555680	1558640	How about a trivia question to answer by private message?
1558640	1559520	Okay, I like that.
1559520	1561360	A trivia question to answer by private message.
1563040	1563440	Okay.
1563440	1564400	Well, you got to do mails.
1564400	1565680	They should probably send it to me.
1565680	1566640	Okay, let's send it to Rob.
1566640	1567840	All right, send it to me.
1567840	1569200	What's the trivia question?
1569200	1569920	Anything I want?
1571360	1572960	How about-
1572960	1574480	I hope you pick something I know the answer to.
1575440	1577920	Oh, well, if you don't know the answer to, I'll tell you anyway.
1577920	1578240	Okay.
1579280	1579680	Okay.
1581200	1581920	Don't make it too hard.
1581920	1582720	We want somebody to play.
1582720	1582800	It'll be easy.
1582800	1583680	What's my favorite color?
1584400	1586000	What's Dark Soccer's favorite color?
1586000	1586400	Yeah.
1586400	1586720	All right.
1586720	1592160	All right, send me a private message with what you think Dark Soccer's favorite color is.
1592720	1596400	And the first person to get it will play Listless with us tonight.
1596400	1597120	That'd be fun.
1597120	1599360	And I'll tell them the topics they can think of their list.
1599360	1600800	All right, so send a private message to Sky.
1600800	1604720	Meanwhile, Dark Soccer is going to open up the old mailbag and get to work.
1604720	1605600	There's just four.
1607280	1610560	Um, well, a fifth one was a thank you.
1611520	1612800	So, Rob, thank you.
1612800	1613600	Oh, you're welcome.
1613600	1614160	What did I do?
1614160	1615360	Oh, okay.
1615360	1615680	Yeah.
1615680	1616480	Oh, you're welcome.
1616480	1624240	Um, the first one, um, comes from, um, I'm just going to say Ryan, who put his full name
1624240	1624560	on here.
1624560	1626480	So, and I don't read out everybody's full names.
1626480	1631440	So, so it says, Hey guys, I was wondering if the operator 11 feeds on OLR can be downloaded
1631440	1632960	to a computer or a PSP.
1632960	1634160	Rock on Dragon Force.
1636160	1637360	Um, not right now.
1638480	1639520	Um, as we have,
1639520	1648480	um, as we've stated earlier, operator 11 is having, um, mental retardation, I'm sorry,
1648480	1649760	technical difficulties.
1649760	1653360	So we're not, um, going to say much more about them.
1653360	1653840	Right.
1655280	1660560	So moving forward, the next email comes from, uh, Martin.
1661120	1662320	Hello, all our crew.
1662320	1664720	I just want to ask your opinion about a blaming game.
1664720	1671840	A gaming cliche that I think is really, really outdated.
1671840	1675840	I constantly hear many game reviewers and game podcasters talk about how kids are always
1675840	1680720	trying to explain game systems and gaming to parents buying the current gen systems.
1680720	1685760	I think that it really must be pointed out that these supposed naive parents grew up
1685760	1691120	with gaming in their lives, starting with the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES and many cats
1691120	1694800	gaming since they started myself, including growing up in the eighties.
1694800	1698560	Yes, it was sometimes a challenge to teach a parent about what a gaming system could
1698560	1703440	do and their relevance, but gaming has been well established almost every living room
1703440	1704960	since the 1980s.
1704960	1709200	I really think that this need to explain to a parent about what a PlayStation or Nintendo
1709200	1713840	Wii is, is really outdated and just plain foolish to think a good portion of all of
1713840	1719280	us oldsters have and continue to game in some cases, no more than their kids about gaming.
1719280	1723920	No more than their kids about gaming don't buy into the hype.
1723920	1728780	The only parents that do not know what video games are will never get it because they choose
1728780	1730440	not to know about it.
1730440	1734360	Martin and all your friends at bunchofdorks.com.
1734360	1735880	Nice name for a website by the way.
1735880	1736880	That's fantastic.
1736880	1742080	Do you have anything to say about that?
1742080	1745600	I'm sorry, I was monitoring the trivia question.
1745600	1746600	Summarize for me?
1746600	1753960	Well, basically saying that since there have been video games for as long as many of the
1753960	1761280	people out there have, I guess, grown up and are now parents themselves, so there shouldn't
1761280	1767320	be any excuse for a parent not to be aware of what a system is or what it does, but I
1767320	1774800	also do think that, and I actually do agree that they don't know what it is because they
1774800	1779440	choose not to know about it, but I think that it's not really the system so much themselves
1779440	1786600	as the content that they need to be informed about because when we were little, games didn't
1786600	1790720	look that major, you know what I mean?
1790720	1799040	True, we had Metal Gear and we had Splatterhouse, but it was all cartoony looking and now it's
1799040	1803880	so realistic that I think that there does need to be a degree of caution on the part
1803880	1806180	of the parents.
1806180	1811920	So in that case, I can see how they might be naive or misinformed or uninformed, but
1811920	1816880	I don't think it's the system so much that people really need a lot of education on.
1816880	1821720	What do you think?
1821720	1824200	So we finally got a winner of our stupid trivia thing, which-
1824200	1826200	I could not guess.
1826200	1828040	Oh my God, it took forever.
1828040	1832600	Oh my God, I don't think I've made any secret about it.
1832600	1835640	So next email, oh it's to me.
1835640	1838040	Wait, which person sent in that last email?
1838040	1846680	Oh, that was, I closed it, that was Martin from a bunch of dorks.com, let me see.
1846680	1851520	I remember, I read this email earlier in the week, sorry, I swear I was paying attention
1851520	1852520	to the chat room.
1852520	1853520	I know.
1853520	1855320	But anyhow, no, you know what's funny about this?
1855320	1858760	When I was reading this, I kind of thought to myself, I was like, okay, as far as the
1858760	1863280	Atari 2600 generation goes, not everybody had that.
1863280	1867200	That's the thing, is that some of us were lucky enough to experience that, but even
1867200	1871280	I think Atari 2600, not everybody in our generation necessarily experienced.
1871280	1876520	It was still kind of something that only certain kids on the block had, and in some parts of
1876520	1880520	the country, you weren't as able to find these as easily.
1880520	1884800	It was still kind of a luxury item, let's put it that way, as video games are in general
1884800	1893080	today, but even when I say luxury item, an old system such as a Nintendo 8-bit system
1893080	1898560	or a PlayStation, those are so cheap now that lots of households have these old video games.
1898560	1900280	I mean when you met them at the flea market.
1900280	1903520	Right, but I think sometimes, I guess what I'm trying to say is that perhaps your perspective
1903520	1909800	is a little bit skewed because you were in this place in your generation where you were
1909800	1914660	able to have this luxury item, where I think a lot of parents, or people that are now parents
1914660	1919800	weren't exposed to this when they were young, nevertheless, even if they were, they remember
1919800	1928840	video games as being Pac-Man, combat, and not Grand Theft Auto, or Manhunt, it was much
1928840	1929840	different back then.
1929840	1935040	I think that the case with a lot of them is that not everyone has been the hardcore gamer
1935040	1941360	type, like me and my husband and our person who emailed us, or any of us in this room,
1941360	1949240	that once we grew up and started working, oh well that's child stuff, we put it away,
1949240	1953400	we don't do it anymore, well, we are more enlightened.
1953400	1959960	And it's as fine as a recreation item as any, and we understand that, but there's always
1959960	1964800	been, I think, when they were growing up with that type of thing, oh, well you're still
1964800	1966220	doing that.
1966220	1970360	My mom still says that to me, and I'm like, okay, you sat and played my Nintendo as much
1970360	1974080	as I did when I had it, so what's your excuse?
1974080	1983720	And now she wants a Wii, so, my mom wants a Wii, I think that's cute, but at any rate,
1983720	1987600	that's where I think the difference comes in.
1987600	1992200	And I think that it's right, those who don't know, it's because they choose not to know,
1992200	1997700	they haven't educated themselves, so they're all surprised, ew, and they don't have a right
1997700	2000600	to be.
2000600	2003880	We can move on now, sorry, sorry I was not paying attention fully the first time.
2003880	2010420	Aw, this makes me feel slightly better, J-Rod emailed, the one who has a really cool quote
2010420	2016080	about Olive Garden, says, hey DarkSakura, I know this isn't exactly a gaming question,
2016080	2021160	but you said you get a sinus infection every single year for New Year's Eve, yes, I'm in
2021160	2025440	the same boat as you, except whenever I have something like a concert to go to, I'll get
2025440	2027660	a sinus infection without question.
2027660	2031200	Someone could ask me to go see a concert tomorrow and I'll develop a sinus infection overnight,
2031200	2032560	woe is us.
2032560	2040240	Yeah, well for me, I always get a bad sinus infection at the end of the year, and then
2040240	2045320	I get like the flu at the beginning of the year, so I think that they just decided to
2045320	2050560	gang up on me and give me both at once or some crap like that, and I have to read it,
2050560	2052320	I have to, Rob.
2052320	2055920	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the Never Ending Salads.
2055920	2059920	Dude, the Olive Garden is the shit, don't forget Never Ending Breadsticks.
2059920	2061960	We should just go for salad one day.
2061960	2064520	Let's go to Olive Garden, cause you wanna come over for movie night, cause I have to
2064520	2068320	show you Stardust, cause I love that movie so much, let's do Olive Garden that night.
2068320	2069800	If I'm not completely broke.
2069800	2072840	We'll do dinner at the Olive Garden!
2072840	2073840	Okay!
2073840	2074840	Yee-haw!
2074840	2075840	Last email!
2075840	2076840	Dun dun dun.
2076840	2079160	If you can't pay, it'll be my treat, cause I want Never Ending Breadsticks.
2079160	2080160	Okay.
2080160	2081160	Alright.
2081160	2082160	And I'll get you after my payday.
2082160	2083160	Sweet.
2083160	2084160	We'll go to Indian again.
2084160	2085160	Yes.
2085160	2086160	I thought I was sick.
2086160	2087160	All I wanted was Indian food.
2087160	2088160	Okay.
2088160	2089160	You know what, Ross Steel?
2089160	2090160	Damn it.
2090160	2091160	I need to have it out with him for a minute here.
2091160	2092160	Okay.
2092160	2093160	Okay, Ross Steel.
2093160	2094160	God damn it.
2094160	2097040	You criticize Loki and his, you know, ways, which I, you know, to some extent I agree
2097040	2098040	with you.
2098040	2099040	Fine.
2099040	2100040	You criticize me playing WoW.
2100040	2104900	Maybe I do play, maybe I do play too much WoW, but I draw the line at you criticizing
2104900	2106360	our love of the Olive Garden.
2106360	2108760	Dude, the Olive Garden is great.
2108760	2112520	The Olive Garden is wonderful, and damn you for thinking otherwise.
2112520	2118200	Although, although, although, one of these days I'm gonna have to take you to Pasquale's.
2118200	2121080	They're closed on Monday, but they're open on Tuesday.
2121080	2125240	I hope you get smited with Zuppa Tuscana.
2125240	2129920	He should get, um, get, uh, uh, Sangreid in the eye.
2129920	2130920	Exactly.
2130920	2133200	That would be great.
2133200	2135760	May a deep-fried ravioli fall from heaven onto your head.
2135760	2138640	That sounds good too, I love those.
2138640	2142600	Um, this email is titled Yaris Made Better by Dragonforce.
2142600	2147480	Hey, O.L.R., I made this video on YouTube and got the inspiration from you guys and
2147480	2148480	girl.
2148480	2151720	I think you should actually start that seg-, uh, should actually start that segment.
2151720	2155080	There are a lot of crappy games out there and someone needs to make them watchable.
2155080	2158960	Anyway, I think you guys are great and I will keep saying that, cause you are, and keep
2158960	2159960	going strong.
2159960	2166400	To get the video, search for PKJR92, and I'm saying it out loud so that they know what
2166400	2170200	to look at, on YouTube, or Yaris, or Dragonforce, or even O.L.R.
2170200	2173840	Sincerely, PK, is it PKJR92?
2173840	2174840	Sure why not.
2174840	2175840	Okay.
2175840	2177520	Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.
2177520	2178920	Is the quote on there?
2178920	2180680	I've, I've heard that quote before.
2180680	2184360	And by the way, I did watch the video, and basically he took the trailer for Yaris, the
2184360	2189160	30 second trailer for Yaris, and put Dragonforce's music behind it, and it's surprisingly effective.
2189160	2190300	We do approve.
2190300	2194000	And I will find the link to that YouTube and post it in chat for you all to look at right
2194000	2195000	now.
2195000	2198040	Well, not right, right now, but, you know.
2198040	2199040	You know, we got one last email.
2199040	2201080	I can hear Loki watching it right now.
2201080	2202080	Yeah.
2202080	2203080	What do you think?
2203080	2204080	Doesn't it make the game better?
2204080	2205080	We got one last email in.
2205080	2206080	All right, sorry.
2206080	2207080	We're getting a lot better with it.
2207080	2208080	From SakuraMax.
2208080	2210440	Hey, O.L.R., just email, just mailing to say Happy New Year.
2210440	2214360	I was running a little late since I didn't have computer access while the New Year special
2214360	2215360	was running.
2215360	2219300	This is from SakuraMax, the one who hasn't annoyed you people in a while, you happy?
2219300	2223920	And a person with mass gamer ADD, who, what to play next?
2223920	2227040	So, there we have it.
2227040	2229560	No more emails?
2229560	2230560	Nope.
2230560	2231560	Oops, sorry.
2231560	2233560	I'm watching the video.
2233560	2237600	No, I was just going to add a little thing that says I approve.
2237600	2241400	But anyway, see now everybody in the chat room is like, you need to go have real Italian
2241400	2242400	food.
2242400	2243400	You need to go have real.
2243400	2244400	I have had real Italian food.
2244400	2245400	I actually went to a little place in Sacramento.
2245400	2248120	I don't even know if you guys have heard of this, but I always thought I got a kick out
2248120	2249120	of this.
2249120	2254480	It's called Español, which means Spain, but it has really good Italian food.
2254480	2256480	So there's real Italian places all over.
2256480	2260400	I bet there are really, really good places in New York, though, and that's where they're
2260400	2261400	offering to take me.
2261400	2264260	So I'm not going to say no, especially if you're buying.
2264260	2270080	So anyhow, if you want to send emails, maybe profess your love for the Olive Garden here
2270080	2271080	on this program.
2271080	2272960	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
2272960	2276440	You know, if we're not the weather podcast, we're the food podcast, I swear to God.
2276440	2277440	Anything but games.
2277440	2279720	That should be our new tagline.
2279720	2280720	Anything but games.
2280720	2281720	We're tired of games.
2281720	2282720	That's right.
2282720	2283720	We've been doing games for like six years.
2283720	2285920	It's time for something new, don't you think?
2285920	2286920	All right.
2286920	2290440	We have a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into tonight's
2290440	2291440	listless.
2291440	2293800	Loki, I'll let you go first.
2293800	2294800	Yes.
2294800	2297000	Anyways, let's see.
2297000	2301280	So if you've been playing Team Fortress 2, you may have been noticing that there are
2301280	2306600	some achievements missing for one of the classes you can play, and that would be the medic.
2306600	2312520	Well, that's going to be fixed hopefully pretty soon, because GermanSight was listening to
2312520	2317680	some brand new achievements, 36 new ones actually, for the medic.
2317680	2319480	So that's kind of neat.
2319480	2325240	And some of the other ones here, they had heal under fire, which is healing somebody
2325240	2327320	while on fire.
2327320	2333400	And let's see here, they have one for healing an engineer, healing teammates who've called
2333400	2343720	for a medic, Ubering a friend, and they have some other fun stuff like a bonesaw spy caller,
2343720	2348360	or I'm assuming that's killer, killing an enemy spy with a bonesaw.
2348360	2352160	Loki, I'm going to interrupt this story to show you the fly swimming for his life in
2352160	2354620	my coffee right now.
2354620	2358560	That fly is going to be totally hyped up on caffeine.
2358560	2360760	The more he swims, the more hyper he gets.
2360760	2363880	But, goddammit, that just ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee.
2363880	2370000	Go flies, asshole, asshole fly.
2370000	2376800	So yeah, hopefully we'll see some of those soon, maybe in an update or something.
2376800	2380880	Even the chat room is like, Rob's derailing the show tonight, I am.
2380880	2385600	I do want to say this though, the native Spanish speakers in chat room are yelling at me and
2385600	2390560	screaming at me, and I should know better, but I only had two years of high school Spanish.
2390560	2396760	España is Spain, español is a Spaniard, or Spanish.
2396760	2400480	I don't know any Spanish, and I knew that.
2400480	2405360	Well sorry, donde esta el baño, that's what I remember.
2405360	2410560	Somebody on Ragnarok last night was spamming with donde esta la biblioteca.
2410560	2414200	Ew, they're telling me to drink the coffee, that's fucking gross.
2414200	2415200	Ew, no.
2415200	2417160	What the hell is wrong with you people?
2417160	2420160	Just say that you are, if you don't have a camera.
2420160	2427360	I'm drinking it right now, mmm, delicious, oh no, I feel that fly in my throat, it's
2427360	2428360	so weird.
2428360	2438600	Oh my God, he's turning into a fly now, that's so crazy.
2438600	2440800	So this is how we're starting off 2008, huh?
2440800	2444860	Dear everyone, Rob is crazy, the end.
2444860	2447080	We can get away with much more when Op 11 isn't running.
2447080	2448760	Maybe we'll never have a webcam again.
2448760	2451920	I can get away with a lot of stuff over here because the camera's never on me.
2451920	2456080	Well, one week I'm going to just surprise you, and it'll be Jamie Cam.
2456080	2457080	No way, I'll learn.
2457080	2458080	And it'll catch you picking your nose.
2458080	2462100	Or I'll put that camera up there and put another camera hidden somewhere that's actually the
2462100	2463100	real camera.
2463100	2464100	Oh, it's elaborate.
2464100	2465100	But it'll work.
2465100	2466100	Candid camera.
2466100	2467100	All right, anyway.
2467100	2471160	I'll make that the day I throw up on you.
2471160	2474960	You know, a lot of folks have been saying this week with all the Xbox Live downtime,
2474960	2477320	I'm just going to go play PlayStation Network.
2477320	2479880	Sony's network is free, I'm just going to go play that.
2479880	2484920	Well, Sony has been polling customers in some of their Asian regions on ways that they can
2484920	2488960	improve the PC and PSP PlayStation Store.
2488960	2490880	One of the things that they're polling about?
2490880	2493760	A monthly subscription plan.
2493760	2494760	Hmm.
2494760	2499800	So possibly is Sony looking into charging a monthly fee for the PlayStation Network?
2499800	2500800	But no.
2500800	2501800	Possibly.
2501800	2502800	Possibly.
2502800	2503800	All right, Loki, go ahead.
2503800	2505760	You're wanting to jump at the bit here to say it was.
2505760	2506760	Sorry.
2506760	2511560	I'm possibly going to be offering a monthly subscription for unlimited download content.
2511560	2512560	That's right.
2512560	2514200	Game tap for your PSP, basically.
2514200	2515200	But with Sony's games.
2515200	2516200	I like that idea.
2516200	2518360	That actually isn't a bad idea at all.
2518360	2520800	I would hand it to Sony if that's the case.
2520800	2527200	Of course, the trump on that, I guess, is that there isn't really a whole lot of download
2527200	2531320	content on the PlayStation Network.
2531320	2539200	Would be a definite way, though, to ensure income from the service on a regular basis.
2539200	2542920	I'd pay for that for a month, download everything, and then that's it.
2542920	2543920	Just wait a few months.
2543920	2547280	What if it's contractual?
2547280	2549760	I don't think services like that are usually contractual, are they?
2549760	2550760	Some are.
2550760	2551760	Well, like game tap isn't it?
2551760	2552760	It's month-to-month.
2552760	2553760	All right.
2553760	2554760	All right.
2554760	2559400	Well, anyhow, I think it's about time for us to have a list list.
2559400	2560400	What do you guys think?
2560400	2564400	Are we going to have a list list time?
2564400	2565400	Sure.
2565400	2567000	All right.
2567000	2571720	List List is the game where we're going to create the definitive list for something.
2571720	2575040	You know, lists are big, especially around this time of year as one year has ended and
2575040	2576040	another begins.
2576040	2578200	Lists are big, so we're going to make our own list tonight.
2578200	2580880	I know we have a lot of new listeners since the last time we've done this because we used
2580880	2584040	to do this game a lot and we probably haven't played it in like four months.
2584040	2588840	So the way List List works is that we're going to have four panelists, myself, Loki Dark
2588840	2594640	Soccer and our Mystery Caller, and each of us are going to give you our top three things
2594640	2596440	that will match the list.
2596440	2598180	And then here's the twist.
2598180	2600840	Each one of us takes one thing off the list.
2600840	2603640	So you have 12 that gets taken down to eight.
2603640	2607800	So once we're down to eight, then the chat room votes on the top three and that will
2607800	2610040	bring us the definitive list.
2610040	2613840	And tonight's topic for the list, if you'd like to start posting your suggestions in
2613840	2620000	chat, here it is, gadget I'd like to see them announce at Consumer Electronics Show.
2620000	2624200	It doesn't have to be gaming related, just any type of tech gadget.
2624200	2627760	So the gadget you would like to see them announce at the Consumer Electronics Show.
2627760	2631840	It can be real, it can be crazy, anything you want, but that's it right here, tonight's
2631840	2632840	List List.
2632840	2641320	So let us call the person who correctly guessed Dark Soccer's favorite color.
2641320	2647680	If I can find them in the list, I suddenly can't find them.
2647680	2656800	Live radio, folks.
2656800	2660400	I'm making them call us.
2660400	2662040	Tell us a little bit about your favorite color.
2662040	2667840	My favorite color is very, very dark, very, very dark.
2667840	2675360	That's right, Dark Soccer's favorite color was matte.
2675360	2676720	Like my soul.
2676720	2677720	That's right.
2677720	2678720	Just like your soul.
2678720	2680680	Okay, I tried calling the person and it's busy.
2680680	2682080	Oh, here we go.
2682080	2683080	Are you there?
2683080	2685360	I'm here, yes I am.
2685360	2688320	Hooray, introduce yourselves, person who won.
2688320	2689760	This is SSJ100 Matt.
2689760	2692600	Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?
2692600	2693600	Hi.
2693600	2694840	I'm fine, all right.
2694840	2696440	Are you a big fan of Consumer Electronics Show?
2696440	2700120	Do you look forward to it every year?
2700120	2706920	I don't check out the keynotes or anything, but I like to watch what they got showing.
2706920	2708720	What do you think about what I said earlier in the show?
2708720	2712440	Is it true that most game nerds are somewhat of tech nerds too?
2712440	2715320	They like to see the latest tech stuff?
2715320	2721080	I think you kind of have to be, to tell you the truth, especially with the whole next
2721080	2723080	gen that's going on now.
2723080	2728400	All right, well tonight's topic is the gadget we would most like to see them announce at
2728400	2729640	the Consumer Electronics Show.
2729640	2730640	Do you have a list?
2730640	2731640	Your top three?
2731640	2733080	Yeah, I certainly do.
2733080	2735160	All right, then we're going to kick it off here.
2735160	2741160	Let's do the background music one more time just because it's so awesome.
2741160	2744000	And if at any time you need some suggestions, just look at our chat room.
2744000	2746600	They're lighting up in chat there with their suggestions.
2746600	2750580	All right, SSJ100 Matt, because you're on the phone, you get to start us off tonight.
2750580	2754240	What is your number three pick?
2754240	2761600	My number three pick is the Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0.
2761600	2765080	And why a Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0?
2765080	2768080	Because it will come out just in time for Rez HD.
2768080	2770080	That's a good point.
2770080	2771680	Rez HD is just around the corner.
2771680	2772680	That's a good idea.
2772680	2773680	Who wants to go next?
2773680	2774680	I can go.
2774680	2776620	Dark Sakura, what is your number three pick?
2776620	2784920	My number three pick is a remote-directed EMP gun for jamming other people's cell phones.
2784920	2787880	And why, pray tell, do you need an EMP gun to jam people's cell phones?
2787880	2792080	For people driving like fucking retards on the road while talking with their phone glued
2792080	2798560	to their face, or people in front of me in line at the grocery store too busy talking
2798560	2801620	on their phone to pay attention to what the hell they're doing.
2801620	2804640	These people need to either die in a fire or hang up the phone.
2804640	2805640	Or both.
2805640	2806640	Preferably not.
2806640	2807640	I'd buy it.
2807640	2809640	Alright, that's actually a good idea.
2809640	2810840	Alright, I'll go next.
2810840	2813520	My number three pick, now I don't know if you've ever seen these, have you ever seen
2813520	2818520	those guns at like Target or things that shoot the big blast of air at people?
2818520	2819520	Yeah, the air cannons?
2819520	2820520	I don't know.
2820520	2821520	Air cannons?
2821520	2822520	Airzookas.
2822520	2823520	Airzookas.
2823520	2824520	Airzookas?
2824520	2826200	Okay, Airzookas are so awesome, but I want them to introduce like an Airzooka that will
2826200	2828320	actually blow somebody over.
2828320	2831160	Because it has so much power in it.
2831160	2838320	So I'm going to just call it the Supreme Airzooka.
2838320	2841360	And I don't know how electronic that gadget is, but I would imagine you'd need a little
2841360	2843240	battery power to make that thing work.
2843240	2845680	Alright, Loki, your number three pick.
2845680	2850320	My number three pick would be kind of a sequel to the iBo.
2850320	2855280	It's the iPer, and it would be, you know, a robotic cat.
2855280	2856680	They already have those.
2856680	2861720	Well, I want one from Sony, because, you know, I need my cat to be able to spy on my other
2861720	2864600	cat so I can see what's going on, you know.
2864600	2866080	Sony does have an iBo cat.
2866080	2868360	They have a gray one and a white one and a black one.
2868360	2870160	But he can put anything he wants on the list.
2870160	2871880	You take it off if you don't like it.
2871880	2872880	Alright.
2872880	2873880	Fine.
2873880	2874880	What, iSloth?
2874880	2876880	I mean, yeah.
2876880	2877880	iFerret.
2877880	2878880	iFerret.
2878880	2879880	Alright, iFerret.
2879880	2880880	I go with iFerret.
2880880	2882880	You're going to change it to iFerret.
2882880	2883880	iFerret.
2883880	2889680	Alright, we're back to you, SSJ100Matt.
2889680	2892200	What is your number two pick?
2892200	2898880	My number two pick is an Apple handheld gaming system.
2898880	2901940	As is the device of many fanboys' dreams.
2901940	2904480	Are you an Apple fanboy?
2904480	2905480	Not really.
2905480	2906480	Oh, okay.
2906480	2911400	Well, why then, especially from non-fanboys, should Apple announce a handheld gaming system?
2911400	2914680	You know what, I think there should be another handheld gaming system in general that's not
2914680	2917640	the N-Gage.
2917640	2920760	As RawstealUT says, the Pippin Boy?
2920760	2921760	Is that what it would be?
2921760	2924760	Alright, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?
2924760	2929520	A streaming TV for iPhone.
2929520	2932040	Like the YouTube channel, but like actual episodes of stuff.
2932040	2933840	I was going to say, YouTube's not good enough for you, huh?
2933840	2937680	Well, because you can't really find full episodes of stuff on YouTube, and it's like a limited
2937680	2938680	YouTube.
2938680	2943680	So they need to have like a show service, like for me, because I don't like to sit in
2943680	2946120	front of the TV because that's just boring to me.
2946120	2948840	You know, I have to have other stuff going on.
2948840	2953520	So having it on my iPhone, and I could watch for a little bit and then go do other crap,
2953520	2957320	and then come back and finish watching it when I'm done, would be perfect for me.
2957320	2961120	Alright, I'm actually going to take my number two pick from the chat room, because this
2961120	2964320	is a darn good pick, and we can be as still as we want, right?
2964320	2970280	So I'm going to suggest that a portal gun be unveiled as CES, so I can have my very
2970280	2971280	own portal gun.
2971280	2973160	Because seriously, who couldn't use a portal gun?
2973160	2976920	I could use one all the time.
2976920	2978320	So portal gun, there you go.
2978320	2981680	Loki, what would be the number two pick for you?
2981680	2984200	My number two pick also happens to come from Portal.
2984200	2986880	I would like the Aperture Science Sentry Bot.
2986880	2991400	You know, the ones that say, hello, and then turn the chute at you.
2991400	2993080	It'd be perfect for the neighbors.
2993080	2998000	Oh, those things are such assholes, but okay, yeah, those would be good guard dogs.
2998000	3001600	I'm surprised no one said a companion queue, but I guess we haven't gotten to the number
3001600	3003480	ones yet, so let's see.
3003480	3007720	SSJ100Matt, what is the number one thing you would like to see them debut at CES?
3007720	3009180	New gadget.
3009180	3016080	My number one pick is the Dreamcast 2.
3016080	3018920	Sega fanboy, eh?
3018920	3022800	You know what, I just want to see another Sega system.
3022800	3026600	I'm not really a fanboy, I just think, you know.
3026600	3029440	Don't you think it's about time to let go?
3029440	3030440	No.
3030440	3031680	Alright, fine.
3031680	3036840	Alright, Dark Soccer, what would be your number one thing you would like to see them
3036840	3038600	announce at CES?
3038600	3040640	Portable Xbox Live Arcade.
3040640	3043720	Portable Xbox Live Arcade, not a bad choice.
3043720	3045480	What made you decide to go with that?
3045480	3051280	Because remember when we were speculating what the interactivity between the Zune and
3051280	3054280	the Xbox was going to be and we were thinking, because they had the thing where you could
3054280	3058540	see which of your friends was online at the time and all that, and we had sort of joked
3058540	3061880	about they should have a way to bring your downloadable content with you.
3061880	3064840	I think that that would be really awesome.
3064840	3068200	Did you happen to see, just on a semi-related note, did you happen to see what the number
3068200	3073000	one most played Xbox Live Arcade game was in 2007, Courtney Major Nelson?
3073000	3074720	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3074720	3076920	We were playing that the other night, too.
3076920	3077920	Good times.
3077920	3078920	Alright, my number one...
3078920	3079920	And Smash TV.
3079920	3083040	Smash TV is good times, too, but that's a little older.
3083040	3088600	My number one pick thing I would like to see them announce at CES, who wouldn't want one
3088600	3089600	of these in their house?
3089600	3091120	It would be the ultimate gadget.
3091120	3094880	I would like to see them unveil the holodeck.
3094880	3099160	Seriously, holodecks are awesome.
3099160	3102880	Alright, Loki, what would be your number one pick gadget you would like to see them unveil
3102880	3103880	at CES?
3103880	3108960	My number one pick has already been said, which was a portal gun, but that's alright,
3108960	3112400	because I didn't really have anything that I thought of.
3112400	3114560	But this would be kind of cool.
3114560	3120640	I know it's not practical in any sense whatsoever, but we haven't seen anything come from George
3120640	3125720	Foreman in a while, so I want a George Foreman grill that I can cook an entire cow on at
3125720	3128720	one time.
3128720	3137720	That would be great.
3137720	3141200	And it needs to clean the cow's guts out for you and everything.
3141200	3144800	What, pray tell, would the George Foreman entire cow grill be called?
3144800	3156720	It would be George Foreman's self-cleaning cow grill.
3156720	3158120	I don't know what to say.
3158120	3162440	This is going to be very hard, because this is a very good list of items that we've built
3162440	3163440	tonight.
3163440	3167160	Black Labs does the mean, lean, fat-reducing cow machine.
3167160	3170080	It would certainly reduce the size of those cows.
3170080	3173960	Uh, wow.
3173960	3175600	We said anything.
3175600	3178960	Very few of these items are actually gaming-related, I'd like to point out, but if it's the theme
3178960	3179960	of our podcast tonight.
3179960	3184040	Alright, SJ100 Matt, I posted the list there in private message for your reference.
3184040	3186080	Let me go ahead and read it as it stands now.
3186080	3189880	I'm going to kill the music, because this is the serious round, because we have twelve
3189880	3193840	items on the list, but four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.
3193840	3199400	We have Res Trans Vibrator 2.0, Remote EMP Gun for jamming people's cell phones, Supreme
3199400	3206640	Airzooka, iFerret, Apple Handheld Gaming System, Streaming TV for iPhone, Portal Gun, Aperture
3206640	3212800	Science Sentry Bot, Dreamcast 2, Portable Xbox Live Arcade, Holodeck, and George Foreman's
3212800	3215080	self-cleaning cow grill.
3215080	3217120	Four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.
3217120	3221120	Uh, SJ100 Matt, what is not worthy of the list?
3221120	3224260	I'm going to go with the Airzooka.
3224260	3226120	You're a bastard, but that's alright.
3226120	3227840	I guess it's not that electronic, is it?
3227840	3228840	Let me see.
3228840	3230960	Alright, Supreme Airzooka is not worthy of the list.
3230960	3234760	Yeah, that isn't really an electronic, although I guess you would need electronics in order
3234760	3236180	to build an aquaver person.
3236180	3237520	But how awesome would that be?
3237520	3238520	Come on, seriously.
3238520	3243000	Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these things is not worthy of the list?
3243000	3250800	Um, I'm going to say the Apple Handheld Gaming System.
3250800	3255040	I was expecting Loki to do that.
3255040	3256040	Just because...
3256040	3259480	I was going to.
3259480	3262240	Just because I think that Microsoft would do it better.
3262240	3263240	Oh, snap!
3263240	3266600	Well, but there's also the iPhone, in which in a way they'll probably turn into a gaming
3266600	3267600	system.
3267600	3269480	And you know there's going to be stuff coming out on that eventually.
3269480	3275500	I love my iPhone, don't get me wrong, but I think that when we have a company that's
3275500	3280960	already established for having quality games out now, I think that's only, you know, inevitable.
3280960	3283200	Alright, well I've got to get rid of this.
3283200	3287400	I'm so sorry SSJ100 Matt, we're picking on you tonight, but Dreamcast 2 is not worthy
3287400	3289680	of the list.
3289680	3293880	Because it's not going to happen, kids.
3293880	3296120	None of the things I listed were never going to happen.
3296120	3300800	A holodeck has a better chance of happening at a future consumer electronics show, or
3300800	3306720	Loki's fucking cow grill has a better chance than the Dreamcast 2.
3306720	3310000	Loki, that being said, we're down to nine items on the list.
3310000	3311800	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
3311800	3314280	I'm going to have to take off Res Trans Vibrator.
3314280	3320080	Well, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's one damn game, I mean, if you really...
3320080	3321080	I'd buy it.
3321080	3322280	They could just have a vibrator.
3322280	3326520	I would like to point out, this doesn't happen very often, but the hosts have effectively
3326520	3328720	eliminated all of SSJ100's lists.
3328720	3329720	Oh, I'm sorry.
3329720	3332000	Your airzooka got taken off?
3332000	3336680	No, I know, but the other three, we eliminated SSJ's entire list.
3336680	3337680	I forgot.
3337680	3338680	Okay, okay.
3338680	3341160	No, sorry, that's the way the cookie crumbles.
3341160	3344560	SSJ100 Matt, I'm very sorry.
3344560	3346680	Apparently your choices just weren't worthy tonight.
3346680	3347680	Yeah.
3347680	3348680	I'm sorry.
3348680	3349680	Are you going to cry about it?
3349680	3351320	No, I'm going to go cut myself.
3351320	3356400	All right, well, I'm sorry that things didn't go your way tonight, but hey, because you
3356400	3359360	don't have any items on the list, we'll still let you vote for the winner.
3359360	3360360	How's that sound?
3360360	3361360	All right.
3361360	3362360	That sounds good to me.
3362360	3364480	All right, anything you want to plug before we hang up on you?
3364480	3365480	Nope.
3365480	3367280	All right.
3367280	3368280	Have a good one.
3368280	3369280	Yep, you too.
3369280	3370280	All right.
3370280	3372720	I like it when they don't have anything to plug.
3372720	3373720	Poor guy.
3373720	3376680	He got his whole list eliminated by us three bastards.
3376680	3378120	That hasn't happened very often.
3378120	3382120	I can only think of one other time in list lists where somebody's entire list got eliminated.
3382120	3385080	They were mad that I took off the ResTrans vibrator 2.0.
3385080	3386080	Oh, well.
3386080	3389520	How do you improve something that vibrates?
3389520	3392080	I mean, seriously, it's not that complicated.
3392080	3393080	Poor power.
3393080	3394080	All right.
3394080	3395080	Well, here we go.
3395080	3398400	We are left with eight choices that have been deemed worthy of the list.
3398400	3399400	Here they are.
3399400	3405160	The remote EMP gun for jamming people's cell phones, an iFerret, a streaming TV for the
3405160	3411360	iPhone, a portal gun, an Aperture Science SentryBot, a portable Xbox Live Arcade, a
3411360	3415280	Holodeck, and a George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.
3415280	3420780	Please send in your votes via private message for your number one and number two picks.
3420780	3424280	If you don't label them one and two, I will assume that the first one is your number one
3424280	3425280	pick.
3425280	3426680	Send a private message to Sky in the chat.
3426680	3430660	You have about 10 minutes while we go over these next few stories, so place your votes
3430660	3431660	now.
3431660	3435680	Meanwhile, we get back into the gaming news with Dark Sakura.
3435680	3447320	We have our dear friend who is the god of third-party peripherals, mad cats, making
3447320	3449740	instruments for Rock Band.
3449740	3457140	They have a multi-year licensing agreement with MTV Games to do wired and wireless bass
3457140	3465120	guitars and a percussion set that's got drumsticks and a microphone and stuff.
3465120	3468400	So it looks like we're going to be seeing those come out eventually.
3468400	3469400	Awesome.
3469400	3472760	This is the first half of 2008.
3472760	3477640	Well, one place you probably won't be able to get a good deal on those would be at Best
3477640	3485320	Buy and apparently they had a coupon that was in, I guess, one of the local papers for
3485320	3489520	25% off of three toys.
3489520	3495400	You basically buy one toy, save 10%, buy two, save 15, buy three, save 25%.
3495400	3503160	Well, oddly enough, games are listed as under the toy section on the website.
3503160	3509760	However, if you went into a Best Buy and tried to use that coupon, they would not let you
3509760	3518920	because they said that games are not a toys and says, let's see here, apparently an employee
3518920	3526240	at Best Buy said that games and game systems do not apply to that coupon because they're
3526240	3527240	not toys.
3527240	3530840	A toy would be like a doll.
3530840	3537520	Best Buy, ripping people off yet again, awesome.
3537520	3539280	So what do you think of that?
3539280	3546200	Is video games a toy or not?
3546200	3550600	If they're listed under their website as a toy, then yes, I think it would apply as a
3550600	3553760	toy, but you've got to be more clear on that stuff.
3553760	3559360	If you're just saying a toy does not apply to video games, that's what they should have
3559360	3564720	had the fine print on the coupon, but they didn't, I think they should honor it, so that's
3564720	3565720	their own fault.
3565720	3570360	And the fact that they're saying, oh, I'm sorry, that's not a toy, well, it doesn't
3570360	3573120	say it's not and on your website it says it is.
3573120	3577680	I'm sure, though, if you looked it up on their website in the store, since it's a different
3577680	3582640	website, their intranet, probably would be otherwise, but I don't know, they rip people
3582640	3586680	off all the time with this kind of shit.
3586680	3589440	Bait and switch, got to love it.
3589440	3595040	All right, well, we're going to give just a couple more minutes for listless votes,
3595040	3596600	so get those votes in now.
3596600	3599640	We will announce the winner shortly and we're going to be taking your Skype calls on our
3599640	3606400	Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and pretty
3606400	3609880	soon you'll be able to call in from your PSP apparently, but I'm going to ask first, while
3609880	3613480	we wait for any last minute votes, if there's any last minute stories that any of the hosts
3613480	3615640	would like to cover tonight.
3615640	3617360	There's not a whole lot.
3617360	3623200	Sony of course introduced the 16 gigabyte memory stick duo for, you know, obviously
3623200	3626480	cameras and PSP and stuff like that.
3626480	3632440	That's a whole lot of movies on there, or a whole lot of games, depending on how you
3632440	3634000	look at it.
3634000	3638400	I don't know, that's pretty much it.
3638400	3640200	It's been pretty dead.
3640200	3643380	Yeah, it was a very slow week, I noticed that.
3643380	3647800	We had less stories in our show role than usual, so that's all right.
3647800	3652800	Next week will be busier after CES, even though CES isn't really a games show, certainly a
3652800	3654320	lot of the tech news.
3654320	3657720	One thing, speaking of tech, I don't think this came up anywhere, which is strange.
3657720	3661480	I thought we had it in our role, but I don't know if you heard, but Warner Brothers is
3661480	3667580	sending their support of HD DVD, which is a huge blow to HD DVD supporters, which sucks
3667580	3668580	because I'm one of them.
3668580	3672700	They actually have an HD DVD player, but what can you do?
3672700	3675840	In fact, it's the ramifications, because if you think about it, Warner Brothers also owns
3675840	3677500	New Line, which is a huge studio.
3677500	3680140	They did Lord of the Rings, right?
3680140	3684160	This is just a huge blow, and they're saying that this could single-handedly turn things
3684160	3685380	in Blu-ray's favor.
3685380	3689280	But something to keep in mind, Paramount is still HD DVD exclusive, and I believe there's
3689280	3690280	one other studio that's still-
3690280	3691280	Universal?
3691280	3696360	Yeah, HD DVD exclusive, so it isn't necessarily over yet, but that is a very big blow, even
3696360	3701480	I'll admit that, because that means the Batman movies and stuff are going to be Blu-ray exclusive,
3701480	3702480	which kind of sucks.
3702480	3711100	It was also the thing Kmart did too, saying they weren't going to carry Blu-ray.
3711100	3714840	Just one more last minute story, and this is kind of stupid, but apparently some guy
3714840	3719980	shot his son over an Xbox 360 argument.
3719980	3728440	Apparently a 17-year-old in Pennsylvania wanted his father to look at his Xbox 360 for some
3728440	3731560	unknown reason, and the father refused.
3731560	3737720	An argument ensued, resulting in the kid handing a rifle to his father, telling him to just
3737720	3739220	go ahead and shoot him.
3739220	3741480	So the father did.
3741480	3744920	Now apparently the kid is sedated in a hospital with a bullet lodged in his skull, and the
3744920	3748040	father is in jail.
3748040	3749040	Talk about asshole.
3749040	3755680	What's the kid doing with a rifle?
3755680	3758840	That's one of the many questions I have.
3758840	3766100	Hold on, you know what, I'm sorry, this means we need to fire up something for 2008 here.
3766100	3773240	This is the inaugural stupid award of 2008, I'm sorry.
3773240	3777000	Like I've heard these arguments before where, you know, somebody is yelling at somebody
3777000	3780560	else and goes, I'm sure it says like, why don't you just shoot me, why don't you just
3780560	3781560	kill me?
3781560	3785640	Like, that doesn't mean you actually shoot them.
3785640	3788520	Have you ever heard of like a metaphor?
3788520	3796080	Congratulations, what's this guy's name?
3796080	3799080	Uh, they didn't have his name.
3799080	3800800	So Unknown Dead 17.
3800800	3804080	I saw it somewhere, wait, I gotta look at this, I know I saw this somewhere, you have
3804080	3809220	to go to the original site that ran it, because I want to say this happened not that far from
3809220	3811120	where I've been in Pennsylvania before.
3811120	3814800	Let's see, where the hell was it?
3814800	3828160	Uh, person, let's see, 60 year old James Stanley Niedasek shot his 17 year old son.
3828160	3831840	So congratulations James Stanley, I can't pronounce your last name, you win the first
3831840	3836800	stupid award of 2008, courtesy of Orange Launch Radio, for shooting your son in an argument.
3836800	3837800	Ass.
3837800	3846440	Uh, there's a release date for the Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Bully out in the UK, March
3846440	3847440	7th.
3847440	3849160	We're getting that here too, I believe, right?
3849160	3851240	Yeah, it's around March.
3851240	3852240	Sweet-ish.
3852240	3855600	This should be the scholarship edition over here.
3855600	3858440	Gonna be very nice.
3858440	3862680	Alright, shall we get to tonight's listless winners?
3862680	3867760	It was neck and neck tonight, only one vote separated number one and two.
3867760	3873800	But everything got a vote tonight, which doesn't happen very often in listless, but somebody
3873800	3876560	in chat wanted a little bit of everything.
3876560	3879660	But in the end there could be only three, so here it is, your top three gadgets you
3879660	3881880	would like to see them unveil at CES.
3881880	3886560	This is the definitive list, no arguing, it's a very scientific method we use here, it's
3886560	3887840	done.
3887840	3896040	The number three thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is the holodeck.
3896040	3902880	The number two thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is a portal gun, meaning the
3902880	3908720	number one thing you'd like to see at CES either this year or 2009, the George Foreman
3908720	3910760	self-cleaning cow grill.
3910760	3911760	Awesome.
3911760	3914720	It bakes the whole fucking cow.
3914720	3916320	Beautiful.
3916320	3918880	Not bad for a last minute pick to fill in the other number one.
3918880	3924280	Now your only trouble is where do you get a cow?
3924280	3926160	That's the only downside.
3926160	3928900	Tip it over and then put it in a bag, I don't know.
3928900	3932600	That's it, you tip it over into the grill.
3932600	3935360	Nice.
3935360	3938400	Alright.
3938400	3942800	Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line of calls then, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username
3942800	3946000	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to go ahead and give us a call.
3946000	3949640	We'll take your calls, we'll take a few of those.
3949640	3954800	RossdielUT says, Loki, you can get a cow carcass at Publix Easy while here in Florida.
3954800	3957200	I don't even know what that is, to be honest.
3957200	3958960	Do you know what that is?
3958960	3959960	Nope.
3959960	3961600	I know, I have no idea what that is.
3961600	3962600	What?
3962600	3963600	Oh.
3963600	3966960	You have to give this to me now while we're trying to take calls on Skype.
3966960	3967960	Alright.
3967960	3968960	Yes, I had to.
3968960	3970960	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
3970960	3973080	Hi, this is RossdielUT.
3973080	3974080	Hello, RossdielUT.
3974080	3975080	Hi.
3975080	3976080	Friend, buddy, pal.
3976080	3977080	Hey there.
3977080	3978080	What's on your mind?
3978080	3979080	Hey.
3979080	3980680	Oh, nothing much.
3980680	3987120	First off, Publix is a supermarket chain over here in the Southeast.
3987120	3988520	Very big.
3988520	3990340	Very big supermarket chain.
3990340	3991340	They don't have those here.
3991340	3995880	I mean, you can get, like, a lot of meat at the store, but you can't get the whole damn
3995880	3996880	cow.
3996880	4001240	Yeah, I've seen people, I used to work at a Publix once, and yeah, I used to see people
4001240	4002240	getting the cow carcasses.
4002240	4003240	Wow.
4003240	4005240	I guess that's what they do for Thanksgiving instead of a turkey.
4005240	4006240	I don't know.
4006240	4012720	That's something I'd like to see them doing on Supermarket Sweep, putting five of those
4012720	4016800	cow carcasses right in the car.
4016800	4020760	You'd need more than one cart, man, those things are fucking huge.
4020760	4023960	Well that's how they did it on the show, they'd fill up one cart and throw it to their partner
4023960	4027600	and they'd get another cart, alright, anyway.
4027600	4031640	Would Supermarket Sweep not be the best video game ever?
4031640	4032640	I'm sorry?
4032640	4035400	I'm sorry, would Supermarket Sweep not be one of the best video games ever?
4035400	4037960	Like, that's the kind of shit they need to be doing for Xbox Live.
4037960	4038960	Seriously.
4038960	4042440	That would be a good Xbox Live or kid game, actually.
4042440	4043920	I hope Microsoft's listening.
4043920	4044920	I hope you guys are listening.
4044920	4048360	Alright, what else is on your mind, Ross Deal?
4048360	4051200	Let's see, in reaction, a couple of things, actually.
4051200	4057720	In reaction to the whole Warner Bros. New Line thing, the CES HD DVD press conference
4057720	4058720	got cancelled.
4058720	4064680	I heard, it's like they've got their tail between their legs going, argh argh argh argh.
4064680	4068280	Well it's pretty big when you think about it.
4068280	4074840	There's only like three exclusive HD DVD studios left, and Paramount, like I said in the chat,
4074840	4079000	they're only exclusive because Microsoft paid them a boatload of money.
4079000	4082620	I have a bad feeling HD DVD's time is running out, and it kind of makes me sad because I
4082620	4088740	am an HD DVD owner, but here's my question is, I read somewhere that porn was suddenly
4088740	4094360	supporting both HD DVD and Blu-ray, but I seem to remember we covered an article.
4094360	4098640	I've seen pornographic Blu-rays on offer, I've seen them in places.
4098640	4102560	I could have sworn on this program last year we had a story about that the porn industry
4102560	4104960	had gone with HD DVD for some reason.
4104960	4107480	I don't remember the reason, but they went with HD DVD.
4107480	4108960	Why did they go back on that?
4108960	4113800	Because I always said, whoever gets porn wins the war, and now that porn is going to Blu-ray,
4113800	4115960	I'm like, it's over.
4115960	4120960	Well the problem with porn really is that it's not like like a DVD, now you see porn
4120960	4125680	really moving into the downloadable space, so it's perhaps not as important for the
4125680	4131040	disc this time around, because it's pretty much all over the internet, there's a site
4131040	4132040	everywhere for it.
4132040	4133040	You know what I mean?
4133040	4135960	It's not like Xbox Live Marketplace is going to suddenly offer porn, although they ought
4135960	4136960	to.
4136960	4139840	Well, not on Xbox Live Marketplace.
4139840	4141760	Why not?
4141760	4147760	Don't they have a whole slew of horror films that are like the most supreme horror of horror
4147760	4149760	gore fest slash films?
4149760	4153760	I mean, if you're going to have one pornographic extremity, why not have another?
4153760	4157920	I would consider the amount of violence in those films pornographic to an extent.
4157920	4158920	Why not some titties?
4158920	4162800	You could say the same thing about Wal-Mart.
4162800	4165760	They carry those movies and they don't carry porn.
4165760	4172800	Microsoft has an image to protect, but what I was about to say is that you can't go five
4172800	4179580	steps in either direction online without dipping into a pay site, so that's where I see a lot
4179580	4185120	of the pornographic market going is online, because you don't have to worry about people
4185120	4188720	picketing in front of porn shops or whatever.
4188720	4191360	It's a lot less trouble than having brick and mortar.
4191360	4193520	I'm picketing in front of your internet.
4193520	4197560	I know why they can't do porn on Xbox Live, because it would shut it down again.
4197560	4199120	I mean, do you think the holidays were bad?
4199120	4203440	I mean, the day porn is released on Xbox Live, the internet is going to die.
4203440	4206520	Oh, then you'll really see those stupid stories.
4206520	4210560	It's a gateway to porn, because none of the parents are going to be...
4210560	4217360	Well, the problem is they already did that with the Wii, so you remember that a few months
4217360	4218360	back.
4218360	4224840	My child went to XTube on the Wii.
4224840	4228760	Anything with any sort of internet capability is going to have pornography.
4228760	4234400	My concern is if it ever went to Xbox Live or a cage, you'd have a bunch of people go
4234400	4239080	on and watch some porn, and they go play Halo or Uno with their cameras, and you see them
4239080	4240080	all.
4240080	4244980	Well, the PlayStation Network is going to get porn pretty soon, with Home coming out
4244980	4249560	there, and you're going to be able to put a TV in your home, and you can put porn and
4249560	4251800	stream it off of your, well, 88 hard drive.
4251800	4256060	I bet anything you're only going to get to put pre-selected video clips that just happen
4256060	4258720	to be clips from Sony's latest movies and TV shows.
4258720	4260520	No, it's going to be stuff that's off your hard drive.
4260520	4261520	It's going to be anything, yeah.
4261520	4262520	Really?
4262520	4263520	Anything on your hard drive, yeah.
4263520	4264520	Anything on your hard drive, yeah.
4264520	4265520	Anything on your hard drive, yeah.
4265520	4266520	Any available at home.
4266520	4267520	Yeah.
4267520	4268640	Are you going to have a virtual porn house in Home?
4268640	4269640	Sure, why not?
4269640	4270640	No, it's going to be fun.
4270640	4275700	Oh, what I want to know is are they going to be, you throw cocks at people in Home.
4275700	4278360	Are they going to throw cocks at people?
4278360	4279360	Second Life.
4279360	4281720	Jamie, did you have something you wanted to say to this?
4281720	4282720	Exactly, everything else is Second Life.
4282720	4285800	I was just going to say Walmart wasn't exactly the best thing to bring up, since they actually
4285800	4290100	sold censored versions of movies.
4290100	4291320	Not here.
4291320	4295480	I totally agree with the point that Wal-Mart's just as bigoted as everybody else in this
4295480	4300920	sense that they're going to sell the violent movies, but heaven forbid our children see
4300920	4301920	titties!
4301920	4303040	Oh no!
4303040	4306000	Heaven forbid we teach them responsible sex at the young age!
4306000	4307960	Wal-Mart is a huge contradiction.
4307960	4313720	They'll sell the unrated movies gladly, they'll sell the M-rated games gladly, but they won't
4313720	4316280	sell porn and they won't sell music with explicit lyrics.
4316280	4318160	I never understood that.
4318160	4319160	Never.
4319160	4324760	I will never forget that fucking Sheryl Crow, of all people, got banned from Wal-Mart because
4324760	4329720	she said in one of her songs she had a lyric about somebody buying a gun at a Wal-Mart
4329720	4330720	store.
4330720	4333040	Well, you can, in fact, buy guns at Wal-Mart stores.
4333040	4334040	Yes, you can.
4334040	4335040	They have a hunting section.
4335040	4340920	So Wal-Mart fucking bans Sheryl Crow, because Sheryl Crow poses this huge threat to society.
4340920	4342880	Like what's going to happen, you know?
4342880	4345720	She does, however, pose a huge threat to good music.
4345720	4350240	You know, when I think of hard fucking core music, I think of Sheryl Crow.
4350240	4351240	Exactly.
4351240	4360000	Anyway, last thing before I go, you'll be happy to know that long after it's been released,
4360000	4363120	they're releasing a Stranglehold map pack.
4363120	4364120	I'd actually heard about that.
4364120	4367400	I got the email from Midway, except I never played Stranglehold in the first place, so
4367400	4368400	I forgot about that.
4368400	4371880	I was about to say, I mean, it wasn't exactly a best-selling game.
4371880	4374740	Why would anyone care at this point?
4374740	4378000	Usually they were already making it, thinking the game was going to be huge, and now it's
4378000	4381120	just kind of one of those wah-wah kind of releases, you know?
4381120	4384240	Yeah, they kind of have to at this point, huh?
4384240	4385240	Yeah.
4385240	4389280	And if you spent the resources on it, if you can make 50 bucks off it, why not?
4389280	4390280	Exactly.
4390280	4391840	It's better than nothing.
4391840	4393600	Try to recover the cost of the people making it.
4393600	4395840	All right, well, Rossdiel YouTube, we've got to let you go to take some other calls, but
4395840	4397840	thank you very much for your call.
4397840	4398840	Have a good one, man.
4398840	4399840	Always a lot of fun.
4399840	4400840	Bye-bye.
4400840	4401840	Bye-bye.
4401840	4403640	I think it's so funny, Rossdiel YouTube, because, you know, he's such a critic in chat
4403640	4407280	and says a lot of, but when you get him on the phone, he's such a nice guy, oh, laugh
4407280	4408280	a lot.
4408280	4409280	No, it's cool.
4409280	4410280	All right, let's take some more calls.
4410280	4411280	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4411280	4412280	Who's this?
4412280	4413280	Hello.
4413280	4415280	This is Arke Rieper in chat.
4415280	4416280	Hi.
4416280	4417280	How are you?
4417280	4418280	I'm fine.
4418280	4419280	What's on your mind?
4419280	4421420	I'm calling from Sweden, actually.
4421420	4422920	You're calling from Sweden?
4422920	4426600	It's got to be like four in the morning over there.
4426600	4431000	I think I'm the first one to actually call from Sweden, maybe.
4431000	4432000	I think so.
4432000	4433000	I think he is.
4433000	4438160	We've had people in, like, England, and I want to say we've had South America, definitely,
4438160	4439160	Mexico.
4439160	4440160	Argentina.
4440160	4441160	Mexico.
4441160	4442160	I want to say we've had another...
4442160	4443160	You've had Denmark.
4443160	4444160	Denmark was it, but we haven't had Sweden.
4444160	4446160	Well, welcome to the show.
4446160	4449320	Well, good evening, so to say.
4449320	4450800	Well, I don't know.
4450800	4460960	I was a bit pissed last year, since in your years of years, your best of year, since never
4460960	4466440	ever spoke about that the expansion for World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, actually came
4466440	4477660	out, but then again, I just was like, wait, did that actually got released last year?
4477660	4479440	It seems like it was a long time ago.
4479440	4480440	You're right.
4480440	4483800	That did come out in January, and as far as PC games go, that was a huge title.
4483800	4489600	Now, in all fairness, and to cover our rears a little bit, we did talk about BlizzCon.
4489600	4491280	We talked about the wrath of Lich King.
4491280	4498240	I remember, I don't know actually when I got hooked on your show for some reason, but I've
4498240	4506180	been listening to your show like, I would say, maybe a year and a half, but then again,
4506180	4514600	I had some, what is it, since I've upgraded platform from going from Macintosh to PC nowadays,
4514600	4522960	so I've had, what is it, one and a half year that didn't go that well.
4522960	4523960	Do you play WoW yourself?
4523960	4529760	Are you really big into Burning Crusade?
4529760	4538480	I would say that I'm a huge WoW player, since that's basically almost the only thing I played.
4538480	4541960	What did I buy games last year?
4541960	4551320	It was Burning Crusade, and I tried out Eve Online this summer, and then I bought the
4551320	4552320	Orange Box.
4552320	4553320	Good choice.
4553320	4554320	Good taste.
4554320	4556800	And that I share with games, really.
4556800	4559880	Here's my question, though, to you, because I notice you're mentioning a lot of PC games,
4559880	4563280	and we always like to ask our callers who call in from other countries, because I know
4563280	4567240	a lot of times here on this program we focus on, here's what's happening in Japan, here's
4567240	4569680	what's happening in the U.S.
4569680	4574080	We try to cover the overseas stuff, but sometimes it's best to kind of hear it firsthand, what
4574080	4575760	the gaming scene's like overseas.
4575760	4579760	For instance, we've kind of heard from callers that have called from Latin and South American
4579760	4584360	countries talk about that a lot of the scene is very expensive there.
4584360	4586960	What would you say the gaming scene is like in Sweden?
4586960	4591720	Is it easy to walk into a store and pick up the latest and greatest game or console, or
4591720	4593720	is it a challenge?
4593720	4595960	That's like a piece of cake.
4595960	4601240	The only problem is that, well, what?
4601240	4613920	Games are currently quite fun in one way, since the PS3 is, for the cost of a PS3, you
4613920	4620860	can actually get a decent computer and start playing WoW or Orange Box, whatever you want
4620860	4621860	to.
4621860	4622860	Interesting.
4622860	4625040	Well, they do say the PS3 is supposed to be a computer.
4625040	4626800	Well, at least they keep going back and forth on that.
4626800	4627800	Yes, it's a computer.
4627800	4628800	No, it's not.
4628800	4636400	And still, I, what is it, they, there was a argument that really that the cell engine,
4636400	4642360	which is in the PS3, is not even made for games, so.
4642360	4648680	So I'm assuming that the PlayStation 3 sales in Sweden are similar to that they are here,
4648680	4652680	where there's quite still a big pile of them at the store waiting to be moved.
4652680	4653680	Yeah.
4653680	4656160	Yeah, it really is.
4656160	4658200	But then it was, oh.
4658200	4662760	So I guess maybe we aren't so different after all.
4662760	4664940	When you look at that.
4664940	4673600	Maybe you want to cut me off right now, but anyway, I just want to say, Sky, what is it?
4673600	4680480	You have a 7E Druid, which I'm quite impressed in one way, since, well, what?
4680480	4690920	In a way, just, well related, I've played World of Warcraft on US servers for one year,
4690920	4695560	and I never even got to level 40.
4695560	4697480	Are you playing on a PvP server?
4697480	4698960	That's probably why.
4698960	4704460	PvP servers was, well, was it, it was Warsong.
4704460	4714320	But here's the thing, I've developed the infamous Altiholic disease, which is that you made,
4714320	4721160	well, one character, and then you get it to get a character of like 35 or something, and
4721160	4726360	then you play another one, and then you repeat that for quite some time.
4726360	4732200	So basically you have WoW ADD is what we would call it, where you just, you can't focus on
4732200	4733200	one character.
4733200	4735640	I have plenty of friends who do that same thing.
4735640	4739320	I was like, I haven't got a character past level 8.
4739320	4749920	Although, really, I actually have 63 Mage nowadays.
4749920	4751720	And well, what is it?
4751720	4758480	When the Burning Crusade came out, I switched to European servers.
4758480	4764400	So well, they made it a lot easier to level.
4764400	4773000	But then again, when the 2.3 patch later, that came out just a few months, one month
4773000	4778240	ago or something, not even that, made it a lot easier to level.
4778240	4781360	You know, I don't know what it is, and I do have to wrap up and get going soon, but I
4781360	4785820	will say this about Druid is that what's amazing about that class is it's one of the last classes
4785820	4789180	I tried playing in WoW, and I think the reason I've stuck with it so long is that you really
4789180	4792760	can do a little bit of everything as a Druid, and that's why I have so much fun with it.
4792760	4799360	Because I can spam Moonfire or whatever, but then I can heal, or in a pinch I can flip
4799360	4804120	in a bear form and tank, even though I'm not very good at it because I'm spec'd for balance.
4804120	4806280	But you know, it's kind of interesting.
4806280	4809240	So yeah, well I know how fun Druid is.
4809240	4812320	I got one at level 45 at 2.3.
4812320	4817960	Now you need to take it a little higher.
4817960	4824680	They were speaking about what was the New Year's promises or stuff, and my problem is
4824680	4830200	that I will say that I will get one character at level 70, but then I just realized that
4830200	4838360	there's this new MMO that's been announced that's called Warhammer Age of Reckoning,
4838360	4852520	which is highly anticipated in my ranks, which is Weehoo.
4852520	4855120	Well it sounds like it could be a big year into 2008.
4855120	4859900	Hopefully we don't neglect to mention that at this year's end special, or we might get
4859900	4862000	another call berating us.
4862000	4863000	No, I'm just kidding.
4863000	4865440	Anyway, we've got to wrap up.
4865440	4868360	I don't mind letting the international calls go on a long time, though, because I know
4868360	4872400	you've got to stay up very, very late to listen to our program, and we appreciate it.
4872400	4873400	But thank you so much.
4873400	4879000	Do you have any other quick final thoughts, things you want to share with our listeners?
4879000	4880000	I don't know.
4880000	4882920	Just keep on the way to the show.
4882920	4887040	It's really one of the greatest I have heard so far.
4887040	4888040	Well thank you.
4888040	4890040	I appreciate that.
4890040	4894240	Hats off for you.
4894240	4896080	Appreciate it very much.
4896080	4899640	Thank you so much for staying up and listening to us, a true fan.
4899640	4903280	Take care, buddy.
4903280	4910880	It is actually my second attempt in listening to you live.
4910880	4915560	I'm usually not, well since it's the hour, difference is such a huge difference.
4915560	4921120	One of these days, we're going to have to do a show at noon to give our British, not
4921120	4925280	just British, but overseas listeners a break, you know, everybody over in those time zones,
4925280	4926280	you know.
4926280	4927280	Maybe we'll have to.
4927280	4928280	Sweden, Denmark, all of them.
4928280	4929280	All right.
4929280	4930280	I've got to let you go.
4930280	4931640	Thanks so much for the call, though.
4931640	4933480	We love hearing from the international folks.
4933480	4934480	It's awesome.
4934480	4937760	We'll do one more call if you've got any other calls coming in.
4937760	4938760	Hi.
4938760	4939760	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4939760	4940760	Who's this?
4940760	4941760	Hey, it's Ron.
4941760	4942760	What's up, everybody?
4942760	4943760	Hey.
4943760	4944760	How you doing, Rama?
4944760	4945760	I'm doing good.
4945760	4948000	I'm finally recovering from my holidays, and so how about you guys?
4948000	4949000	I'm doing fine.
4949000	4951160	Thank you for the card, by the way, on a personal note.
4951160	4952160	Hey, no problem.
4952160	4954440	Jamie, did you get your card yet?
4954440	4955620	I have to check the mail.
4955620	4959240	We have a pile of it, and I've been sort of too sick to look at anything.
4959240	4960960	You know what's hilarious, Rama?
4960960	4963300	Your car actually got wet because of the storms.
4963300	4964640	The rain got in my mailbox.
4964640	4965960	Isn't that crazy?
4965960	4966960	No.
4966960	4968840	That happened to Dan's friend, Will.
4968840	4973000	He was expecting the title to his truck, and he found it floating in the gutter.
4973000	4974000	Oh, my God.
4974000	4975240	Well, it wasn't that bad.
4975240	4980480	It's just that the wind actually blew open the little flap, and water got in there.
4980480	4981480	It's crazy.
4981480	4982480	So, anyway, sorry, Rama.
4982480	4983480	Enough about me boo-hooing.
4983480	4985480	What's on your mind?
4985480	4986480	Not much.
4986480	4987480	I'll make this brief.
4987480	4988960	I finally got a chance to play Rock Band.
4988960	4990760	Oh, what did you think of Rock Band?
4990760	4991760	It is great.
4991760	4995760	It has got to be one of the greatest games I've played all year.
4995760	4999480	I am probably one of the only people on the planet that thinks that Guitar Hero 3 has
4999480	5001880	a better song list than Rock Band.
5001880	5002880	I don't know why.
5002880	5004280	I'm just not as into the songs in Rock Band.
5004280	5007560	Although, I will say, Rock Band has some great download songs.
5007560	5011400	I actually like that Attack song a lot, the one you told me to get.
5011400	5015000	I actually really like that song.
5015000	5019160	Rock Band's growing on me, but here's my question, because I was just thinking about this earlier
5019160	5020160	today.
5020160	5022180	I know it's your call and everything, but I'm deflecting.
5022180	5026440	What do you think they could do for Rock Band 2?
5026440	5028360	I have more instruments.
5028360	5031160	A keyboard would be nice for Rock Band 2.
5031160	5033480	That I would like to see happen.
5033480	5036760	You know what I think they should do for Rock Band 2?
5036760	5038000	Not have a Rock Band 2.
5038000	5040120	I think they should come out with Pop Band.
5040120	5046520	And I think in Pop Band they should get rid of maybe the guitar, lose the guitar and put
5046520	5048860	the keyboard in instead or something.
5048860	5050360	Or lose the bass and put it in the keyboard.
5050360	5051360	I don't know.
5051360	5055960	But I would love to see them do a Pop Band game, although I don't know how that would
5055960	5056960	go over.
5056960	5061560	Well, if they do a Rock Band 2, maybe one of the controls could be a double axe handle
5061560	5062560	controller.
5062560	5066240	That would be pretty rad to have, because that's what my character has.
5066240	5070440	I have a giant double axe controller with a big unicorn on it, because you can put stickers
5070440	5071440	on a guitar.
5071440	5072440	So I put a big unicorn on it.
5072440	5074000	It's awesome.
5074000	5077000	Dan has the tattoo of the snake coming out of the pants.
5077000	5078000	Nice.
5078000	5082720	And every time he shows it off, he goes, what's a trouser snake?
5082720	5088120	SSJ100 Matt says Polka Band, and Dark Knight says, I gotta have cowbells?
5088120	5091120	If there's a Polka Band, it's gotta be Weird Al.
5091120	5096960	I think I was telling you about this the other day, that our friend was, while she was highly
5096960	5104000	intoxicated, by the way, walking around with a cup and a pencil playing cowbell.
5104000	5106960	That's great.
5106960	5111960	So as a long time, because I know you've been a long time fan of Konami's Bimani series
5111960	5117080	and DDR and all that stuff, and I know that's how you kind of first came to our station.
5117080	5123200	What do you think Konami could do to kind of step it up and give Harmonix a little competition?
5123200	5130000	Well, actually bring over more of the Bimani games and fine-tune it more for American audiences
5130000	5133880	instead of- Did we lose him?
5133880	5134880	Hello?
5134880	5135880	Oh, I'm right here.
5135880	5136880	Sorry.
5136880	5137880	Sorry.
5137880	5139800	Fine-tune it for American audiences instead of-
5139800	5144400	Instead of putting in rehashes of some of the Japanese songs, like with DDR.
5144400	5149600	Since I enjoy DDR, I would like to see more American songs in the game.
5149600	5155000	That's just me personally, but I know a lot of the die-hard to leave it the way it is.
5155000	5158880	Have you heard about that new Konami Bimani game?
5158880	5161560	It looks like it's Ju-Beat, but it's pronounced differently.
5161560	5162560	I think it's U-Beat.
5162560	5163560	Yeah, U-Beat.
5163560	5164560	Have you heard about U-Beat?
5164560	5166880	No, I have not.
5166880	5169160	It's a new Bimani game that's coming out over there.
5169160	5175240	It was just location tested a couple weeks ago, and it looks like it uses 16 monitors
5175240	5176240	as the buttons.
5176240	5177240	I don't know.
5177240	5178560	It looked like a funky version of Whac-A-Mole to me.
5178560	5179560	Yeah.
5179560	5180560	Isn't that kind of what it looked like?
5180560	5181560	It was like Whac-A-Mole to music.
5181560	5182560	It's like a touch screen or something.
5182560	5184280	That might be kind of interesting.
5184280	5185280	That would be freaking awesome.
5185280	5187360	Except how can you play that on a home console?
5187360	5191180	So it's something that's only going to be in arcades, if anything.
5191180	5192180	Pretty much.
5192180	5196520	One of the things I've noticed is that when me and my roommate, when we play Guitar Hero,
5196520	5200360	it's like, eh, eh, we have to trade off controllers back and forth.
5200360	5201920	There's just more than one person here.
5201920	5205760	I mean with Rock Band, my friend brought it up, it was like for the Christmas party, it
5205760	5208120	was like the ultimate party game.
5208120	5213360	You have a lot of people, you got WarioWare, you got the Mario parties, but you break out
5213360	5218060	Rock Band, everybody will just show up and you start playing, you're switching off controllers
5218060	5219060	back and forth.
5219060	5223800	You're just getting together, having a good time, and well, when we have Rock Band, we
5223800	5229880	called it Rockstar because right on the other side of the room, we have all the alcohols,
5229880	5233280	all the mixers all set up, so we were definitely having fun with it.
5233280	5238640	I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the chat room and of course Dark Tetsuya's got to go and
5238640	5241920	be smart and says a DS version would work for U-Beat.
5241920	5248600	Anyhow, Rama, I got to let you go, wrap up the show here, any quick final thoughts?
5248600	5249800	Two quick things.
5249800	5255520	My game of the year was Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass, and worst game of the year, Role
5255520	5257440	vs. SmackDown 08.
5257440	5260440	Why those two?
5260440	5263240	For me to get into a game, you have to take my full attention.
5263240	5268720	Any game that can help me kill a 45-minute train ride from homework vice versa is definitely
5268720	5273560	up in my book, and Phantom Hourglass was one of the few DS games that were able to have
5273560	5274560	me do that.
5274560	5279440	As for Role vs. SmackDown 08, I'm an average wrestling fan, I just didn't like the fact
5279440	5284000	that they took so much out of the Wii version compared to the other versions of the game.
5284000	5287360	Basically, the Wii got the gimped version of the game.
5287360	5288640	That's why it gets worst game of the year.
5288640	5293040	I just had to ask because you're one of the two people who didn't say Yaris, so I just
5293040	5294040	had to ask.
5294040	5295040	I don't have a 360 yet.
5295040	5296040	Ah, there you go.
5296040	5299200	All right, well, DJ Rama asks, we got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling
5299200	5300200	us always.
5300200	5301200	Take care.
5301200	5302200	All right, you too.
5302200	5303200	Bye-bye.
5303200	5304200	Bye.
5304200	5305200	That's going to do it for calls tonight.
5305200	5306200	We've had a lot of very long calls tonight, but that's all right.
5306200	5310080	We heard we had some callers we haven't heard from in a while, callers we hear from regularly,
5310080	5314880	Rama, and a caller from overseas that we never heard from before who stayed up very, very,
5314880	5317080	very late to listen to our program.
5317080	5319280	It's quarter to six over there, right?
5319280	5322160	We ought to let him go to bed, so we probably should wrap things up.
5322160	5325280	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5325280	5329720	And Dark Sakura, we'll start with you, your final thought.
5329720	5332460	Bye.
5332460	5335960	My final thought is I'm going to get a bug lamp for this room and every time it goes
5335960	5338520	bzzt, I'm going to laugh.
5338520	5339520	Loki.
5339520	5344120	Big rigs over the road racing is really, really, really bad.
5344120	5346760	All right.
5346760	5350760	I'll take your word for it because I am not going to play it, although not as bad as I
5350760	5351760	thought I would be.
5351760	5352760	All right.
5352760	5355800	I think there's some where those Wii conspiracy games are even worse.
5355800	5359920	Thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent
5359920	5360920	radio.
5360920	5361920	We appreciate it.
5361920	5364600	We would be nowhere without you guys and your word of mouth.
5364600	5368880	So if you like what you've heard, please tell two people about our show, spread the word
5368880	5369880	about Orange Launch Radio.
5369880	5373000	If you tell two people, then slowly we'll take over the world because we don't have
5373000	5377780	any magazines or websites to get million views a month that we can advertise on.
5377780	5380280	We literally broadcast out of my garage.
5380280	5383220	So it's independent radio at its finest.
5383220	5388000	If you don't feel so inclined to tell people, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes
5388000	5392320	or Digg or Yahoo podcasts or any of those sites because that works too.
5392320	5396120	Anyhow, thank you guys so much for tuning in this week.
5396120	5401840	Next week we will be back and we'll have more gaming news and more stuff to come in the
5401840	5403540	year 2008.
5403540	5405800	Hopefully some surprises here on the program.
5405800	5408900	I was trying to book some guests for the upcoming shows.
5408900	5411080	So hopefully we'll have some of those in the next few weeks.
5411080	5412560	So more to come.
5412560	5414240	Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.
5414240	5415440	She's Dark Sakura.
5415440	5416520	He's Loki.
5416520	5417520	And we're out.
5417520	5423040	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5423040	5426560	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
