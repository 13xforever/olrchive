487	5568	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5888	14730	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15450	19131	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19971	25152	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 6th of 2008.
26253	27453	Feels a little weird to be saying that, 2008.
28592	29393	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
51727	54388	Yeah, they just kind of, they briefly went over everything.
54508	58329	They were talking a little bit about some mobile platforms and stuff like that.
58349	61710	In fact, actually, that's what they're talking about a new telephone service right now.
62310	75254	And apparently, I guess their sync service, you know, the one that you keep seeing the commercials for, is basically going to be ripping off OnStar, including, you know, if you get in an accident, sync will call, you know, 911, you know, and then play them a song or something.
76894	79595	No, they'll tell them that you've been in an accident and get...
81655	82955	Gaming-related stuff.
83296	84856	They've announced a whole lot of stuff.
86297	88118	A couple things they announced, of course.
88498	93661	They've sold 17.7 million units worldwide so far to date.
93841	99464	Did $3.5 billion in business through November.
101465	104106	Right now, of course, past the 10 million member mark on live.
104788	115014	They did announce that their Xbox Live video marketplace is going to have some new additions, including ABC and Disney are going to be bringing their TV shows to live.
115814	118136	So you're going to get Lost and Desperate Housewives.
118516	120057	Lost, Desperate Housewives, that kind of stuff.
120217	121337	Gotcha.
122278	127861	Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding MGM movies as well that are going to be coming out.
129040	135684	In the UK, they're going to be offering their medium room service, which is like their IPTV and that kind of thing.
136865	142049	Apparently, though, there's going to be a company, British Telecommunication, I think, BT.
142449	147152	They're going to be partnering with them to use the 360 as a set-top box.
147212	149554	So basically, you'll be able to watch TV, I guess, through that.
150134	150814	So that's kind of neat.
150874	151935	But they have no...
153664	156026	Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.
157067	158508	It's still going on.
158828	163212	Right now they're doing some phone service and they're showing... What was the thing you were talking about?
163312	172900	Right when we were doing the music break between Part A and B here live, you were mentioning something about a Zune MySpace type thing?
173160	174541	Yeah, they have the Zune Social.
174721	178344	It's going to be basically a part of their website.
178464	179965	You can create your own page.
180005	181867	It'll have your
183584	186425	Zune pick and your Zune tag and that kind of stuff.
186865	197587	It'll basically show all your stats, kind of what you're listening to, your top three songs, songs that you've flagged as your favorites, that kind of thing.
197667	199288	Customers will be able to go through there.
199568	201208	So it's last FM for your Zune.
201428	202128	Sort of, yeah.
202188	204549	You can listen to songs that other people are listening to.
204689	210730	You can buy those songs and you can visit their friends and listen to songs and that kind of thing.
212571	213051	Interesting.
213407	214668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
230973	241137	Talking about being able to hook everything up between the TV, your Windows PC, your mobile PC, your Zoom, etc.
241658	242118	Interesting.
243258	249521	Now, Sakuramax is in our chat right now at chat.orangeonline.com and really doesn't give a shit about anything you're saying, Loki.
249841	253363	What Sakuramax wants to know is how many copies of Eye of Judgment have moved?
253863	255283	That's what we really want the update on.
255424	255764	I don't know.
255804	258785	We haven't gotten the new MPD numbers yet.
259090	260711	But we're not close to a million yet, are we?
261712	263313	We haven't even broke 100,000 yet.
264713	265054	All right.
266634	269156	Let's go ahead and go back to the gaming news then.
269236	273739	And Loki will keep one eye on the Consumer Electronics Show speech and let us know.
273819	274379	Just break in.
274399	275900	If anything really big is announced, just break in.
275960	276340	Definitely.
276560	276780	All right.
276901	278461	Anyways, let's start things off.
278842	280703	And this is a little bit surprising.
281083	285005	Apparently, Nintendo is no longer shipping the Wavebird to stores right now.
285926	287727	They have kind of phased out that system.
288419	295482	No word, though, if, you know, I guess... I really wish that they would just allow the classic controller to play GameCube games.
295582	301445	I think that would make things a lot easier, because it's a pain in the ass to have to have a GameCube controller to play GameCube games and stuff.
301986	302326	I don't know.
302666	311050	But, um, right now, apparently there's no other way, you know, to play your classic games on the virtual console if you don't have a GameCube controller.
311070	315332	I guess you could buy a wired controller, but, um, or one of those third-party...
316209	318250	controllers that's like a WaveBird, like I have.
319571	322213	The WaveBird is an amazing piece of hardware, too.
322313	325695	I mean, everybody knows that it's like a really great game controller.
326435	332899	And, you know, it was obviously, you know, it was wireless, kind of before you had the Xbox 360 wireless and PS3, you know, 6-axis or whatever.
334000	334920	Just a great peripheral.
334940	337982	It's kind of weird that it's going away now before Smash Bros.
338022	338742	Melee is out.
339243	340984	So if you were hoping to control Smash Bros.
341004	343725	Melee with a WaveBird, you better get your hands on it if you don't already have one.
344266	344926	I've got mine.
345590	346650	I don't have one, sadly.
346930	350971	One of the things I was talking about, real quick, just to break in with the CES stuff.
350991	360514	They were talking about how, I guess, this new phone service that they're doing, I think it's called Tell Me.
361374	364635	It will actually allow you to use your phone.
364655	366916	Like, say, for example, it has GPS and stuff.
367196	371897	You walk up to a theater, it will show you on the phone what's playing there and that kind of stuff and all the information.
371937	372557	You can buy tickets.
373278	386009	One of the other things that they're showing is you can actually use your phone's camera to point in that building and get directions to how to get to the building, what the building is, and that kind of stuff.
386089	387691	It will know, I guess.
388752	389172	Freaky.
389212	390193	Kind of freaky.
390293	394597	Pretty soon it's going to be the Jetsons, flying cars, video phones, all that stuff.
395417	396698	We already have video phones.
396718	397499	I guess we kind of do.
397859	399541	We have to do teleconferencing.
400091	401612	Hey, you know, actually, I'll say this.
402193	405056	I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but I gotta say, this is pretty awesome.
406237	407978	Maybe I mentioned this last week.
408058	411041	No, I couldn't have, because the New Year's thing happened after last week.
411816	415057	I had a little New Year's get-together here at the place.
415638	417098	Shane is obviously a good friend of mine.
417158	419279	Meek Latavi's been on the show before.
419319	424961	He doesn't live here anymore because Konami folded in the Bay Area, so he went back to Kansas.
425641	427722	He's back there, and he couldn't come to the party.
428022	433584	But we got on the Xbox 360 cam, and I hooked up the cam, and so we could all wave at him through the camera.
434945	437886	I was talking on the phone with him at the same time because he doesn't have a headset or whatever.
438246	441729	So, you know, it's kind of like a way for him to kind of see everybody without actually being here.
441789	445632	I just thought that was really neat, you know, and that's kind of a video phone in that regard.
445752	454780	And that's sort of what I was thinking because even now a lot of cameras like, you know, that one's got, doesn't that one have a microphone on it?
454880	455460	Well, EyeSight?
455600	455901	Oh, yeah.
456601	462146	So, really all you need is a camera with a microphone and speaker and there you go.
463542	469784	So that was the equivalent you had with the Xbox camera and being on the phone.
470585	474666	It's not too far off to being an everyday thing available in the home, I think.
475567	476007	Yeah.
476047	477607	It's kind of surprising we're not already there.
477907	481609	Because I remember that was a big thing they always talked about in the 80s and 90s was the video phone.
482089	482589	Kind of interesting.
482669	488591	It's more, I think, something that they've put more in a business-oriented type market, though.
488631	492653	Because I've worked at places that had video teleconferencing, so.
493595	494955	Dark Tetsuya was asking if we were playing Strip Uno.
494995	495076	No.
495096	495176	Perv.
523294	530049	But you do bring up a good point because I have joked on this program that Strip Uno is really the only reason to have an Xbox 360 cam right now.
530370	532474	Well, I found another decent use for it, so there you go.
535199	535919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
557566	564650	Well, the smacketh was laid downeth, and you cannot actually download full DS games coming to the Wii.
564690	565910	That is not in the future.
566351	575035	What is in the future, however, is what Japan already has, the DS demos being downloaded from your Wii to the Nintendo DS, which I think we all saw coming.
576036	578557	That functionality is almost already there to an extent.
578597	586281	You can't download them yet, but if you own a copy of Geometry Wars Galaxies, you can actually beam a copy of Geometry Wars DS version to your DS.
586821	589082	So that functionality is already there in some games.
591543	606669	But no full DS games at this time, which is fine because that would mean there would have to be a whole other memory unit, which means they would probably unleash a... I'll bet you anything if they do remodel the DS, a new DS remodel is going to come out with some type of onboard memory so they can do that.
607429	608169	But we'll see.
608349	609230	It wouldn't surprise me.
609570	609710	Yeah.
610839	629284	Well, someone decided to be original, as I say this in humongous quote fingers, and bring out a peripheral for the cell phone to play different games on that is called a Z-Mote, put out by the company called Z2.
629724	631365	It's a Bluetooth.
632025	634705	It looks just like the Wiimote, only smaller.
634725	636606	It fits directly in your palm.
637538	643262	On the Nintendo Wiimote, isn't the button on the Wiimote referred to as the Z button?
656224	657485	Isn't that the Z button in games?
658546	660747	On the Nunchuck, it's the Z button.
660767	661728	That's what I thought.
661768	666591	When you do a little ground pound in Mario Galaxy, that's the Z button you're hitting, right?
667032	668733	Yeah, this isn't going to be a lawsuit at all or anything.
669033	669293	No.
669574	671235	Oh, but it's black.
672616	674097	Oh, well then that makes all the difference.
674137	675238	And it looks like it's matte.
675278	675998	It's not shiny.
676639	677859	Oh, well, shit.
678460	679801	That just means the parts are cheaper.
683624	683764	Yeah.
683784	684004	Yeah.
684898	687739	But I mean, seriously, what games are you going to play on your cell phone with this?
688379	688799	Come on.
689859	690239	Really, kids.
690259	696521	Maybe if you're trying to play Pac-Man, because I can tell you from experience that Super Pac-Man on a cell phone is damn near impossible.
697041	697881	Yeah, really.
699121	703322	One thing that's damn near impossible is to get a damn game that's not censored in some way.
704123	707784	And unfortunately, Metal Slug 3 has been censored in the U.S.
707884	709164	on Xbox Live Arcade.
710104	713905	Instead of spewing streams of blood in the zombie stage,
714281	719982	You spew streaming something, some white substance.
721442	723223	White substance, that's even worse, I think.
723403	723703	Semen.
725143	729084	Yes, you shoot streams of semen.
729424	733805	Anyways... That's even grosser than blood.
734245	739186	But if you want to fix it so that there's blood again, all you have to do is just...
740498	741999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
767930	768450	Metal Slug 3 Metal Gear 3
788982	791463	The zombie stage is like my freaking favorite in the whole game.
791824	804070	But nevertheless, the news about a desensitized version of Metal Slug and the fact that things have to be toned down for us here in America because we can't handle the blood, that just incites rage within us.
804290	808973	I don't know about you guys, but it motivates us to do a little segment here we call the FUs of the Week.
824741	828102	So, um, my FUs are multiple fold.
829683	834224	Um, first is, uh, to being sick because I lost two days of work.
835024	843187	I mean, I got sick pay forms, that's okay, but... I just, I turn into a big emo mess whenever I'm really, really sick.
844067	851129	Because I'm just so tired all the time, so I was really just crabby and upset and I hated it.
851169	852790	And I'm feeling better today, but...
854044	883205	I have to go back to work tomorrow and on top of that I have to go in early but it's a good reason why I'm going in early because I'm going to my school tomorrow to see how close I am to graduating I might actually qualify for yet my ninth change of major since starting my college career ten years ago and also an F you goes to my right hand middle finger because I've started developing the symptoms of trigger finger in that one as well
883766	890087	So I think that I might have actually injured something instead of it being some sort of naturally causing thing.
890107	896728	Because normally Sugarfinger sets in if you're older or do a lot of heavy pulling with your hands and I don't do either.
897348	901989	I push and I type and that's about it and that's not what causes Sugarfinger.
902029	905170	So I get to go back and get another shot in my hand which is going to be fun.
906810	907510	And that's the end.
909511	911071	Loki, do you have anything you want to F you?
912374	917538	I'm not really mad at much of anything other than the really crappy drivers for the NVIDIA cards.
917858	931387	Apparently the latest graphics driver that they have now, for whatever reason, when my system boots up, it keeps flashing black every now and then, and I basically have to switch my resolution down to something lower than switch back up to normal, and it stops.
931807	935270	So I don't know why it's doing that, because the older drivers didn't do it.
935770	937711	But anyways, so that sucks.
937831	939492	The other thing that kind of really sucks...
940734	944515	Well, there wasn't really much more announcements, I guess, at CES.
944655	947495	At least the Microsoft thing.
947635	948176	That's it.
948556	951236	No Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.
951476	951856	They're done.
952076	955037	They just basically had Slash come on stage and they played some Guitar Hero 3.
956297	957137	Lame!
959178	961358	Isn't that the way an episode of Scooby-Doo would end?
962018	962678	Something like that.
962698	964579	Slash just comes out and everybody rocks out.
965439	966239	Like a big party.
968320	969840	It was pretty retarded.
970420	970600	Right.
971481	973942	My FU of the week goes to whoever stole our garbage can.
973962	976623	There's no fucking garbage can now, thanks to the storm.
976683	979324	I don't know if God stole it, Mother Nature, or one of the neighbors.
979824	980384	I don't know.
980644	982265	We are missing a fucking garbage can.
982645	984725	And it's freaky, because, like, where are we going to put the trash?
985526	986006	Call them up.
986506	987406	That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.
988026	988687	This is scary.
989067	989867	It's a scary notion.
990427	991448	I still give an FU to that.
991868	996089	By the way, Robert M. would like to point out the irony in our chat room.
996589	998990	The Dark Sakura gave the finger to her finger.
1001118	1001559	www.DarkSakura.com
1015064	1017786	TigerClaw says, Sky, perhaps it was stolen by a bum?
1018046	1019347	You know, that's the scary thing.
1019668	1024131	Like, maybe it was stolen by a bum, but seriously, why does a bum need a fucking trash can?
1024711	1029995	And seriously, why would he hike this far into this, like, development here to steal a trash can?
1030015	1031476	And why not steal the recycle bin?
1031496	1031957	It's bigger.
1032397	1033498	My guess is it blew away.
1033758	1038041	It blew away in the storm, and someone said, hey, free trash can!
1038382	1042004	Well, what day, was it the day when he had all the trash cans out the curb?
1042685	1043525	No, it wasn't the same day.
1043565	1044286	We brought them back up.
1045109	1047010	Oh, well that's weird.
1047331	1048291	Yeah, it is very weird.
1048551	1049312	No, we have no idea.
1049572	1050913	It's just the weirdest thing ever.
1051313	1053375	That's why you store your trash cans behind the fence.
1054335	1058298	Well, yeah, we'll be doing that from now on, but still, kind of weird, nonetheless.
1060669	1061390	Yeah, and I don't understand.
1061450	1064312	If a bum took it because they wanted to, I don't know, live in it or whatever.
1064332	1065753	Why would you live in a trash can?
1067074	1069116	Did Oscar the Grouch steal my can?
1069436	1070957	Did Oscar the Grouch need a new home?
1071317	1074219	Why did he not take the... There's three cans.
1074239	1077442	There's a recycle, there's a lawn, and a garbage.
1077502	1078903	The garbage one is the smallest.
1078923	1081005	Because he lives in a garbage can.
1082786	1084087	Well, fuck you, Oscar the Grouch.
1087550	1087810	Anyhow.
1090379	1090719	ACTION GENRAS
1117402	1122784	It's actually announced in Game for Windows Magazine, so this is something for PC gamers.
1123704	1128525	It's being created by Chris Taylor, or I guess he's spearheading it or what have you.
1129065	1136868	And apparently it's supposed to be inspired in part by Warcraft 3's modification, Defense of the Ancients.
1138268	1143330	From the screenshots, it looked almost like an RTS version of Shadow of the Colossus.
1143910	1144470	Interesting.
1146701	1149722	Well, they have like these Titan things that look like, you know.
1149902	1156563	I always like hearing about these games that combine these very interesting types of genres, like RPGs and action.
1156603	1157723	That's going to be kind of interesting.
1158083	1160264	Well, almost every game's an action game.
1160664	1163765	I mean, it kind of makes me think of Kingdom Hearts as like RPG mixed with action, right?
1164285	1166245	So I'm just kind of interested to see what this is.
1166285	1168225	Yeah, just think more of an RTS game.
1168305	1169746	That's what it basically looked like.
1169946	1171126	RTS game, I guess, where you're,
1172961	1179966	All right, well, no release date announced yet.
1180026	1182948	All we know is that Demigod is coming soon.
1183929	1186110	Of course, the almighty soon, right?
1187231	1190894	Well, Rockstar is going to be...
1191798	1192558	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1221625	1223806	And what is it, like the original Grand Theft Auto?
1223926	1227187	No, they're Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.
1228047	1228487	I'll take it.
1229108	1233849	The first Grand Theft Auto game, and the second I believe, are available free on their website.
1234510	1236610	Oh, that's right, they did that some time ago, I forgot about that.
1237010	1241712	So, you know, if you want to play those, because I remember the original Grand Theft Auto, that game was fun.
1243633	1244813	Nothing like what it is today.
1245293	1246174	No, not at all.
1246474	1247474	Very, very different.
1248617	1267255	Um, anyways, uh, let's see here, Just Cause 2 was announced, released some details about it, uh, they're gonna be, I don't know, getting rid of some of the side quests, I guess, in the game, to kind of simplify it a little bit more, make it more, um, I don't know, straightforward.
1268215	1273899	Now they're saying that they've identified the key areas that they want to improve for Just Cause 2.
1274559	1280783	They just want to make better use of the huge game world, enhance the stunts, improve the combat, and reward exploration.
1280883	1284425	Which I don't understand how you can reward exploration but get rid of some of the side quests.
1285185	1287887	That's kind of counterintuitive.
1289229	1311412	but apparently the game is not going to be set on the island of San Espirito anymore it's going to be a tropical paradise in Southeast Asia but it will still have Rico Rodriguez as the lead character I don't know, I didn't really play Just Cause I played the demo a lot, that was fun
1312708	1318431	And I know that game had a few glitches where you can fly a plane underwater, but, you know, other than that, it looked pretty cool.
1318611	1321913	It sold pretty good for a first, you know, a new IP, right?
1322394	1323895	Yeah, it might be one I might pick up.
1325716	1328317	I actually might pick up the original, because I think it's dirt cheap right about now.
1328337	1329118	I think it is dirt cheap.
1329138	1330619	I think I saw it in a bargain bin the other day.
1331279	1331399	Hmm.
1331940	1342651	Well, this isn't coming to a bargain bin anytime soon because the latest and greatest piece of technology for you PC gamers is a brand new video card, NVIDIA's GeForce 9800GX2.
1343351	1347856	A blog called HardOCP has gotten a peek at the new card.
1348236	1353882	This card is coming out in late February, early March-ish, and it's basically going to replace NVIDIA's
1354609	1355170	and DarkSakura.
1376892	1377853	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1400436	1410860	are nowhere near what Nvidia's are, and because of that, Nvidia doesn't really have any competition, so they keep re-releasing their old cards with slightly better processors and that kind of stuff.
1411240	1416962	So this, essentially, is just two graphics cards shoved on the one card, is what it basically is.
1417002	1428486	It's like your Core 2, or the quads that they have, the Intel chips, they're not really a quad-core processor, it's just two Core 2 Duos on one processor.
1429042	1430122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1448607	1448827	DarkSakura
1477284	1479265	Did you hear that I've got one that's 13 inches?
1481887	1483208	I paid good money for it, too.
1484089	1484970	I'm sure you did.
1485490	1486551	Here's what I want to know, Loki.
1486851	1487992	Will it make WoW run better?
1490434	1492795	Dude, WoW will run on pretty much anything.
1493156	1494757	It really will, but it's kind of choppy.
1495257	1498059	Will it make freaking Tabula Rasa run better?
1498119	1501862	Because I tried playing a demo of that, and it did not run very well on my computer.
1502122	1502682	Probably.
1502923	1504764	Which is strange, because it's not like my computer is that old.
1505906	1507207	Game's a memory hog.
1509908	1511148	How about we do something else, Rob?
1511248	1512589	How about we do some emails?
1512649	1518191	We are going to get to the mailbag, but something you kids should be thinking about, because it's coming up very soon, not too far after the mailbag.
1518751	1524113	We're going to bring back a game we haven't done in a long time tonight on the program, and that is Listless.
1525053	1527814	And we're actually going to be looking for a caller in a little while.
1527875	1530375	Not yet, but we're going to be looking for a caller to play with us.
1530435	1534237	It's Listless, and tonight's topic, so you can start thinking about... Well...
1534755	1535275	Maybe I'll save that.
1535295	1536155	I'll keep that a secret.
1536235	1536635	Save it.
1536976	1539936	But if you call in right now, Rob will tell us who it is and we'll laugh.
1540516	1542057	No, I'm not going to do that right now.
1542757	1543777	Well, I am kind of wondering.
1543877	1550899	I should get someone to participate in Listless with us so I can tell them the topics so they can start thinking of their list because we don't want to have to come up with it on the spot.
1551159	1551819	So I'm going to say this.
1551879	1555560	If you want to participate in Listless tonight and you're available on Skype.
1555800	1558481	How about a trivia question to answer by private message?
1558781	1559681	Okay, I like that.
1559701	1561382	A trivia question to answer by private message.
1562242	1562502	All right.
1563123	1563483	Okay.
1563603	1564444	Well, you gotta do mails.
1564564	1565405	They should probably send it to me.
1565825	1566665	Okay, send it to Rob.
1566806	1567406	Alright, send it to me.
1567426	1567946	We'll work for Rob.
1567986	1569247	What's the trivia question?
1569347	1569988	Anything I want?
1571429	1574511	How about... I hope you pick something I know the answer to.
1575672	1577853	Oh, well, if you don't know the answer to, I'll tell you anyway.
1578093	1578333	Okay.
1579434	1580735	Okay.
1581375	1582056	Don't make it too hard.
1582096	1582636	We want somebody to play.
1582656	1582916	It'll be easy.
1582937	1583737	What's my favorite color?
1584578	1586019	What's DarkSakura's favorite color?
1586119	1586359	Yeah.
1586619	1586839	Alright.
1587299	1592283	Alright, send me a private message with what you think DarkSakura's favorite color is.
1592990	1595991	and the first person to get it will play listless with us tonight.
1596591	1597091	That'd be fun.
1597291	1598992	And I'll tell them the topics they can think of their list.
1599012	1600912	All right, so send a private message to Skye.
1600973	1604474	Meanwhile, DarkSakura's going to open up the old mailbag and get to work.
1604874	1605694	There's just four.
1607655	1610655	Well, a fifth one was a thank you.
1611656	1612456	So, Rob, thank you.
1613076	1613616	Oh, you're welcome.
1613796	1614277	What did I do?
1616057	1616517	Oh, okay.
1617358	1617838	Oh, you're welcome.
1618498	1620518	The first one comes from...
1622492	1627794	I'm just going to say Ryan, who put his full name on here, and I don't read out everybody's full names.
1628554	1634396	So it says, Hey guys, I was wondering if the Operator 11 feeds on OLR can be downloaded to a computer or a PSP.
1634917	1635977	Rock on, Dragon Force.
1638178	1639038	Um, not right now.
1640579	1645160	Um, as we have... Sorry.
1646861	1647261	Never mind.
1648364	1652750	As we've stated earlier, Operator 11 is having mental retardation.
1653290	1658817	I'm sorry, technical difficulties, so we're not going to say much more about them, right?
1660619	1664023	So moving forward, the next email comes from Martin.
1665445	1665725	Martin?
1666479	1667480	Hello, OLR Crew.
1667540	1673626	I just want to ask your opinion about a gaming cliché that I think is really, really outdated.
1673746	1682254	I constantly hear many game reviewers and game podcasters talk about how kids are always trying to explain game systems and gaming to parents buying the current-gen systems.
1682874	1690141	I think that it really must be pointed out that these supposed naive parents grew up with gaming in their lives, starting with the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES,
1692483	1695244	and many kept gaming since they started, myself including.
1695664	1706608	Growing up in the 80s, yes, it was sometimes a challenge to teach a parent about what a gaming system could do and their relevance, but gaming has been well established in almost every living room since the 1980s.
1707188	1711750	I really think that this need to explain to a parent about what a PlayStation or Nintendo Wii is
1712370	1714812	is really outdated and just plain foolish to think.
1714932	1721137	A good portion of all of us oldsters have and continue to game and in some cases know more than their kids about gaming.
1721697	1723459	Don't buy into the hype.
1723919	1729743	The only parents that do not know what video games are will never get it because they choose not to know about it.
1730464	1735568	Martin and all your friends at bunchofdorks.com Nice name for a website, by the way.
1735748	1736549	That's fantastic.
1739471	1741112	Do you have anything to say about that?
1742150	1744691	I'm sorry, I was monitoring the trivia question.
1745491	1746151	Summarize for me.
1746931	1759435	Well, basically saying that, you know, since there have been video games for as long as many of the people out there have, I guess, grown up and are now parents themselves.
1760475	1766137	So there shouldn't be any excuse for a parent not to be aware of what a system is or what it does.
1766917	1769138	But I also do think that
1772186	1800671	and I actually do agree that they don't know what it is because they choose not to know about it but I think that it's not really the system so much themselves as the content that they need to be informed about because when we were little you know games didn't look that major you know what I mean we you know true we had Metal Gear and we had Splatterhouse and but they still it was all cartoony looking you know and now it's so realistic that I think that
1801554	1804596	There does need to be a degree of caution on the part of the parents.
1806137	1810481	So in that case, I can see how they might be naive or misinformed or uninformed.
1811842	1815904	But I don't think it's the system so much that people really need a lot of education on.
1818827	1819347	What do you think?
1821709	1824070	Sorry, we finally got a winner of our stupid trivia thing.
1824150	1825251	I could not guess.
1826672	1827733	Oh my God, it took forever.
1828153	1828674	Oh my God.
1829354	1830275	I don't think I've made any
1830896	1831576	Secret about it.
1832557	1833678	So, next email.
1833838	1834638	Oh, it's to me.
1836259	1837740	Wait, which person sent in that last email?
1838301	1841202	Oh, that was... I closed it.
1841362	1845185	That was Martin from a bunch of dorks dot com.
1845645	1846145	Let me see.
1846766	1847146	I remember.
1847206	1848587	I read this email earlier in the week.
1848667	1848927	Sorry.
1849807	1852349	I swear I was paying attention to the chat room.
1852929	1853530	But anyhow, no.
1854050	1855131	You know what's funny about this?
1855271	1859773	When I was reading this, I kind of thought to myself, I was like, okay, as far as the Atari 2600 generation goes,
1861423	1862963	Not everybody had that.
1863064	1864584	That's the thing.
1864684	1866765	Some of us were lucky enough to experience that.
1866805	1871326	But even, I think, Atari 2600, not everybody in our generation necessarily experienced.
1872006	1875807	It was still kind of something that only certain kids on the block had.
1875847	1880609	And in some parts of the country, you weren't as able to find these as easily.
1880649	1882269	It was still kind of a luxury item.
1882309	1882929	Let's put it that way.
1882969	1885090	As video games are in general today.
1885410	1887331	But even when I say luxury item, you know...
1889451	1890252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1908513	1916400	places in your generation where you were able to have this luxury item, where I think a lot of parents, or people that are now parents, weren't exposed to this when they were young.
1917241	1927429	Nevertheless, even if they were, they remember video games as being Pac-Man, Combat, and not Grand Theft Auto or Manhunt.
1928470	1929551	It was much different back then.
1929611	1931393	I think that the case with a lot of them is that
1931986	1948412	Not everyone has been, you know, the hardcore gamer type that, you know, like me and my husband and our person who emailed us or any of us in this room that, you know, once we, you know, grew up and started working, you know, oh, well, that's child stuff.
1948432	1949173	We put it away.
1949233	1950033	We don't do it anymore.
1950093	1951834	Well, we are more enlightened.
1953314	1957096	And it's as, you know, fine as a recreation item as any.
1957136	1958256	And we understand that.
1958946	1965591	But there's always been, I think, when they were growing up with that type of thing, oh, well, you're still doing that?
1966192	1973617	My mom still says that to me, and I'm like, okay, you sat and played my Nintendo as much as I did when I had it, so what's your excuse?
1974038	1974939	And now she wants a Wii.
1977741	1978001	Nice.
1978281	1979122	My mom wants a Wii.
1979162	1980042	I think that's cute.
1981063	1985727	But at any rate, that's where I think the difference comes in.
1987858	1988999	I think that it's right.
1989019	1991540	Those who don't know, it's because they choose not to know.
1992160	1993581	They haven't educated themselves.
1994001	1995542	So they're all surprised, too.
1997083	1998003	And they don't have a right to be.
2000585	2001225	We can move on now.
2001265	2001485	Sorry.
2001525	2003706	Sorry I was not paying attention fully the first time.
2004046	2005727	Oh, this makes me feel slightly better.
2006568	2007388	J-Rod emailed.
2008268	2011390	The one who has a really cool quote about Olive Garden.
2013343	2019605	Hey, DarkSakura, I know this isn't exactly a gaming question, but you said you get a sinus infection every single year for New Year's Eve.
2019865	2026908	Yes, I'm in the same boat as you, except whenever I have something like a concert to go to, I'll get a sinus infection without question.
2027548	2030989	Someone could ask me to go see a concert tomorrow and I'll develop a sinus infection overnight.
2031109	2031609	Woe is us.
2033090	2036131	Yeah, well, for me, I always get...
2037858	2039198	Dude, the Olive Garden is the shit.
2039218	2040419	Don't forget never-ending breadsticks.
2040439	2041820	We should just go for salad one day.
2061880	2066265	Let's go to, you know, because you want to come over for movie night because I have to show you Stardust because I love that movie so much.
2066525	2067666	Let's do Olive Garden that night.
2068327	2069428	If I'm not completely broke.
2070689	2072371	We'll do dinner at the Olive Garden.
2072631	2072971	Okay.
2073092	2073652	Yeehaw!
2074573	2076675	Last email.
2076715	2079138	If you can't pay, it'll be my treat because I want never-ending breadsticks.
2079278	2079879	Okay.
2079919	2080900	And I'll get you after my payday.
2081060	2081280	Sweet.
2081801	2082581	We'll go to Indian again.
2083462	2083682	Yes.
2084402	2086703	You know, the whole time I was sick, all I wanted was Indian food.
2087024	2087904	You know what, Ross Steele?
2088404	2090425	Dammit, I need to have it out with him for a minute here.
2090485	2090605	Okay.
2090685	2097349	Okay, Ross Steele, goddammit, you criticize Loki and his, you know, ways, which I, you know, to some extent I agree with you.
2097409	2097609	Fine.
2097829	2099330	You criticize me playing WoW.
2099670	2102171	Maybe I do play too much WoW.
2102351	2106293	But I draw the line at you criticizing our love of the Olive Garden.
2107096	2108617	Dude, Olive Garden is great.
2108737	2112318	The Olive Garden is wonderful, and damn you for thinking otherwise.
2112338	2116740	Although, although, although, one of these days I'm going to have to take you to Pasquale's.
2118121	2119782	They're closed on Monday, but they're open on Tuesday.
2121202	2123483	I hope you get smited with Zuppa Toscana.
2125244	2129226	He should get sangria'd in the eye.
2130446	2131026	Exactly.
2131367	2132147	That would be great.
2133192	2135754	May a deep fried ravioli fall from heaven onto your head.
2135774	2136295	That sounds good too.
2136335	2136976	I love those.
2137416	2142600	Anyway, this email is titled Yaris made better by Dragon Force.
2143541	2147645	Hey OLR, I made this video on YouTube and got the inspiration from you guys and girl.
2148265	2151748	I think you should actually start that segment.
2152048	2154911	There are a lot of crappy games out there and someone needs to make them watchable.
2155307	2159690	Anyway, I think you guys are great and I will keep saying that because you are and keep going strong.
2159850	2170137	To get the video, search for PKJR92 and I'm saying it out loud so that they know what to look up on YouTube or Yaris or Dragon Force or even OLR.
2170637	2172579	Sincerely, PKJR92.
2173759	2174200	Sure, why not?
2174300	2174580	Okay.
2175220	2177402	Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.
2178183	2178823	is the quote on there.
2178983	2180084	I've heard that quote before.
2180624	2188346	And by the way, I did watch the video, and basically he took the trailer for Yaris, the 30-second trailer for Yaris, and put Dragon Force's music behind it, and it's surprisingly effective.
2189126	2189707	We do approve.
2190227	2194148	And I will find the link to that YouTube and post it in chat for you all to look at right now.
2195348	2197269	Well, not right right now, but, you know.
2198009	2198289	You know what?
2198309	2199250	We got one last email in.
2199270	2201090	I can hear Loki watching it right now.
2201370	2201950	What do you think?
2202391	2203411	Doesn't it make the game better?
2203431	2204551	We got one last email in.
2204671	2205692	It would be a lot better with it.
2205712	2206572	From Sakura Maxx.
2207628	2210409	Hey, OLR, just mailing to say Happy New Year.
2210529	2214851	I was running a little late since I didn't have computer access while the New Year special was running.
2215272	2218113	This is from Sakuramax, the one who hasn't annoyed you people in a while.
2218153	2218713	You happy?
2219254	2223075	And a person with MassGamerADD, what to play next.
2225196	2226117	So, there we have it.
2230259	2231720	No more emails?
2231740	2231900	Nope.
2231940	2233000	Oops, sorry, I haven't watched the video.
2234966	2237247	No, I was just going to add a little thing that says I approve.
2237547	2241589	But anyway, see, now everybody in the chat room is like, you need to go have real Italian food.
2242430	2243390	I have had real Italian food.
2243410	2245291	I actually went to a little place in Sacramento.
2245311	2248433	I don't even know if you guys have heard of this, but I always thought I got a kick out of this.
2248513	2254296	It's called Español, which means Spain, but it has really good Italian food.
2254396	2256497	So there's real Italian places all over.
2256577	2261279	I bet there are really, really good places in New York, though, and that's where they're offering to take me.
2261339	2263540	So I'm not going to say no, especially if you're buying.
2264221	2264661	So anyhow.
2266285	2270708	If you want to send emails, maybe profess your love for the Olive Garden here on this program.
2270748	2272649	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2272909	2275351	You know, if we're not the weather podcast, we're the food podcast.
2275411	2275951	I swear to God.
2276371	2277232	Anything but games.
2277272	2278372	That should be our new tagline.
2279353	2280374	Anything but games.
2280454	2281794	We're tired of games.
2281834	2282195	That's right.
2282215	2283716	We've been doing games for like six years.
2283776	2285136	It's time for something new, don't you think?
2286898	2287118	All right.
2287498	2290840	We have a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into tonight's listless.
2291580	2292561	Loki, I'll let you go first.
2293341	2293581	Yes.
2294102	2294382	Anyways.
2295741	2296121	Let's see.
2296901	2306107	So, if you've been playing Team Fortress 2, you may have been noticing that there are some achievements missing for one of the classes you can play, and that would be the Medic.
2306627	2317214	Well, that's going to be fixed, hopefully pretty soon, because a German site was listing some brand new achievements, 36 new ones, actually, for the Medic.
2317654	2318655	So, that's kind of neat.
2319598	2327401	Some of the other ones here, they had Heal Under Fire, which is healing somebody while on fire.
2328921	2341045	Let's see here, they have one for healing an engineer, healing teammates who've called for a medic, Ubering a friend, and they have some other fun stuff like...
2341829	2348573	Bone Saw Spy Caller, or I'm assuming that's Killer, killing an enemy spy with a bone saw.
2348773	2353096	Loki, I'm going to interrupt this story to show you the fly swimming for his life in my coffee right now.
2354517	2358380	That fly is going to be totally hyped up on caffeine.
2358580	2360281	The more he swims, the more hyper he gets.
2360741	2363283	But goddammit, that just ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee.
2363983	2364844	Go flies!
2365304	2365724	Asshole.
2366184	2366825	Asshole fly.
2369912	2376236	So yeah, hopefully we'll see some of those soon, maybe in an update or something.
2376636	2380158	Even the chatroom is like, Rob's derailing the show tonight.
2380278	2380558	I am.
2381298	2382399	I do want to say this, though.
2382959	2389923	The native Spanish speakers in chatroom are yelling at me and screaming at me, and I should know better, but I only had two years of high school Spanish.
2390543	2392244	España is Spain.
2392724	2394305	Español is a Spaniard.
2395005	2395586	Or Spanish.
2396866	2398327	I don't know any Spanish.
2398829	2399549	And I knew that.
2400310	2400890	Well, sorry.
2400930	2401210	I know.
2401570	2403050	Donde Esta El Bano.
2403091	2403811	That's what I remember.
2405031	2410353	Somebody on Ragnarok last night was spamming with Donde Esta La Biblioteca.
2411914	2413394	Ew, they're telling me to drink the coffee.
2413434	2414434	That's fucking gross.
2414574	2415755	What the hell is wrong with you people?
2416975	2418396	Just say that you are.
2418616	2418716	Yeah.
2418736	2419676	You don't have a camera.
2419696	2421537	Mmm, I'm drinking it right now.
2421557	2421617	Mmm.
2422430	2423510	Oh, that's so gross!
2423571	2425551	Oh my god, why are you doing that?
2425611	2427192	I feel that fly in my throat.
2427252	2428052	It's so weird.
2428192	2430493	Oh my god, he's turning into a fly now.
2430553	2431894	That's so crazy.
2438556	2440437	So this is how we're starting off 2008, huh?
2440797	2442758	Dear everybody, Rob is crazy.
2443018	2443478	The end.
2444818	2446999	We can get away with much more when Op 11 isn't running.
2447299	2448660	Maybe we'll never have a webcam again.
2448860	2451561	I can get away with a lot of stuff over here because the camera's never on me.
2452156	2453757	Well, one week I'm going to just surprise you.
2454718	2455739	And it'll be Jamie Cam.
2456040	2457861	No way.
2458041	2462946	I'll put that camera up there and put another camera hidden somewhere that's actually the real camera.
2464767	2466128	Oh, it's elaborate.
2466168	2466829	Candid camera.
2467009	2469271	I'll make that the day I throw up on you.
2471133	2476798	You know, a lot of folks have been saying this week with all the Xbox Live downtime, I'm just going to go play PlayStation Network.
2477138	2478139	Sony's network is free.
2478319	2479240	I'm just going to go play that.
2479833	2488496	Well, Sony has been polling customers in some of their Asian regions on ways that they can improve the PC and PSP PlayStation Store.
2488916	2490317	One of the things that they're polling about?
2490977	2492817	A monthly subscription plan.
2493438	2494458	Hmm.
2494658	2499620	So, possibly is Sony looking into charging a monthly fee for the PlayStation Network?
2499740	2500180	But, no.
2500839	2501399	Possibly.
2501980	2502840	All right, Loki, go ahead.
2502880	2504981	You're wanting to jump at the bit here to say it.
2505021	2505222	What?
2505282	2505622	Sorry.
2506262	2511225	They're possibly going to be offering a monthly subscription for unlimited download content.
2511425	2511865	That's right.
2512326	2514847	Game tap for your PSP, basically, but with Sony's games.
2515267	2515968	I like that idea.
2515988	2517448	That actually isn't a bad idea at all.
2518449	2519990	I would hand it to Sony if that's the case.
2520870	2529115	Of course, the trump on that, I guess, is that there isn't really a whole lot of download content on the PlayStation Network.
2531286	2539175	It'd be a definite way, though, to ensure income from the service on a regular basis.
2539255	2542458	I'd pay for that for a month, download everything, and then that's it.
2542799	2543820	Just wait a few months.
2543840	2544941	What if it's contractual?
2547343	2549446	I don't think services like that are usually contractual, are they?
2549666	2550507	Some are.
2550547	2552649	Well, like GameTap is, and it's month to month.
2553150	2553350	All right.
2554929	2559270	Alright, well anyhow, I think it's about time for us to have a list list.
2559310	2560011	What do you guys think?
2560051	2560991	Is it list list time?
2561631	2561951	Sure.
2565712	2571654	Alright, list list is the game where we're going to create the definitive list for something.
2571674	2576376	You know, lists are big, especially around this time of year as one year has ended and another begins.
2576436	2578236	Lists are big, so we're going to make our own list tonight.
2578296	2583498	I know we have a lot of new listeners since the last time we've done this because we used to do this game a lot and we probably haven't played it in like four months.
2583988	2590191	So the way listless works is that we're going to have four panelists, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and our mystery caller.
2590832	2595854	And each of us are going to give you our top three things that will match the list.
2596335	2597655	And then here's the twist.
2598075	2600897	Each one of us takes one thing off the list.
2601277	2603178	So you have 12 that gets taken down to eight.
2603538	2606800	And so once we're down to eight, then the chat room votes on the top three things.
2607441	2609902	And that will bring us the definitive list.
2609962	2615145	And tonight's topic for the list, if you'd like to start posting your suggestions in chat, here it is.
2615985	2619847	Gadget I'd like to see them announce at Consumer Electronics Show.
2620648	2623889	Doesn't have to be gaming related, just any type of tech gadget.
2624129	2627791	So the gadget you would like to see them announce at the Consumer Electronics Show.
2627871	2630032	It can be real, it can be crazy, anything you want.
2630773	2632274	But that's it right here, tonight's list list.
2632654	2636876	So let us call the person who correctly guessed...
2639013	2640514	DarkSakura's favorite color.
2641274	2643895	If I can find them in the list, I suddenly can't find them.
2647517	2648478	Live radio, folks.
2656842	2659063	I'm making them call us.
2660323	2661984	Tell us a little bit about your favorite color.
2662224	2664505	My favorite color is very, very dark.
2665366	2666546	Very, very dark.
2667707	2668127	It's, um...
2672021	2673181	DarkSakura's favorite color was black.
2700166	2706029	I don't check out the keynotes or anything, but I like to watch what they got showing.
2706069	2708631	What do you think about what I said earlier in the show?
2708711	2712293	Is it true that most game nerds are somewhat of tech nerds too?
2712393	2713814	They like to see the latest tech stuff?
2715375	2718337	I think you kind of have to be, to tell you the truth.
2719457	2722059	Especially with the whole next gen that's going on now.
2723956	2728338	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2754200	2758321	My number three pick is the Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0.
2761541	2763342	And why a Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0?
2764762	2768283	Because, you know, it would come out just in time for Rez HD.
2769283	2769843	That's a good point.
2770063	2771523	Rez HD is just around the corner.
2771563	2772163	That's a good idea.
2772763	2773524	Who wants to go next?
2773544	2774464	I can go.
2774564	2776424	DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?
2776584	2781325	My number three pick is a remote-directed EMP gun for jamming other people's cell phones.
2784834	2787737	And why, pray tell, do you need an EMP gun to jam people's cell phones?
2787837	2800848	For people driving like fucking retards on the road while talking with their phone glued to their face, or people in front of me in line at the grocery store too busy talking on their phone to pay attention to what the hell they're doing.
2801509	2803791	Those people need to either die in a fire or hang up the phone.
2804611	2805012	Or both.
2805813	2806173	Preferably.
2806193	2806553	I'd buy it.
2807074	2808475	Alright, that's actually a good idea.
2809401	2810742	All right, I'll go next.
2810802	2811782	My number three pick.
2811822	2812983	Now, I don't know if you've ever seen these.
2813023	2818185	Have you ever seen those guns at, like, Target or things that shoot the big blast of air at people?
2818425	2819465	Yeah, the air cannons.
2819485	2819985	Air zookas.
2820065	2821446	Air zookas.
2821506	2822166	Air zookas.
2822226	2830549	Okay, air zookas are so awesome, but I want them to introduce, like, an air zooka that will actually blow somebody over because it has so much power in it.
2831090	2834291	So I'm going to just call it the supreme air zooka.
2838374	2842958	I don't know how electronic that gadget is, but I would imagine you'd need a little battery power to make that thing work.
2843758	2845159	All right, Loki, your number three pick.
2845640	2849863	My number three pick would be kind of a sequel to the AIBO.
2850183	2855247	It's the AIPER, and it would be a robotic cat.
2855567	2856388	They already have those.
2856928	2863573	Well, I want one from Sony because I need my cat to be able to spy on my other cat so I can see what's going on.
2864614	2865935	Sony does have an AIBO cat.
2866693	2868394	They have a gray one and a white one and a black one.
2868494	2869774	He can put anything he wants on the list.
2870074	2871335	You take it off if you don't like it.
2871775	2872035	All right.
2872916	2873216	Fine.
2873876	2874596	I sloth?
2874676	2876837	I mean, yeah.
2876997	2877537	I ferret.
2878058	2878478	I ferret.
2878498	2878798	That'd be cool.
2878838	2879558	All right, I ferret.
2879838	2880198	I ferret.
2880358	2881099	I go with I ferret.
2881119	2882439	You're going to change it to I ferret.
2882499	2882960	I ferret.
2883840	2885160	So AI ferret.
2886701	2887001	All right.
2888062	2889222	We're back to you, SSJ100.
2889442	2890723	Matt, what is your number two pick?
2892183	2893824	My number two pick is...
2894922	2897164	An Apple handheld gaming system.
2898825	2901747	As is the device of many fanboys' dreams.
2901928	2902908	Are you an Apple fanboy?
2904389	2904810	Not really.
2905090	2905430	Oh, okay.
2905690	2909953	Well, why then, especially from non-fanboys, should Apple announce a handheld gaming system?
2911254	2911675	Well, you know what?
2911775	2915898	I think there should be another handheld gaming system in general that's not the N-Gage.
2917619	2919701	As RawSteelUT says, the Pippin Boy?
2920741	2921382	Is that what it would be?
2921982	2924064	All right, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?
2924864	2926205	A streaming TV for iPhone.
2929407	2931909	Like the YouTube channel, but like actual episodes.
2931929	2933751	I was gonna say, YouTube's not good enough for you, huh?
2934051	2938154	Well, because you can't really find full episodes of stuff on YouTube, and it's like a limited YouTube.
2938934	2941496	So they need to have like a show service.
2941536	2945940	Like for me, because I don't like to sit in front of the TV because that's just boring to me.
2945960	2948221	You know, I have to have other stuff going on.
2948802	2950403	So having it on my iPhone...
2950953	2956757	and I could, you know, watch for a little bit and then go do other crap and then come back and finish watching it when I'm done would be perfect for me.
2958277	2963601	Alright, I'm actually going to take my number two pick from the chat room because this is a darn good pick and we can be as silly as we want, right?
2964281	2972746	So I'm going to suggest that a portal gun be unveiled as CES so I can have my very own portal gun because seriously, who couldn't use a portal gun?
2974027	2975188	I could use one all the time.
2975208	2977749	Alright, so portal gun, there you go.
2978350	2980631	Loki, what would be the number two pick for you?
2981418	2984140	Uh, my number two pick also happens to come from Portal.
2984240	2986921	I would like the Aperture Science Sentry Bot.
2987282	2991044	You know, the ones that say, hello, and then turn the chute at you.
2991624	2992885	They're perfect for the neighbors.
2993365	2997548	Oh, those things are such assholes, but okay, yeah, those would be good guard dogs.
2998588	3002911	I'm surprised no one said a companion queue, but I guess we haven't gotten to the number ones yet, so let's see.
3003811	3007614	SSJ100Matt, what is the number one thing you would like to see them debut at CES?
3007674	3008154	New Gadget.
3009116	3012698	My number one pick is the Dreamcast 2.
3016000	3017161	Sega fanboy, eh?
3018842	3022284	You know what, I just want to see another Sega system.
3023205	3028028	I'm not really a fanboy, I just think, you know... Don't you think, though, it's about time to let go?
3030484	3030785	No.
3031505	3032186	Alright, fine.
3032667	3037774	Alright, DarkSakura, what would be your number one thing you would like to see them announce at CES?
3038334	3039636	Portable Xbox Live Arcade.
3040217	3042019	Portable Xbox Live Arcade.
3042239	3043000	Not a bad choice.
3043641	3044763	What made you decide to go with that?
3045259	3046079	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
3074642	3075583	We were playing that the other night too.
3097605	3099126	Because seriously, holodecks are awesome.
3099146	3101709	All right, Loki, what would be your number one pick?
3101749	3103310	Gadget, you'd like to see them unveil at CES.
3103330	3106853	My number one pick has already been said, which was a portal gun.
3107494	3107774	Whoops.
3108114	3111637	That's all right, because I didn't really have anything that I thought of.
3112178	3113459	But this would be kind of cool.
3114660	3124889	I know it's not practical in any sense whatsoever, but we haven't seen anything come from George Foreman in a while, so I want a George Foreman grill that I can cook an entire cow on.
3125738	3126658	at one time.
3134362	3135282	That would be great.
3135522	3140144	And it needs to clean the cow's guts out for you and everything.
3140164	3140624	Self-cleaning.
3141044	3144626	What, pray tell, would the George Foreman entire cow grill be called?
3145286	3147507	It would be George Foreman's self-cleaning cow grill.
3157169	3157949	I don't know what to say.
3158029	3162191	This is going to be very hard because this is a very good list of items that we've built tonight.
3162211	3165192	Black Lab says the mean lean fat reducing cow machine.
3165212	3166253	I like that.
3167133	3169314	It would certainly reduce the size of those cows.
3170394	3170774	Wow.
3173895	3174696	We said anything.
3175436	3179838	Very few of these items are actually gaming related, I'd like to point out, but it fits the theme of our podcast tonight.
3180178	3183659	All right, SJ100 Matt, I posted the list there in private message for your reference.
3183959	3186040	Let me go ahead and read it as it stands now.
3186954	3193736	I'm going to kill the music because this is the serious round because we have 12 items on the list but four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.
3193796	3214102	We have Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0, Remote EMP Gun for jamming people's cell phones, Supreme Air Zooka, iFerret, Apple Handheld Gaming System, Streaming TV for iPhone, Portal Gun, Aperture Science Sentry Bot, Dreamcast 2, Portable Xbox Live Arcade, Holodeck, and George Foreman Self-Cleaning Cow Grill.
3214822	3216743	But four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.
3217861	3219702	SJ100, Matt, what is not worthy of the list?
3221302	3223283	I'm going to go with the Airzooka.
3224143	3225403	You're a bastard, but that's all right.
3226223	3227664	I guess it's not that electronic, is it?
3227744	3228144	Let me see.
3228184	3230945	All right, Supreme Airzooka is not worthy of the list.
3231005	3232605	Yeah, but it isn't really an electronic.
3233105	3235986	Although I guess you would need electronics in order to build an Agraver person.
3236106	3237346	But how awesome would that be?
3237446	3238287	Come on, seriously.
3238787	3242348	All right, DarkSakura, which of these things is not worthy of the list?
3243448	3243548	Um...
3246311	3249313	I'm going to say the Apple handheld gaming system.
3250194	3255498	I was expecting Loki to do that.
3255538	3256358	I was going to.
3259360	3261342	Just because I think that Microsoft would do it better.
3262082	3262903	Oh, snap.
3263383	3266565	But there's also the iPhone, which in a way they'll probably turn into a gaming system.
3266585	3268807	And you know there's going to be stuff coming out on that eventually.
3269748	3271589	I love my iPhone, don't get me wrong.
3272384	3280613	But I think that when we have a company that's already established for having quality games out now, I think that's only inevitable.
3280633	3281314	All right.
3281374	3282956	Well, I've got to get rid of this.
3283276	3284257	I'm so sorry, SSJ100.
3284517	3288041	Matt, we're picking on you tonight, but Dreamcast 2 is not worthy of the list.
3289322	3289723	Because...
3290746	3291787	It's not going to happen, kids.
3293769	3295832	None of the things I listed were never going to happen.
3296432	3302459	A holodeck has a better chance of happening at a future consumer electronics show or Loki's fucking cow grill.
3303659	3303719	S.S.J.
3303759	3303979	100's list.
3330413	3331914	Your Airsuka got taken off?
3332235	3336238	No, I know, but the other three, we eliminated SSJ's entire list.
3336738	3337379	Oh, I forgot.
3337399	3337999	Okay, okay.
3338660	3339160	No, sorry.
3339480	3340761	That's the way the cookie crumbles.
3342143	3343744	SSJ100, Matt, I'm very sorry.
3344605	3346406	Apparently your choices just weren't worthy tonight.
3347187	3347487	Yeah.
3347827	3348227	I'm sorry.
3348688	3349549	Are you going to cry about it?
3349569	3351310	No, I'm going to go cut myself.
3351530	3351830	All right.
3351890	3354853	Well, I'm sorry that things didn't go your way tonight.
3355093	3359316	But hey, because you don't have any items on the list, we'll still let you vote for the winner.
3359357	3359897	How's that sound?
3361084	3361985	Alright, that sounds good to me.
3362085	3363786	Alright, anything you want to plug before we hang up on you?
3364927	3366329	Um, nope.
3366749	3367670	Alright, have a good one.
3368390	3368971	Yep, you too.
3369451	3371653	Alright, I like it when they don't have anything to plug.
3372594	3373234	Poor guy.
3373635	3375977	He got his whole list eliminated by us three bastards.
3375997	3378159	It doesn't happen, it hasn't happened very often.
3378179	3382042	I can only think of one other time in ListList where somebody's entire list got eliminated.
3382062	3384284	They were mad that I took off the ResTrans by Rear 2.0.
3384324	3384564	Oh, well.
3387031	3389532	How do you improve something that vibrates?
3389792	3390732	I mean, seriously.
3391112	3391992	It's not that complicated.
3392012	3392712	Poor power.
3393292	3393592	All right.
3393952	3394573	Well, here we go.
3394633	3398313	We are left with eight choices that have been deemed worthy of the list.
3398353	3398814	Here they are.
3399194	3402434	The remote EMP gun for jamming people's cell phones.
3402854	3403715	An iFerret.
3404015	3405875	A streaming TV for the iPhone.
3406175	3406995	A portal gun.
3407295	3408936	An Aperture Science Sentry Bot.
3409216	3411056	A portable Xbox Live Arcade.
3411376	3412076	A holodeck.
3412336	3414797	And a George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.
3415237	3420338	Please send in your votes via private message for your number one and number two picks.
3420758	3424619	If you don't label them one and two, I will assume that the first one is your number one pick.
3424659	3426280	Send a private message to Sky in the chat.
3426640	3429420	You have about ten minutes while we go over these next few stories.
3429460	3431441	So place your votes now.
3431921	3434962	Meanwhile, we get back into the gaming news with DarkSakura.
3435662	3439463	We have our dear friend who is the...
3440522	3448484	God of third party peripherals, Mad Catz, making instruments for Rock Band.
3449704	3464167	They have a multi-year licensing agreement with MTV Games to do wired and wireless bass guitars and a percussion set that's got drumsticks and a microphone and stuff.
3465067	3468048	So it looks like we're going to be seeing those come out eventually.
3470263	3471203	This is the first half of 2008.
3473384	3478046	Well, one place you probably won't be able to get a good deal on those would be at Best Buy.
3478726	3483648	And apparently they had a coupon that was in, I guess, one of the local papers.
3485008	3492071	For 20% off of three toys, you basically buy one toy, save 10%, buy two, save 15%, buy three, save 25%.
3495310	3502997	Well, um, oddly enough, um, you know, games are listed as, you know, under the toy section on the website.
3503337	3512265	However, if you went into, um, a Best Buy and tried to use that coupon, um, they would not let you because they said that games are not a toy.
3512345	3515068	It says, um, let's see here.
3515848	3520553	Apparently, um, a employee at Best Buy, um,
3521826	3526828	So the games and game systems do not apply to that coupon because they're not toys.
3526928	3527969	A toy would be like a doll.
3529629	3532550	So, you know, Best Buy ripping people off yet again.
3533151	3533431	Awesome.
3537473	3539213	So what do you think of that?
3539273	3541434	Is video games a toy or not?
3543095	3545136	I think they, I don't know.
3545576	3545696	It's
3546303	3551008	If they're listed under their website as a toy, then yes, I think it would apply as a toy.
3551148	3553470	But you've got to be more clear on that stuff.
3553751	3561699	If you're just saying toy does not apply to video games, that's what they should have had the fine print on the coupon.
3561739	3562620	But they didn't.
3562700	3563621	I think they should honor it.
3564081	3565463	So that's their own fault.
3566023	3569487	And the fact that they're saying, oh, I'm sorry, that's not a toy, well...
3569878	3570839	Bait and Switch Gotta love it
3591099	3614317	Alright, well we're going to give just a couple more minutes for listless votes, so get those votes in now, we will announce the winners shortly, and we're going to be taking your Skype calls on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, and pretty soon you'll be able to call in from your PSP apparently, but I'm going to ask first, while we wait for any last minute votes, if there's any last minute stories that any of the hosts would like to cover tonight.
3615510	3616491	There's not a whole lot.
3617252	3625860	Sony, of course, introduced the 16 gigabyte memory stick duo for, you know, obviously cameras and PSP and stuff like that.
3626301	3627942	That's a whole lot of movies on there.
3630265	3632907	Or a whole lot of games, depending on how you look at it.
3634128	3636711	I don't know.
3636931	3638232	That's pretty much it.
3638332	3639894	It's been pretty dead.
3641593	3641673	H.D.V.D.
3671384	3672085	But what can you do?
3672685	3674186	In fact, it's the ramifications.
3674226	3677429	Because if you think about it, Warner Brothers also owns New Line, which is a huge studio.
3677449	3678509	They did Lord of the Rings, right?
3680050	3681231	This is just a huge blow.
3681471	3684974	And they're saying that this could single-handedly turn things in Blu-ray's favor.
3685274	3688857	But something to keep in mind, Paramount is still HD DVD exclusive.
3688877	3690898	And I believe there's one other studio that's still... Universal?
3691098	3692379	Yeah, HD DVD exclusive.
3692439	3696202	So it isn't necessarily over yet, but that is a very big blow.
3696262	3697082	Even I'll admit that.
3697122	3697903	Because that means, you know...
3698423	3702106	The Batman movies and stuff are going to be Blu-ray exclusive, which kind of sucks.
3702126	3709150	There was also the thing Kmart did too, saying they weren't going to carry Blu-ray.
3710931	3718016	Just one more last minute story, and this is kind of stupid, but apparently some guy shot his son over an Xbox 360 argument.
3719077	3722599	Apparently a 17-year-old in Pennsylvania
3725031	3725591	Talk about asshole.
3725631	3725752	Sorry.
3725852	3727493	What's the kid doing with a rifle?
3727533	3727713	Sorry.
3756393	3757873	That's one of many questions I have.
3758694	3759094	Hold on.
3759134	3759634	You know what?
3759715	3760175	I'm sorry.
3760275	3764537	This means we need to fire up something for 2008 here.
3766018	3767879	This is the inaugural stupid award of 2008.
3768640	3769300	I'm sorry.
3773403	3779706	I've heard these arguments before where somebody is yelling at somebody else and goes, I'm sure it's just like, why don't you just shoot me?
3780027	3781627	Why don't you just kill me?
3781988	3783969	That doesn't mean you actually shoot them.
3785578	3786959	Have you ever heard of, like, a metaphor?
3786979	3791180	Ah, so stupid.
3794362	3795082	Congratulations.
3795102	3795863	What's this guy's name?
3797143	3798204	Uh, they didn't have his name.
3799004	3801805	So, Unknown... Wait, I saw it somewhere.
3801845	3802906	Wait, I gotta look at this.
3802926	3803906	I know I saw this somewhere.
3803926	3806107	You have to go to the original site that ran it.
3806127	3811089	Because I want to say this happened not that far from where I've been in Pennsylvania before.
3811109	3812730	Let's see, where the hell was it?
3816485	3820207	Uh, person in the... Let's see.
3820227	3826189	60-year-old James Stanley Nidasik shot his 17-year-old son.
3828090	3829990	So, congratulations, James Stanley.
3830050	3831211	I can't pronounce your last name.
3831251	3836073	You win the first Stupid Award of 2008, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio, for shooting your son in an argument.
3837213	3837393	Ass.
3839914	3844936	There's a release date for the Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Bully out in the U.K.,
3846107	3846707	March 7th.
3847308	3848688	We're getting that here too, I believe, right?
3849289	3850950	Yeah, it's around March.
3851450	3851910	Sweet-ish.
3851930	3855152	This should be the scholarship edition over here.
3857433	3858113	Going to be very nice.
3859014	3861615	All right, shall we get to tonight's listless winners?
3862176	3862516	Sure.
3864099	3865220	It was neck and neck tonight.
3865300	3867321	Only one vote separated number one and two.
3868262	3876227	But everything got a vote tonight, which doesn't happen very often in Listless, but somebody in chat wanted a little bit of everything.
3876487	3877988	But in the end, there could be only three.
3878068	3881770	So here it is, your top three gadgets you would like to see them unveil at CES.
3881790	3882931	This is the definitive list.
3883291	3884012	No arguing.
3884052	3885993	It's a very scientific method we use here.
3886353	3886773	It's done.
3887814	3892317	The number three thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is the holodeck.
3896013	3900455	The number two thing you would like to see them debut at CES is a portal gun.
3902497	3910541	Meaning the number one thing you would like to see at CES either this year or 2009, the George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.
3911041	3911421	Awesome.
3911441	3913463	It bakes the whole fucking cow.
3915664	3916124	Beautiful.
3916224	3917665	Not bad for a last minute pick.
3918505	3921307	Now your only trouble is where do you get a cow?
3924076	3925677	That's the only downside.
3925697	3927898	You tip it over and then put it in a bag?
3927998	3928358	I don't know.
3928698	3929038	That's it.
3929098	3930619	You tip it over into the grill.
3934301	3934621	Nice.
3936442	3936722	All right.
3938263	3941404	Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line of calls then.
3941424	3942325	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3942385	3944446	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3944466	3946787	If you want to go ahead and give us a call, we'll take your calls.
3946847	3947707	We'll take a few of those.
3949722	3953424	Ross Deal UT says, Loki, you can get a cow carcass at Publix Easy.
3953464	3954405	Well, here in Florida.
3954865	3956546	I don't even know what that is, to be honest.
3957807	3958468	Do you know what that is?
3959048	3959248	Nope.
3959808	3960048	I know.
3960109	3961189	I have no idea what that is.
3962230	3962410	What?
3963591	3963691	Oh.
3964371	3966553	You have to give this to me now while we're trying to take calls on Skype?
3967313	3967553	All right.
3968274	3968974	Yes, I had to.
3969214	3970235	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3970255	3970595	Who's this?
3972016	3973677	Hi, this is Ross Deal UT.
3973937	3975158	Hello, Ross Deal UT.
3975178	3975218	Hi.
3975838	3976699	Friend, buddy, pal.
3976719	3977099	Hey there.
3977339	3978060	What's on your mind?
3978180	3978300	Hey.
3978420	3978500	Hey.
3979503	3980263	I'm nothing much.
3980403	3985245	First off, Publix is a supermarket chain over here in the southeast.
3988346	3989466	Very big supermarket chain.
3997645	4002267	Yeah, I've seen people, I used to work at a Publix once, and yeah, I used to see people getting the cow carcasses.
4002728	4003048	Wow.
4003128	4005689	I guess that's what they do for Thanksgiving instead of the turkey, I don't know.
4005889	4007410	You put it in your shopping cart.
4009271	4014153	That's something I'd like to see them doing on Supermarket Sweep, putting five of those cow carcasses right in the car.
4016134	4020136	Yeah, you'd need more than one cart, man, those things are fucking huge.
4020696	4025719	Well, that's how they did it on the show, they'd fill up one cart and throw it to their partner and they'd get another cart, alright, anyway.
4026947	4030348	I'm sorry, would Supermarket Sweep not be the best video game ever?
4031709	4032089	I'm sorry?
4032709	4035250	Would Supermarket Sweep not be one of the best video games ever?
4035310	4037511	Like, that's the kind of shit they need to be doing for Xbox Live.
4038111	4038512	Seriously.
4039612	4042413	That would be a good Xbox Live arcade game, actually.
4042553	4043674	I hope Microsoft's listening.
4043994	4044694	I hope you guys are listening.
4044734	4046315	Alright, what else is on your mind, Rusty?
4048015	4048876	Um, let's see.
4049336	4051116	In reaction, a couple of things, actually.
4051196	4055198	In reaction to the whole Warner Brothers New Line thing, the CES
4055792	4077417	HD DVD press conference got cancelled I heard, it's like they've got their tail between their legs going Well, it's pretty big when you think about it There's only like three exclusive HD DVD studios left And Paramount, like I said in the chat, they're only exclusive because Microsoft paid them a boatload of money
4078277	4079318	I've seen pornographic Blu-rays on offer.
4098787	4104969	I could have sworn on this program last year we had a story about that the porn industry had gone with HD DVD for some reason.
4105009	4107090	I don't remember the reason, but they went with HD DVD.
4107430	4108570	Why did they go back on that?
4108710	4111731	Because I always said whoever gets porn wins the war.
4112091	4114672	And now that porn is going to Blu-ray, I'm like, it's over.
4115892	4120013	Well, the problem with porn really is that it's not like back in DVD.
4120093	4122934	Now you see porn really moving into the downloadable space.
4123815	4128363	Xbox Live Marketplace is going to suddenly offer porn, although they ought to.
4137727	4139629	Well, not on Xbox Live Marketplace.
4160235	4162716	You could say the same thing about Walmart.
4162756	4165697	They carry those movies and they don't carry porn.
4165737	4178442	Microsoft has an image to protect, but what I was about to say is that you can't go five steps in either direction online without dipping into a pay site.
4178862	4182484	That's where I see a lot of the pornographic market going, is online.
4183324	4187446	You don't have to worry about people picketing in front of porn shops or whatever.
4187466	4187586	It's a
4188601	4189161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4211479	4214121	Well, the problem is they already did that with the Wii, so, you know.
4214261	4214922	Oh, yeah, that's right.
4214942	4217644	They already did... Yeah, you remember that, like, a few months back.
4217764	4219845	My child went to X-Tube on the Wii.
4221566	4221827	Yeah.
4222947	4228671	Yeah, anything with any sort of internet capability is gonna have pornography.
4228732	4233495	My concern is if it ever went to Xbox Live Arcade, you'd have a bunch of people, you know...
4235291	4239275	Watch some porn and go play Halo or Uno with their cameras and you'll see them all.
4248581	4251782	You can put porn, stream it off of your 80 gig hard drive.
4251882	4258683	I bet anything you're only going to get to put pre-selected video clips that just happen to be clips from Sony's latest movies and TV shows.
4258743	4260464	No, it's going to be stuff that's off your hard drive.
4260484	4261144	It's going to be anything, yeah.
4261284	4261564	Really?
4261784	4262804	Anything on your hard drive, yeah.
4262904	4265305	Loki's Porn Palace, only available at home.
4266525	4268326	Are you going to have a virtual porn house at home?
4268526	4269126	Oh, sure, why not?
4269146	4271627	That's going to be fun.
4271647	4273347	Oh, what I want to know is, you know, are they going to be...
4273712	4275833	I think I'm going to let you throw cocks at people in home.
4276073	4277773	Are they going to throw cocks at people?
4278213	4278974	Like Second Life.
4279454	4281454	Jamie, did you have something you wanted to say to this?
4281474	4282455	Everything else was Second Life.
4282655	4287776	I was just going to say Walmart wasn't exactly the best thing to bring up since they actually sold censored versions of movies.
4289957	4290397	Not here.
4291238	4296579	Oh, I totally agree with the point that Walmart's just as bigoted as everybody else in this sense.
4297239	4301521	They're going to sell the violent movies, but heaven forbid our children see titties.
4301701	4302021	Oh, no.
4302825	4305528	Heaven forbid we teach them responsible sex at a young age.
4305908	4307850	Walmart is a huge contradiction.
4307870	4310293	They'll sell the unrated movies gladly.
4310693	4312895	They'll sell the M-rated games gladly.
4313196	4316259	But they won't sell porn and they won't sell music with explicit lyrics.
4316359	4317840	I never understood that.
4318221	4318461	Never.
4319507	4330136	I will never forget that fucking Sheryl Crow, of all people, got banned from Walmart because she said in one of her songs, she had a lyric about somebody buying a gun at a Walmart store.
4330697	4332859	Well, you can, in fact, buy guns at Walmart stores.
4332879	4333119	Yes, you can.
4333139	4334280	They have a hunting section.
4334600	4340325	So Walmart fucking banned Sheryl Crow because Sheryl Crow poses this huge threat to society.
4340805	4342407	Like, what's going to happen, you know?
4343127	4345670	She does, however, pose a huge threat to good music.
4345690	4349574	You know, when I think of hard fucking core music, I think of Sheryl Crow.
4351276	4351996	Exactly.
4352837	4354799	Anyway, last thing before I go.
4354879	4361987	You'll be happy to know that long after it's been released, they're releasing a Stranglehold map pack.
4363213	4363973	I'd actually heard about that.
4363993	4368575	I got the email from Midway, except I never played Stranglehold in the first place, so I forgot about that.
4368635	4371795	I was about to say, I mean, it wasn't exactly a best-selling game.
4371815	4373556	Why would anyone care at this point?
4374296	4380838	Probably they were already making it, thinking the game was going to be huge, and now it's just kind of one of those wah-wah kind of releases, you know?
4381518	4383299	Yeah, they kind of have to at this point, huh?
4383319	4385659	If you can make $50 off it, why not?
4390067	4391408	Hi, how are you?
4418055	4418495	I'm fine.
4418755	4419415	What's on your mind?
4419515	4421236	I'm calling from Sweden, actually.
4421336	4422776	You're calling from Sweden?
4422856	4425336	It's got to be like four in the morning over there.
4425356	4429997	I think I'm the first one to actually call from Sweden, maybe.
4430997	4431597	I think so.
4431637	4432778	I think he is.
4432818	4438699	We've had people in England, and I want to say we've had South America, definitely, Mexico.
4439499	4441299	I want to say we've had another... We've had Denmark.
4441859	4443620	Denmark was it, but we haven't had Sweden.
4444620	4445460	Well, welcome to the show.
4447162	4449023	Well, good evening, so to say.
4449303	4449863	Well, I don't know.
4450863	4466748	I was a bit pissed last year since, in your years of, your best of year, since never ever spoke about that the expansion for World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, actually came out.
4467648	4475170	Which was, but then again, I just was like, wait, did that actually get released?
4475808	4476488	Last year?
4477649	4479310	It seems like it was a long time ago.
4479330	4479790	You're right.
4479870	4483692	That did come out in January, and as far as PC games go, that was a huge title.
4484073	4488715	Now, in all fairness, and to cover our rears a little bit, we did talk about BlizzCon.
4489576	4490916	We talked about The Wrath of the Lich King.
4490996	4491977	I remember.
4492277	4502703	I've been actually... I don't know actually when I got hooked on your show for some reason, but I've been listening to your show like I would say maybe a year and a half.
4502723	4503003	So...
4505606	4519731	But then again, I had some, what is it, since I've upgraded platform from going from Macintosh to PC nowadays, so I've had, what is it, only a half year that didn't go that well.
4521832	4524012	Yeah, are you a big, do you play WoW yourself?
4524072	4525293	Are you really big into Burning Crusade?
4526253	4532195	Yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm like, I would say that I'm a huge WoW fan.
4532765	4536026	Well, players, since that's basically almost the only thing I've played.
4538407	4540608	What did I buy games last year?
4541188	4552172	Oh, it was Burning Crusade, and, well, I tried out EVE Online this summer, the summer bit, and then I bought the Orange Box.
4552972	4553252	Good choice.
4553272	4553472	Good taste.
4553612	4555133	And that I share with games.
4556648	4560009	Here's my question, though, to you, because I notice you're mentioning a lot of PC games.
4560029	4569371	And we always like to ask our callers who call in from other countries, because I know a lot of times here on this program we focus on, here's what's happening in Japan, here's what's happening in the U.S.
4569651	4575512	We try to cover the overseas stuff, but sometimes it's best to kind of hear it firsthand, what the gaming scene's like overseas.
4575552	4580693	Like, for instance, we've kind of heard from callers that have called from Latin and South American countries talk about that
4581113	4584175	A lot of the scene is very expensive there.
4584255	4586897	What would you say the gaming scene is like in Sweden?
4586957	4590600	Is it easy to walk into a store and pick up the latest and greatest game or console?
4591200	4592581	Or is it a challenge?
4593562	4594862	That's like a piece of cake.
4595963	4599826	The only problem is that, well, what?
4600826	4605550	Games are currently quite fun in one way, since the PS3 is...
4610484	4621012	For the cost of a PS3, you can actually get a decent computer and start playing WoW or Orange Box, whatever you want to.
4622173	4622734	Interesting.
4622994	4625155	Well, they do say the PS3 is supposed to be a computer.
4625175	4626697	Well, at least they keep going back and forth on that.
4626717	4627357	Yes, it's a computer.
4627417	4627857	No, it's not.
4629058	4630900	And still, what is it?
4630940	4640027	There was an argument that really the cell engine, which is in the PS3, is not even made for games, so...
4642330	4651674	So I'm assuming that the PlayStation 3 sales in Sweden are similar to that they are here, where there's quite still a big pile of them at the store waiting to be moved.
4652774	4656196	Yeah, it really is.
4658137	4660538	So I guess maybe we aren't so different after all.
4662658	4664559	When you look at that.
4664759	4668961	Maybe you want to cut me off right now, but anyway, I just want to say, Skype,
4672460	4672780	What is it?
4673540	4679701	You have a 70 Druid, which I'm quite impressed in one way, since, well, what?
4680922	4683902	In a way, just well-related.
4684362	4693744	I've played World of Warcraft on US servers for one year, and I never even got to level 40.
4695504	4697284	Are you playing on a PvP server?
4697324	4698205	That's probably why.
4699205	4700725	PvP server was
4701403	4702103	What was it?
4702383	4703283	It was Warsong.
4704364	4705164	But here's the thing.
4705964	4722167	I've developed the infamous altaholic disease, which is that you made one character, and then you get a character like 35 or something, and then you play another one.
4723167	4725628	And then you repeat that for quite some time.
4726688	4732853	So basically you have WoW ADD is what we would call it, where you can't focus on one character.
4732873	4735615	I have plenty of friends who do that same thing.
4735675	4736415	I was like that.
4736455	4738036	I haven't got a character pass level 8.
4739898	4747583	Although, really, I actually have 63 mage nowadays.
4748164	4748884	And what is it?
4748904	4749004	When...
4751607	4755648	When the Burning Crusade came out, I switched to European servers.
4758428	4764049	So, well, they made it a lot easier to level.
4764329	4777172	But then again, when the 2.3 patch later that came out just a few months, one month ago or something, not even that, made it a lot easier to level.
4778190	4806336	You know, I don't know what it is, and I do have to wrap up and get going soon, but I will say this about Druid, is that what's amazing about that class is it's one of the last classes I tried playing in WoW, and I think the reason I've stuck with it so long is that you really can do, like, a little bit of everything as a Druid, and that's why I have so much fun with it, because, you know, I can do spam, you know, Moonfire or whatever, but then I can heal, or in a pinch, I can flip in a bear form and, you know, tank, even though I'm not very good at it, because I'm specced for balance, but, you know, it's kind of interesting, so...
4806601	4809243	Yeah, well, I know how fun Druids is.
4809343	4812064	I got one at level 45 at the current stage.
4812284	4813705	Now you need to take it a little higher.
4814686	4816467	Yeah.
4817868	4830235	They were speaking about, well, what was the New Year's promises or stuff, and my problem is that I was saying that I will get one character level standing, but then I just realized that
4831430	4845516	There's this new MMO that's been announced called Warhammer Age of Reckoning, which is highly anticipated in my ranks, which is Weehoo.
4852335	4854915	Well, it sounds like it could be a big year into 2008.
4855076	4861737	Hopefully we don't neglect to mention that at this year's end special, or we might get another call berating us.
4862117	4862977	No, I'm just kidding.
4863217	4865157	Anyway, we've got to wrap up.
4865538	4872019	I don't mind letting the international calls go on a long time, though, because I know you've got to stay up very, very late to listen to our program, and we appreciate it.
4872319	4873079	But thank you so much.
4873099	4876120	Do you have any other quick final thoughts, things you want to share with our listeners?
4877120	4877480	No.
4879025	4880906	I don't know, just keep on the show.
4882827	4886689	It's really one of the greatest I have heard so far.
4886949	4887430	Well, thank you.
4887470	4888170	I appreciate that.
4890071	4893013	Hats off for you.
4893773	4895014	I appreciate it very much.
4895594	4895895	Thank you.
4895935	4898096	Thank you so much for staying up and listening to us.
4898196	4898776	A true fan.
4899557	4900117	Take care, buddy.
4903279	4905700	It is actually my second attempt in...
4907958	4915840	and listen to your live since I'm usually not well since it's the hour difference is such a huge difference.
4916560	4923261	And one of these days we're going to have to do a show at noon to give our British and not just British but overseas listeners a break.
4923301	4924821	Everybody over in those time zones.
4925841	4926361	Maybe we'll have to.
4926381	4928082	Sweden, Denmark, all of them.
4928662	4930222	Alright, I've got to let you go.
4930302	4931562	Thanks so much for the call though.
4931923	4933323	We love hearing from the international folks.
4933783	4934283	It's awesome.
4935126	4937729	We'll do one more call if you've got any other calls coming in.
4937810	4938771	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4938791	4939111	Who's this?
4940213	4940893	Hey, it's Ranma.
4940913	4941714	What's up, everybody?
4941794	4942996	Hey, how you doing, Ranma?
4943937	4944878	I'm doing good.
4944918	4946680	I'm finally recovering from my holidays.
4946821	4947882	So how about you guys?
4948282	4948843	I'm doing fine.
4948863	4950645	Thank you for the card, by the way, on a personal note.
4951446	4952227	Hey, no problem.
4952247	4953429	Jamie, did you get your card yet?
4954554	4955574	I have to check the mail.
4955614	4958955	We have a pile of it, and I've been sort of too sick to look at anything.
4959175	4960495	You know what's hilarious, Ranma?
4960855	4963236	Your car actually got wet because of the storms.
4963276	4964716	The rain got in my mailbox.
4964936	4965897	Isn't that crazy?
4966197	4968417	No, that happened to Dan's friend Will.
4968817	4972878	He was expecting the title to his truck, and he found it floating in the gutter.
4973678	4974118	Oh, my God.
4974138	4975139	Well, it wasn't that bad.
4975199	4980400	It's just that the wind actually blew open the little flap, and water got in there.
4980440	4981060	It's crazy.
4981080	4981160	Yeah.
4981533	4983873	So anyway, sorry Ranma, enough about me boohooing.
4983893	4984454	What's on your mind?
4985394	4985774	Not much.
4985814	4986774	I'll make this brief.
4987034	4988574	I finally got a chance to play Rock Band.
4989414	4990555	Oh, what'd you think of Rock Band?
4991395	4992195	It is great.
4992275	4995015	It's got to be one of the greatest games I've played all year.
4996016	5001056	I am probably one of the only people on the planet that thinks that Guitar Hero 3 has a better song list than Rock Band.
5001957	5002477	I don't know why.
5002537	5004197	I'm just not as into the songs in Rock Band.
5004237	5007158	Although I will say, Rock Band has some great download songs.
5007338	5009638	Like, I actually like that Attack song a lot.
5010448	5011448	The one you told me to get.
5011488	5012589	I actually really like that song.
5014830	5019431	Rock band's growing on me, but here's my question, because I was just thinking about this earlier today.
5019491	5021312	I know it's your call and everything, but I'm deflecting.
5022052	5024113	What do you think they could do for a rock band 2?
5026654	5027494	Add more instruments.
5027554	5030355	I mean, a keyboard would be nice for rock band 2.
5030995	5032256	That I would like to see happen.
5033376	5035157	You know what I think they should do for rock band 2?
5036554	5037615	Not have a Rock Band 2.
5038075	5039555	I think they should come out with Pop Band.
5040036	5044598	And I think in Pop Band they should get rid of maybe the guitar.
5044838	5047739	Lose the guitar and put the keyboard in instead.
5048419	5050340	Or lose the bass and put in the keyboard.
5050380	5050740	I don't know.
5051101	5054842	But I would love to see them do a Pop Band game.
5055002	5056343	Although I don't know how that would go over.
5057303	5061725	Well, if they do a Rock Band 2, maybe one of the controls could be a double axe handle controller.
5061785	5062926	Now that would be badass.
5063683	5066044	That would be pretty rad to have because that's what my character has.
5066384	5070966	I have a giant double axe controller with a big unicorn on it because you can put stickers on a guitar.
5071006	5072126	So I put a big unicorn on it.
5072186	5072646	It's awesome.
5073987	5076608	Dan has the tattoo of the snake coming out of the pants.
5076828	5077088	Nice.
5079089	5082070	And every time he shows it off, he goes, what's a trouser snake?
5083570	5085391	SSJ100 Matt says, polka band.
5085471	5087072	And Dark Knight says, I got to have cowbells?
5088092	5090173	If there's a polka band, it's got to be Weird Al.
5090788	5100435	I think I was telling you about this the other day, but our friend was, while she was highly intoxicated, by the way, walking around with a cup and a pencil playing cowbell.
5103197	5103577	Nice.
5103778	5104618	That's great.
5106900	5115606	So as a long time, because I know you've been a long time fan of Konami's Bimani series and DDR and all that stuff, and I know that's how you kind of first came to our station.
5115626	5116347	Yeah.
5116980	5122281	What do you think Konami could do to kind of step it up and give Harmonix a little competition?
5124061	5133283	Well, actually bring over more of the Bimani games and fine-tune it more for American audiences instead of... Did we lose him?
5133343	5133603	Hello?
5135264	5136124	Oh, I'm right here, sorry.
5136184	5144186	Fine-tune it for American audiences instead of... Instead of putting in rehashes of some of the Japanese songs, like with DDR.
5144206	5145466	As much as I enjoy DDR...
5146354	5147875	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5175197	5176058	as the buttons.
5176178	5176418	I don't know.
5176458	5178479	It looked like a funky version of Whack-A-Mole to me.
5178800	5178940	Yeah.
5178960	5179800	Isn't that kind of what it looked like?
5179840	5180881	It was like Whack-A-Mole to music.
5180981	5181842	It's like touchscreen or something.
5182262	5183183	That might be kind of interesting.
5184103	5185244	That would be friggin' awesome.
5185264	5186945	Except how can you play that on a home console?
5187326	5190067	So it's something that's only going to be in arcades, if anything.
5190968	5191609	Pretty much.
5192759	5200220	Well, one thing I've noticed is that when me and my roommate, when we play Guitar Hero, it's like, eh, eh, we have to trade off controllers back and forth.
5200260	5201621	There's just more than one person here.
5202021	5204141	I mean, with Rock Band, I mean, my friend brought it up.
5204201	5205641	It was like for the Christmas party.
5205661	5208262	It was like the ultimate party game, you know?
5208322	5209742	I mean, like, you have a lot of people.
5209782	5211082	You got, like, WarioWare.
5211102	5212202	You got the Mario parties.
5212282	5216583	But you break out of Rock Band, everybody will just show up and just start playing.
5216603	5218804	You know, you're switching off controllers back and forth.
5219064	5220884	You're just getting together, having a good time.
5220944	5221404	And, well...
5222008	5223229	DarkTetsuya DarkSakura
5248558	5249138	Two quick things.
5249779	5253800	My game of the year was Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
5254081	5254361	Why?
5254521	5256402	Worst game of the year, Rover vs. Smackdown 08.
5258042	5258562	Why those two?
5260363	5263124	For me to get into a game, you've got to take my full attention.
5263184	5269387	Any game that can help me kill a 45-minute train ride from homework vice versa is definitely up in my book.
5269807	5274249	And Phantom Hourglass was one of the few DS games that were actually able to have me do that.
5274670	5278213	And as for Raw vs. SmackDown 08, I'm an average wrestling fan.
5278633	5283537	I just didn't like the fact that they took so much out of the Wii version compared to the other versions of the game.
5283837	5286760	Basically, the Wii got the gimped version of the game.
5287180	5288541	That's why it gets worst game of the year.
5288721	5292204	I just had to ask because you know you're one of like the two people who didn't say Yaris.
5292464	5293485	So just had to ask.
5293525	5294546	I don't have a 360 yet.
5294846	5295427	Ah, there you go.
5296147	5296407	All right.
5296447	5298009	Well, DJ Rama S, we got to let you go.
5298149	5299670	But thank you so much for calling us always.
5299950	5300330	Take care.
5300531	5300771	All right.
5301051	5301371	You too.
5301451	5301631	Bye-bye.
5301651	5302272	All right.
5302930	5303890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5332458	5336982	My final thought is I'm going to get a bug lamp for this room and every time it goes bzzz I'm going to laugh.
5337582	5337882	Loki.
5339484	5340725	Big rigs over the road.
5340805	5343467	Racing is really, really, really bad.
5345288	5345588	Alright.
5346829	5347850	I'll take your word for it.
5348210	5349451	Because I am not going to play it.
5349752	5351313	Although not as bad as I thought it would be.
5352414	5355096	I think there's some where those Wii conspiracy games are even worse.
5355663	5360184	Thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.
5360224	5360964	We appreciate it.
5361704	5364485	We would be nowhere without you guys and your word of mouth.
5364565	5368006	So if you like what you've heard, please tell two people about our show.
5368346	5369867	Spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
5369887	5377028	If you tell two people, then slowly we'll take over the world because we don't have any magazines or websites to get million views a month that we can advertise on.
5377728	5379829	We literally broadcast out of my garage.
5380209	5382511	So it's independent radio at its finest.
5383191	5392077	If you don't feel so inclined to tell people, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Dig or Yahoo Podcasts or any of those sites because that works too.
5392698	5395300	Anyhow, thank you guys so much for tuning in this week.
5395900	5402104	Next week we will be back and we'll have more gaming news and more stuff to come in the year 2008.
5402945	5405407	Hopefully some surprises here on the program.
5405587	5408489	I was trying to book some guests for the upcoming shows.
5408854	5410515	So hopefully we'll have some of those in the next few weeks.
5411016	5411976	So more to come.
5412377	5417000	Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.
5420402	5422844	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
