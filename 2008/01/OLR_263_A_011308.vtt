Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models have discontinued in Japan.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
The worlds of Soulcalibur and Star Wars collide, and could Resident Evil be returning to arcades?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that video game show on the internet dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Our show's very own Bionic Woman.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Who hearts pirates according to her shirt, or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I have skulls pirates.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
So that means you collect their skulls?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Like shrunken heads?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Like PVP and Ragnarok, yo.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
That means skull fuck.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
And of course the other voice you hear over there, the ever giggly tech master Loki.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Sorry, I was watching Crysis YouTube videos.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I see.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
Because you have to understand Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
Well, there's chickens and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spotted a ton of chickens and vehicles and blowing them up and that's hilarious. I don't know.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Killing chickens has been funny ever since like the Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
You didn't kill them though. They just, you picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
That's right.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Sweet, sweet chicken-y vengeance.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
These chickens do not get revenge. They simply die.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Can we eat them?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, that was my next question. Can you eat them?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
No.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
No fun.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
All right, well anyway, it's just the three of us tonight. We haven't had a guest in a long time. I think everybody locally hates our show suddenly.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Doesn't want to come visit anymore.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
They're listening to us.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
There's some that are listening. No.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
We'll get some more. I think the rain and the weather lately has been keeping people indoors and of course there was like the holidays.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You know, who wants to come do a show on Christmas, right?

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
But anyhow, hopefully we'll have some more familiar faces and new faces as well.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
I've been talking to somebody locally that's going to come on a future show. I'll give you more details about that in the future, but I'm very excited about it.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
It's somebody I found on YouTube. That's all I'll say. Who happens to live here locally is going to come on the show.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
So I'm very excited. I'll give you guys more details. This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Person on YouTube. That could be anyone on the face of the earth.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
That could be. I mean, it's a wonderful place.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
But anyway, we have that and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan, but of course it's kind of a dull period right now.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
There's not a lot of games coming out. I think there's a few. Of course there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff, but otherwise kind of a slow period for games.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
But that doesn't mean the news has stopped, and we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass trying to get it to work.

03:06.000 --> 03:19.000
I now have Cooking Mama in the collection in the purse to play because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again and to hell with my production.

03:19.000 --> 03:32.000
And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
Now, I didn't know what rebirth was. You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night, and the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.

03:39.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you have to start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I've been really amazed, so, oh well.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I wish Warcraft had a New Game Plus.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, you get to 70. Ha ha, you're stuck.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm like, hey, I'm at 99. Let's do the Time Warp again.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
It's just to jump to the left.

04:21.000 --> 04:34.000
No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is endgame content.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Like, there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You find a pond, you get experience.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
PvP.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
You find a rock, you get experience.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
You don't get experience for discoveries at level 70 because there is no more experience.

04:47.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, no, but I mean, for other stuff, when you're getting there, it's like, you, you, it's like, what was that, Eddie, is your thing, you have crossed the road, champagne!

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That's kind of what it is, exactly.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
But it's kind of cool because sometimes you gain levels when exploring.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
I think I hit like level, one of the higher ones, like 68 or 69 exploring, and it was like vroom, new level.

05:08.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, right now I'm, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of, and I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I brought a DVI to VGA converter.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Thing is the DVI side doesn't fit.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It's, I guess, completely different.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
This is the one that Vandalus gave me.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh, nice.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Yes, before he left us.

05:38.000 --> 05:52.000
But I, what we were going to do, we were going to put it in a different case so that I could add more stuff to it and use one of our newer cards so that I could use the other monitor.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And it works just fine with the graphics card that was in it.

05:55.000 --> 06:06.000
And it's actually a pretty decent graphics card, but I want something that's going to be a little bit better before I hop back on Guild Wars because I am going to be going back to Guild Wars about once a week.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Sokka.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Hey.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm just kidding.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Guild Wars was kind of fun.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
You got your account, man, as well, right?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Exactly, I know.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
That's the one thing I always liked about Guild Wars is, like, it's always there for you to come back to, you know?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
You bought the game.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
There's no monthly fee or anything.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
It's always there to come back.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this Dark Sakura, so I'm going to bring this up now.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message, and apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I know.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Until the server's shut down on March 31st.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I know.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I talked about it with Rama last night.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Ah.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Doh.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Doh.

06:51.000 --> 07:03.000
Um, so I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so...

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
She's playing PSU.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
She was on Lost Planet the other night.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That's right.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And I was like, oh, it's Julie.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Wait, Julie?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Julie's playing Lost Planet?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah, she hung out with us today.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
We went to breakfast, and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead, but it's not the right one.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
She actually bought it for me.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I thought I was really nice of her, because it was only, like, ten bucks.

07:39.000 --> 07:55.000
And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount, and Dan used his gift card, and ended up getting one of those new PS3 remotes for twelve bucks.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
So that was pretty cool.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Very cool.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
They watched Ratatouille again, which is one of Dan's presents.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Aw.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
And I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, who knows?

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD kind of finishes.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Everybody's kind of jumping ship.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, well, I think it's still kind of up there, you know.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
It was very good.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
It was.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I heart that movie.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Did you like the new icon?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes, I did.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It was very nice.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
I made an icon from my LiveJournal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
You know what?

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
In Greek mythology, Lamia was the Queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Hot.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
They should make a video game out of Stardust.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I do.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't know what it is.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's the whole, like, swords and magic.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
You know, music is very Oblivion-ish.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.500
You can get it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
it glowing green.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.000
This has pulled my finger.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Hilarious.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I know.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm very proud of it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
All right.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It took, like, five seconds.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Why not?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
It was okay.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
It's horrible.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I hate.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
You know, I was still looking for it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Sorry to hear it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just, it's all, yay.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.200
Then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks, even though my character is in it,

09:39.200 --> 09:43.000
which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penises Magic Pen Gel.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
No, no.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.440
That game is way better.

09:53.440 --> 09:58.280
Then I played some more Crysis.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.480
Actually I'm about to finish it, but that's where the game starts to really, really suck.

10:03.480 --> 10:08.360
Apparently, I don't know, somewhere along the line of making the game, they decided

10:08.360 --> 10:15.560
not to test the last level very much, and it has hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches

10:15.560 --> 10:20.780
in it that make it almost impossible to play, and actually I have been unable to beat the

10:20.780 --> 10:24.000
game because of these glitches.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.320
You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your

10:28.320 --> 10:33.480
strength mode or whatever, and so when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't

10:33.480 --> 10:35.000
actually be able to be knocked down.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.480
They'll get stuck.

10:36.480 --> 10:43.720
And then some other times, you know, for example, one of the commanders or whatever, there's

10:43.720 --> 10:49.760
supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.120
Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand, and that's it.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.720
He's just frozen, and nothing ever happens.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.440
So you have to constantly restart the game, and it's just horrible.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.160
It's like, if that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at

11:04.160 --> 11:07.040
all because it was just that bad.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.920
And even now, I've tried playing it through about ten different times, starting on saves

11:11.920 --> 11:16.760
that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe, you know, something will

11:16.760 --> 11:19.680
work this time, but it doesn't.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.360
And I'm about fed up with it.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.560
However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.360
See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.

11:29.360 --> 11:34.040
It's like a portable nuke launcher, so I mean, why did they have it at the beginning of the

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
game?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.040
Because I would have loved to blow up chickens with that.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
It would have been fun.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.360
You have to work towards it.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
I know.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
You have to earn it.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.040
Or I have to cheat really bad.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.040
You need a chicken cannon.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.080
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
I think that's about it.

11:48.080 --> 11:53.760
It's just Saints Row, a little bit of Earth Defense Force still plugging away at that

11:53.760 --> 11:54.760
game.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.600
Alright, well, my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.920
Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft, you know, there's not a lot of new games coming

12:04.920 --> 12:07.920
out and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.200
So really, the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the

12:11.200 --> 12:15.240
week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games

12:15.240 --> 12:16.240
ever.

12:16.240 --> 12:22.520
You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.080
You know what you need is the booth.

12:25.080 --> 12:31.720
The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.120
I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.120
Basically if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four mini games

12:38.120 --> 12:39.120
in one.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.000
There's a lot of games in this period that were similar to it because honestly, the setup

12:44.000 --> 12:48.440
of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey the arcade game, which is also

12:48.440 --> 12:50.400
made up of four mini games.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.560
But basically what you do in Tron, you know, there's one level that's based off the light

12:53.560 --> 12:56.600
cycles and there's another where you're trying to enter the cone.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.840
You've probably seen the pictures of that before.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.160
And basically once you beat each of the four mini games, you get to do it all over again!

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
Yay!

13:04.160 --> 13:08.920
Well, the addition of Xbox Live co-op is kind of cool, getting to play a two-player game

13:08.920 --> 13:10.920
experience.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.820
Five dollars though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and

13:14.820 --> 13:16.640
age is worth too much more.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.160
I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.320
That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.880
That'll be kind of cool.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.680
Discs of Tron was very interesting.

13:26.680 --> 13:32.280
I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.

13:32.280 --> 13:38.280
The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play

13:38.280 --> 13:39.680
the entire game.

13:39.680 --> 13:45.560
It's just that when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and

13:45.560 --> 13:48.960
more difficult each time.

13:48.960 --> 13:55.480
The demo will give you a really good idea of what the game is all about.

13:55.480 --> 14:00.040
Other than Tron, the other new game on Xbox Live this week was Omega 5, this new shooting

14:00.040 --> 14:01.760
game that's out on Xbox Live Arcade.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.000
And I'll tell you what, I kind of did a double take when I was playing the game because I'm

14:05.000 --> 14:07.880
like, is this a PlayStation 2 game or an Xbox game?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.960
And I'm not saying that to knock the graphics, because the graphics are actually pretty cool,

14:10.960 --> 14:14.440
but this is not the type of game I'm used to seeing on the Xbox.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.200
It's a shooter-rific game that I really would have thought would have been on the PlayStation

14:18.200 --> 14:20.600
2, but it's in HD and widescreen.

14:20.600 --> 14:26.240
I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.820
You know, lots of bullets everywhere.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.820
That's always fun.

14:28.820 --> 14:34.160
Basically you can pick up these, you can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking

14:34.160 --> 14:38.920
up these different power-ups and you can have lasers or spreading bullets and things of

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
that sort.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.600
And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
that you know?

14:45.600 --> 14:46.840
Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
I mean, I'll give it that.

14:47.840 --> 14:54.520
Omega 5 is ten bucks, but it definitely reminds me of a Hay Day arcade Japanese-influenced

14:54.520 --> 14:55.780
shooter, so definitely check it out.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.820
The demo on that one is not bad either.

14:57.820 --> 15:01.080
You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.000
You do one mini-boss fight.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.680
But it's pretty cool.

15:07.680 --> 15:13.600
And of course there's always our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and rostielut, quite

15:13.600 --> 15:17.760
the smartass in our chatroom, the official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes

15:17.760 --> 15:18.760
and ways.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
No, I'm kidding.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.520
He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.520
You know what I mean.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.520
I'm not talking about first-person shooters.

15:24.520 --> 15:30.120
I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know?

15:30.120 --> 15:33.400
This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too, and

15:33.400 --> 15:38.100
some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.400
So there you have it.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.880
So that's really going to do it for our gaming week.

15:43.880 --> 15:48.120
So now we're going to move on into some housekeeping, of which we don't have a whole lot to share.

15:48.120 --> 15:53.200
I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished.

15:53.200 --> 15:59.760
So if you were feeling there's not enough of the old-school classics and music from

15:59.760 --> 16:02.320
video games and such, you're going to love the new rotation.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.680
It's tons and tons of music from various video games.

16:05.680 --> 16:13.480
We wanted to avoid the temptation of just dumping MP3s upon MP3s in there and just tried

16:13.480 --> 16:17.660
to pick out songs that were a little more upbeat, radio-friendly, and the types of things

16:17.660 --> 16:20.520
that you'd hear on the radio that will still remind you of the classics.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
So check it out.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.000
Give us your feedback in our forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.360
And one other thing is that there's a new show.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.080
It's not a live show or a hosted show.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.240
It's just a music show, but it airs every day from noon to 1230.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.340
That's every day, Monday through Sunday, so every day.

16:36.340 --> 16:41.280
It's the retro lunch, so it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
Just a little bit.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
Don't overdo it.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.840
But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
So check that out.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.840
Yep, lots of fun.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.440
And some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they

16:53.440 --> 16:56.680
will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station

16:56.680 --> 16:57.680
right now and try to guess.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
I used to do that.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.680
Yeah.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
It's fun.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.680
It's fun.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.680
So check that out.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.680
All right.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.200
Anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
of.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.640
It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody

17:11.640 --> 17:16.880
everywhere wants to know, how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?

17:16.880 --> 17:22.000
We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know the number.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.920
So but this week we have an idea of how Eye of Judgment is doing.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
Do we not?

17:26.920 --> 17:27.920
Yes.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.480
So now we have an actual place we can look to see how Eye of Judgment is doing thanks

17:32.480 --> 17:43.160
to VGcharts.com and apparently you guys are up to.15 million copies to be exact actually

17:43.160 --> 17:52.680
because that's just an estimate, 132,199 copies sold so far.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
All right.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.240
So how many does that mean we have left to go?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.120
About 870,000.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.120
Yeah.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
All right.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.480
Get to work.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.480
For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of

18:05.480 --> 18:09.680
Judgment could, if Eye of Judgment was actually, because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece

18:09.680 --> 18:14.280
of shit, we call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program, and Loki says there's

18:14.280 --> 18:19.640
no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies and if it does, he will don

18:19.640 --> 18:24.220
a tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby

18:24.220 --> 18:27.960
Blackwolf in a match of the Eye of Judgment, which by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
I heard it on his show.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.840
Oh, my own sake, it is actually 150,000.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
150 million?

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
Oh shit.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.840
We've got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.840
No, I don't think so.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.800
150 million, that'd be unheard of.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.560
Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.

18:43.560 --> 18:53.120
I didn't realize the 132,199 is just US, which is pretty impressive actually that the US

18:53.120 --> 18:54.880
has actually sold that many copies.

18:54.880 --> 18:55.880
Japan, not so much.

18:55.880 --> 19:03.580
In fact, they're only up to 19,384, so no love in Japan for that stuff, but the US keeps

19:03.580 --> 19:04.580
on chugging.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.320
Now, is the game out in Europe yet?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.760
The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?

19:08.760 --> 19:12.640
Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.

19:12.640 --> 19:17.400
According to this, that's not Europe though, let me see.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
I don't think so.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.680
No, it's not out in Europe yet.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.520
So Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.

19:23.520 --> 19:32.280
Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chat room and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.

19:32.280 --> 19:37.040
If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon apparently,

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
so there you go.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
You can buy it cheap.

19:39.040 --> 19:45.040
I posted a link in the chat room where you can play along at home and we'll probably

19:45.040 --> 19:50.760
post it in a thread or something in our forums so that you can watch the count.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.080
So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show?

19:53.080 --> 19:55.440
No, we can do it every month or so.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.760
Maybe when it crosses milestones, when we get to 200,000 we'll mention it again, a quarter

19:59.760 --> 20:04.400
million, then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows, if we keep going.

20:04.400 --> 20:10.100
I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but I don't know, because there's

20:10.100 --> 20:11.680
other stories we're getting into.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
That's right.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.840
Shall we get into these stories?

20:13.840 --> 20:17.920
We shall get into these stories.

20:17.920 --> 20:25.000
So the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Some more cards.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.880
In fact, there's two of them.

20:29.880 --> 20:39.640
Let's see, the Machine God's Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th and there's

20:39.640 --> 20:44.520
also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in

20:44.520 --> 20:46.640
the summer.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.400
They said downloads, though.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.360
That's not really new cards, though.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.960
I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.440
So how does this affect the bet?

20:57.440 --> 21:01.760
I don't think it affects anything, because it's not actually selling anything.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.080
Download content does not count.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.740
But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of

21:06.740 --> 21:11.180
Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?

21:11.180 --> 21:16.680
If there's an expansion disc that comes, you know, including cards, obviously, because

21:16.680 --> 21:20.120
I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.

21:20.120 --> 21:27.080
But right now, and that's even kind of being a little generous, because seriously, I mean,

21:27.080 --> 21:28.080
I don't know.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.240
I think you want to wear that tingle outfit a little bit.

21:29.240 --> 21:33.460
I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.320
It will never sell one million units.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.320
Ever.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.320
Ever.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.760
Even with expansions that are retail.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
Retail expansions.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.320
But download expansions, we couldn't really track anyway.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.320
Exactly.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.320
Tony doesn't release those numbers.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.360
I'm not counting like fucking booster packs and shit like that, because that's just stuff

21:47.360 --> 21:48.360
that we can't track.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.360
All right.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.120
You know, seriously, just if it's going to be sold like, you know, Warhawk or something

21:53.120 --> 21:57.520
like that, where it's download content, and it's also, you know, sold as a retail disc,

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
then yeah, we'll count that.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.160
But if it's like a fucking, you know, booster pack or some shit that they come out later

22:02.160 --> 22:03.680
on, no, I'm sorry, that does not count.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.440
Because they'll come out with one million booster packs.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.000
Well no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that

22:10.000 --> 22:13.400
they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
That's stupid.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
That's cheating.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
That's not really a game.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.680
We don't count, you know, the download content.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.760
All right, well at least we have the bet clarified.

22:19.760 --> 22:24.600
You have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover US sales,

22:24.600 --> 22:27.200
but you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.

22:27.200 --> 22:31.680
Yeah, and also it was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for

22:31.680 --> 22:32.680
eternity, so.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.520
All right, and SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession

22:37.520 --> 22:38.520
behind us.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.520
That might be a good point.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.520
No.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.520
Just to let this joke die.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.520
No, I'm not wearing it.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.520
All right.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.520
I'm very confident.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.480
If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.

22:46.480 --> 22:51.840
I am very confident that this will never sell a million units, because it's the stupidest

22:51.840 --> 22:56.160
thing I've ever seen, until they come out with something else that's even more retarded,

22:56.160 --> 22:58.920
but right now it's pretty retarded.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.760
All right.

23:01.760 --> 23:06.760
Do you, now a good point brought up in chat here, Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly

23:06.760 --> 23:07.840
buying Eye of Judgment.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.960
Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
Why?

23:10.960 --> 23:13.080
I don't play card games, and no.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
That's a no.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.080
Just say no.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.800
For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was

23:19.800 --> 23:23.720
like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we converted it on the show anyways,

23:23.720 --> 23:25.960
but I'm like, nah.

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
I'm not doing that.

23:26.960 --> 23:31.120
You could just use your credit and get something good.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.720
Why waste it?

23:32.720 --> 23:36.640
Darkknight is in chat, DJ Darkknight says, get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
suit.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.840
She's not going to make me dress up.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.240
That's stupid.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.300
All right, let's move on.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.320
Let's put this obsession behind us, shall we?

23:47.320 --> 23:51.640
And talking about the PlayStation 3 a little more, Sony of Japan is going to discontinue

23:51.640 --> 23:53.680
certain models of the PlayStation 3.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.880
That would be the 20 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte models, and that's going to be discontinued

23:57.880 --> 24:00.880
after one last shipment at the end of this month.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.880
Sony will instead be focusing on the 40 gigabyte model.

24:04.880 --> 24:08.500
The 40 gigabyte model, of course, is 40 gigabytes, whereas the other one was a little smaller

24:08.500 --> 24:09.560
and a little larger.

24:09.560 --> 24:14.320
But the other big change, oh yeah, it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility, which obviously

24:14.320 --> 24:17.280
makes it a lot cheaper to produce.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.400
So that's where they're headed in Japan.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.200
Obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards

24:23.200 --> 24:24.200
compatibility.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.400
In Europe, well, shit, they never really had it.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.640
But at least our main model is 80 gigabytes.

24:29.640 --> 24:34.000
Of course, what I'm going to put on that PlayStation 3 on all that hard drive space, I'm not quite

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
sure yet.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Porn.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I guess porn.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.640
I got a new hard drive this week, actually.

24:38.640 --> 24:43.420
Like you, I have one of those little external drives now, because that's kind of the rage

24:43.420 --> 24:47.560
right now, those external, like, what are they called?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.160
The gigabooks or something?

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
I don't know what the hell they're called.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
Travel books or whatever.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.720
Well, William had one from his work he wasn't even using, and he's moving right now, and

24:54.720 --> 24:55.720
he's like, you want this?

24:55.720 --> 24:58.080
I'm like, sweet, porn drive!

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
Yoink.

24:59.080 --> 25:05.480
I used mine when my computer was starting to die, when my Vio was, the Franken-Vio,

25:05.480 --> 25:07.760
I should call it, was about to go.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.320
So it's good for backing up stuff.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.320
Yeah.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.320
And porn.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.320
I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.000
For porn.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.960
For Doctor Who episodes.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.640
By the way, on YouTube, okay, here's how bored I was on YouTube the other night.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.640
Like, I ended up watching an episode of The Weakest Link that had a bunch of Doctor Who

25:24.640 --> 25:25.640
people on it.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
It was like a Doctor Who special.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
Oh, I want to see that one!

25:27.640 --> 25:28.720
I've watched some of it.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
It's all on YouTube.

25:29.720 --> 25:35.200
Because, yeah, it was all of the people from the second season, I think.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.840
Yeah, I want to see that.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
Hey, Jamie.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
Games.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
Whatever.

25:39.840 --> 25:48.000
Well, hey, guess who they're getting in Japan?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.080
I could be a lot of things.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.080
What?

25:50.080 --> 25:54.920
They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.

25:54.920 --> 25:59.560
Like, they need another color for a video game system.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
Why mint green?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
Well, look at the DS.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.840
It works for the DS.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
Why not the PSP?

26:03.840 --> 26:04.840
I guess so.

26:04.840 --> 26:08.800
Maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envious.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.800
Why mint green of all colors?

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
I don't know.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.920
Why not, you know, pink and red for Valentine's Day?

26:14.920 --> 26:16.680
They made a Sakura one.

26:16.680 --> 26:23.000
Well, a Sakura PS2 that I wanted that was metallic purple, and I was like, Cherry Blossom's

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
pink.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Why did you make it pink?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
No, it's metallic purple.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Okay, fine.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.240
I just wanted it for the name.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.920
Maybe there was a surplus of purple paint in the Sony factory, and maybe that's what

26:32.920 --> 26:33.920
it is.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.820
The Sony factory, they have certain excess paint supplies.

26:36.820 --> 26:41.400
They have some green left and they have some white left, and it's like, screw it, mix it,

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
paint some PSPs.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.400
All right.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.120
We'll call it mint green.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.920
And call it run out of color green.

26:47.920 --> 26:51.320
You should put it out in, like, Ireland.

26:51.320 --> 26:57.520
Mint green, like an Olive Garden mint, which, by the way, made good on the promise.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.520
We did.

26:58.520 --> 27:04.600
We went to Olive Garden, and I had, what did I have, Seafood Alfredo.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.920
Yes, and lots of never-ending breadsticks.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.120
I know, and that really good meatball soup.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.000
Yes, anyway, sorry.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.400
Games, right?

27:12.400 --> 27:13.400
Games.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.400
Yeah.

27:14.400 --> 27:20.080
So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming

27:20.080 --> 27:22.920
to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.

27:22.920 --> 27:26.600
Well, people were wondering why not the original PSP.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
What the hell?

27:27.600 --> 27:32.500
The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more

27:32.500 --> 27:33.500
RAM in it.

27:33.500 --> 27:40.680
So, being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, is the only system able to

27:40.680 --> 27:43.260
handle Skype, apparently.

27:43.260 --> 27:47.400
Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
as Skype.

27:48.400 --> 27:55.040
I don't know of one that they're working on right now, so, oh well, no Skype for you.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.320
Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.360
Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.160
But then again, who am I really going to call on Skype?

28:04.160 --> 28:08.720
I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.

28:08.720 --> 28:13.360
It's just very inconvenient anyways, I mean seriously, you have to have, I think you have

28:13.360 --> 28:17.000
to buy Skype for this, I don't know if it's going to be free, it may be free to use, but

28:17.000 --> 28:19.360
I think you have to buy the software for it.

28:19.360 --> 28:25.320
And then, once you've done that, you have to have a Wi-Fi spot and stuff, it's just

28:25.320 --> 28:28.120
like, shit, once you've already got all that stuff, might as well just use your computer

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
to do it.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.440
Or just fucking call them on the phone.

28:30.440 --> 28:34.020
Yeah, but you know, I'm hearing from more and more people who are interacting with this

28:34.020 --> 28:35.880
program on a PSP.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.400
So you know, PSPs are basically becoming little mini computers that you have in your pocket.

28:40.400 --> 28:46.120
You know, people take their PSP to Starbucks and they'll be sipping on a coffee, studying

28:46.120 --> 28:51.720
for math class or something, and listening to our show, so that's kind of crazy.

28:51.720 --> 28:57.160
So PSPs are kind of mini computers at this point.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.120
PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.520
Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not, but

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
one thing that is...

29:03.520 --> 29:06.560
It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.

29:06.560 --> 29:11.720
There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3 is that the cross-media

29:11.720 --> 29:16.960
bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.880
Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I

29:19.880 --> 29:24.760
believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the

29:24.760 --> 29:27.520
game, but that was something that the developers had to do.

29:27.520 --> 29:31.920
There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar

29:31.920 --> 29:34.440
to show up within a game.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.780
And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every

29:38.780 --> 29:42.480
game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that

29:42.480 --> 29:45.520
the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.160
Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.

29:48.160 --> 29:56.960
Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.

29:56.960 --> 30:02.360
However there was no news at CES, they instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales

30:02.360 --> 30:05.920
or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.800
Soon is the magic word, isn't it?

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
Of course.

30:09.800 --> 30:17.080
Well, there is a little confirmation that it should make some people happy, and that

30:17.080 --> 30:19.160
is about LittleBigPlanet.

30:19.160 --> 30:25.040
It will be out in September, at least that's what Sony's saying, but you know, it's September

30:25.040 --> 30:30.560
and not September X date, it's September, which is some time.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.040
And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.040
Yes.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.960
It changed because Consumer Electronics Show, it seems like we're getting slightly more

30:38.960 --> 30:44.480
gaming news out of CES this year, I use that word slightly, because usually CES is not

30:44.480 --> 30:45.480
for games.

30:45.480 --> 30:55.080
It's not a game show, it's a kitchenware, and 150,000 foot TVs, and all the George Foreman

30:55.080 --> 30:56.080
grilling machines.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.640
And robots to waltz with.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.080
Yes exactly, and all that stuff, that's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show, you

31:01.080 --> 31:02.080
don't see a lot of games.

31:02.080 --> 31:07.080
But I feel like this year, at least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit

31:07.080 --> 31:08.080
more gaming news.

31:08.080 --> 31:12.960
I'm not saying we never got gaming news out of CES, but I feel like we got a little more

31:12.960 --> 31:18.160
this year, and I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be, or what

31:18.160 --> 31:21.080
the heck that's about, but I just thought that was interesting.

31:21.080 --> 31:26.960
I'm not reading too much into that, I just thought it was interesting, that's all.

31:26.960 --> 31:32.200
And then freakin' Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft Keynote, I

31:32.200 --> 31:35.880
mean that was kind of interesting.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.480
The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlant is coming out in September,

31:39.480 --> 31:42.960
I mean wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
And now it's like, oh I'm sorry.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
Another Sony delay?

31:45.960 --> 31:46.960
You don't say.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.960
I know, it's crazy.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.680
And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out, seriously, they keep advertising this

31:51.680 --> 31:55.680
shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid

31:55.680 --> 32:01.000
4, all these games that are out now, Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games

32:01.000 --> 32:05.280
are out yet, and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy Playstation 3, good

32:05.280 --> 32:07.520
stuff will be coming someday.

32:07.520 --> 32:12.240
I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.080
That's the problem though, even though they take their time on getting the product out,

32:16.080 --> 32:19.260
it's still just average.

32:19.260 --> 32:23.080
They can delay it all they want, it'll still be kind of eh.

32:23.080 --> 32:27.500
I agree to an extent, I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think

32:27.500 --> 32:30.400
they should never have launched the damn console when they did, I think they should have just

32:30.400 --> 32:34.680
sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.

32:34.680 --> 32:39.940
Well it's just like LittleBigPlanet, granted it's something that's pretty ambitious, but

32:39.940 --> 32:45.220
don't fucking show this shit off like, oh it's coming out this fall, get everybody excited,

32:45.220 --> 32:49.220
And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall, it's coming out this spring, or, okay,

32:49.220 --> 32:52.440
great, spring comes along, oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring, it's coming

32:52.440 --> 32:53.440
out in September.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.440
You know, it's...

32:54.440 --> 32:55.440
Okay.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
You can do them forever.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.680
And Akuta in our chat room at chat.ornisontisradio.com brings up a good point.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.380
Wasn't Super Smash Brothers Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?

33:05.380 --> 33:07.160
So is Sony the only bad guys here?

33:07.160 --> 33:08.160
No, they're not.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.800
And, you know, Nintendo's just as guilty for doing that kind of stuff.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.320
Hyping up a game, you know, that's supposed to be coming out at some point, and then ends

33:15.320 --> 33:18.960
up getting delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and...

33:18.960 --> 33:20.820
And basically you all ruined Christmas.

33:20.820 --> 33:22.160
But here's the thing, though.

33:22.160 --> 33:27.160
Even still, so that they delay that one game, though, there's still other stuff coming out

33:27.160 --> 33:28.160
that's good.

33:28.160 --> 33:33.520
Whereas, you know, the PlayStation 3, a lot of their stuff is being delayed, and it's

33:33.520 --> 33:37.240
not just one game, because one game, big deal, okay, so that gets delayed.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.680
It's a lot of games being delayed, and it's consistent.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.320
So that's the only thing that sucks.

33:42.320 --> 33:47.440
And for anyone that just owns a PlayStation 3, you know, I'd be kind of disappointed.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.200
I'd be pissed off if I owned just a PlayStation 3, because, you know, all these good games

33:51.200 --> 33:55.240
come out for the 360, and then I have to wait months for the same thing to come out on the

33:55.240 --> 33:56.240
PS3.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.720
I don't know.

33:57.720 --> 33:58.720
It's kind of unfair.

33:58.720 --> 34:03.000
All right, well what else is Sony teasing for us?

34:03.000 --> 34:07.760
Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games

34:07.760 --> 34:08.760
on the system.

34:08.760 --> 34:14.040
I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun, one of my favorite games on the

34:14.040 --> 34:18.400
system, one of the few that I still own, because I love it so much.

34:18.400 --> 34:24.040
Well this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60 player online death matches, which

34:24.040 --> 34:30.720
is fucking crazy, eight player co-op, and two campaigns, one which is supposed to be

34:30.720 --> 34:35.400
an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just, you know, standard single player

34:35.400 --> 34:36.400
campaign.

34:36.400 --> 34:42.280
60 player multiplayer matches, god I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.

34:42.280 --> 34:48.920
Well from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48 player multiplayer death

34:48.920 --> 34:49.920
matches.

34:49.920 --> 34:54.560
So, you know, it's not so bad, and you have to remember though, not each one of these

34:54.560 --> 34:59.880
PlayStation 3 consoles ships with a microphone, you have to buy that, you know, separately.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.880
That's good.

35:00.880 --> 35:06.520
So, they should make a new shooting game called The Right to Speak, and basically players

35:06.520 --> 35:09.200
shoot each other to earn the right to speak into the microphone.

35:09.200 --> 35:14.720
That would be funny, that should be just a mode in the game.

35:14.720 --> 35:18.200
And there should be something where like if somebody is completely being a jerk, then

35:18.200 --> 35:23.080
like everybody can like target that person and, you know, obliterate them to smithereens

35:23.080 --> 35:25.640
and they lose the right to speak.

35:25.640 --> 35:26.640
I like it.

35:26.640 --> 35:30.500
Patent pending, that means I own all the rights to it, and if you try to put this in your

35:30.500 --> 35:31.880
game, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.640
If you want more information though on Resistance 2, it's supposed to be in the new issue of

35:35.640 --> 35:36.640
Game Informer.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.640
Alrighty.

35:37.640 --> 35:43.400
Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier, how it's becoming more and more

35:43.400 --> 35:44.400
like a computer.

35:44.400 --> 35:49.960
Well, there's one thing the PSP is sorely lacking, and that is a keyboard for now.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.780
That's right, there is a PSP apparently.

35:53.780 --> 35:57.960
It's something that Sony is actually developing themselves, first party.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.720
It is, you know, consider it a rumor for right now, but it was something that GameSpot reported

36:01.720 --> 36:03.240
on, so who knows.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.960
It's supposed to arrive in the middle of 2009.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.880
It's fucking lame.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.880
It's a long ways out.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.880
No, seriously, it's lame.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.760
Homebrew has already had, you know, keyboard support for a long time.

36:12.760 --> 36:18.300
It has a damn IR port on it, so you can use keyboards that are meant for PDAs.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.800
Why the hell is it going to take them so long to develop a USB keyboard?

36:20.800 --> 36:24.060
I mean, seriously, it's not that hard.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.060
It's a keyboard.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.060
You know why?

36:26.060 --> 36:28.640
It's probably something that they want, it's a time thing.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.920
They want to put it out in 2009 for a reason.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.680
They're going to add something that you're going to want to have this keyboard for in

36:34.680 --> 36:35.680
2009.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.680
Hey, look, now you don't.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.160
Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.160
Ah, lame.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.920
It's a time thing.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
Just you wait.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
It's still lame.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.360
You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.960
Why wait?

36:48.960 --> 36:53.520
Because then, if you wait, then you put this thing out, nobody buys it because there's

36:53.520 --> 36:57.200
nothing to use it for, so retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first

36:57.200 --> 36:58.200
place?

36:58.200 --> 37:00.600
Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.600
I still think it's stupid.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.240
It's not going to sell anyways if it's AIM.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.120
That's stupid.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.120
It's kind of like, you know what?

37:07.120 --> 37:12.460
I would almost blame that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the

37:12.460 --> 37:13.460
GameCube.

37:13.460 --> 37:14.460
What do they call it?

37:14.460 --> 37:15.760
The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.520
There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody

37:19.520 --> 37:21.220
could get into at the time.

37:21.220 --> 37:22.720
So where did those things end up?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.760
In the bargain bins, developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them

37:25.760 --> 37:26.760
are out there.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.760
It was kind of like a damning cycle.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.560
What should have happened is that at that time, Nintendo should have come out and said,

37:32.560 --> 37:36.720
we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.

37:36.720 --> 37:41.360
F-Zero is going to support the, you know, how awesome would an F-Zero GX have been if

37:41.360 --> 37:43.520
it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?

37:43.520 --> 37:47.360
Like a completely different kind of game than PSO, right?

37:47.360 --> 37:50.360
I can't see Nintendo putting an online game.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.360
I know.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.840
I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
I don't know.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.240
I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.

37:57.240 --> 38:03.320
Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking

38:03.320 --> 38:04.320
off that.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.000
I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really

38:07.000 --> 38:11.080
a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online

38:11.080 --> 38:12.080
thing.

38:12.080 --> 38:16.200
I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
for the PSP.

38:17.200 --> 38:24.200
They've already got Java stuff that works for it, I mean, it works on cell phones.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.200
What the hell's taken them so long?

38:25.200 --> 38:28.680
I mean, seriously, this system's been out for a few years now.

38:28.680 --> 38:32.100
I don't understand why there would be these two-year delays for this shit.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.100
They're playing Eye of Judgment.

38:33.100 --> 38:36.680
Yeah, they're too busy playing Eye of Judgment, exactly.

38:36.680 --> 38:41.800
Well, this is a happy rumor, although, you know, it's also said that we might be getting

38:41.800 --> 38:49.080
Parappa 2, but, you know, hey, they're talking about putting Vibribin out for the European

38:49.080 --> 38:50.080
PSN.

38:50.080 --> 38:55.060
I think that's pretty cool, although, you know, they also, like I said, mentioned Parappa

38:55.060 --> 38:58.840
as well, but has that happened?

38:58.840 --> 38:59.840
No.

38:59.840 --> 39:06.480
So, but hey, Vibribin's great for anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what Vibribin

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
is.

39:07.480 --> 39:16.120
It's a vector-animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.080
I have some mood-setting music.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.080
Okay.

39:19.080 --> 39:28.120
It had, I think, like eight tracks or something, this is one of them built into the game.

39:28.120 --> 39:35.040
And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.120
And the way that you play the game is you, you know, you start the game and you can actually

39:39.120 --> 39:40.120
put in your own CDs.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.480
And we tried to do it to, what did we call it?

39:44.480 --> 39:46.360
TDR music, like Max 300 and stuff.

39:46.360 --> 39:52.360
Yeah, we tried to do it to, what did we call it, oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania,

39:52.360 --> 39:53.360
yeah.

39:53.360 --> 39:57.080
We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300, and we tried to pick as

39:57.080 --> 40:01.600
many fast and retarded stuff as we could, and did it end up being, like, some Polteri

40:01.600 --> 40:03.080
song that was really hard instead?

40:03.080 --> 40:06.120
I think it was colors.

40:06.120 --> 40:12.320
The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, you

40:12.320 --> 40:14.880
know, designing your own levels with your own music.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.600
But it was kind of cool, nevertheless.

40:16.600 --> 40:21.880
And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.

40:21.880 --> 40:22.880
It was pretty cool.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.800
And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.760
And I hope it comes out.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.120
I want it over here, though.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.760
GS68 has a brilliant idea.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.320
You can play that game with Dragon Force now.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.320
You know what I could do?

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
What?

40:37.320 --> 40:40.440
I could do that, because I have VibRibbon.

40:40.440 --> 40:45.440
I saw a copy of VibRibbon sitting at Network Video, may you rest in peace.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.100
That's what we need to do for our little piece.

40:47.100 --> 40:50.360
I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force, so

40:50.360 --> 40:52.020
we need to make that happen with VibRibbon.

40:52.020 --> 40:53.960
So you need to dust off your copy, because we're going to be doing that.

40:53.960 --> 40:54.960
I found it.

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
Good.

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
I found my copy.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
Get that ready.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
More like Dance Factory.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.440
I picked up VibRibbon for 40 bucks, and I got an original, and I've never regretted

41:01.440 --> 41:02.440
it.

41:02.440 --> 41:03.440
Awesome.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
Awesome.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.080
Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.080
Probably.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.080
Alright.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.080
Sucka.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
Although, I could just pop it in my PS2.

41:11.080 --> 41:19.240
This is the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet, because we found the cartridge

41:19.240 --> 41:24.600
and our Super Nintendo, so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing, okay?

41:24.600 --> 41:25.600
Alright.

41:25.600 --> 41:29.860
Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff, not online, but stuff you can actually

41:29.860 --> 41:31.080
walk into a store and buy.

41:31.080 --> 41:36.080
Yes, in the US, it's the smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy,

41:36.080 --> 41:43.040
most of which is the latter, including Kid Sports Ice Hockey for the Wii, yet another

41:43.040 --> 41:50.920
game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good, FlatOut Head On on the PSP,

41:50.920 --> 41:56.540
that's a FlatOut 2 port, so that should be pretty fun, History Channel Lost Worlds on

41:56.540 --> 42:02.140
the PC, Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii, which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails

42:02.140 --> 42:14.360
samurai game, Furu Furu Park on the Wii, only $20, a bunch of little mini games by Majesco,

42:14.360 --> 42:20.240
Miami Nights Singles in the City for the DS, I don't know if it's any better than Sprung,

42:20.240 --> 42:25.480
but I guess we'll have to see, Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose

42:25.480 --> 42:31.760
to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike 64, and it's kind of the same

42:31.760 --> 42:38.280
thing, it's bikes with rockets on them, and then The Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and The

42:38.280 --> 42:48.760
Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out, Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to

42:48.760 --> 43:00.400
$30, and finally, let's see here, Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle,

43:00.400 --> 43:05.160
and that's coming out as well, enough pirate games, enough, I was going to say though there

43:05.160 --> 43:09.440
is something kind of funny that's coming out next week, also happens to be by Destineer

43:09.440 --> 43:19.520
though, Kawasaki Jet Ski, this one looks almost identical to Waveray 64, so that might be

43:19.520 --> 43:22.240
pretty cool, and that's it.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.440
Alright then let's head on over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there in

43:25.440 --> 43:31.160
Japan, not a lot sadly, but if you have an Xbox 360 in Japan, you're one of the few,

43:31.160 --> 43:36.840
you have Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights to look forward to, which comes out on January 17th,

43:36.840 --> 43:41.400
going over to other systems on the Playstation 3, Juiced 2 for some reason comes out a week

43:41.400 --> 43:46.480
later, go figure, it comes out the week of January 24th, I guess Juiced takes longer

43:46.480 --> 43:50.660
to produce for Sony Systems, I couldn't tell you, on the Nintendo Wii things look a little

43:50.660 --> 43:56.720
better because you get Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th, and Sonic Riders Shooting

43:56.720 --> 43:59.240
Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

43:59.240 --> 44:03.320
Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking

44:03.320 --> 44:06.000
at the patient with a knife?

44:06.000 --> 44:09.680
You know what, Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007, like it was

44:09.680 --> 44:13.800
on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not had the time amongst all

44:13.800 --> 44:17.900
the other games that came out, but I will get to that very soon.

44:17.900 --> 44:22.640
Also on the Playstation 2 this week, you get Juiced 2, but you get a game called Lucky

44:22.640 --> 44:28.800
Star comes out this week, Lucky Star looks to be probably based off another anime, it's

44:28.800 --> 44:34.640
an adventure game, and that's really all I know, except there's two chicks holding hands

44:34.640 --> 44:39.440
on the front cover, but one's an angel, so I don't think it's Lesbians or anything like

44:39.440 --> 44:41.700
that.

44:41.700 --> 44:45.120
That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?

44:45.120 --> 44:51.120
Oh shit I fucked up, Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week, don't, sorry.

44:51.120 --> 44:55.180
You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star which is

44:55.180 --> 45:00.160
also released next week, however this week you can get a game called School Days, School

45:00.160 --> 45:05.520
Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kinda

45:05.520 --> 45:10.160
arm in arm like they're BFFs, and they're wearing school girl uniforms so you know this

45:10.160 --> 45:14.360
will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe.

45:14.360 --> 45:20.000
Moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, a game called From the Abyss makes its

45:20.000 --> 45:23.680
way to the Nintendo DS, and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think

45:23.680 --> 45:26.840
this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS, oh I guess it is, there's the box art and

45:26.840 --> 45:31.160
stuff, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS, I always thought

45:31.160 --> 45:35.080
that was a Wii only game, go figure, that comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in

45:35.080 --> 45:42.600
Japan, and lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing, nothing for the PSP, but you have a price

45:42.600 --> 45:46.880
reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week, so there you have it, your Japanese

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
release dates.

45:47.880 --> 45:56.520
Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe, we have Balls of Fury, that's great.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.240
That's based off a movie that didn't do very well.

45:59.240 --> 46:07.160
Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Night's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost

46:07.160 --> 46:13.560
picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team

46:13.560 --> 46:22.400
in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure, and that's it.

46:22.400 --> 46:27.560
I just say save your money, well get nights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles

46:27.560 --> 46:30.760
later that month.

46:30.760 --> 46:34.320
You know, I will never understand our chat room in the way they think sometimes, because

46:34.320 --> 46:36.760
you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?

46:36.760 --> 46:43.240
So SSG100Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup, dating sim for DS, or now, you know,

46:43.240 --> 46:48.760
two girls, one cup is now 2007, but now you have, you know, because obviously something

46:48.760 --> 46:53.740
much more hardcore came out apparently recently, and Cory31 suggests that four girls finger

46:53.740 --> 46:58.600
paint would make a good DS Wii game.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.880
Sick!

47:00.880 --> 47:03.840
Gotta keep up on the internet, you all are sick!

47:03.840 --> 47:08.860
There you go, BlackWolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better, absolutely.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.860
Date Dragon Force, the game.

47:09.860 --> 47:10.860
You know what I want?

47:10.860 --> 47:14.440
They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.

47:14.440 --> 47:15.440
Really?

47:15.440 --> 47:17.840
Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.

47:17.840 --> 47:22.920
Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.

47:22.920 --> 47:28.920
Alright, well it was announced this week that two secret characters are going to be coming

47:28.920 --> 47:33.640
to Soul Calibur IV, although I don't really know how an announcement makes it secret,

47:33.640 --> 47:39.680
but anyways, Darth Vader and Yoda are coming to Soul Calibur IV.

47:39.680 --> 47:45.480
The only bad thing about it is, one is coming to each version, so if you get the Playstation

47:45.480 --> 47:49.840
3 version, you happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.

47:49.840 --> 47:53.040
If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.

47:53.040 --> 47:57.080
I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.440
Cue all the Xbox fans going, noooooo!

47:59.440 --> 48:02.880
Hey, I can't get them both!

48:02.880 --> 48:03.880
Exactly!

48:03.880 --> 48:04.880
Why?

48:04.880 --> 48:05.880
Why?

48:05.880 --> 48:06.880
Why would you buy them both?

48:06.880 --> 48:07.880
That is exactly why they did this shit.

48:07.880 --> 48:08.880
That was sarcasm, by the way.

48:08.880 --> 48:09.880
Okay, thank god.

48:09.880 --> 48:10.880
But it's also going to come over there and beat you.

48:10.880 --> 48:14.880
But I'm going to get the PS3 version.

48:14.880 --> 48:19.280
Well, yeah, but this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off

48:19.280 --> 48:24.240
of Soul Calibur IV, they went back and based it off of Soul Calibur II.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.520
A balanced version.

48:25.520 --> 48:30.320
Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?

48:30.320 --> 48:33.360
It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur II.

48:33.360 --> 48:37.080
Yeah, but I don't have a problem with, you know, Link not being on the Playstation, because

48:37.080 --> 48:38.220
that doesn't make any sense.

48:38.220 --> 48:43.200
Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a Playstation or something like

48:43.200 --> 48:44.820
that?

48:44.820 --> 48:48.500
This they're, you know, not really specific to any console.

48:48.500 --> 48:51.840
It's not like you have the Darth Vader game on the Playstation 3 or anything like that.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.560
It's just fucking lazy is what it is.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.560
What happened to Blu-ray?

48:54.560 --> 48:56.960
I thought Blu-ray can hold all this, like, data and stuff.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.680
Why can't you fit Yoda on there?

48:58.680 --> 49:02.480
It's just being, you're just being an asshole is what you're being.

49:02.480 --> 49:06.760
And to be honest, I'd rather have the Playstation 3 version with Darth Vader, and I'm sure Sony

49:06.760 --> 49:08.800
paid money to have, you know, Darth Vader on there.

49:08.800 --> 49:13.100
I will buy the Xbox 360 version because I love Soul Calibur, and you know what?

49:13.100 --> 49:16.520
You know why else I don't care which of these versions I pick up?

49:16.520 --> 49:20.120
Because Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!

49:20.120 --> 49:21.600
Why did that happen in the first place?

49:21.600 --> 49:22.600
That is stupid.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.160
Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts to have a crazy-looking

49:26.160 --> 49:27.160
Yoda.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.160
It looks stupid.

49:28.160 --> 49:31.560
I looked at the screenshots of, like, Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever, and I'm just

49:31.560 --> 49:35.160
going like, I just rolled my eyes, I'm like, this looks dumb.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.880
This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.

49:37.880 --> 49:41.080
No, no, no, did you hear what their original intent was?

49:41.080 --> 49:46.040
The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fight

49:46.040 --> 49:47.040
characters.

49:47.040 --> 49:51.440
Oh my god, he's going to ruin his own franchise.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.720
He said that would have been his pick, but apparently someone-

49:53.720 --> 49:54.720
What's next?

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
Klonoa?

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
Apparently-

49:56.720 --> 49:57.720
Klonoa would be awesome, though.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.720
Screw you!

49:58.720 --> 49:59.720
Hey, I like-

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
Apparently someone beat with that.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.480
Klonoa is one of my favorite games ever.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.520
I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.

50:05.520 --> 50:08.240
I thought it was cool to have Link in it.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.680
Link made sense.

50:09.680 --> 50:15.280
Link also a swordsy and, you know, is swords and sorcery type of character.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
Ha-Hachi?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.440
Okay, I can, we'll let that one slide, that makes sense.

50:18.440 --> 50:22.560
How long have they had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?

50:22.560 --> 50:23.560
Well Yoshi-

50:23.560 --> 50:25.600
Is they the Soul Calibur character forever?

50:25.600 --> 50:27.480
At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.360
Oh, it just doesn't, it doesn't fit.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.360
Ha-Hachi has a diaper.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.360
You know what they're doing?

50:31.360 --> 50:34.560
They're fucking, they're fucking this over like they would Tekken, where they just start

50:34.560 --> 50:36.840
putting all this ridiculous shit in there.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.720
Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears and-

50:39.720 --> 50:42.320
Okay, Tekken has always been that way though.

50:42.320 --> 50:46.820
Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken because they can.

50:46.820 --> 50:49.800
And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb too.

50:49.800 --> 50:50.800
Exactly.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.640
Well actually, I don't know, a panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.

50:53.640 --> 51:01.040
Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in, oh my god.

51:01.040 --> 51:03.200
No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?

51:03.200 --> 51:04.200
Yes!

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
That's what I thought.

51:05.200 --> 51:10.160
Devil and Angel and everybody and the gold band just says, secret character, your mom.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.600
Last night, Devil Jin was awesome by the way.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.440
Do not ever poop on Devil Jin.

51:16.440 --> 51:21.000
I would not, I would not be surprised if we saw a Soul Calibur versus Tekken game.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.200
Ooh, I'd buy it.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.320
That actually would kind of rock.

51:23.320 --> 51:28.800
I don't know why, like I'm being a total hypocrite, but I don't care because that idea is actually

51:28.800 --> 51:29.800
kind of cool to me.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.880
But here's the other thing, okay, when I look at this and I see the Star Wars characters,

51:32.880 --> 51:38.440
I'm like, why doesn't Namco just like do an all Star Wars fighting game?

51:38.440 --> 51:42.520
Now I know, now before the chat room jumps, I know there already was one like back on

51:42.520 --> 51:45.600
the Playstation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.600
Like not a lot of people remember.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.240
Because you made a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
game.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
Exactly.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.440
You can, I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.200
Star Wars, there were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?

51:56.200 --> 51:57.800
These games have been coming out forever.

51:57.800 --> 52:02.240
So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know like using the

52:02.240 --> 52:06.680
Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.

52:06.680 --> 52:08.280
That would be all kinds of awesome.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.960
I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.

52:10.960 --> 52:11.960
That would be kind of awesome.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.960
Because I love Soul Calibur.

52:13.960 --> 52:17.060
Somebody in my life journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really

52:17.060 --> 52:18.320
like other fighting games.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
It's true.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.680
I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.

52:20.680 --> 52:24.240
I liked Gon from Tekken 3, and that's about it.

52:24.240 --> 52:29.480
Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.

52:29.480 --> 52:34.760
Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.560
And you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2?

52:36.560 --> 52:40.240
It's the crappy spinoff games happening too, like the Legends game.

52:40.240 --> 52:44.680
Like what's her, oh god, what's her name from Tekken got her own spinoff game?

52:44.680 --> 52:45.680
Death by degree.

52:45.680 --> 52:47.560
Death by playing this game.

52:47.560 --> 52:51.120
Here's the thing that really sucks about that whole Soul Calibur game, other than the fact

52:51.120 --> 52:53.120
that it was just crap.

52:53.120 --> 52:56.200
I don't understand why they couldn't do a fighting game on, you know, the Wii.

52:56.200 --> 53:00.680
In fact, I remember seeing someone comment on why don't they just take the engine from

53:00.680 --> 53:07.160
Soul Calibur 2 for the GameCube and just port it over to the Wii, maybe update the graphics

53:07.160 --> 53:10.320
a little bit, and put new characters in it.

53:10.320 --> 53:14.400
Or add some of the characters from Soul Calibur 4 and you can have its own series on the Wii

53:14.400 --> 53:19.120
that maybe not as pretty, but still just as effective.

53:19.120 --> 53:23.280
RossdielUT in chat says, Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.

53:23.280 --> 53:26.320
Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.

53:26.320 --> 53:32.320
Like I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game

53:32.320 --> 53:38.520
with massive boobage, and this game will move a zillion copies on the first day.

53:38.520 --> 53:40.440
Just you wait.

53:40.440 --> 53:42.600
Mark my words.

53:42.600 --> 53:51.400
Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Taras Kasi, leave it to slumber in its grave,

53:51.400 --> 53:57.000
no zombie apocalypse.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.600
Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords, they will cut

54:01.600 --> 54:02.600
through them.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.960
In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.

54:03.960 --> 54:06.800
Oh I'm sorry, let me read that the way it should have been read.

54:06.800 --> 54:10.960
I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

54:10.960 --> 54:14.480
I mean, come on.

54:14.480 --> 54:17.880
It's a video game dude, seriously.

54:17.880 --> 54:18.880
Just giving you a hard time.

54:18.880 --> 54:24.120
I'm trying to apply real world physics, and why am I even calling the Star Wars universe

54:24.120 --> 54:25.120
real world physics?

54:25.120 --> 54:26.480
Did you just say Jedi physics?

54:26.480 --> 54:28.360
No, real world physics.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.360
Oh sorry.

54:29.360 --> 54:30.360
Not Jedi physics.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.080
That would make me even more retarded.

54:33.080 --> 54:36.440
Seriously, who cares, it's just a fucking game.

54:36.440 --> 54:40.760
They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.880
What they do need though, they need to get some Star Trek characters.

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
I want to see Kirk.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.680
That's right, Kirk vs Picard, let's settle this shit right now.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.880
That would be funny, I would love to see that.

54:50.880 --> 54:54.080
I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.680
It's done up like one of those motivational posters.

54:56.680 --> 55:00.680
It's a picture of Kirk just grinning, and it says, I'm sorry I can't hear you over the

55:00.680 --> 55:02.440
sound of how awesome I am.

55:02.440 --> 55:07.440
I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it, like Kirk, I want to see

55:07.440 --> 55:11.800
Adam West playing Adam West, and you know, just weird shit like that.

55:11.800 --> 55:12.800
Loki Fighter 2008?

55:12.800 --> 55:13.800
Hell yeah.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.800
There you go.

55:14.800 --> 55:22.040
All right, Black Wolf says, the Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields

55:22.040 --> 55:23.040
down to 85%.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.420
I'm sorry, let me reread that.

55:25.420 --> 55:31.720
The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.680
Please let's change the topic, pretty please.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.760
It's my turn, it sure is.

55:35.760 --> 55:41.520
Microsoft has made a comment about Xbox 360 backwards compatibility.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.560
It was Albert Piniello, the group marketing manager for the Xbox 360, he said this to

55:46.560 --> 55:51.200
Kotaku earlier in the week, quote, I don't know if we have plans to do any more releases

55:51.200 --> 55:56.280
in regards to backwards compatibility, quote, it feels like we kind of hit the point of

55:56.280 --> 55:58.240
diminishing returns there.

55:58.240 --> 56:02.180
So in other words, if you were hoping for more games to become backwards compatible,

56:02.180 --> 56:05.000
you can just keep on hoping.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.860
And of course, everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible,

56:08.860 --> 56:11.480
but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.960
Buy new games.

56:12.960 --> 56:16.480
Or better yet, don't sell off your old system.

56:16.480 --> 56:17.480
There you go.

56:17.480 --> 56:18.480
Problem solved.

56:18.480 --> 56:23.600
I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah, but especially in light of now that

56:23.600 --> 56:28.480
they've launched this download Xbox originals thing where they can charge more money for

56:28.480 --> 56:32.440
games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.

56:32.440 --> 56:35.880
Unless they do an update, watch this, this is what they'll do.

56:35.880 --> 56:39.160
They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.440
They'll only update it to do a download game or something.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.760
Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution

56:45.760 --> 56:51.420
games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat, because really that's really

56:51.420 --> 56:55.280
the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games, because

56:55.280 --> 56:57.520
you know, they're a good workout, right?

56:57.520 --> 57:01.000
So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?

57:01.000 --> 57:04.880
But I could just see Microsoft making those games backwards compatible and then releasing

57:04.880 --> 57:08.880
them on the download service and not putting out a patch.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.520
That's what they're talking about when they say diminishing returns.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.520
Bastards.

57:12.520 --> 57:17.080
It means, diminishing returns means they're not really going to sell that many copies

57:17.080 --> 57:20.960
of Xbox games as soon as they don't make them anymore, and what the hell do they care?

57:20.960 --> 57:25.120
I do agree, it is kind of like, Xbox was what, like three years ago now?

57:25.120 --> 57:26.960
So it's kind of over, but...

57:26.960 --> 57:31.620
They play quite a few games, I mean if you're so bent out of shape that you can't play your

57:31.620 --> 57:36.300
copy of I don't know what, but you know, some obscure game out there, then just fucking

57:36.300 --> 57:37.440
buy an Xbox.

57:37.440 --> 57:42.480
I'm sure original Xboxes, assuming you don't have one already, are probably pretty damn

57:42.480 --> 57:43.480
cheap right now.

57:43.480 --> 57:48.320
Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds, and they're like an eyesore in my living room.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.680
I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.

57:50.680 --> 57:54.040
But you still have an original Xbox.

57:54.040 --> 57:55.040
I do, and you know where it is?

57:55.040 --> 57:58.440
It's in that drawer right there, the closed drawer right there.

57:58.440 --> 58:01.480
Well, how often do you play Xbox games?

58:01.480 --> 58:07.200
I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible, but they're not.

58:07.200 --> 58:10.120
Well, that's just Konami, they don't like you.

58:10.120 --> 58:11.120
I guess that's what it is.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.600
We sometimes break out our old stuff.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.200
Well, you're crazy.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.760
You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.320
Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?

58:18.320 --> 58:19.320
What?

58:19.320 --> 58:22.260
The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.260
Just because.

58:23.260 --> 58:24.260
Just because.

58:24.260 --> 58:25.260
Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.

58:25.260 --> 58:32.760
Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin

58:32.760 --> 58:33.760
today.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.760
Dust off the Genesis.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
Let's get it out.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.360
Yeah, we do that.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.360
Sometimes.

58:38.360 --> 58:41.560
But we've brought out our Xbox before to play old stuff.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.440
Just depends.

58:43.440 --> 58:51.960
Well, this is something interesting, though, to come out of CES, is the Force Feedback

58:51.960 --> 58:59.040
Suit by TN Games, which I think is kind of stupid, but I figured it was worth a mention

58:59.040 --> 59:09.360
because you, it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch.

59:09.360 --> 59:13.400
Like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets, like, punched in the chest,

59:13.400 --> 59:16.240
you'll feel it as just pressure.

59:16.240 --> 59:23.080
And it's, you know, meant for, it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion,

59:23.080 --> 59:28.120
but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out.

59:28.120 --> 59:38.920
So it actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for, like, a light

59:38.920 --> 59:44.560
hit or blow air past you if something misses you.

59:44.560 --> 59:50.320
So it's more for, I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why

59:50.320 --> 59:51.320
anyone would want one.

59:51.320 --> 59:53.640
Yeah, it's too, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.

59:53.640 --> 59:57.040
If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an Air

59:57.040 --> 59:59.000
Zuka while I play a game.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.120
Screw the Air Zuka, I'll just have a can.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:06.920
Well, they have those, was it, I don't remember the, like, ambient FX or something like that.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.320
It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.600
So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.480
I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.200
what's in the game.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.400
I'm laughing at RobWithTwoBees in the chat room.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.120
It says, how does it play with rez?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120
That's a good question.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120
That'd be funny.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120
That might be kind of fun.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.120
All right.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.120
Well, let's keep it moving.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.840
Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:48.480
Anyways, so, Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480
Good luck.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.600
Because right now you're not off to a good start.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.200
What does that mean, most reliable?

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.200
I don't know.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:02.320
He basically says, he says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.520
Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.080
Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.600
Does most reliable mean, like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.400
the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.300
I don't know.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:25.240
But I don't know how they can claim that even, I understand that they want to be the most

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:32.200
reliable, but I want to be rich, and I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable,

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.640
so I don't know.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.200
All right.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.680
Well, one thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox originals will make its

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.000
way to the Xbox Live Marketplace, and one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Take

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Down.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.040
Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.360
But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.840
in the long-running Burnout series, I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.020
Paradise or anything like that, but yeah, Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.560
to the Xbox 360 console as a downloadable original.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:13.280
It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about 1,499.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.480
Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360, so

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480
yeah.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.800
Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.800
Yeah.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800
That's coming out.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.960
Yeah, I liked it better than Revenge anyway, so.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.960
Recommend it if you don't have it.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.320
Yeah, Take Down's a good game.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.360
I would also recommend it, and it's, yeah, it plays well on the backwards compatibility

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360
and all that good stuff, so.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:41.040
Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.120
that got pooped on?

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.440
Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy, well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440
Whatever happened?

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440
Oh, yeah, I know what happened.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.400
Nobody else left GameSpot, too, because of that earlier this week.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.560
Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked Gerstmann as why he was leaving.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.840
You know what's funny, though, is there's been like some other independent reviewers

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.280
also leaving, and I'm just like, I don't care what, you're trying to like, you know, be

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.480
all noble and stuff.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.160
Other people have done it before you, who cares?

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.680
Well, the game in question, Kane & Lynch Dead Men, sold a million copies.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.460
So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.840
to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
of stuff on the internet.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.840
It probably helped, if anything.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.120
I want to see what the drama's about.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.560
It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.320
There's no such thing as bad press, you know, that'd be great.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.280
This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.680
Loki made a really big funny.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.440
It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.920
Exactly.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.840
All right.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.960
Well I think parents just bought this game for their kids, well actually you really shouldn't

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.920
buy this game for your kids, so I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.720
tree, but quite a few people, apparently.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.880
I'm sure kids have it, because their parents don't care.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.760
Well, Billy wants Kane & Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760
him.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.560
What's this M mean on the front of the package?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.080
M means it's...

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.080
Must have!

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.560
It's magnificent.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.600
M for magnificent, okay.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:27.480
So one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess, I

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.840
don't know why they're doing it, but they did.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.080
So now ResHD will be supporting...

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.640
I'm sorry, this is too good.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.960
Black Wolf says, oh, M is for Miners.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960
Miners?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.760
Yeah, there you go.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760
Sorry, go ahead.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:49.400
So ResHD is going to be supporting trans vibration, in the form of your other controllers, so

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:55.440
one person can play, and three other people can be pleasured, awesome.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.920
So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers, one to play the game,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920
three in your pants.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.320
Why can't they support just the Res trans vibrator, I mean, it's just a USB device,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.720
and if they built in the driver for it, why don't they support it, because that'd be kind

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.000
of cool.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.440
Okay, so they're going to spend money to, you know, engineer this whole stupid thing

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:23.040
on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040
vibrator.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.040
Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
No I actually don't.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.960
See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one, I'm telling you right now.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.760
I've been looking for one.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.080
And cue the emails of everybody who has one emailing me telling me I'm wrong.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:45.240
Just reverse engineer a trans vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that, or

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.160
like a dildo or something.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:53.240
SSJ100Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week, during list lists,

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.920
remember how we were doing the list lists, and it was the gadgets we most want to see

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.880
at CES, remember the Foreman grill, the grill's the entire cow one, right, we had like the

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.560
Holodeck in there and all that stuff, right?

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.480
Remember SSJ100Matt, his entire list got eliminated, and his list was gone.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.480
One of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.000
Oh we don't need it, we have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.600
No but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:25.160
announced in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now...

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.960
I don't know why you would need a trans vibrator anyways, it's kind of weird, but...

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.160
Well congratulations SSJ100Matt for being correct.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.520
It'll be fun though to put the controller on like stuff that rattles, you know, like

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.000
my coffee table and stuff like that so it'll be really loud and annoying.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.280
I'm sure your wife will love that.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.680
One thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.880
a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.920
That's right, it's the classic video game of the week, brought to us by Dark Sakura.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.160
Dark Sakura, what games have you picked for the masses this week?

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.760
The game of the week is Bongio, which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.360
game on top of that, which makes it even more awesome.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.080
Two treasure games in a row, aha!

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.080
But you can do that.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.080
I can.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:28.560
The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan, and it has come out on the Dreamcast.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:35.600
In fact I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.920
a bunch of it, it's really crazy because like you go around and, well actually I think it's

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:47.480
kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version has a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480
It's pretty cool.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.440
So if you got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!

01:07:51.440 --> 01:08:00.400
But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can do like a bajillion

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.080
shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.360
And I believe that the maximum number of like bullets you personally can shoot out at one

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.600
time is like 400 I think.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.600
It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small, but when you think

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:25.320
about everything else that's going in the game, it makes sense, you get a lot of action

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320
going on at one time.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:35.760
With the Dreamcast it makes some changes from the Nintendo 64 version, you have a sort of

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.960
an explosion counter instead of the combo system and you don't have a shot that you

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.400
can buy stuff from the Nintendo 64 version.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:53.040
Your special attacks are based on the amount of incoming fire, so you don't have to charge

01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:00.000
for it, the more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Everybody also, all the characters were equalized as far as their powers are concerned, there's

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.280
additional bosses, two new enemies which are a flamethrower and a giant egg, just little

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.720
things, you know, graphical changes.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:21.640
But there was a sequel that came out which was Bongayo Spirits that's actually in development

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.440
with DS.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.600
I was going to say that Dark Hetsuya and Chao were saying something about DS and Xbox Live

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.000
Arcade rumors as well.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.760
I've been hearing some of that too, but I'm definitely going to be getting Bongayo

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.760
Spirits.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.760
It's actually going to be coming out in Japan as Bongayo Tamashiki.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.800
So the Bongayo goodness lives on, but for now we pay tribute to the original Bongayo,

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.880
apparently Dreamcast version over the Nintendo 64.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.360
I have actually once played a Nintendo 64 version, there are some differences, I actually

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.240
think the Dreamcast version is a lot more balanced.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.640
Well there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bongayo.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.880
Love it, play it.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.320
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio this week, but fear

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.440
not the show isn't done just yet, we're going to come back and we're going to have ourselves

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.360
a part B, and in part B we're going to talk about a lot of other stuff, speaking of the

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.040
DS, we're going to talk a little bit about Assassin's Creed, and we're going to talk

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.680
about Bionic Commando possibly coming to a Nintendo system as well, and a very cool feature

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.280
for Disney World travelers that could be coming to the DS very soon.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.280
That's all coming up tonight in part B, so stay tuned.
