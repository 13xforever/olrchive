WEBVTT

00:13.920 --> 00:19.222
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models are discontinued in Japan.

00:19.562 --> 00:25.085
[SPEAKER_00]: The worlds of Soul Calibur and Star Wars collide, and can Resident Evil be returning to arcades?

00:27.646 --> 00:35.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.850
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that video game show on the internet.

00:38.257 --> 00:42.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.801 --> 00:43.842
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:44.343 --> 00:48.106
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.567 --> 00:48.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

00:49.087 --> 00:50.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Our show's very own bionic woman.

00:51.049 --> 00:51.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Who hearts pirates, according to her shirt.

00:53.391 --> 00:55.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.

00:55.854 --> 00:56.454
[SPEAKER_02]: I skulls pirates.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.156
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means you collect their skulls?

00:58.737 --> 00:58.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:59.117 --> 00:59.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Like shrunken heads?

00:59.957 --> 01:01.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Like PvP and Ragnarok, yo.

01:01.738 --> 01:03.338
[SPEAKER_02]: That means skull fuck.

01:03.738 --> 01:08.299
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the other voice you hear over there, the ever-giggly Techmaster Loki.

01:08.659 --> 01:11.339
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was watching Crisis YouTube videos.

01:11.719 --> 01:12.119
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

01:12.280 --> 01:19.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to understand, Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.

01:20.181 --> 01:25.482
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's chickens, and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spawned a ton of chickens and vehicles and...

01:29.438 --> 01:33.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing chickens has been funny ever since The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.121
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't kill them, though.

01:34.261 --> 01:39.064
[SPEAKER_03]: You picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.

01:39.164 --> 01:41.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet, sweet, chickeny vengeance.

01:41.745 --> 01:43.426
[SPEAKER_01]: These chickens do not get revenge.

01:43.486 --> 01:44.387
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply die.

01:45.687 --> 01:46.228
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we eat them?

01:46.428 --> 01:46.608
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:46.628 --> 01:46.828
[SPEAKER_02]: No fun.

01:51.104 --> 01:52.125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

02:16.874 --> 02:17.755
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:27.588 --> 02:28.408
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to come on the show.

02:28.668 --> 02:29.289
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited.

02:29.309 --> 02:30.269
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you guys more details.

02:30.289 --> 02:34.171
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.

02:34.411 --> 02:35.331
[SPEAKER_01]: Person on YouTube.

02:35.371 --> 02:36.952
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be anyone on the face of the earth.

02:36.972 --> 02:37.512
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.633
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a wonderful place.

02:39.733 --> 02:43.894
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we have that, and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.616
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, it's kind of this dull period right now.

02:46.636 --> 02:47.356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of...

02:48.038 --> 02:48.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Games coming out.

02:48.858 --> 02:49.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a few.

02:49.699 --> 02:52.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.341
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, kind of a slow period for games.

02:54.401 --> 02:55.801
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean the news has stopped.

02:55.821 --> 02:58.963
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.844
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:02.364 --> 03:05.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass, trying to get it to work.

03:08.387 --> 03:15.850
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have Cooking Mama in the collection, in the purse to play, because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again.

03:16.844 --> 03:18.325
[SPEAKER_03]: and to hell with my production.

03:20.607 --> 03:31.674
[SPEAKER_03]: And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.

03:32.014 --> 03:33.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I didn't know what rebirth was.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.917
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night.

03:36.017 --> 03:38.859
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sort of.

03:40.600 --> 03:50.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to start, you start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.

03:51.347 --> 03:57.470
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.

03:59.272 --> 04:07.356
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.

04:08.237 --> 04:09.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really amazed, so.

04:11.138 --> 04:12.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Warcraft had a new game plus.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you get to 70.

04:14.959 --> 04:15.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, you're stuck.

04:16.160 --> 04:16.880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, hey, I'm at 99.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do the Time Warp again.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to jump to the left.

04:22.102 --> 04:33.826
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is in-game content.

04:34.226 --> 04:36.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.

04:36.187 --> 04:38.547
[SPEAKER_03]: You find a pond, you get experience.

04:39.368 --> 04:39.708
[SPEAKER_02]: PvP.

04:41.047 --> 04:41.427
[SPEAKER_02]: New Level

05:08.564 --> 05:14.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of.

05:15.849 --> 05:23.494
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I bought a DVI to VGA converter.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing is, the DVI side doesn't fit.

05:26.756 --> 05:28.377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I guess, completely different.

05:28.737 --> 05:32.720
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.622
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one that Vandalus gave me.

05:36.283 --> 05:36.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

05:36.823 --> 05:38.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, before he left us.

05:39.187 --> 05:39.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Saka

06:08.811 --> 06:11.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you got your account, me as well, right?

06:18.956 --> 06:20.557
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no monthly fee or anything.

06:20.617 --> 06:21.457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always there to come back.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this, DarkSakura.

06:24.679 --> 06:25.620
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to bring this up now.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.061
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message.

06:29.542 --> 06:32.843
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.

06:33.084 --> 06:33.344
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Until the server shut down on March 31st.

06:36.085 --> 06:36.325
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.488
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?

06:40.988 --> 06:42.769
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about it with Ranma last night.

06:44.350 --> 06:48.652
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.

06:50.293 --> 06:50.673
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

06:54.435 --> 07:08.141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so... Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on, she's playing PSU.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.462
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on Lost Planet.

07:10.322 --> 07:10.883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

07:11.123 --> 07:15.725
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?

07:15.745 --> 07:16.986
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, it's Julie.

07:17.286 --> 07:17.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Julie?

07:17.886 --> 07:17.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie?

07:18.567 --> 07:19.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie's playing Last Planet?

07:20.047 --> 07:21.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she hung out with us today.

07:21.968 --> 07:25.868
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to breakfast and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.

07:27.289 --> 07:32.389
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.590
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not the right one.

07:34.670 --> 07:35.690
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually bought it for me.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was really nice of her because it was only like $10.

07:38.751 --> 07:44.452
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.492
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan used his...

07:47.947 --> 07:52.830
[SPEAKER_03]: I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray, and I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.

08:09.022 --> 08:09.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who knows?

08:09.763 --> 08:15.989
[SPEAKER_02]: It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD finishes.

08:16.069 --> 08:17.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's kind of jumping ship.

08:19.692 --> 08:21.494
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's still kind of up there.

08:22.935 --> 08:29.662
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.865
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.

08:32.945 --> 08:33.686
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very good.

08:33.766 --> 08:33.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

08:34.634 --> 08:41.421
[SPEAKER_03]: I made an icon for my live journal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.

08:41.701 --> 08:42.522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

08:42.922 --> 08:48.247
[SPEAKER_03]: In Greek mythology, Lamia was the queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.330
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.692
[SPEAKER_02]: They should make a video game out of Stardust.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.

08:55.274 --> 08:55.534
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

08:55.975 --> 08:56.756
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

08:56.856 --> 08:59.018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole swords and magic thing.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Music is very Oblivion-ish.

09:01.782 --> 09:06.345
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll link it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with it glowing green.

09:06.605 --> 09:07.566
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pull My Finger.

09:08.807 --> 09:09.407
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.

09:09.908 --> 09:10.948
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very proud of it.

09:11.629 --> 09:12.730
[SPEAKER_03]: It took like five seconds.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?

09:15.111 --> 09:15.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

09:15.712 --> 09:16.893
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:17.313 --> 09:18.093
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

09:18.494 --> 09:22.296
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.

09:22.997 --> 09:23.697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's horrible.

09:25.459 --> 09:25.839
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate.

09:27.347 --> 09:27.868
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear it.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.369
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just... It's all, yay!

09:31.689 --> 09:37.132
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff, then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks!

09:37.952 --> 09:42.474
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though my character's in it, which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.435
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.616
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.

09:46.636 --> 09:49.878
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penis as Magic Pen Gel.

09:49.998 --> 09:50.338
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.299
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is way better.

09:53.339 --> 09:54.100
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I played...

09:56.291 --> 09:57.853
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

10:12.910 --> 10:17.713
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches in it that make it almost impossible to play.

10:18.134 --> 10:22.897
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I have been unable to beat the game because of these glitches.

10:23.958 --> 10:29.441
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your strength mode or whatever.

10:29.882 --> 10:34.905
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't actually be able to be knocked down.

10:34.945 --> 10:35.666
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get stuck.

10:36.406 --> 10:39.969
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, some other times, you know, for example, one of the...

10:42.310 --> 10:49.656
[SPEAKER_01]: There's supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.

10:49.736 --> 10:53.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand and that's it.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.342
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just frozen and nothing ever happens.

10:56.662 --> 11:00.085
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to constantly restart the game and it's just horrible.

11:00.826 --> 11:06.191
[SPEAKER_01]: If that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at all because it was just that bad.

11:07.235 --> 11:19.064
[SPEAKER_01]: Even now, I've tried playing it through about 10 different times, starting on saves that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe something will work this time, but it doesn't.

11:19.544 --> 11:20.825
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm about fed up with it.

11:21.225 --> 11:26.129
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.

11:27.050 --> 11:29.251
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a portable nuke launcher.

11:32.774 --> 11:34.075
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have it at the beginning of the game?

11:34.095 --> 11:35.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would have loved to have blown up chickens with that.

11:37.436 --> 11:38.256
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to work towards it.

11:38.496 --> 11:38.856
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.077
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I have to cheat really bad.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.057
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a chicken cannon.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see, what else did I play?

11:47.118 --> 11:47.978
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's about it.

11:47.998 --> 11:48.878
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Saints Row.

11:50.039 --> 11:51.739
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of Earth Defense Force.

11:52.259 --> 11:54.039
[SPEAKER_01]: Still plugging away at that game.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft.

12:03.326 --> 12:07.288
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of new games coming out, and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.

12:07.868 --> 12:15.672
[SPEAKER_02]: So really the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games ever.

12:15.912 --> 12:17.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Dan was playing a demo of that.

12:18.553 --> 12:22.575
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.756
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you need is the booth.

12:25.056 --> 12:28.238
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still...

12:29.349 --> 12:31.631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.

12:33.832 --> 12:38.635
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four minigames in one.

12:38.956 --> 12:49.803
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of games in this period were similar to it, because honestly, the setup of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey, the arcade game, which is also made up of four minigames.

12:50.103 --> 12:50.783
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX LIVE CO-OP

13:11.529 --> 13:16.252
[SPEAKER_02]: $5 though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and age is worth too much more.

13:16.812 --> 13:19.053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.

13:19.093 --> 13:21.295
[SPEAKER_02]: That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.

13:21.495 --> 13:22.235
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be kind of cool.

13:22.696 --> 13:25.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Discs of Tron was very interesting.

13:26.801 --> 13:31.544
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.

13:31.825 --> 13:39.290
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play the entire game.

13:39.630 --> 13:46.915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that, you know, when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and more difficult each time.

13:47.296 --> 13:51.499
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really, you know, the demo will give you a really good idea of what the game's all about.

13:51.819 --> 13:53.440
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that.

13:55.385 --> 13:56.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14:20.867 --> 14:25.268
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.448
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of bullets everywhere.

14:27.708 --> 14:28.269
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always fun.

14:28.329 --> 14:39.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can pick up these... You can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking up these different power-ups, and you can have, like, lasers or spreading bullets and things of that sort.

14:39.711 --> 14:44.552
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was.

14:44.572 --> 14:45.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Aegis Wing, yeah.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.

14:46.932 --> 14:48.213
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll give that... Omega 5's $10, but...

14:50.437 --> 14:55.719
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely reminds me of a heyday arcade Japanese-influenced shooter, so definitely check it out.

14:55.759 --> 14:57.339
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo on that one's not bad either.

14:57.759 --> 15:01.000
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.

15:01.020 --> 15:04.181
[SPEAKER_02]: You do one mini-boss fight, but it's pretty cool.

15:07.582 --> 15:12.804
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's always our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and rostiout.com.

15:13.459 --> 15:15.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite the smartass in our chatroom.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.122
[SPEAKER_02]: The official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes and ways.

15:18.162 --> 15:18.642
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

15:19.142 --> 15:21.664
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.

15:22.464 --> 15:22.985
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about first-person shooters.

15:24.565 --> 15:29.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know.

15:30.049 --> 15:32.990
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too.

15:33.130 --> 15:37.893
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.

15:38.073 --> 15:39.294
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you have it.

15:41.342 --> 16:02.331
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's really going to do it for our gaming week so now we're going to move on into some housekeeping of which we don't have a whole lot to share I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished so if you were feeling there's not enough of the old school classics and music from video games and such you're going to love the new rotation it's

16:02.711 --> 16:03.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

16:24.885 --> 16:26.686
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing is that there's a new show.

16:27.326 --> 16:28.987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a live show or a hosted show.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a music show.

16:30.628 --> 16:32.388
[SPEAKER_02]: But it airs every day from noon to 1230.

16:32.768 --> 16:35.209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's every day, Monday through Sunday.

16:35.289 --> 16:35.690
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.370
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Retro Lunch.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.852
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.

16:41.152 --> 16:41.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.

16:41.972 --> 16:42.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't overdo it.

16:43.013 --> 16:45.594
[SPEAKER_02]: But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.

16:46.774 --> 16:47.354
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

16:48.195 --> 16:48.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, lots of fun.

16:49.756 --> 16:57.821
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station right now and try to guess.

16:57.841 --> 16:58.282
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do that.

16:58.542 --> 16:59.322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fun.

16:59.543 --> 16:59.843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

17:00.163 --> 17:00.743
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

17:01.264 --> 17:06.407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care of.

17:06.988 --> 17:16.834
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody everywhere wants to know how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?

17:16.874 --> 17:19.496
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know.

17:19.978 --> 17:21.279
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the numbers, I don't know.

17:42.045 --> 17:46.088
[SPEAKER_01]: To be exact, actually, because that's just an estimate, 1,300, I'm sorry, 132,199 copies sold so far.

17:46.108 --> 17:46.349
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.050
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many does that mean we have left to go?

17:48.070 --> 17:48.410
[SPEAKER_01]: About 870,000.

17:48.470 --> 17:48.590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

17:48.610 --> 17:48.831
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

17:48.851 --> 17:49.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to work.

18:01.418 --> 18:10.140
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of Judgment could... If Eye of Judgment was actually... Because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece of shit.

18:11.081 --> 18:13.121
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program.

18:13.561 --> 18:17.702
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki says there's no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies.

18:17.742 --> 18:25.204
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it does, he will don a Tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby Blackwolf in a match.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.955
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.

18:28.015 --> 18:28.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it on his show.

18:28.855 --> 18:29.355
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my mistake.

18:29.395 --> 18:29.915
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually 150,000.

18:29.955 --> 18:30.395
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 million?

18:30.475 --> 18:30.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.

18:30.655 --> 18:32.036
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.

18:32.056 --> 18:33.196
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

18:33.536 --> 18:36.377
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 million, that'd be unheard of.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.

18:37.257 --> 18:38.618
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize the 132,199 is just U.S.,

18:50.509 --> 18:53.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is pretty impressive, actually, that the U.S.

18:53.231 --> 18:54.391
[SPEAKER_01]: has actually sold them any copies.

18:54.752 --> 18:55.832
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan, not so much.

18:56.132 --> 18:57.553
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they're only up to 19,384.

18:58.294 --> 19:02.336
[SPEAKER_01]: So no love in Japan for that stuff, but the U.S.

19:03.397 --> 19:04.518
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps on chugging.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is the game out in Europe yet?

19:06.999 --> 19:08.520
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?

19:09.481 --> 19:12.362
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.885
[SPEAKER_01]: According to this... That's not Europe, though.

19:15.905 --> 19:16.365
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

19:17.446 --> 19:18.046
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

19:19.113 --> 19:20.274
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not out in Europe yet.

19:20.414 --> 19:22.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, so Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.

19:25.920 --> 19:31.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chatroom and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.

19:32.267 --> 19:36.892
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon, apparently.

19:36.992 --> 19:37.573
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

19:38.214 --> 19:38.894
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it cheap.

19:38.974 --> 19:41.217
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted a link in the chatroom where you can...

19:41.923 --> 19:42.644
[SPEAKER_01]: Play along at home.

19:42.784 --> 19:50.371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, play along at home, and we'll probably post it in a thread or something in our forums so they can watch the count.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.993
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show.

19:53.173 --> 19:55.355
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can do it every few months or so.

19:55.415 --> 19:56.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when it crosses milestones.

19:56.917 --> 20:02.502
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get to 200,000, we'll mention it again, a quarter million, and then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows?

20:02.562 --> 20:07.807
[SPEAKER_01]: If we keep going... I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but...

20:08.556 --> 20:08.896
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

20:09.716 --> 20:11.417
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's other stories we're getting into.

20:11.437 --> 20:12.037
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

20:12.357 --> 20:13.478
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we get into these stories?

20:13.798 --> 20:15.178
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall get into these stories.

20:15.859 --> 20:24.462
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.

20:24.922 --> 20:25.822
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more cards.

20:26.322 --> 20:27.883
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's two of them.

20:29.724 --> 20:36.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, the Machine Gods Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th.

20:38.078 --> 20:45.005
[SPEAKER_01]: And, let's see here, there's also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in the summer.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.889
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are, they said downloads, though.

20:47.969 --> 20:51.393
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not really new cards, though.

20:51.413 --> 20:53.655
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.

20:55.938 --> 20:57.079
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this affect the bet?

20:58.080 --> 21:00.802
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it affects anything because it's not actually selling anything.

21:01.502 --> 21:02.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Download content does not count.

21:03.003 --> 21:10.947
[SPEAKER_02]: But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?

21:11.147 --> 21:19.852
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an expansion disc that comes, including cards obviously, because I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.

21:19.972 --> 21:21.273
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now...

21:22.575 --> 21:25.759
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's even kind of being a little generous because... It's very generous.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.562
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I don't know.

21:27.742 --> 21:29.324
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want to wear that Tingle outfit a little bit.

21:29.344 --> 21:32.849
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.

21:33.450 --> 21:34.992
[SPEAKER_01]: It will never sell one million units.

21:35.312 --> 21:35.552
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.

21:35.953 --> 21:36.894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

21:37.175 --> 21:39.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with expansions that are retail.

21:40.510 --> 21:41.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail Expansions

22:06.368 --> 22:13.392
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.

22:13.432 --> 22:14.033
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cheating.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.574
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really a game.

22:15.754 --> 22:17.875
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't count, you know, the download content.

22:17.895 --> 22:19.596
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, at least we have the bet clarified.

22:19.636 --> 22:23.779
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover U.S.

22:23.839 --> 22:24.179
[SPEAKER_02]: sales.

22:24.559 --> 22:27.121
[SPEAKER_02]: But you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.

22:27.161 --> 22:32.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it also was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for eternity, so...

22:33.396 --> 22:33.676
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

22:34.136 --> 22:38.019
[SPEAKER_02]: And SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession behind us.

22:38.039 --> 22:38.839
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good point.

22:39.019 --> 22:39.199
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to let this joke die.

22:40.620 --> 22:41.601
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not wearing it.

22:41.801 --> 22:42.081
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

22:43.122 --> 22:44.022
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very confident.

22:44.142 --> 22:46.824
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.

22:46.844 --> 22:52.988
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very confident that this will never sell a million units because it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.029
[SPEAKER_01]: Until they come out with something else that's even more retarded.

22:56.209 --> 22:56.490
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.530
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now it's pretty retarded.

23:00.112 --> 23:00.392
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

23:01.741 --> 23:04.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you... Now, a good point brought up in chat here.

23:04.742 --> 23:07.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly buying Eye of Judgment.

23:07.822 --> 23:09.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?

23:10.243 --> 23:10.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

23:10.503 --> 23:11.483
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play card games.

23:11.863 --> 23:12.143
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

23:12.923 --> 23:13.383
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a no.

23:13.443 --> 23:13.983
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say no.

23:14.723 --> 23:23.765
[SPEAKER_01]: For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we could burn it on the show anyways.

23:23.805 --> 23:26.706
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, nah, I'm not doing that.

23:26.926 --> 23:28.546
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just use your credit and get something good.

23:31.075 --> 23:31.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Why waste it?

23:32.537 --> 23:33.739
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight is in chat.

23:33.759 --> 23:36.923
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Dark Knight says get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the suit.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.267
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not going to make me dress up.

23:40.968 --> 23:41.589
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid.

23:43.041 --> 23:44.142
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:05.198 --> 24:29.727
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 gigabyte model of course is 40 gigabytes whereas the other one was a little smaller and a little larger but the other big change oh yeah it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility which obviously makes it a lot cheaper to produce so that's where they're headed in Japan obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards compatibility in Europe well shit they never really had it but at least our main model is 80 gigabytes and

24:30.200 --> 24:30.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

24:30.320 --> 24:30.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Drive!

24:58.925 --> 25:01.808
[SPEAKER_03]: I used mine when my computer was starting to die.

25:02.568 --> 25:06.851
[SPEAKER_03]: When my Vio was, the Franken-Vio, I should call it, was about to go.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.233
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for backing up stuff.

25:09.974 --> 25:11.915
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.

25:12.095 --> 25:12.456
[SPEAKER_02]: For porn.

25:13.997 --> 25:15.118
[SPEAKER_03]: For Doctor Who episodes.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.275
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:48.092 --> 25:48.992
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be a lot of things.

25:49.012 --> 25:49.372
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

25:49.593 --> 25:53.494
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.

25:54.815 --> 25:58.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they need another color for a video game system.

25:59.497 --> 26:00.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Why mint green?

26:00.417 --> 26:01.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at the DS.

26:01.637 --> 26:02.638
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for the DS.

26:02.778 --> 26:03.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not the PSP?

26:04.339 --> 26:08.540
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envy or something.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Why mint green of all colors?

26:10.901 --> 26:11.441
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

26:11.502 --> 26:12.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not, you know...

26:13.038 --> 26:14.680
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink and Red for Valentine's Day.

26:27.307 --> 26:28.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Mint Green Olive Garden Mint

26:53.800 --> 26:56.181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually much paler than that.

26:56.301 --> 26:57.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Made good on the promise.

26:57.502 --> 26:57.882
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.

26:57.922 --> 27:03.245
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Olive Garden and I had... What did I have?

27:03.285 --> 27:04.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Seafood Alfredo.

27:04.645 --> 27:04.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.786
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of never-ending breadsticks.

27:07.026 --> 27:07.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

27:07.487 --> 27:08.727
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really good meatball soup.

27:08.847 --> 27:09.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

27:09.287 --> 27:09.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

27:10.148 --> 27:10.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

27:11.649 --> 27:12.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Games, right?

27:12.749 --> 27:13.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Games.

27:13.730 --> 27:14.810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

27:15.170 --> 27:22.354
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.

27:22.854 --> 27:23.114
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

27:23.581 --> 27:26.503
[SPEAKER_01]: People are wondering why not the original PSP.

27:26.523 --> 27:26.903
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?

27:27.544 --> 27:33.088
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more RAM in it.

27:33.248 --> 27:42.314
[SPEAKER_01]: So being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, it is the only system able to handle Skype, apparently.

27:43.175 --> 27:47.918
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing as Skype.

27:47.998 --> 27:50.960
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I know of one that they're working on right now.

27:52.682 --> 27:53.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well.

27:54.080 --> 27:54.901
[SPEAKER_01]: No Skype for you.

27:54.921 --> 27:57.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.

27:58.162 --> 28:01.144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.

28:01.164 --> 28:03.925
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I mean, who am I really going to call on Skype?

28:04.365 --> 28:08.307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.

28:08.627 --> 28:10.188
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very inconvenient anyways.

28:10.248 --> 28:14.710
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, you have to have, you know, I think you have to buy Skype for this.

28:14.911 --> 28:16.091
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's going to be free.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.652
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be free to use, but I think you have to buy the software for it.

28:19.273 --> 28:21.714
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you've done that,

28:22.711 --> 28:23.932
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:51.661 --> 28:53.763
[SPEAKER_02]: So PSPs are kind of mini-computers at this point.

28:56.605 --> 28:59.047
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.

28:59.107 --> 29:02.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not.

29:02.650 --> 29:05.733
[SPEAKER_01]: It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.

29:06.423 --> 29:15.970
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3, is that the cross-media bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.

29:16.930 --> 29:27.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the game, but that was something that the developers had to do.

29:27.458 --> 29:33.142
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar to show up within a game.

29:34.388 --> 29:44.752
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.

29:45.632 --> 29:47.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.

29:48.153 --> 29:54.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.

29:56.932 --> 29:58.812
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there was no news at CES.

29:58.912 --> 30:05.054
[SPEAKER_02]: They instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.

30:05.714 --> 30:07.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon is the magic word, isn't it?

30:07.814 --> 30:08.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

30:10.115 --> 30:18.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a little confirmation that should make some people happy and that is about LittleBigPlanet.

30:19.137 --> 30:20.297
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out in September.

30:20.897 --> 30:22.078
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what Sony's saying.

30:22.858 --> 30:23.978
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's

30:24.514 --> 30:26.916
[SPEAKER_03]: September and not September X date.

30:27.736 --> 30:30.218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's September, which is sometime.

30:30.498 --> 30:32.839
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?

30:32.919 --> 30:33.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

30:33.420 --> 30:41.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is strange because Consumer Electronics Show, like it seems like we're getting slightly more gaming news out of CES this year.

30:41.144 --> 30:44.967
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that word slightly because usually CES, not for games.

30:45.948 --> 30:47.530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a game show.

30:47.690 --> 30:55.961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kitchenware and 150,000 foot TVs and the George Foreman grilling machine.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.402
[SPEAKER_03]: And robots to waltz with.

30:57.503 --> 30:58.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

30:58.644 --> 30:59.345
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that stuff.

30:59.365 --> 31:01.027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show.

31:01.047 --> 31:01.948
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see a lot of games.

31:01.988 --> 31:03.090
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like this year...

31:04.008 --> 31:07.989
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit more gaming news.

31:09.310 --> 31:11.911
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying we never got game news out of CES.

31:12.051 --> 31:13.291
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we got a little more this year.

31:13.631 --> 31:18.993
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be or what the heck that's about.

31:19.393 --> 31:20.894
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just thought that was interesting.

31:22.334 --> 31:23.475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not reading too much into that.

31:23.495 --> 31:24.395
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was interesting.

31:24.555 --> 31:24.875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

31:25.015 --> 31:25.255
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

31:26.876 --> 31:32.118
[SPEAKER_02]: And then freaking Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft keynote.

31:32.158 --> 31:32.818
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was kind of...

31:33.655 --> 31:34.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

31:35.821 --> 31:39.371
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlanet's coming out in September.

31:39.391 --> 31:42.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?

31:42.867 --> 31:44.387
[SPEAKER_01]: and now it's like, oh, I'm sorry.

31:44.627 --> 31:45.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Sony delay?

31:45.848 --> 31:46.408
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't say.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.428
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's crazy.

31:47.628 --> 31:49.689
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out?

31:49.789 --> 31:58.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, they keep advertising this shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid 4, you know, all these games that are out now.

31:58.651 --> 32:04.652
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games are out yet and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy a PlayStation 3.

32:05.192 --> 32:07.313
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff will be coming someday.

32:07.673 --> 32:11.574
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.

32:12.094 --> 32:12.915
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem, though.

32:13.255 --> 32:18.518
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they take their time on getting the product out, it's still just average.

32:19.219 --> 32:20.620
[SPEAKER_01]: They can delay it all they want.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.800
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still be kind of eh.

32:23.241 --> 32:24.602
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree to an extent.

32:24.742 --> 32:29.665
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think they should never have launched the damn console when they did.

32:29.705 --> 32:34.468
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should have just sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.

32:34.488 --> 32:35.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just like LittleBigPlanet.

32:35.889 --> 32:38.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it's something that's pretty ambitious, but...

32:39.975 --> 32:41.395
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking show this shit off.

32:41.535 --> 32:43.476
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, oh, it's coming out this fall.

32:43.536 --> 32:44.716
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get everybody excited.

32:45.136 --> 32:46.857
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall.

32:46.897 --> 32:47.737
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out this spring.

32:48.277 --> 32:50.458
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, okay, great, spring comes along.

32:50.758 --> 32:52.158
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring.

32:52.198 --> 32:53.078
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out in September.

32:53.098 --> 32:55.919
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's... Okay.

32:55.939 --> 32:56.739
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take them forever.

32:57.679 --> 33:01.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuda in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com brings up a good point.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't Super Smash Bros.

33:02.821 --> 33:04.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?

33:05.341 --> 33:07.062
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Sony the only bad guys here?

33:07.142 --> 33:07.682
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not.

33:08.042 --> 33:08.182
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

33:08.931 --> 33:09.171
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

33:30.379 --> 33:30.579
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3, PS4, PS5

33:59.707 --> 34:02.089
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, what else is Sony teasing for us?

34:02.469 --> 34:08.433
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games on the system.

34:08.853 --> 34:12.515
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun.

34:13.156 --> 34:14.437
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite games on the system.

34:14.597 --> 34:18.079
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the few that I still own because I love it so much.

34:19.020 --> 34:24.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60-player online deathmatches, which is fantastic.

34:24.673 --> 34:25.454
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking crazy.

34:26.654 --> 34:28.956
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight-player co-op and two campaigns.

34:29.537 --> 34:36.822
[SPEAKER_01]: One which is supposed to be an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just standard single-player campaign.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.363
[SPEAKER_02]: 60-player multiplayer matches.

34:38.503 --> 34:41.385
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.

34:42.146 --> 34:49.371
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48-player multiplayer deathmatches.

34:50.432 --> 34:52.153
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's not so bad.

34:52.293 --> 34:53.194
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to remember that

34:53.629 --> 34:54.369
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

35:14.628 --> 35:24.131
[SPEAKER_02]: and there should be something where if somebody is completely being a jerk then everybody can target that person and obliterate them to smithereens and they lose the right to speak.

35:25.631 --> 35:25.991
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

35:26.152 --> 35:26.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Patent pending.

35:28.252 --> 35:31.713
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I own all the rights to it and if you try to put this in your game I'll sue you for a million dollars.

35:31.853 --> 35:36.355
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more information though on Resistance 2 it's supposed to be in the new issue of Game Informer.

35:38.315 --> 35:38.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

35:39.315 --> 35:44.257
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier how it's becoming more and more like a computer.

35:44.653 --> 35:45.273
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:07.796 --> 36:09.137
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:32.836 --> 36:35.177
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're going to want to have this keyboard for in 2009.

36:35.477 --> 36:40.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time thing.

36:41.761 --> 36:42.321
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you wait.

36:42.581 --> 36:43.422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still lame.

36:43.502 --> 36:46.823
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.

36:47.304 --> 36:47.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wait?

36:48.644 --> 36:51.846
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then if you wait, then you put this thing out.

36:52.426 --> 36:54.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody buys it because there's nothing to use it for.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.249
[SPEAKER_02]: So retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first place?

36:57.589 --> 36:59.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.

37:00.669 --> 37:01.491
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's stupid.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna sell anyways if it's AIM.

37:04.116 --> 37:04.658
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, you know what?

37:07.231 --> 37:12.816
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost blame, that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the GameCube.

37:12.836 --> 37:13.237
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they call it?

37:13.257 --> 37:15.699
[SPEAKER_02]: The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.

37:15.719 --> 37:20.784
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody could get into at the time.

37:21.164 --> 37:22.365
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did those things end up?

37:22.425 --> 37:23.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Bargain bins.

37:23.146 --> 37:26.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them are out there.

37:26.289 --> 37:28.391
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of like a damning cycle.

37:28.651 --> 37:30.533
[SPEAKER_02]: What should have happened is that at that time...

37:31.173 --> 37:37.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo should have come out and said, we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.

37:37.618 --> 37:43.903
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero is going to support the... How awesome would F-Zero GX have been if it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?

37:43.943 --> 37:46.184
[SPEAKER_02]: A completely different kind of game than PSO.

37:47.405 --> 37:49.607
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see Nintendo putting an online game...

37:50.467 --> 37:54.548
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.

37:54.568 --> 37:56.989
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.

37:57.349 --> 38:03.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking off that.

38:03.731 --> 38:11.173
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online thing.

38:11.534 --> 38:17.295
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger for the PSP.

38:17.715 --> 38:19.476
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already got Java stuff that works...

38:20.163 --> 38:20.804
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

38:36.789 --> 38:37.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Vibribin Vibribin

39:00.189 --> 39:02.211
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but hey, VibRibbon's great.

39:02.771 --> 39:16.062
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what VibRibbon is, it's a vector animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.

39:16.183 --> 39:17.484
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some mood-setting music.

39:21.967 --> 39:22.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

39:22.868 --> 39:25.630
[SPEAKER_03]: It had, I think, eight tracks or something.

39:25.671 --> 39:27.212
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of them built into the game.

39:28.015 --> 39:33.396
[SPEAKER_03]: And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.

39:34.896 --> 39:40.358
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that you play the game is you start the game and you can actually put in your own CDs.

39:40.778 --> 39:46.079
[SPEAKER_03]: And we tried to do it to... CD-R music, like Max 300 and stuff.

39:46.099 --> 39:47.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we tried to do it to 151.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania, yeah.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.901
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300.

39:56.400 --> 40:03.304
[SPEAKER_03]: and we tried to pick as many fast and retarded stuff as we could and did it end up being some solitary song that was really hard instead?

40:03.965 --> 40:04.825
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Colors.

40:05.186 --> 40:16.133
[SPEAKER_02]: The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, designing your own levels with your own music, but it was kind of cool nevertheless.

40:16.553 --> 40:21.897
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.

40:21.937 --> 40:22.517
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.

40:22.817 --> 40:25.619
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.

40:26.679 --> 40:29.721
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope it comes out.

40:29.781 --> 40:30.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it over here though.

40:30.942 --> 40:32.644
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 has a brilliant idea.

40:32.724 --> 40:34.965
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play that game with Dragon Force now.

40:35.265 --> 40:36.106
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I could do?

40:36.326 --> 40:36.506
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

40:36.526 --> 40:38.508
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do that because I have Vib Ribbon.

40:40.689 --> 40:43.371
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a copy of Vib Ribbon sitting at Network Video.

40:43.411 --> 40:44.412
[SPEAKER_03]: May you rest in peace.

40:45.313 --> 40:47.114
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need to do for our little piece.

40:47.174 --> 40:50.377
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force.

40:50.397 --> 40:51.738
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make that happen with Vib Ribbon.

40:51.998 --> 40:53.999
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to dust off your copy because we're going to be doing that.

40:54.019 --> 40:54.440
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it.

40:54.720 --> 40:54.900
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

40:57.486 --> 41:01.627
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up the ribbon for $40 and I got an original and I've never regretted it.

41:02.367 --> 41:03.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

41:03.848 --> 41:06.448
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?

41:06.688 --> 41:07.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

41:08.269 --> 41:08.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucka.

41:09.089 --> 41:11.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I could just pop it in my PS2.

41:11.269 --> 41:16.270
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet.

41:17.310 --> 41:23.052
[SPEAKER_03]: We found the cartridge and our Super Nintendo so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing.

41:23.132 --> 41:23.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

41:24.572 --> 41:24.832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

41:25.944 --> 41:30.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff not online, but stuff you can actually walk into a store and buy.

41:31.028 --> 41:31.928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the U.S.

41:32.008 --> 41:37.271
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy, most of which the latter.

41:39.013 --> 41:41.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Including kids sports, ice hockey for the Wii.

41:42.675 --> 41:46.537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good.

41:48.639 --> 41:53.922
[SPEAKER_01]: Flat out head-on on the PSP, that's a flat out 2 port, so that should be pretty fun.

41:54.772 --> 42:21.564
[SPEAKER_01]: History Channel Lost Worlds on the PC Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii Which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails samurai game Let's see, Furu Furu Park on the Wii Only $20, a bunch of little mini-games by Majesco Let's see, Miami Knights Singles in the City for the DS I don't know if it's any better than Sprung, but I guess we'll have to see

42:22.525 --> 42:49.051
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike64 and it's kind of the same thing, it's bikes with rockets on them and then the Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and the Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to $30 and

42:50.901 --> 42:54.362
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, let's see here.

42:55.842 --> 42:59.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle.

43:00.284 --> 43:01.924
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming out as well.

43:02.424 --> 43:03.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough pirate games.

43:03.665 --> 43:03.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough.

43:04.285 --> 43:07.746
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, though, there is something kind of funny that's coming out next week.

43:08.186 --> 43:10.186
[SPEAKER_01]: Also happens to be by Destiny Air, though.

43:10.907 --> 43:12.087
[SPEAKER_01]: Kawasaki Jet Ski.

43:12.567 --> 43:17.868
[SPEAKER_01]: This one looks almost identical to Wave Race 64.

43:18.909 --> 43:19.909
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be pretty cool.

43:21.059 --> 43:21.519
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

43:42.418 --> 43:43.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th.

43:55.092 --> 43:59.036
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sonic Riders Shooting Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

43:59.196 --> 44:05.001
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking at the patient with a knife?

44:05.962 --> 44:06.362
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

44:06.442 --> 44:08.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007.

44:08.985 --> 44:12.448
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not...

44:12.888 --> 44:13.348
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

44:41.618 --> 44:43.280
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?

44:45.221 --> 44:46.022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, I fucked up.

44:46.082 --> 44:47.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week.

44:47.904 --> 44:48.184
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

44:49.085 --> 44:50.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

44:51.067 --> 44:56.112
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star, which is also released next week.

44:56.452 --> 44:58.914
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this week you can get a game called School Days.

45:00.015 --> 45:06.962
[SPEAKER_02]: School Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kind of arm in arm like they're BFFs.

45:07.918 --> 45:32.375
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're wearing schoolgirl uniforms so you know this will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS a game called From the Abyss makes its way to the Nintendo DS and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS oh I guess it is there's the box art and everything Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS I always thought that was a Wii only game go figure

45:33.080 --> 45:35.541
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan.

45:36.221 --> 45:39.742
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing.

45:40.962 --> 45:41.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing for the PSP.

45:42.002 --> 45:44.623
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have a price reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week.

45:44.903 --> 45:45.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

45:45.803 --> 45:47.403
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, your Japanese release dates.

45:48.043 --> 45:52.625
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe.

45:52.645 --> 45:53.845
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Balls of Fury.

45:55.525 --> 45:56.265
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

45:56.425 --> 45:58.586
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off a movie that didn't do very well.

45:59.355 --> 46:17.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Knight's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure.

46:17.747 --> 46:20.169
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

46:22.430 --> 46:28.134
[SPEAKER_03]: I just say save your money, well, get Knights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles later that month.

46:30.677 --> 46:36.119
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I will never understand our chat room and the way they think sometimes because you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?

46:36.680 --> 46:40.521
[SPEAKER_02]: So SSJ100 Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup dating sim for DS.

46:41.161 --> 46:44.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Or now, you know, two girls, one cup is now 2007.

46:46.524 --> 46:51.066
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you have, you know, because obviously it's something much more hardcore came out apparently recently.

46:51.386 --> 46:56.148
[SPEAKER_02]: And Corey31 suggests that four girls finger paint would make a good DS Wii game.

47:00.209 --> 47:00.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.

47:00.729 --> 47:02.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta keep up on the internet.

47:02.130 --> 47:02.990
[SPEAKER_02]: You all are sick.

47:03.770 --> 47:04.170
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

47:04.430 --> 47:07.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better.

47:08.212 --> 47:08.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

47:08.712 --> 47:09.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Date Dragon Force, the game.

47:09.752 --> 47:10.572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want?

47:10.652 --> 47:14.053
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.

47:14.213 --> 47:14.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

47:15.114 --> 47:17.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.

47:17.494 --> 47:17.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

47:18.375 --> 47:22.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.

47:22.916 --> 47:23.276
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

47:23.956 --> 47:26.077
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was announced this week that

47:26.733 --> 47:28.255
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:46.653 --> 47:49.315
[SPEAKER_01]: You happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.

47:49.795 --> 47:52.657
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.

47:53.078 --> 47:56.880
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.

47:56.940 --> 48:01.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Cue all the Xbox fans going, No!

48:01.063 --> 48:02.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can get them both.

48:02.964 --> 48:03.445
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

48:03.505 --> 48:03.825
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

48:03.965 --> 48:04.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

48:04.305 --> 48:05.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you buy them both?

48:05.266 --> 48:07.047
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly why they did this shit.

48:07.067 --> 48:08.468
[SPEAKER_03]: That was sarcasm, by the way.

48:08.628 --> 48:09.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank God.

48:09.549 --> 48:11.210
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to come over there and beat you.

48:11.230 --> 48:12.711
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to get the PS3 version.

48:12.731 --> 48:13.031
[SPEAKER_02]: For Vader?

48:13.051 --> 48:13.412
[SPEAKER_02]: For Vader.

48:15.475 --> 48:16.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

48:16.255 --> 48:20.418
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off of Soul Calibur 4.

48:20.458 --> 48:22.199
[SPEAKER_03]: They went back and based it off of Soul Calibur 2.

48:24.340 --> 48:25.641
[SPEAKER_03]: A balanced version.

48:25.941 --> 48:30.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?

48:30.243 --> 48:33.205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur 2.

48:33.545 --> 48:38.127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I don't have a problem with Link not being on the PlayStation because that doesn't make any sense.

48:38.187 --> 48:43.250
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a PlayStation or something like that?

48:44.671 --> 48:44.871
[SPEAKER_01]: This...

48:45.558 --> 48:46.479
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:02.461 --> 49:04.143
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!

49:20.051 --> 49:21.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did that happen in the first place?

49:21.492 --> 49:22.273
[SPEAKER_02]: That is stupid.

49:22.413 --> 49:26.235
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts because they have a crazy looking Yoda.

49:26.275 --> 49:27.456
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks stupid.

49:27.576 --> 49:31.238
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at the screenshots of like Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever.

49:31.279 --> 49:33.060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going like, I just rolled my eyes.

49:33.100 --> 49:34.401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this looks dumb.

49:35.081 --> 49:37.823
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.

49:37.883 --> 49:38.403
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

49:38.463 --> 49:40.925
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear what their original intent was?

49:41.085 --> 49:46.709
[SPEAKER_01]: The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fighting characters.

49:47.189 --> 49:48.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

49:48.210 --> 49:49.771
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to ruin his own franchise.

49:51.474 --> 49:52.017
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next, Klonoa?

49:55.831 --> 49:57.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Planoa would be awesome, though.

49:57.532 --> 49:58.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw you!

49:58.392 --> 50:02.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like... You know, Planoa is one of my favorite games ever.

50:02.754 --> 50:05.275
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.

50:05.496 --> 50:07.817
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cool to have Link in it.

50:07.997 --> 50:09.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Link made sense.

50:09.437 --> 50:14.400
[SPEAKER_02]: Link, also a swordsy and, you know, swords and sorcery type of character.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.440
[SPEAKER_02]: Hahachi?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I can... We'll let that one slide.

50:18.401 --> 50:18.882
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

50:18.902 --> 50:21.523
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has he had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?

50:22.495 --> 50:25.097
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a Soul Calibur character forever!

50:25.117 --> 50:26.918
[SPEAKER_02]: At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.

50:28.159 --> 50:30.141
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually has a diaper.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.782
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what they're doing?

50:32.022 --> 50:36.325
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking this over like they did with Tekken, where they just start putting all this ridiculous shit in there.

50:36.786 --> 50:39.708
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears.

50:39.768 --> 50:41.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken has always been that way, though.

50:42.830 --> 50:46.513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken, because they can.

50:46.753 --> 50:49.555
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb, too.

50:50.223 --> 50:51.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I don't know.

50:51.164 --> 50:53.326
[SPEAKER_02]: A panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.

50:53.506 --> 51:00.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in... Oh, my God.

51:01.273 --> 51:02.674
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?

51:02.935 --> 51:03.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

51:03.315 --> 51:03.996
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.

51:04.776 --> 51:09.400
[SPEAKER_03]: And Devil and Angel and everybody, and Gold Banjo's his secret character, your mom.

51:09.921 --> 51:12.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night, Devil Jin was awesome, by the way.

51:13.544 --> 51:15.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not ever...

51:15.720 --> 51:16.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop on Devil Jam.

51:38.952 --> 51:45.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before the chatroom jumps, I know there already was one back on the PlayStation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.

51:45.536 --> 51:49.679
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you make a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good game now.

51:49.739 --> 51:50.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

51:50.660 --> 51:53.642
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.

51:53.662 --> 51:55.123
[SPEAKER_02]: There were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?

51:55.223 --> 51:57.465
[SPEAKER_02]: These games have been coming out forever.

51:57.745 --> 52:05.511
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know, like using the Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.

52:06.374 --> 52:08.295
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be all kinds of awesome.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.

52:10.896 --> 52:12.777
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of awesome, because I love Soul Calibur.

52:13.857 --> 52:17.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in my live journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really like other fighting games.

52:18.279 --> 52:18.539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

52:19.780 --> 52:21.020
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.

52:21.040 --> 52:23.021
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Gon from Tekken 3.

52:24.081 --> 52:29.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.

52:30.664 --> 52:32.625
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.

52:33.783 --> 52:39.471
[SPEAKER_02]: God, oh, and you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2 is there's the crappy spin-off games happening too, like the Legends game.

52:40.112 --> 52:40.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um...

52:41.943 --> 52:42.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Death by playing this game.

53:06.178 --> 53:07.199
[SPEAKER_01]: Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.

53:07.219 --> 53:09.861
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.

53:10.181 --> 53:14.785
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game with massive boobage, and this game will move...

53:35.919 --> 53:37.800
[SPEAKER_02]: A zillion copies on the first day.

53:38.320 --> 53:39.020
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you wait.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark my words.

53:44.682 --> 53:48.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Teras Kasi.

53:49.023 --> 53:51.224
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it to slumber in its grave.

53:51.384 --> 53:52.644
[SPEAKER_02]: No zombie apocalypse.

53:56.918 --> 54:01.143
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

54:01.183 --> 54:02.064
[SPEAKER_02]: They will cut through them.

54:02.364 --> 54:03.926
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.

54:04.287 --> 54:04.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

54:04.947 --> 54:06.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read that the way it should have been read.

54:07.150 --> 54:10.293
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

54:10.313 --> 54:14.818
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

54:14.878 --> 54:15.900
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seriously.

54:18.011 --> 54:20.552
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to apply real world physics?

54:21.932 --> 54:24.853
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I even calling the Star Wars universe real world physics?

54:24.873 --> 54:26.233
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just say Jedi physics?

54:26.794 --> 54:28.214
[SPEAKER_01]: No, real world physics.

54:28.354 --> 54:28.974
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

54:29.174 --> 54:30.255
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Jedi physics.

54:30.795 --> 54:33.015
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make me even more retarded.

54:33.836 --> 54:34.916
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, who cares?

54:35.056 --> 54:36.056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fucking game.

54:36.416 --> 54:39.897
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.

54:40.698 --> 54:41.578
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do need, though...

54:42.199 --> 54:43.840
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to get some Star Trek characters.

54:43.880 --> 54:44.661
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see Kirk.

54:44.801 --> 54:45.162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

54:45.202 --> 54:46.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirk versus Picard.

54:46.222 --> 54:47.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's settle this shit right now.

54:48.124 --> 54:49.065
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be funny.

54:49.926 --> 54:50.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see that.

54:50.987 --> 54:53.429
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.

54:54.049 --> 54:55.971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done up like one of those motivational posters.

54:56.631 --> 54:58.373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a picture of Kirk just grinning.

54:59.113 --> 55:01.836
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.

55:02.521 --> 55:05.942
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it.

55:06.022 --> 55:11.404
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Kirk, I want to see Adam West playing Adam West and, you know, just weird shit like that.

55:11.724 --> 55:12.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki Fighter 2008?

55:12.605 --> 55:13.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

55:13.585 --> 55:14.686
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

55:15.706 --> 55:16.066
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

55:18.407 --> 55:22.368
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

55:23.609 --> 55:24.829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, let me re-read that.

55:25.370 --> 55:28.211
[SPEAKER_02]: The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

55:31.553 --> 55:33.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Please let's change the topic, pretty please.

55:33.782 --> 55:35.429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my turn, it sure is.

55:35.730 --> 55:36.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft...

55:37.244 --> 55:38.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility

56:04.918 --> 56:11.407
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible, but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.

56:11.427 --> 56:16.274
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy new games, or better yet, don't sell off your old system.

56:16.354 --> 56:17.055
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

56:17.516 --> 56:18.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem solved.

56:18.377 --> 56:20.981
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah.

56:21.496 --> 56:32.107
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially in light of now that they've launched this download Xbox Originals thing where they can charge more money for games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.

56:32.427 --> 56:35.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they do an update, and watch this, this is what they'll do.

56:35.754 --> 56:38.675
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.

56:39.035 --> 56:41.956
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll only update it to do a download game or something.

56:42.256 --> 56:49.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat.

56:50.378 --> 56:56.979
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, that's really the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games because, you know, they're a good workout, right?

56:57.439 --> 57:00.340
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?

57:00.600 --> 57:01.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Diminishing Returns

57:18.564 --> 57:19.685
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:41.550 --> 57:43.050
[SPEAKER_01]: are probably pretty damn cheap right now.

57:43.070 --> 57:48.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds and they're like an eyesore in my living room.

57:48.331 --> 57:50.372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.

57:52.312 --> 57:54.012
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still have an original Xbox.

57:54.092 --> 57:55.012
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and you know where it is?

57:55.052 --> 57:56.253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in that drawer right there.

57:56.333 --> 57:57.913
[SPEAKER_02]: The closed drawer right there.

57:57.973 --> 58:01.434
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and how often do you play Xbox games?

58:01.574 --> 58:04.894
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible.

58:05.974 --> 58:06.374
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not.

58:07.515 --> 58:08.475
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just Konami.

58:08.495 --> 58:09.055
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like you.

58:10.354 --> 58:12.035
[SPEAKER_03]: We sometimes break out our old stuff.

58:12.955 --> 58:14.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're crazy.

58:14.176 --> 58:16.757
[SPEAKER_02]: You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.

58:16.777 --> 58:18.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?

58:18.277 --> 58:18.477
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

58:18.797 --> 58:21.198
[SPEAKER_03]: The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.

58:21.858 --> 58:22.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

58:22.919 --> 58:23.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

58:23.379 --> 58:25.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.

58:25.520 --> 58:33.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin today.

58:33.283 --> 58:34.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Dust off the Genesis.

58:34.323 --> 58:34.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it out.

58:35.524 --> 58:36.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, we do that.

58:37.239 --> 58:39.540
[SPEAKER_03]: CES Force Feedback Suit by TN Games

58:59.213 --> 59:28.216
[SPEAKER_03]: because it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets punched in the chest you'll feel it as just pressure and it's meant for it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out so

59:31.126 --> 59:43.770
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for a light hit or blow air past you if something misses you.

59:44.511 --> 59:50.913
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more for complete... I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why anyone would want one.

59:51.893 --> 59:53.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.

59:53.713 --> 59:58.515
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an airzooka while I play a game.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw the airzooka, I'll just have a can.

01:00:01.524 --> 01:00:06.727
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have those, I don't remember, like, ambient effects or something like that.

01:00:06.827 --> 01:00:11.850
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:17.493
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.

01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:22.116
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on what's in the game.

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:26.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm laughing at Rob with two Bs in the chat room.

01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:28.000
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, how does it play with Rez?

01:00:28.643 --> 01:00:29.363
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

01:00:29.483 --> 01:00:30.063
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be funny.

01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:30.863
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun.

01:00:34.204 --> 01:00:34.664
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:00:35.364 --> 01:00:36.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep moving.

01:00:36.364 --> 01:00:38.245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.

01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:47.006
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.

01:00:48.346 --> 01:00:48.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

01:00:49.127 --> 01:00:51.947
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now you're not off to a good start.

01:00:52.467 --> 01:00:54.047
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean, most reliable?

01:00:55.088 --> 01:00:55.808
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:00:56.168 --> 01:00:57.088
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically says...

01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:02.075
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.

01:01:02.295 --> 01:01:05.355
[SPEAKER_01]: Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.

01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:07.296
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.

01:01:07.996 --> 01:01:15.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Does most reliable mean like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?

01:01:17.197 --> 01:01:17.577
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:01:18.177 --> 01:01:27.519
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how they can claim that even... I understand that they want to be the most reliable, but I want to be rich in the

01:01:28.598 --> 01:01:33.911
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable, so I don't know.

01:01:35.615 --> 01:01:36.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well,

01:01:37.016 --> 01:01:42.437
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox Originals will make its way to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:01:42.457 --> 01:01:45.378
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Takedown.

01:01:45.418 --> 01:01:48.619
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:54.840
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries in the long-running Burnout series.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout Paradise or anything like that, but...

01:02:00.263 --> 01:02:06.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th to the Xbox 360 consoles, the downloadable original.

01:02:06.567 --> 01:02:10.350
[SPEAKER_02]: It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about $14.99.

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:16.714
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:20.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?

01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:24.278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Burnout 3, I liked it better than Revenge anyway.

01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:26.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommend it if you don't have it.

01:02:27.433 --> 01:02:28.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Take Down is a good game.

01:02:28.414 --> 01:02:29.535
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also recommend it.

01:02:29.575 --> 01:02:32.917
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays well on the backwards compatibility and all that good stuff.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:43.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer that got pooped on?

01:02:43.864 --> 01:02:45.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy.

01:02:45.645 --> 01:02:47.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened... Oh, yeah, I know what happened.

01:02:49.268 --> 01:02:53.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else left GameSpot, too, because of that, earlier this week.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked...

01:02:56.616 --> 01:02:58.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Gershman as why he was leaving.

01:02:58.557 --> 01:02:59.437
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny though?

01:02:59.457 --> 01:03:02.659
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been like some other independent reviewers also leaving.

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:07.362
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, I don't care what you're trying to like, you know, be all noble and stuff.

01:03:07.422 --> 01:03:08.602
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have done it before you.

01:03:08.642 --> 01:03:09.062
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

01:03:09.963 --> 01:03:15.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the game in question, Kane and Lynch, Dead Men, sold a million copies.

01:03:16.646 --> 01:03:24.510
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind of stuff on the internet.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.631
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably helped.

01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:28.904
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what the drama's about.

01:03:29.064 --> 01:03:33.286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.

01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:35.947
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as bad press.

01:03:36.227 --> 01:03:36.867
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

01:03:36.887 --> 01:03:40.229
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:42.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki made a really big funny.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:44.471
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:47.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:03:47.672 --> 01:03:47.952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:03:49.757 --> 01:03:53.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think parents just bought this game for their kids.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, you really shouldn't buy this game for your kids.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.662
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas tree, but quite a few people, apparently.

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:01.304
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure kids have it because their parents don't care.

01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:06.927
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Billy wants King Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for him.

01:04:07.728 --> 01:04:10.029
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this M mean on the front of the package?

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:12.550
[SPEAKER_00]: M means it's... Must have.

01:04:13.931 --> 01:04:15.112
[SPEAKER_00]: It's magnificent.

01:04:15.632 --> 01:04:16.913
[SPEAKER_00]: M for magnificent, okay.

01:04:19.537 --> 01:04:29.266
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess I don't know why they're doing it, but they did.

01:04:29.826 --> 01:04:36.272
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, RezHD will be supporting... I'm sorry, this is too good.

01:04:36.632 --> 01:04:38.654
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, oh, M is for minors.

01:04:39.654 --> 01:04:40.015
[SPEAKER_01]: Minors?

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:41.336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.

01:04:41.812 --> 01:04:42.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead.

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:48.934
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rez HD is going to be supporting trans-vibration in the form of your other controllers.

01:04:49.314 --> 01:04:52.034
[SPEAKER_01]: So one person can play and three other people can be pleasured.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:52.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:59.276
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers.

01:04:59.456 --> 01:05:01.496
[SPEAKER_02]: One to play the game, three in your pants.

01:05:01.696 --> 01:05:04.457
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they support just the Rez trans-vibrator?

01:05:04.517 --> 01:05:08.338
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a USB device, and if they built in the driver for it...

01:05:10.396 --> 01:05:10.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they?

01:05:10.956 --> 01:05:12.016
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that would be kind of cool.

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:23.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so they're going to spend money to engineer this whole stupid thing on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans vibrator.

01:05:23.959 --> 01:05:25.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.700
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually don't.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.321
[SPEAKER_02]: See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one.

01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:31.181
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now.

01:05:33.022 --> 01:05:33.902
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking for one.

01:05:35.587 --> 01:05:37.750
[SPEAKER_02]: And cue the emails of everybody who has one.

01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:38.431
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, though.

01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:44.199
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone will just reverse engineer a trans-vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that.

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.683
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like a dildo or something like that.

01:05:47.305 --> 01:06:12.807
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week during listless remember how we were doing the listless and it was the gadgets we most want to see at CES remember the Foreman grill that grills the entire cow one we had the holodeck in there remember SSJ100 Matt his entire list got eliminated and his list was gone one of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator

01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:13.970
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we don't need it.

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.971
[SPEAKER_01]: We have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.

01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:26.177
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually announced, in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now... I don't know why you would need the trans-vibrator anyways.

01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:32.140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird, but... Well, congratulations, SSJ100Matt, for being correct.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:41.225
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun, though, to put the controller on stuff that rattles, like my coffee table and stuff like that, so it'll be really loud and annoying.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.110
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure your wife will love that.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.750
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:58.715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.

01:06:58.755 --> 01:06:59.155
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:03.777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic video game of the week brought to us by DarkSakura.

01:07:03.797 --> 01:07:06.478
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what game have you picked for the masses this week?

01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:09.680
[SPEAKER_03]: The game of the week is Bongaio.

01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:14.829
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure game on top of that which makes it even more awesome.

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:17.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Two treasure games in a row.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:18.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha.

01:07:19.011 --> 01:07:19.631
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do that.

01:07:20.151 --> 01:07:20.471
[SPEAKER_03]: I can.

01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:28.635
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan and it has come out on the Dreamcast.

01:07:30.095 --> 01:07:36.898
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played a bunch of it.

01:07:36.978 --> 01:07:38.659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really crazy because like

01:07:39.324 --> 01:07:47.387
[SPEAKER_03]: You go around and, well, actually I think it's kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version was a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.

01:07:47.888 --> 01:07:48.468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

01:07:48.788 --> 01:07:51.169
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:58.352
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can...

01:07:59.167 --> 01:08:04.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Do like a bajillion shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.

01:08:04.611 --> 01:08:11.656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that the maximum number of bullets you personally can shoot out at one time is like 400, I think.

01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:16.659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.422
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you think about everything else that's going on in the game...

01:08:23.582 --> 01:08:26.324
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense, you get a lot of action going on at one time.

01:08:27.745 --> 01:08:31.608
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Dreamcast, it makes you change this from the Nintendo 64 version.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:43.477
[SPEAKER_03]: You have sort of an explosion counter instead of the combo system, and you don't have a shot that you can device up with the Nintendo 64 version.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Your special attacks are based on...

01:08:49.451 --> 01:08:51.772
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of incoming fire.

01:08:51.852 --> 01:08:53.352
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to charge for it.

01:08:53.392 --> 01:08:56.413
[SPEAKER_03]: The more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:03.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, also all the characters were equalized as far as their power is concerned.

01:09:03.654 --> 01:09:05.074
[SPEAKER_03]: There's additional bosses.

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:09.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Two new enemies, which are a flamethrower and a giant egg.

01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:12.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little things, you know, graphical changes.

01:09:14.256 --> 01:09:17.577
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a sequel that came out, which was...

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.502
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:53.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have actually once played Nintendo 64, but there are some differences.

01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:56.035
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think Nintendo 64 is a lot more balanced.

01:09:56.736 --> 01:09:57.056
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:09:57.677 --> 01:10:00.159
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bungaio.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:01.841
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:02.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Play it.

01:10:03.237 --> 01:10:07.521
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio this week.

01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:09.883
[SPEAKER_02]: But fear not, the show isn't done just yet.

01:10:09.903 --> 01:10:13.906
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to come back and we're going to have ourselves a Part B. And in Part B we're going to talk about a lot of other stuff.

01:10:13.926 --> 01:10:17.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the DS, we're going to talk a little bit about Assassin's Creed.

01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:20.892
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about Bionic Commando possibly coming to a Nintendo system as well.

01:10:21.312 --> 01:10:27.177
[SPEAKER_02]: And a very cool feature for Disney World travelers that could be coming to the DS very soon.

01:10:27.197 --> 01:10:30.400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all coming up tonight in Part B. So stay tuned.

01:10:31.235 --> 01:10:36.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

01:10:36.678 --> 01:10:40.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
