0	2640	Alright, anything else you want to add to your gaming week, DarkSakura?
2640	3300	Nope.
3300	5620	Then let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
5620	7700	My gaming week was fine.
7700	11040	I played a little bit of
11040	15280	Nitro Bike this week because I was anticipating it was going to be awesome and
15280	19680	all that stuff for the week because, you know, they're kind of comparing it to Excite Truck.
19680	24960	It is not even close to Excite Truck and it's also not even close to being good, so
24960	26680	unfortunately it sucked.
26680	28000	And what ways did it suck?
28000	33220	It sucked because the tracks weren't really open enough like Excite Truck.
33220	35280	The game itself
35280	38400	wasn't very fun because you can do tricks
38400	40600	in the air and stuff, but
40600	44760	I mean really there's no need to be doing any sort of variety of tricks because you can do
44760	49360	the same trick over and over and get the same kind of bonus for it, which is more Nitro.
49360	51000	But the fact is the
51000	55860	tracks aren't really straight enough anyways to where you would need the Nitro, so
55860	58240	it was kind of dumb.
58240	63080	They tried and they failed. The other thing though that I do not like about a lot of these
63080	65700	racing games
65700	69720	is that unlike Excite Truck, which you hold the Wii Remote kind of, you know,
69720	71180	parallel to the ground,
71180	76080	a lot of these games will have it where you're holding it on its side so that, you know, you can
76080	78420	use those really crappy plastic
78420	81440	steering wheel controllers.
81440	85560	And I really hate having to hold it like that because it makes it really uncomfortable
85560	88960	for your hands because you have to twist your whole wrist back and stuff.
88960	91280	Excite Truck is just awesome, what can I say.
91280	96760	Then on purpose I played Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, which is
96760	99040	a game that got reviewed on
99040	103840	IGN giving it a 1.5.
103840	107280	Yeah, it's deserving of that. It was just really bad.
107280	112600	Basically your vehicles in the game kind of control like crap,
112600	117800	very sluggish, and I had trouble staying on the track because of that.
117800	120960	But it was fun to get to play it, I guess.
120960	124720	Then, not so crappy games, I got to play
124720	129760	Burnout Paradise, which I'm very surprised,
129760	130780	the game
130780	133020	I didn't think was going to be that good
133020	137960	when I played the demo. It didn't seem like something I would like,
137960	142400	but playing the full version of the game, I was completely wrong.
142400	145600	Absolutely the best Burnout game in the series so far.
145600	150160	Personally for me, number three was my favorite. This is very much like
150160	153600	number three. The takedowns are a little bit easier like three was.
153600	158800	Very fast, I like the ability to drive anywhere in the entire game. Plus,
158800	162860	the best part of the entire game is the Showtime mode, which basically,
162860	166280	for all those people complaining that there's no crash mode anymore, well you can
166280	170640	activate crash mode anytime you want. Just absolutely, you're driving down the street,
170640	172480	oh look, there's a bunch of cars, hit the buttons,
172480	176200	and you just roll, and you keep rolling, smashing through cars,
176200	179880	and you can travel like thousands and thousands and thousands of feet
179880	183720	down the street and just smashing into the stuff.
183720	186320	It's absolutely fun.
186320	189680	Now, is it just, the game's a little more like test drive, right? Where you're
189680	192420	kinda driving in this free world and then you can pull up to something to
192420	193240	start a race?
193240	196440	Sort of, not really. Can you pick up chicks too?
196440	199520	No. Like you couldn't test drive at all? No, but
199520	203160	the game, the only thing that's kind of weird though is you have to crash some of the,
203160	207480	or you have to take down certain cars if you want to unlock them, so you basically
207480	209920	unlock them, they'll drive around the city, and you have to find them.
209920	213320	And a lot of times it's hard to find those cars, and in fact,
213320	217600	usually I notice, you know, a car will zoom past me and start driving crazy, and I'm like,
217600	218840	okay, that's one of the cars,
218840	223880	and so I'll chase after it and stuff, but it's just pretty awesome, and the races are
223880	224600	pretty cool.
224600	228360	Also the music in the game, they have a great soundtrack in it.
228360	233280	Although the only flaw, they put Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in there, so I
233280	234880	guess there's gotta be something
234880	239520	for everybody, but it was a little weird driving and all of a sudden your girlfriend
239520	240520	comes on, it just felt
240520	244880	strange. But I highly recommend the game.
244880	248880	I'm going to be playing this for a long time. Very cool.
248880	253080	I'm actually looking forward to picking up this game too, I like the Burnout games. I'm not huge on a
253080	254600	lot of racing games, but I like
254600	257720	Burnout quite a bit. I want to try the online, but the servers, I guess, are not up right now.
257720	262160	Well, seeing as the game isn't totally out yet, that might make sense, why?
262160	266880	Yeah. Oh, and then Product Placement, there's a ton of it.
266880	270160	There's vans driving around with like Axe and
270160	273680	Gillette and all sorts of weird shit on them. Like manly ads.
273680	277360	Yeah, but you can crash into them, which is great.
277360	280880	It's like, oh, Product Placement, destroy!
280880	284760	It would be funnier if you got more points if you destroyed a Tampax
284760	286440	billboard or something, you know what I mean?
286440	289760	It's awesome though. Seriously, you drive
289760	293840	really fast through the game, they'll have like Stunt Mode and stuff. It's cool.
293840	298640	I just like, it's like, hee hee hee, you know, just crashing and stuff. I don't know, it's
298640	302040	hee hee fire. Exactly.
302040	305640	Did you try doing like your own custom soundtracks? Because you said you don't like Avril Lavigne or
305640	306600	whatever that's in there, but
306600	310440	like when I played the last Burnout game on 360, I just used custom soundtracks all the time.
310440	313760	I would basically use the music from Whangam Midnight Maximum Tune
313760	317960	to Burnout, and it was awesome. No, actually, I just, they have the EA tracks or whatever,
317960	321200	you can go in there and shut off which songs you don't like. So if you don't like Avril Lavigne,
321200	324760	you can just turn the track off and you'll never hear it again. That's a good function.
324760	328840	But, you know, actually what I did is I kept, and I may,
328840	332880	if I have to find it for my cage match, but I may pick this song. There's a song in there,
332880	337120	a remix by Jason Nevins that I've been having on repeat because
337120	340160	it was the song that they had in the trailer for and
340160	345160	it was, what was it, I want to say it was Taxi or something like that.
345160	349720	That really crappy movie with Queen Latifah and
349720	353120	Oh God, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, but it was a cool song though,
353120	356920	but they had it in the trailer and just racing to that song is pretty awesome.
356920	361640	I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. We actually have
361640	364280	two chat rooms now because we have the Justin TV chat too,
364280	367560	but I'm a little worse at being able to stay on top of that one, so we'll try
367560	369680	to read both chats, but I'm looking at our
369680	374440	main chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com and some predictions from Son of Dad for the
374440	375340	next Burnout game.
375340	378400	It's Britney, bitch. Maybe that'll be on the soundtrack.
378400	381840	Who knows? And that will be turned off as well.
381840	386440	I don't know, some Britney songs are actually kind of fun to drive to. They do
386440	389880	incite a lot of rage and the ability to crash into other cars.
389880	393720	I think the online mode is going to be pretty fun because
393720	396560	you know, I guess you can just turn it on where people are just racing around with
396560	398160	you and stuff which would be cool
398160	402080	because the game itself, I mean, just driving around is pretty fun.
402080	405160	So, I don't know, I like it.
405160	409280	Rice Princess, I know you've said you've been playing a lot of WoW this week while
409280	411240	you're sick. Is that it or are there other games?
411240	415080	Well, I got my Wii back online finally
415080	418440	because I had the brilliant idea of taking it over to Nathan's where he has
418440	423200	like a wireless connection. So we downloaded Alien Crush and
423200	426800	really he's been playing that more than me. Good taste. Yeah.
426800	431200	I played more Actraiser. What else did I play? I love Actraiser.
431200	434920	I know, Actraiser is so good. Doesn't it have like the best music ever? It does.
434920	440400	Yuzo Koshiro is the man. Oh yeah, we have to get Devil's Crush too.
440400	444200	Well, that's up there now too, huh? Well, I just remembered that we played a bit of
444200	447160	Alien Crush at my house and then we had to hook up the TurboGrafx and play Devil's
447160	448760	Crush but now that it's there it's like, oh yeah.
448760	452400	I know, seriously, like, because Alien Crush is addictive.
452400	457520	I got to 64 on my Ork Hunter and wow,
457520	461160	whoop dee doo. Nothing super exciting, nothing new.
461160	465800	But you are wearing a Silent Hill shirt. Are you excited for Silent Hill 5?
465800	469680	Yes, I am. Rumor is it's going to be out by summer. Really? I hope that's true.
469680	472720	I hope it is too. Did you check out Silent Hill Origins on PSP at all?
472720	476400	No, I don't have a PSP. I know, but I figured maybe you stole someone else's, I don't know.
476400	480360	Yeah, that's a good idea. Ask William. I bought him one for his birthday, he never plays it.
480360	484480	Really? Yeah, but also, well, also take note that Silent Hill Origins is coming out on
484480	485680	the PlayStation 2 very soon.
485680	488800	Oh my. So you can just play it on PS2.
488800	492360	Hmm, that's an idea. Decision, decision. Someone needs to play
492360	496520	the other Silent Hill games. Is that
496520	500200	Nathan you're looking at? Maybe. Oh, Nathan, care to defend yourself? Maybe tell us a
500200	501320	little bit about your gaming week?
501320	504600	I have never played a Silent Hill in my life.
504600	508960	Have you played Resident Evil? I wouldn't say played
508960	513600	so much as died a lot. Alright.
513600	517360	Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Nathan? Alien Crush
517360	521560	a lot. I don't even know what the point of the game is besides points,
521560	525960	but that's all that I care about is more. You just want to keep your ball alive
525960	529720	is what you want to do. I try to keep as many balls as possible.
529720	532960	In play at the same time? Sure. Alright. It's pinball.
532960	538360	It's the point. Anything else you've been up to this week in the gaming world?
538360	541880	Just today, my
541880	546800	level 58 Tauren Warrior went to Outlands.
546800	551160	Well, congratulations. Getting to Outlands is a really big deal for WoW nerds,
551160	555120	so congratulations. It's beautiful, really. Did you shed a tear a little bit when you
555120	556040	walked through the portal?
556040	559840	It's like your character's all grown up now? No, I just said woot.
559840	565560	Woot. Alright, good. Well, anyhow, feel free, you guys, to chime in
565560	567560	throughout the show as we talk about stories.
567560	570560	You know, your usual schtick, even though you're sick, Irene.
570560	574280	So, I do want to hear your opinion on things.
574280	577640	You're right, I don't. But I do want to hear the chat room opinion.
577640	580680	chat.orangelandradio.com
580680	584120	Let's see. Robert M says, I actually got both
584120	587440	Alien and Devil Crush, both very good video pinball titles.
587440	590800	You gotta get Sonic Spinball, too. I like that one for a pinball game. It's not as
590800	592000	good, but it's still fun.
592000	596480	It's fun-ish. Why are you making a scrunchy I don't like you face, Irene?
596480	602080	Whatever.
602080	604880	Just not your kind of game? I was trying to get the mic over you, it's not working.
604880	607920	Sorry. I'm tangling myself up. Alright.
607920	612000	Um, let's see.
612000	615600	You know what they need to do? What? We need a
615600	619800	a new Williams pinball collection or we need a
619800	623200	a Stern pinball collection.
623200	628080	Because Stern has the, um, I think has the licensing rights to Big Bang Bar.
628080	631800	Well, it was just like my favorite pinball table.
631800	635760	You want a Big Bang Bar machine. And the Pirates pinball.
635760	640200	And the Spider-Man pinball that just came out. Whatever happened to,
640200	643480	I remember you talking about this at one of the pinball shows you went to, and I'm just curious if it ever
643480	645400	came out, but like something I heard about
645400	650160	where like they were going to take a high-def TV and put it on its side and lay it down so it was
650160	650680	like a
650680	653920	like a pinball table, like rectangular. They had six of them there. They're
653920	657600	their ultra-cade pinball is what they are.
657600	662720	And they're very, very cool, but I have to say, because what I did
662720	666320	is I went and played the virtual tables
666320	670400	and then I went back to play the actual pins, because a lot of them were there.
670400	673440	And they're pretty close.
673440	676920	The physics in them are very, very good.
676920	683360	But there's just something not right. But each of them, I think, held like six tables
683360	687560	and I think there's a capacity for more. Sounds interesting.
687560	691120	It was very interesting, but you couldn't get like, you'd only be able to do like
691120	695120	certain pins, like there's the standard two flipper,
695120	698960	you know, start button, whatever, unless you had something equipped
698960	702000	that had the other buttons mapped, like for things with double flippers
702000	705400	where you have to have two sets of flipper, two controls for it,
705400	708720	or like a special,
708720	711400	like the MagnaBall, for example, on...
711400	716400	One of those tables that we can't remember.
716400	720120	I know it is. It's like one that you hit the button and it catches the ball before it drains.
720120	723600	And I want to say, I know it's not on...
723600	726480	I want to say that it was on...
726480	730120	Whodunnit had one. But like,
730120	733600	things like that, it would be a little bit more difficult.
733600	737240	They'd have to find a way to map it. Or the cannon button
737240	740840	on Black Rose.
740840	744680	I want to read some other things in chat room right now. Not related to pinball,
744680	745680	unfortunately, but
745680	749920	something about the burnout. We were talking about the custom soundtracks and SSJ100 Matt
749920	750240	said,
750240	753320	I'm waiting for the next OLR listener to suggest Dragon Force.
753320	757240	That would be an amazing soundtrack to put as a custom soundtrack to a burnout. We'll see what
757240	757680	happens.
757680	762120	Anyhow, we're about to get into the gaming news for the week, but first,
762120	766480	a quick housekeeping. As many of the folks in our live chat are noticing, we have moved
766480	770880	from operator 11 to a new service called Justin.tv. So hello to all the
770880	775560	Justin.tv people. The cool thing about Justin.tv is that we now are no
775560	777040	longer limited to 40 minutes
777040	781280	for a section of the show. We pretty much have unlimited. I am noticing some folks
781280	784580	already having problems. That's probably because the cam is running off the Wi-Fi
784580	785280	right now.
785280	788680	So until I get a splitter out here to run the regular
788680	792440	line through, it may be a little bit choppy, and I think it's causing
792440	793680	buffering or whatever. But
793680	797000	remember, the video isn't the main part of our show. We're trying to do a radio show.
797000	797800	So
797800	801240	audio is the most important part, and that way it gets out there to the podcast and all that.
801240	801600	But
801600	805200	the other cool thing about Justin.tv is it does archive everything, so you can kind of
805200	808400	go back and watch corresponding video to a show. So if something particularly
808400	809720	hilarious happens,
809720	812880	then actually what can happen is that one of our listeners can set it as a
812880	813600	highlight,
813600	816280	and then people can go back and watch just the highlights. So that's kind of
816280	817680	interesting. We'll have to see how that works out.
817680	821960	So Justin.tv, and our username on Justin.tv, of course, is OrangeLoungeRadio.
821960	825960	So if you want to check out the cam right now, you just go to www.Justin.tv
825960	829560	slash OrangeLoungeRadio. Alright,
829560	834080	that's going to do it for housekeeping, so let's get into some gaming news, and we'll
834080	835480	start off tonight with
835480	838520	Loki. Anyways,
838520	842480	I'm sure this is going to come as a big shock to you, but
842480	845560	there's a certain game out there that's going to be delayed one month.
845560	850280	So yeah, Nintendo finally came out and said that, guess what, Smash Brothers is
850280	852080	delayed to March 9th,
852080	855280	and I'm sure that's the first time that you've ever heard of that,
855280	860200	ever. Lucky for the people in Japan, though, it is coming out the 31st of this
860200	860640	month.
860640	865880	Also lucky for me. So for all those people that import their games,
865880	868960	they're going to be plenty successful. They are a-okay.
868960	872920	But isn't it going to be very heavy on the Japanese? Is it going to be, are you going to be able to navigate through the game?
872920	875280	I think you'd be able to navigate through the game just fine.
875280	878760	It's a fighting game. That's true. It's not going to be that complex,
878760	881960	but there's so many different modes. Like if you've been watching what's going on
881960	882520	on the
882520	887960	dojo, there's so many different modes. That makes it even easier, though.
887960	891520	I don't think it's going to even matter as much with that, because
891520	895360	first of all, half the time they put up the text, it's going to be in hiragana,
895360	899960	I'm sorry, either hiragana or katakana, and then there's usually a language select
899960	902000	anyway for different regions.
902000	906080	Well, their excuse for it is they said that development is taking slightly longer than
906080	906920	expected,
906920	910040	which is bullshit, since it's coming out in Japan
910040	914080	already. So obviously development's done on it. It's localization.
914080	918480	It's either taking a long time, or they can't press enough copies fast enough, so
918480	921960	one of those.
921960	926040	Well, is it possible that maybe
926040	929360	there's, well, I guess that's localization. I was thinking maybe translation and all that stuff, but
929360	932840	people shouldn't read into this, like, OMG, they went back and added a new
932840	935200	character or something like that. No. They're not adding a new character.
935200	939480	So, do you think there might be any secret characters that they've been sitting on that they
939480	940600	haven't announced yet? I think so, yeah.
940600	944280	I hope the eggplant wizard's in it, because I love Kid Icarus.
944280	947840	Well, I mean, look at, they didn't announce all the new characters. Why are you
947840	951600	laughing at the eggplant wizard, Nathan? I'm thinking of Captain N.
951600	954840	Well, like, you know, Captain N,
954840	958880	Captain N should be in it! Game & Watch, or Mr. Game & Watch, he was a secret character,
958880	963720	that they never talked about before, so you never know. Mr. Game & Watch is awesome.
963720	967560	Well, if eggplant wizard doesn't make it to Super Smash Brothers, perhaps it will
967560	970040	make it to the rumored, emphasis on rumored,
970040	973520	Kid Icarus game that is being worked on by Factor 5
973520	978360	for the Nintendo Wii. Rumors are abounding this week, and Go Nintendo is
978360	980360	reporting that Factor 5
980360	983900	has been offered up the license from Nintendo to make
983900	988360	a Kid Icarus game, or Kid Icarus, however you want to pronounce it, because that was
988360	990920	always a point of contention that, you know, people never knew exactly how to
990920	991680	pronounce the game.
991680	997680	But, Icarus? Well, regardless, Factor 5 made some previous games on the
997680	1001640	GameCube. I believe they did, um, they did
1001640	1005360	Star Fox, right? Didn't they do the Star Fox game?
1005360	1008640	They may have. I think so. So, anyhow,
1008640	1011960	I'll be very excited. Didn't they do Fire Emblem? Perhaps.
1011960	1015360	I don't remember. Yeah,
1015360	1018640	but, well, Factor 5 is not Fire Emblem. No.
1018640	1021560	No, Fire Emblem wasn't Capcom. Huh.
1021560	1024800	Are you thinking Breath of Fire? Breath of Fire was Capcom. Yeah.
1024800	1029440	Alright, so, well, anyhow, regardless, I am very excited at the potential of
1029440	1030840	having a new Kid Icarus game
1030840	1034400	out there. I just hope they don't kinda, like, screw it up.
1034400	1038320	I don't know. I don't want it to be 3D or any of that stuff. You just kinda know that
1038320	1038840	things
1038840	1042800	gonna be inevitable. Of course, Chat Room saves the day when we forget things.
1042800	1047200	Shadow Next Gen says Factor 5 did the Rogue Squadron games. There you go.
1047200	1050680	Alright, anyhow, uh, let's move on.
1050680	1054920	Well, in other news, let's see, wasn't that professional.
1054920	1058320	Um, for anybody who keeps up with the, um,
1058320	1062720	results of video game system sales, it has, uh,
1062720	1066400	been pretty clear that the Wii and DS
1066400	1070520	are outselling, um, the Xbox 360 as far as units,
1070520	1073800	but, um, Microsoft is like, uh-uh, we made more money, so we win.
1073800	1079320	So, um, in fact, they've made, uh, 4.8 billion compared to, uh, 3.5 billion on
1079320	1079800	the Wii
1079800	1085400	and, uh, 2.2 billion on PS3. So, if you're just looking at money, um,
1085400	1088720	yeah, PS3 does not have it. Um,
1088720	1095480	they also, for the Xbox 360, they've, uh, sold 4.62 million units. That's just
1095480	1096240	pretty cool.
1096240	1099600	Um, PS2, um, sold 3.97
1099600	1102720	million, uh, PSP 3.82 million,
1102720	1105760	and the PS3, uh, sold 2.56 million
1105760	1109020	for its first year. A lot of that money stuff has to do with the fact, though, that the
1109020	1110280	Nintendo Wii, they make
1110280	1114000	quite a bit of money off every sales of those, whereas, uh, Microsoft and Sony still
1114000	1114660	lose money
1114660	1118780	on everyone. Yeah, I think, I think that, yeah, so I think that for,
1118780	1123240	if they're saying that, if Microsoft is saying that they've made more money
1123240	1127280	with what they lose in production, then
1127280	1131220	overall, yeah, they are, I'd have to say they're definitely having to move a lot
1131220	1131960	more units,
1131960	1136620	but I don't see where the, but the Wii is clearly selling
1136620	1140000	the, like, crazy if they're having trouble stocking them. And this is only,
1140000	1143460	this is only the numbers for 2007, too. Obviously, you know,
1143460	1147160	Xbox 360 is still number one in the US, although,
1147160	1151540	worldwide, the Wii is number one. Are people still crazy about Wii? Are they
1151540	1154320	still hard to find? Yes, they're still hard to find. Wow.
1154320	1157880	What happened with the rain check program the GameStop was supposed to be doing?
1157880	1162320	Well, I don't know, I'm just kinda curious, like, I'm just kinda throwing it out there. I remember
1162320	1164200	they were gonna have all these systems
1164200	1167820	for these people who ordered rain checks, and now the system is still hard to get.
1167820	1168680	I still think that,
1168680	1173640	I mean, I'm sure that was successful for them, but, I don't know, maybe
1173640	1176460	gave them a little bit more attention. I don't think that they got any more than they
1176460	1177560	would have normally gotten
1177560	1180680	anyways. Maybe a little bit, because I know that,
1180680	1185520	you know, distribution didn't get as many Wii systems in January because of
1185520	1189720	this whole rain check program, but I don't think it's
1189720	1194040	a lot, you know, it's not like, dude, they're not like getting like four million systems.
1194040	1196600	Yeah, I don't know how many people that affected, but I'm just kinda
1196600	1199600	curious, because I remember throwing that story out there, and it was kinda like, well, what if
1199600	1201600	Wii's are still really hard to come by in January,
1201600	1205120	which it seems like they are. I don't know, but,
1205120	1208480	yeah, it's still hard to find,
1208480	1212680	and it probably will be for a while. Chat Room to the Rescue, yet again, JV Mon is
1212680	1215960	in there, chat.orangelandradio.com, and says, Rob, I work at GameStop,
1215960	1219880	we filled all the pre-orders already, and are already got extras to sell to people.
1219880	1223080	So, there you go. We got the same amount we did November to December.
1223080	1228280	We're still cranking them out there. Well, as far as what the games did themselves, Halo 3 was at the top,
1228280	1231920	had 4.82 million, and Wii Play was right behind it,
1231920	1235240	which I think was kinda funny. Call of Duty 4
1235240	1238680	followed that. Guitar Hero 3 on PS2 was behind that.
1238680	1242840	I think the only reason Wii Play did so well is because it was like controller,
1242840	1243520	plus
1243520	1248160	cheap games, and that made it stand out. And it's like Wii Sports, and people
1248160	1253000	love Wii Sports, and for a while there, it was hard to find remotes, and
1253000	1256400	that was the only way you could find it, so win-win-win.
1256400	1261060	Sneaky. We actually were at Fry's last week when I was having my computer
1261060	1261560	drama,
1261560	1265160	and there was a lady there trying to decide whether or not to buy Trauma Center or
1265160	1266200	buy Wii Play,
1266200	1269320	and she's like, wait, this has a controller with it, and put it down Trauma Center.
1269320	1273720	That was it. But Trauma Center's so awesome.
1273720	1276800	I know. It's all about the lowest common denominator.
1276800	1281540	For real, there it is right there. Nintendo's secret to success. It's all
1281540	1283160	about the lowest common denominator.
1283160	1286520	For real. Nintendo deer hunting, that's all.
1286520	1292440	That'll win. Let's move on. Anyways, Nintendo came out and announced a few dates
1292440	1296120	of titles coming out, and this is first and third party stuff.
1296120	1299440	For the first half of 2008,
1299440	1303960	some of which we probably already knew about, some I guess were surprising, I don't know.
1303960	1309480	Anyways, one game that was rumored to be coming out soon was Okami on the Wii.
1309480	1314800	That's been dated for the 25th. Wii Fit scheduled for Quarter 2,
1314800	1319640	which that would coincide with the supposed rumor from 1UP that
1319640	1323360	Wii Fit's supposed to come out May 2nd, or not 2nd, the 20th.
1323360	1329760	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, they're going to have some sequels coming out
1329760	1334000	for that in Quarter 2 as well. Crossword DS,
1334000	1337200	Nintendo Crosswords coming out May 5th,
1337200	1341100	and Professor Layton in the Curious Village, the
1341100	1344960	current number one selling DS title in Japan right now coming out
1344960	1348560	in the United States on February 10th.
1348560	1352440	Let's see, some other fun stuff for the Wii.
1352440	1357220	February 26th, The Masked Queen and The Tower of Mirrors, the Dragon Quest
1357220	1358680	Swords game.
1358680	1363200	Karaoke Revolution presents American Idol Encore.
1363200	1367640	That's coming out in the early part of February as well.
1367640	1370960	Let's see here.
1370960	1374920	Looks like a Poona is scheduled to be coming out from Koei. That's supposed to be a pretty good
1374920	1378960	role-playing game.
1378960	1383360	It sounds dirty, I'm sorry, I'm laughing over here like a three-year-old, but...
1383360	1386840	Poona, I just can't contain herself either.
1386840	1390080	Ironic. That's hilarious.
1390080	1395000	Strangely enough though in here, they have Nitro Bike from Ubisoft listed as
1395000	1396320	March.
1396320	1400200	Apparently they didn't realize it's already come out, so...
1400200	1405040	They didn't get the memo on that. And then, of course, April, we cannot forget
1405040	1406480	Wild Earth
1406480	1408240	African Safari
1408240	1410640	from Majesco, the rip-off of
1410640	1412260	Africa.
1412260	1415360	And Cooking Mama Cook-Off 2
1415360	1419720	in June, because I know the first one controlled so well. The Cooking Mama on Wii
1419720	1421360	was horrific,
1421360	1425240	but the DS one's still cool.
1425240	1428960	Another cool game that's on the Nintendo DS is Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.
1428960	1431080	That game was pretty awesome on the Nintendo DS.
1431080	1434360	And some screenshots, some rumored screenshots, have leaked from a new
1434360	1438040	Castlevania game, although we kind of emphasize this is only a rumor at this
1438040	1441520	time. However, it would really not be a surprise. It's kind of a no-brainer that
1441520	1445960	Konami would probably make a follow-up game to Portrait of Ruin at some point, a
1445960	1449340	new DS title. You might remember that the cool thing about Portrait of Ruin was
1449340	1453000	that you could use the Nintendo Wi-Fi service, but now it looks like that this
1453000	1456240	new Castlevania game, with some early screenshots that have been linked or to be
1456240	1457120	believed,
1457120	1458800	could possibly have
1458800	1460200	a Wii
1460200	1463520	connectivity feature built into it so that your DS interacts with your Wii
1463520	1465560	somehow. How?
1465560	1466920	Who knows?
1466920	1470900	It's unknown at this time, but apparently there's some type of Wii menu item
1470900	1473560	that's being seen in the screenshots
1473560	1474960	on the screen, so...
1474960	1477120	Would that imply that, you know,
1477120	1480600	there's going to be a Wii from Castlevania game coming out soon as well then?
1480600	1482480	I would think.
1482480	1484900	I hope so.
1484900	1489380	Because Castlevania is a good franchise, that's why.
1489380	1493240	I seem to remember, though, that the creator of Castlevania was not too
1493240	1496680	pleased with the Nintendo Wii when he first... You know, he didn't want it to be that
1496680	1497520	gimmicky,
1497520	1501320	oh, you're going to actually use the thing as a whip, oh, what the...
1501320	1505600	He fucking wears an ugly cowboy hat. I don't care. You know, he can suck it,
1505600	1506480	because
1506480	1509020	I would really like for one to be on the Wii.
1509020	1513280	But isn't that... I mean, that would be cheesy, though. They don't have to act like you can actually whip.
1513280	1517680	No one says that you... That's not cheesy at all. I would love that. No one says you can't have just a
1517680	1521120	traditional game on the Wii system. Exactly.
1521120	1524360	People just, for some reason, get it stuck in their heads that they've got to
1524360	1528460	make some, you know, motion control crap and stuff that go along with it.
1528460	1530040	You don't need to.
1530040	1534060	Look at, uh, what is it, you know, Super Paper Mario.
1534060	1537320	I mean, that didn't have two... I mean, it had some stuff, but
1537320	1539800	it was pretty much a traditional game.
1539800	1543840	Uh, MacMan, that says in chatroom, Castlevania whip carnival games.
1543840	1545660	There you go.
1545660	1549200	Why you don't applaud that?
1549200	1553800	First time in Belmont, or whatever, one of the Belmont crew has to, uh, tame lions or
1553800	1554880	something like that.
1554880	1559000	GS68 in our chatroom speculates,
1559000	1561840	uh, it's probably going to be Castlevania
1561840	1562920	W
1562920	1566840	of I, you know, because it has to be, you know, it's to say Wii, so he's suggesting
1566840	1569800	Castlevania Wind of Illness.
1569800	1573720	Does that sound Castlevania-esque to you? That's very Castlevania-esque. Very Castlevania-esque.
1573720	1578720	But does it have to be, like, a music, like, symphony, rondo, wind of incontinence?
1578720	1584480	The ones with the, with...
1584480	1587360	Well...
1587360	1589280	Sorry, JB, yes?
1589280	1591680	That really only applied to, well,
1591680	1595600	only applied to Dracula X.
1595600	1599360	To be technical, Symphony of the Night slash Nocturne in the Moonlight
1599360	1602840	was part of the Dracula X series, and all the other ones after that were just
1602840	1605800	Castlevania.
1605800	1610560	Well, also not all the games have been that, because Portrait are ruined. Portrait's not a music thing, so...
1610560	1614040	They could have Dracula, or, you know, part of the
1614040	1618000	Dracula triple X series, you know, and then the whips and chains get, you know, that's a
1618000	1621280	whole different part of the game. Those could excite some of the people.
1621280	1622800	Now you're talking!
1622800	1624800	I'd buy that. You know what I'd buy?
1624800	1629200	Well, I am sure we're going to get into this a little bit later. That's probably something Itagaki would be into, as well, right?
1629200	1631480	There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1631480	1638480	You can have to whip the cowboy hat off his head, because, you know...
1643160	1644840	Uh, anyhow...
1644840	1647400	Ew, this is a crappy game!
1647400	1650720	What? From Namco? It's listed as a game coming out in the summer.
1650720	1652820	Active Life Outdoor Challenge?
1652820	1654740	I'm sorry, I don't want to be active.
1654740	1656400	I refuse to buy that game.
1656400	1658240	I like being active.
1658240	1662260	They should have different types of interactive games like that.
1662260	1664920	Anyway, for
1664920	1666920	our friends in the UK, there are a
1666920	1671680	couple of things out for Virtual Console, and I'm very sorry for you all.
1671680	1673740	Well, I mean, one of them was okay, but
1673740	1674980	there's better.
1674980	1677480	Like, 1080 Snowboarding
1677480	1679500	from the Nintendo 64.
1679500	1682160	Yeah, it's out. I'm sorry.
1682160	1686340	And then Riot Zone for Turbo Duo. I'm really sorry.
1686340	1688280	Because it's, um...
1688280	1693480	not very good. So, sorry.
1693480	1696240	Or, you know, if you're feeling adventurous, you could just say, you know what? Forget
1696240	1698200	Jamie's opinion. I'm going to download it anyway.
1698200	1700200	If you want to download it and throw up,
1700200	1702240	be my guest.
1702240	1704320	Well, enjoy, or don't.
1704320	1709600	There is one game that's coming out on the WiiWare service at some point here.
1709600	1713860	That's actually being scheduled for the second quarter of 2008.
1713860	1717820	It's a game called Plachin, and it's kind of a
1717820	1720240	mix between a shooter and a puzzle game.
1720240	1723800	Now, what I thought was interesting is they were talking about some of the stuff
1723800	1725280	that it will support.
1725280	1726240	One thing,
1726240	1729920	they have a price point on it, which is going to be 1,500 Wii points, so you can kind of
1729920	1733400	expect a lot of these games to be around the $10, $20 range
1733400	1736600	instead of... Or $15 in that case.
1736600	1739680	Well, that's why that's a range, Rob.
1739680	1744360	Which, you see, it falls right in the middle of that range.
1744360	1746600	Alright, I understand basic math. I get it. I'm just saying.
1746600	1749240	You say $10 and $20, yeah, this game's going to be $15.
1749240	1750360	I'm just clarifying.
1750360	1753880	For our listeners who may not be following, because they fell asleep during your report because they
1753880	1756600	can't understand simple math. Are you insulting our listeners like that?
1756600	1760200	No, I would never.
1760200	1765440	Look, it's Nintendo's strategy, lowest common denominator, right?
1765440	1767080	I guess.
1767080	1771960	It's got some interesting stuff, though, in it. You can play it with the Wii Zapper,
1771960	1774080	although I don't know why.
1774080	1779920	You can play it offline with up to 12 people at the same time.
1779920	1784280	So I guess that would be one person uses a nunchuck, one person uses a remote,
1784280	1789100	and then also the four controllers, and then four GameCube controllers.
1789100	1791440	That's craziness.
1791440	1797280	I can't even fit that many people in my living room without breaking some type of fire hazard.
1797280	1800920	We did that once. Remember WarioWare? Eleven people.
1800920	1804320	That's right, but that was crazy. That was like a workout, because you had to run around.
1804320	1808320	There wasn't enough room in that room for people.
1808320	1810000	It supports DK Bongos.
1810000	1817000	There's finally another game that can utilize the DK Bongos.
1817000	1822760	And, apparently, they're also playing a...
1822760	1824920	Can you use a Guitar Hero 3 controller, too?
1824920	1827680	Oh, sure. Why not?
1827680	1828680	If you can use everything...
1828680	1829680	Maybe R-Mat?
1829680	1830680	Maybe.
1830680	1831680	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1831680	1835100	Actually, I'm sure you probably could, since, you know, it's...
1835100	1840640	That could be like the Ultimate Showdown. Twelve people. Twelve peripherals in the Ultimate
1840640	1842180	WiiWare Showdown.
1842180	1846820	Keep in mind, I think that it's actually pretty funny, because for me, who likes to find however
1846820	1850940	many different controllers will work on a different game? I mean, my friend was the
1850940	1852540	one who invented Rodcalibur.
1852540	1857600	But here's the thing, though. I mean, this will have, you know, a ton of different multiplayer
1857600	1862960	options and peripheral options, but what if the game sucks? You know, it's like, oh, great,
1862960	1866280	I can use all these controllers, but do we really want to play this game?
1866280	1869700	Now, are you sure it's a twelve player game, or is it somewhere in the range of ten to
1869700	1870700	fourteen players?
1870700	1875720	No, it's twelve players. It says, for support for twelve people, it does not say a range
1875720	1877420	of...
1877420	1881000	That's why they offer you different controller choices, so that you can change the nature
1881000	1885440	of the game. So, it's like, man, I hate playing it with the Zapper. I'm going to use the Bongo.
1885440	1889120	Hey, I like the Bongo. Then, those people are covered.
1889120	1893560	Anyways, I just thought it was interesting that they were talking about some of this
1893560	1897160	stuff, so hopefully that service launches pretty soon. I still think that they're going
1897160	1899200	to announce it at Game Developers Conference.
1899200	1901800	That would actually be a really smart place.
1901800	1905880	It would make lots of sense. Actually, now that I remember seeing this before, this was
1905880	1909480	the first game that was announced for WiiWare at one time. Actually, it doesn't look that
1909480	1913560	bad. It's kind of weird looking, though. It's like, I don't know, how would you describe
1913560	1914560	that?
1914560	1915560	Abstract.
1915560	1916560	Abstract?
1916560	1922520	This is great radio. Rob, describe this screenshot for our listeners.
1922520	1926640	I don't know. It's in space. It's got bejeweled stuff and a sun.
1926640	1929720	I can tell you from the distance it looked like a pizza. From over here, it looked like
1929720	1930720	pizza.
1930720	1931720	You're just hungry. You just want to eat it.
1931720	1932720	Alright, that's it.
1932720	1934440	Let's move on.
1934440	1938800	I think that's a good idea, though. We need to do the whole twelve people, twelve peripherals,
1938800	1943840	one game, and have a showdown, and then laugh at how stupid we are. Paraglove wins.
1943840	1953740	Anyhow, anyway, let's move on to another story.
1953740	1957560	You might remember, you know, it's funny, these April Fools stories that run in Electronic
1957560	1961600	Gaming Monthly have this really strange habit of turning into reality. Remember Mortal
1961600	1967360	Kombat? There was the rumor of the hidden character, Ermac, that it was the red sub-zero
1967360	1972120	or whatever, and then he actually showed up in a game later on. Well, years ago, I don't
1972120	1974480	remember how long it was, maybe it was last year, I don't remember, but there was supposedly
1974480	1978160	a game that was going to be made, it was their April Fools joke, Super Mario Fusion, I'm
1978160	1981520	sorry, it was Super Mario Kingdom Hearts, or something like that. It was the idea that
1981520	1984160	the Mario universe would be combined with Kingdom Hearts.
1984160	1986720	It was Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.
1986720	1991760	That's what it was, Mushroom Kingdom Hearts. Well, what's happened now is that someone
1991760	1997960	has taken, I guess, they've taken Mario and combined it with, what the hell else, they
1997960	2003840	got this game, Fusion, and they've got, I guess, Kingdom Hearts all worked into one.
2003840	2009720	It's a combined, it's basically a game called Super Mario Bros. Fusion, but it combines
2009720	2010720	like Mega Man.
2010720	2011720	What the hell? That's Mega Man.
2011720	2020320	Yeah, it combines Mega Man, Halo, they've got Ghosts and Goblins, Sonic the Hedgehog,
2020320	2024640	just a bunch of stuff, and it's all made in this one Game Maker 7 program or whatever,
2024640	2028920	but it plays like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros. 3.
2028920	2033120	Wow, that's like a Halo stage and we had a Mega Man stage. Who else is there here? That's
2033120	2034120	more Mega Man.
2034120	2036080	Yeah, they have the whole entire Bubble Man stage.
2036080	2039880	That is craziness. Somebody was really bored.
2039880	2042480	Yeah, I think that's all we see is the Bubble Man stage now.
2042480	2047080	But you can actually play the demo for it.
2047080	2050080	You can throw the bubbles.
2050080	2055400	That's pretty awesome. Very cool.
2055400	2056400	That's very creative.
2056400	2058680	Somebody's got a lot of free time on their hands, seriously.
2058680	2062080	That's actually cooler than Asshole Mario.
2062080	2063080	That's quite a compliment.
2063080	2065920	Yeah, because Asshole Mario is really cool.
2065920	2066920	And funny.
2066920	2067920	That's really cool.
2067920	2072560	Mega Man asks the question, Mario plus Kingdom Hearts plus Mega Man plus Halo plus Sonic
2072560	2073560	equals Will It Blend?
2073560	2078480	If you've ever visited that website, Will It Blend? Forget it. Forget it.
2078480	2084760	All right, anyhow, let's move on to Will It Come Out, talking about some new release dates
2084760	2088240	and what games are in your future. We'll start off with Europe.
2088240	2094600	Well, for our friends over there, there is some actually sort of cool stuff coming out.
2094600	2098920	There is, as soon as this works for me, there we go. We have Pirates of the Burning Sea
2098920	2106280	on the 22nd. We have Advanced Wars Dark Conflict and Burnout Paradise on the 25th. We have
2106280	2113000	Cruisin for Wii, Donkey Kong Jet Race, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Foster's Home for
2113000	2120780	Imaginary Friends, Imagination Invades on DS, FDC World Darts Championship 2008, Fantasy
2120780	2126280	Star Universe Ambition of Illuminus, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, and finally, Universe
2126280	2131360	at War Earth Assault for PC.
2131360	2132360	That it?
2132360	2133360	Yeah.
2133360	2134360	Doesn't seem like that busy of a week over there.
2134360	2141080	Well, I guess all of the people who are addicted to PSU will be happy.
2141080	2147600	Well, it's not a very busy week over in Japan either, but I'm going out of turn. It's actually
2147600	2149600	supposed to be the U.S. states next. My bad.
2149600	2157600	I can wait. Anyways, in the U.S. we have a pretty good week of stuff coming out. My personal
2157600	2162320	favorite, No More Heroes, is coming out for the Wii. Definitely worth picking up. If you
2162320	2167060	don't have a Wii, maybe you'll like this for the DS, Advanced Wars Days of Ruin. Looks
2167060	2168060	pretty awesome.
2168060	2173920	Let's see, Pirates of the Burning Sea for the PC. We have Burnout Paradise coming out
2173920	2178840	in Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. If you're looking for more of a casual game, Endless
2178840	2184460	Ocean on the Wii. You can swim around with the fishies. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic
2184460	2192280	Games on the DS. One Piece Unlimited Adventure on the Wii. Iridium Runners on Playstation
2192280	2201280	2. It's a piece of crap. Rainbow Islands Evolution on the PSP. Hopefully you'll be able to get
2201280	2212600	past Kawasaki Jet Ski, which is actually supposed to be like Wave Race, but probably not going
2212600	2217760	to be because it's put out by Destiny and every game that they make sucks. But, cross
2217760	2219960	our fingers, maybe someday their games won't suck.
2219960	2225000	I'm just going to say this about Rainbow Islands on the PSP. I do love Rainbow Islands, the
2225000	2229600	original Rainbow Islands game, and that is where my love for the series ends. None of
2229600	2232640	the games after that were really worth, you know, getting excited about.
2232640	2234480	Okay, now we'll go over to Japanese Re-
2234480	2236320	What about Paracel Stars?
2236320	2239360	That's different. I mean, you could say all those games are in the Bubble Bobble universe,
2239360	2240360	I suppose, but, you know.
2240360	2241520	Yeah, Paracel Stars was great.
2241520	2246420	Paracel Stars was pretty cool. Anyway, going over to Japanese release dates, not a lot
2246420	2251340	on the Xbox 360, but you do have on the Playstation 3 this week, Juice 2, which I think was delayed
2251340	2254720	from last week because it came out on all the other systems last week. There really
2254720	2258880	isn't a lot to speak of otherwise on the next gen systems, but on the current gen systems,
2258880	2263000	such as Playstation 2, or, I don't know, is it high time for us to start calling it last
2263000	2267160	gen now? The Playstation 2 is really last gen and current gen is, I guess, last gen.
2267160	2268160	Who knows? Who cares?
2268160	2269640	How about we just call it the PS2?
2269640	2274620	How about we just call it the PS2? Coming to the PS2, a game called Lucky Star, also
2274620	2279400	a game called Tokka Race Driver 3 Ultimate Racing Simulator come out this week as well
2279400	2285720	on the Playstation 2. Going to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, Daikokai
2285720	2291880	Jidai 4 Rota Nova moves in to the best hits from Koei, and that's a price reduction. The
2291880	2296100	only really new game that looks like it's coming out over there is you get Hijoguchi
2296100	2302280	Exit DS. There's another Mahjong game coming out on the DS as well. The Sims 2 Cast Away
2302280	2307480	also comes out on the Nintendo DS. And the Prince of Tennis Driving Smash Side King.
2307480	2308800	That's an interesting anime.
2308800	2312320	That's right. You two can be the Prince of Tennis in the privacy of your own home.
2312320	2315800	I'd rather be the Prince of the Cosmos.
2315800	2321000	On the Sony PSP, not a whole lot of stuff, but you do have a Winning Eleven Ubiquitous
2321000	2325120	Evolution 2008 coming out on the PSP. A couple other games getting price reductions, such
2325120	2331200	as Luminous 2. That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
2331200	2335960	That's all happy and good. Well, speaking of things that are happy and good, there was
2335960	2340200	a, well I'm sure that people have heard about this by now, but there was a guy named Paxton
2340200	2347200	Galvanek, who rescued two victims from an overturned SUV in North Carolina. And this
2348560	2352420	guy's supposed to be pretty cool because he, you know, assessed the situation, treated
2352420	2359260	their wounds like with perfect first aid, kept them alive, and his medical background
2359260	2362080	consists of playing America's Army.
2362080	2364080	Wow.
2364080	2369160	Apparently there's a classroom in there, and part of the classroom area is basically all
2369160	2373680	the stuff they go through in basic, which is including a medic class, so that you learn
2373680	2379080	basic first aid. And when he witnessed the accident, he basically went right into that
2379080	2385720	mode and, you know, he, the first person he treated was someone who had lost two fingers,
2385720	2390600	and so he used a towel to stop the bleeding and held their hand over their head, which
2390600	2396080	is, I mean, I've got a full first aid certification because I have to as a massage therapist,
2396080	2399880	and that's the first thing that you do. You see who's more injured, and you, you know,
2399880	2404040	if they're bleeding, you hold their hand over their head and, you know, have them do that.
2404040	2408800	And he also treated somebody for a head wound too, so that by the time someone arrived,
2408800	2413920	which I think is kind of funny because it said it was a soldier that showed up to help
2413920	2420920	them out, everybody was fine. And he actually, I think it's pretty cool, though, if they're
2420920	2425920	putting in, like, actual real first aid techniques in that game, then that's pretty cool.
2425920	2427920	By chance, did he play Trauma Center as well?
2427920	2428920	I don't think so.
2428920	2431920	Because you can learn a little bit from playing Trauma Center.
2431920	2433920	Like, we're not to cut people?
2433920	2437920	You can stitch up somebody by, you know, waving furiously, and then you can also stop time
2437920	2439920	and slow down time if you use your psychic powers.
2439920	2444920	Star, you can totally, like, heal them completely, wow.
2444920	2447920	Okay, so maybe America's Army is a little more practical, but...
2447920	2452920	Well, I mean, that was the whole point of that game, though, is to show, you know, what
2452920	2457920	it's supposed to be like to go through, you know, basic and be out, you know, in the field
2457920	2463920	and everything. And I actually think that's kind of cool that someone could just pick
2463920	2467920	up from that and learn and use it actually in a real life situation.
2467920	2472920	I think it's also very healthy for the video game scene to actually get a video game saves
2472920	2477920	life as opposed to stupid kid shoots his brother over a video game type news story, you know?
2477920	2480920	So, just, it's nice to have a change.
2480920	2482920	Like, I was 28 years old.
2482920	2485920	Who actually plays a medic in, like, America's Army?
2485920	2490920	I mean, seriously, it's like, I want to be the medic! Ooh!
2490920	2494920	You know what, it's required to have first aid training when you go in the Army.
2494920	2495920	It's a game!
2495920	2500920	There's a lot of people that go into the Army to study doctor type stuff, you know?
2500920	2503920	Here at the end of America's Army 2, they all become rock stars and have tons of women
2503920	2507920	and, like, live in mansions, because that's what the military is supposed to do.
2507920	2509920	It's going to give you women in mansions.
2509920	2512920	I don't think so. I don't think that's how they advertise it.
2512920	2515920	Yeah. Sure, they do.
2515920	2520920	I think it's more of the be all you can be and going into the Army can strengthen yourself.
2520920	2522920	Whatever.
2522920	2525920	I think it's like, Mike, yay.
2525920	2528920	I think it's like when people are playing an MMO and they pick their class, it's like
2528920	2534920	the same people who would pick a priest because they like to assist and, like, heal people.
2534920	2537920	That's my theory.
2537920	2543920	And, of course, our chat room is breaking out into a chorus of, heal please, heal please.
2543920	2544920	I don't know.
2544920	2549920	Good for him for actually, you know, being able to help them, although it's very coincidental
2549920	2553920	that he actually learned something from this game from, you know, because it's usually
2553920	2558920	it's like, okay, I hit A and then they heal. Okay, that didn't work right, you know.
2558920	2560920	Have you ever played America's Army?
2560920	2562920	No, I have not played America's Army.
2562920	2566920	It is a rigorous training process just to start the game.
2566920	2571920	Like, they make you take tests before you get your gun and then it jams.
2571920	2574920	Sounds like fun. Sounds like a lot of fun.
2574920	2579920	LF-10,000M, Iraq instance. Tank and healer needed. Please send tell.
2579920	2585920	Well, if people are, you know, buying the game for the purpose of what it is as a simulation,
2585920	2587920	then it needs to be that in depth.
2587920	2591920	Because, I mean, really the game is just a marketing tool for the Army anyway.
2591920	2592920	It is, but.
2592920	2596920	And now this kid is going to be the poster child of that game.
2596920	2598920	Look, see what America's Army can do?
2598920	2601920	Now imagine what would happen if you joined the real military.
2601920	2605920	I was just reading the thing over and saying, you know, when he was talking about what he did
2605920	2609920	and I was like, that is proper first aid. That's what you're supposed to do.
2609920	2613920	So, pay attention. Kudos to you.
2613920	2619920	Hooray. So, I guess you really can't stitch up somebody by going like this and flailing your arm about.
2619920	2621920	I refuse to believe it, Rob.
2621920	2623920	Alright, let's move on.
2623920	2628920	Anyways, something along the same lines as America's Army.
2628920	2636920	Okay, maybe not. But apparently the porn industry has dropped their backing for HD DVD.
2636920	2640920	No!
2640920	2645920	And dozens of Xbox 360 owners cry out in pain all at once.
2645920	2650920	I'm going to put HD DVD player on Craigslist tomorrow.
2650920	2655920	I mean, I don't know if it's everybody, but one studio in particular, Digital Playground,
2655920	2660920	has decided to abandon HD DVD and stick solely with Blu-Ray.
2660920	2663920	Good for them, I guess.
2663920	2665920	But not every studio.
2665920	2669920	Not every studio, as a lot of people are reporting. It's just Digital Playground.
2669920	2672920	It wasn't... never mind, I'm not going to say it.
2672920	2675920	And, you know, I don't know.
2675920	2680920	To be honest, I... let's...
2680920	2683920	Sorry, Irene and I are giggling like three-year-olds over here.
2683920	2688920	Irene's all, you're just hoping it's not Falcon or Colt, huh?
2688920	2692920	No, I mean, it's one studio... I mean, how many porn studios are out there, seriously?
2692920	2693920	Billions!
2693920	2694920	There's a ton of them.
2694920	2700920	But let's see what Digital Playground has to offer us, you know, because...
2700920	2704920	Okay, I mean, seriously, let's see here.
2704920	2711920	They're top-selling titles that you may be missing if you have HD DVD and you want it in HD.
2711920	2715920	Jack's Teen America 19,
2715920	2718920	Mrs. Bee Haven,
2718920	2720920	Jessie's Juice,
2720920	2722920	Jannikova and Blu,
2722920	2724920	Forbidden Tales,
2724920	2728920	Jack's Big Tit Show number four,
2728920	2731920	Hush! and Jessie Jean's Scream.
2731920	2738920	Although, to their credit, though, they did produce the Pirates film, and Pirates was hilarious.
2738920	2740920	Hilariously bad.
2740920	2748920	MacMan suggests that the PlayStation 3's newest games, Drake's Penis, Ratchet and Dick, and Heavenly Sword.
2748920	2752920	But here's the thing, though.
2752920	2758920	They may have stopped making HD DVDs, but they still sell them.
2758920	2761920	They still have quite a bit of stuff on there.
2761920	2765920	And besides, anyone that actually watches a lot of porn anyways, they don't buy their porn.
2765920	2769920	I mean, come on, this is the internet revolution, you know?
2769920	2771920	Who actually buys porn nowadays?
2771920	2774920	And you can find plenty of it in Divx out there.
2774920	2779920	And remember, your PlayStation 3 also plays Divx, and hopefully Xbox 360 will at some point soon.
2779920	2781920	Or you can stream stuff.
2781920	2785920	I believe Xbox 360 is already playing Divx now after their last patch.
2785920	2787920	Yeah, yeah.
2787920	2792920	Because I was watching, it wasn't porn, it was a legitimate television show,
2792920	2797920	but I was watching Cat House Girls that I downloaded from the internet in Divx on the Xbox 360.
2797920	2799920	So I'm pretty sure it supports Divx.
2799920	2801920	So crisis averted.
2801920	2803920	Exactly.
2803920	2806920	Anyhow, there's always Porn02 on your Wii, by the way.
2806920	2809920	Not that we're telling you how to do that.
2809920	2814920	Anyhow, if you don't want to use your PlayStation 3 to watch pirates or other types of porn,
2814920	2818920	you can use it for more legitimate purposes, such as playing SingStar.
2818920	2823920	However, apparently the SingStar SingStore is not that great.
2823920	2827920	Remember when we first saw the SingStar SingStore at a previous E3
2827920	2832920	and it looked like every song ever made looked like it was going to be in there with all these videos and so on?
2832920	2836920	Sony had promised 350 music tracks.
2836920	2841920	Well, so far there are less than 100 songs, apparently, out there.
2841920	2843920	Apparently the server keeps going down.
2843920	2847920	There really aren't a lot of updates in the SingStore news section.
2847920	2852920	So SingStar does not appear to be doing quite as well as people originally thought.
2852920	2854920	I'm glad they can underdeliver like normal.
2854920	2858920	Now, however, to be fair, Sony did make a response a little later in the week.
2858920	2862920	SingStar Studios said that downloadable songs for SingStore are on the way.
2862920	2866920	The original vision was supposed to be 350, but they missed the mark.
2866920	2872920	However, they are going to put out 18 new tracks on January 18th, which should have already passed,
2872920	2878920	15 English songs and three Spanish ones, including David Bowie and Blur.
2878920	2879920	Not bad.
2879920	2880920	I like Blur.
2880920	2884920	And February 4th is supposed to see the launch of even more songs.
2884920	2887920	That's okay. They only missed the mark by 200 songs.
2887920	2889920	Good thing they're looking at 18.
2889920	2892920	No, 15 of those are in English.
2892920	2896920	Well, they're supposed to be updating it now twice a week.
2896920	2898920	Sorry, not twice a week, twice a month.
2898920	2900920	That's okay. No one needs to be playing SingStar anyways.
2900920	2903920	It's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.
2903920	2908920	Karaoke is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of entertainment, okay?
2908920	2909920	How do you really feel?
2909920	2910920	I enjoyed it.
2910920	2914920	Plus they have the ability to upload videos of yourself singing.
2914920	2916920	Who would do that? That's lame.
2916920	2920920	I don't know what to tell you.
2920920	2925920	Well, we do have a situation.
2925920	2928920	Uh-oh.
2928920	2930920	Do I have to call out the troops?
2930920	2931920	No.
2931920	2932920	Do we have to get a medic?
2932920	2935920	No.
2935920	2940920	I'm sorry for all of our European listeners who are excited about Uncharted.
2940920	2942920	It's not in 1080i.
2942920	2944920	Sorry.
2944920	2948920	It was only added to the U.S. version later in development,
2948920	2950920	and the PAL version is not going to have it.
2950920	2952920	Thank God. I thought there was a real problem.
2952920	2957920	They said that it would delay the game's release because they have to test it for QA.
2957920	2959920	So, sorry.
2959920	2961920	Wait a minute. Game developers are QA-ing their games again?
2961920	2962920	That's good news.
2962920	2963920	Okay, folks.
2963920	2964920	It would be 480p.
2964920	2971920	If you really have been out of shape about that, remember, PlayStation 3 games are region-free.
2971920	2975920	So, if you really need your 1080i, to be honest, you're not going to tell the difference between...
2975920	2981920	If you've got an HDTV, then it doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.
2981920	2982920	No, it shouldn't.
2982920	2986920	So get it. Import it.
2986920	2987920	And there's your workaround.
2987920	2990920	Hooray! Workaround!
2990920	2998920	Speaking of workarounds, they finally released the custom firmware from DarkAlex,
2998920	3003920	the guy behind all those wonderful PSP custom firmwares, released all the popular ones.
3003920	3011920	He has just released 3.80 M33, and it will give you all the wonderful features of 3.8,
3011920	3018920	including the streaming internet radio and all that fun stuff, plus a bunch of new features as well.
3018920	3024920	One of the cool things I liked about this, actually, is once you've loaded 3.8 in there,
3024920	3030920	any additional firmware updates that happen to come along from the custom firmware scene,
3030920	3037920	you can actually update them over the internet, just like you would your normal PSP firmwares.
3037920	3045920	So you can just download an update and update it right there, just like you would any official firmware,
3045920	3048920	which I did, and it was pretty cool.
3048920	3054920	But that's available right now for PSP Slims, and they also have one for the PSP Fat, I guess,
3054920	3064920	that also has some of the stuff for the 1.5 firmware, so you can run your homebrew crap.
3064920	3070920	But try as they may, they'll never stop the people from breaking those firmwares.
3070920	3072920	Do you think at some point Sony's just going to give up?
3072920	3074920	No.
3074920	3078920	I guess they really think that they're going to win.
3078920	3081920	I guess it keeps some people employed or what have you, I don't know.
3081920	3090920	Anyhow, one thing that perhaps DarkAlex maybe wants to work on soon is solving the Dust problem on the PlayStation 3,
3090920	3094920	because, no, I'm not trying to make a joke that nobody's playing their PlayStation 3 so they're getting dusty,
3094920	3100920	but remember, remember, like, Dust killed somebody's PlayStation, like Sony refused to do anything about it or something like that?
3100920	3105920	The guy ended up getting a refund from the credit card company or something like that?
3105920	3109920	Well, Dust is obviously a huge issue for PlayStations.
3109920	3114920	Dude, that PS3 right there looks like someone put it under their sawhorse when they were cutting some wood or something.
3114920	3115920	I mean, this is ridiculous.
3115920	3117920	They collect dust, though, really easily.
3117920	3119920	They're dust magnets, I'm telling you.
3119920	3122920	Well, Hori makes a bunch of different peripherals.
3122920	3127920	They're like a peripheral making company, and they are coming out with a Dust Guard Kit 3.
3127920	3130920	It guards all four of your air vents.
3130920	3135920	It puts a filter that, you know, prevents dust and, of course, cigarette smoke from getting inside the PlayStation 3
3135920	3138920	for all those people that smoke next to their PlayStation 3s.
3138920	3141920	It also covers up the open ports and so on.
3141920	3147920	So insert your dust cap joke here, but there is officially a dust cap coming for the PlayStation 3.
3147920	3148920	That's actually pretty cool.
3148920	3150920	That company makes really good stuff.
3150920	3156920	We got a couple of controllers that they put out, the GameCube ones back in the day.
3156920	3161920	I want a mod that makes my PS3 smoke a cigarette, because that would make it even cooler.
3161920	3167920	Or you could just not smoke next to your PlayStation 3 or put it in a well vent.
3167920	3168920	Oh, yeah.
3168920	3172920	Take a hit off this PS3, you'll love it.
3172920	3175920	Suddenly your PlayStation 3 is glowing.
3175920	3177920	Want to get high?
3177920	3179920	Look at the website, though.
3179920	3181920	Did you look at the ad for it?
3181920	3182920	No.
3182920	3185920	The connector, it's actually pretty cool.
3185920	3191920	Looking at how all of this fits in, I think it's a very good idea.
3191920	3193920	How it all pieces together?
3193920	3197920	Well, they said that it's charged with static to attract the dust.
3197920	3201920	You know those static wipes for dusting?
3201920	3202920	It's the same theory on it.
3202920	3204920	That's actually pretty cool.
3204920	3206920	Wow.
3206920	3208920	I'll link the ad in the chatroom.
3208920	3209920	Interesting.
3209920	3211920	The ad is available at hoary.jp.
3211920	3214920	Just browse to their products for the Dust Guard Kit 3.
3214920	3215920	I know.
3215920	3219920	I think that GameStop still carries a lot of the hoary products.
3219920	3221920	So, shouldn't have any problem.
3221920	3222920	Very cool.
3222920	3223920	Dust Cap 3.
3223920	3227920	I was always hoping it would come to the U.S.
3227920	3229920	Wow, let's move on with some more news.
3229920	3231920	Well, in other news.
3231920	3234920	And, you know, we said we weren't going to talk about this guy again.
3234920	3239920	But he who shall not be named keeps reappearing.
3239920	3241920	Has he opened the Chamber of Secrets this time?
3241920	3242920	He's trying.
3242920	3245920	He's trying to open up a can of drama is what he's doing.
3245920	3247920	Oh, really?
3247920	3249920	No way.
3249920	3250920	Yeah, really.
3250920	3257920	Anyway, I will say it for the benefit of those who have not listened for a while
3257920	3261920	and don't know who the heck we're talking about when we speak of he who shall not be named.
3261920	3263920	But Jack Thompson, the butthead.
3263920	3265920	Sends shivers down my spine.
3265920	3268920	Lord Voldemort.
3268920	3273920	He said that there were quotes that were attributed to him by British newspapers
3273920	3278920	that were a total fabrication about Buzz.
3278920	3281920	And he's quoted saying, I was never interviewed about Buzz.
3281920	3285920	I never heard about it until I was quoted having allegedly said this about it.
3285920	3290920	And what he was quoted as saying is that video games have hurt far more people than they have helped.
3290920	3296920	And he said that what he would say.
3296920	3299920	Well, I'm just going to read his quote because he speaks in circles.
3299920	3304920	I would never say what I am quoted as saying in any context as the quotation,
3304920	3308920	regardless of what it is applied to, is absurd on its face.
3308920	3315920	How in the world could anyone prove and or quantify that games have hurt more people than they have helped?
3315920	3319920	That sounds to me like he's lying.
3319920	3323920	You know, every time this guy opens his mouth, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.
3323920	3325920	Do you get a little angsty?
3325920	3331920	Real quick, I was just going to mention that Take-Two actually proactively sued him,
3331920	3334920	so that's also going on right now, too.
3334920	3337920	You know, Loki cut me off, and that makes me even more angsty,
3337920	3340920	so you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
3340920	3356920	Music
3356920	3363920	I'm an FU to my washing machine for not wanting to wash my hoodie by itself and imbalancing,
3363920	3366920	because I really wanted to wear my Jack hoodie tonight.
3366920	3371920	My nightmare before Christmas day, and I couldn't because of the wet.
3371920	3374920	I'm really not very angsty.
3374920	3375920	All right.
3375920	3382920	No, an FU to my cat for throwing up a hairball on my massage diploma,
3382920	3387920	so now I have to go get a reprint of it and my transcripts, and I have to get reprints of those.
3387920	3391920	And an FU to my folder from when I first started school,
3391920	3398920	because it has all of my massage clover seats in it, so that I can have myself one big fat tax write-off.
3398920	3403920	An FU to the company I work for for not claiming my W-2 yet.
3403920	3404920	For real?
3404920	3405920	I want money!
3405920	3406920	Me too.
3406920	3408920	Loki, you're FUs.
3408920	3413920	Um, FU to the theater that I went and saw Cloverfield in,
3413920	3417920	because the entire time the front left speaker was making a
3417920	3421920	noise, so it was really annoying.
3421920	3423920	The entire movie.
3423920	3425920	Are you sure it wasn't just the monster?
3425920	3426920	I'm pretty sure.
3426920	3429920	And we went and complained to management, and they're like, you know,
3429920	3432920	a bunch of little kids running around trying to figure out how to fix the speaker.
3432920	3434920	The monster didn't go have some fourth meal at Taco Bell?
3434920	3435920	I'm pretty sure.
3435920	3436920	All right.
3438920	3439920	Is that it?
3439920	3440920	That's it.
3440920	3443920	My FU of the week goes to the damn flies in here,
3443920	3446920	who have not been served yet with the swatter of justice.
3446920	3447920	Are they hiding right now?
3447920	3448920	I think they are.
3448920	3450920	I haven't seen one in a little while.
3450920	3452920	But FU to the fact that the flies hide all week long,
3452920	3453920	and then they come out on Sunday.
3453920	3454920	I hate that.
3454920	3455920	Anyhow.
3455920	3458920	Rice Princess, Nathan, do you guys have anything you want to add?
3458920	3461920	Flies just like listening to the show, geez.
3461920	3465920	Um, FU to being sick and, you know,
3465920	3467920	not being able to hear out of my left ear,
3467920	3470920	so I sound like an old woman, like, eh?
3470920	3472920	Can I do Janet again, Johnny?
3472920	3474920	Like, yeah, it's annoying.
3474920	3479920	And then I also second the FU to Cloverfield audiences.
3479920	3481920	Wait, no, you just said the theater, right?
3481920	3482920	The audio.
3482920	3484920	Well, I'd say FU to the audience,
3484920	3486920	because they're stupid and immature,
3486920	3490920	and they're, like, yelling out what they thought of a movie at the end.
3490920	3493920	That's why I don't go see movies on opening weekend ever.
3493920	3495920	Because of kids.
3495920	3497920	Yeah, there were a bunch of kids.
3497920	3500920	It's not like I went out and said, you know, my opinion on the movie,
3500920	3503920	because I don't care to do that, but people do and they're stupid,
3503920	3505920	FU!
3507920	3511920	My only FU is for Nintendo.
3511920	3514920	I love you guys, but you gotta really hurry up
3514920	3518920	and make available on the Virtual Console
3518920	3523920	Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
3523920	3530920	Some people haven't played it and don't know how great it is.
3535920	3538920	My games are better.
3538920	3540920	I have one.
3541920	3544920	FU didn't know Guardian Legend either.
3544920	3546920	Greatest 8-bit game of all time.
3546920	3548920	We've been saying that for a long time on this show.
3548920	3552920	But I do agree, Super Mario RPG would make a fine addition to Virtual Console.
3552920	3555920	But don't keep holding your breath.
3555920	3556920	Anyhow.
3556920	3559920	Anyway, Loki, anyway.
3561920	3565920	So, this is kind of exciting and hopefully this comes out in the Wii,
3565920	3569920	because this would be one of those games that could utilize that whipping motion
3569920	3571920	from the Wii Remote.
3571920	3574920	But Leisure Suit Larry, box office bust,
3574920	3578920	is coming to consoles and the PC fall of 2008.
3578920	3582920	And yes, if you don't remember Leisure Suit Larry,
3582920	3585920	well, then you need to look it up on the internet,
3585920	3588920	because I'm not going to explain it to you, but it's awesome.
3588920	3592920	Except for that last game, because that last game blew really bad,
3592920	3593920	and not in a good way.
3593920	3596920	Well, if the last game was bad, what's going to make this game good?
3596920	3598920	Because it's not the last game.
3600920	3603920	But it's scheduled right now for, it looks like,
3603920	3607920	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and mobile phones,
3607920	3613920	and is being developed by Team17, the group behind the Worms games.
3613920	3615920	Nice.
3615920	3616920	Oh, cool.
3616920	3621920	And the script, I guess, is being penned by Happy Madison Productions' Alan Covert.
3623920	3626920	Is that Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison or something?
3626920	3629920	Well, Happy Madison is Adam Sandler's production group.
3629920	3630920	Oh, okay.
3630920	3635920	And Alan Covert, he's done such wonderful movies as,
3635920	3641920	okay, I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, Grandma's Boy,
3641920	3645920	Eight Crazy Nights, Mr. Diesel and Nicky, Big Daddy,
3645920	3648920	Deuce Bigalow, Mail Jiggalow, Waterboy,
3648920	3652920	pretty much every other Adam Sandler movie that's been out there, Happy Gilmore.
3652920	3657920	So, you know what, if only that game had Adam Sandler
3657920	3660920	and the whole Happy Madison group doing the voices in there,
3660920	3661920	that might be cool.
3661920	3663920	Because Rob Schneider in that game, that could be cool.
3663920	3665920	You can do it!
3665920	3667920	All night long.
3667920	3671920	They should make a Leisure Suit Larry movie, Happy Madison.
3671920	3673920	That would be cool.
3673920	3675920	You never know, anything's possible.
3675920	3678920	All right, well, part A of our program is coming to a close,
3678920	3681920	but not before we pay a little respect to our elders
3681920	3684920	by nodding at the classic games,
3684920	3686920	and we do that with a little segment we call
3686920	3688920	Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
3688920	3691920	So, Dark Sakura, what classic game have you picked for the kids this week
3691920	3693920	to play a little bit of?
3693920	3695920	The game I'm referring to is one of the last ones
3695920	3698920	that came out on the Sega Saturn in America.
3698920	3701920	One of the games, I actually, it's one of my favorite games,
3701920	3705920	is Burning Rangers, which is also put out by Sonic Team.
3705920	3707920	Who can do no wrong?
3707920	3709920	I love Sonic Team.
3709920	3713920	Anyway, the game is basically set in the future
3713920	3716920	where the old Sonic games,
3716920	3722920	where the only few hazards remaining is one of them is fire.
3722920	3726920	So these are futuristic fire fighters who use their super sentai powers
3726920	3729920	to extinguish flames and rescue people.
3729920	3731920	And after you beat the game once,
3731920	3734920	you actually have a random level generator
3734920	3738920	that you can use to change the game each time you go play it.
3738920	3741920	As far as the technical side of it,
3741920	3744920	for people who were Saturn fans,
3744920	3748920	you know that the Saturn was,
3748920	3751920	it wasn't very good with transparency,
3751920	3753920	but they did it for this game.
3753920	3755920	It's one of the games that used it.
3755920	3761920	And also, the first game that used ADX audio compression.
3761920	3764920	On top of that, while there hasn't been a sequel,
3764920	3766920	it's been referenced to quite a number of times.
3766920	3768920	In Phantasy Star Online,
3768920	3771920	there was a central dome fire swirl level
3771920	3774920	where one of the main characters from Burning Rangers
3774920	3777920	asked you to help him put out fires and help people,
3777920	3781920	and had the music from the Japanese version of Burning Rangers,
3781920	3783920	which was angels with burning hearts.
3783920	3787920	Two of the vocal songs were in Sonic Pinball Party.
3787920	3791920	Also, the theme song was in Samba de Amigo,
3791920	3794920	if you remember, as one of the downloadable songs.
3794920	3798920	And could make a return when Samba de Amigo comes out on the Wii a little later, right?
3798920	3804920	You could actually access it in, I believe, in the second Samba 2000.
3804920	3808920	Also, Phantasy Star Universe had an event called Operation Firebreak
3808920	3811920	that uses the same song,
3811920	3815920	and it's on the planet that was involved in the game.
3815920	3821920	And it's actually, all the soundtrack was designed by the guitarist
3821920	3824920	for a British band called UFO.
3824920	3827920	So, Burning Rangers is cool.
3827920	3830920	There you have it, your classic game of the week, Burning Rangers,
3830920	3833920	a game I never played, but maybe I ought to.
3833920	3836920	Well, I will bring that in the side and over one day.
3836920	3837920	I think you should.
3837920	3840920	I think it's funny that it goes for bucks on eBay,
3840920	3843920	and I got mine at a convention swap meet for 30 bucks.
3843920	3846920	Wow. Sometimes you find little gems there.
3846920	3847920	So, there you go.
3847920	3852920	All right, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of our show.
3852920	3855920	But as you know, Orange Launch Radio is divvied up into two parts every week,
3855920	3860920	so we will be right back after just a little bit with Orange Launch Radio, Part B.
