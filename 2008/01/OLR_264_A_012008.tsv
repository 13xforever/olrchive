49	2510	All right, anything else you want to add to your gaming week, DarkSakura?
3010	3130	Nope.
3310	4231	Then let's go over to Loki.
4291	5251	Loki, how was your gaming week?
5791	7272	My gaming week was fine.
8012	19296	I played a little bit of Nitro Bike this week because I was anticipating it was going to be awesome and all that stuff for the Wii because they're kind of comparing it to Excite Truck.
19836	23658	It is not even close to Excite Truck, and it's also not even close to being good.
23818	26338	So, unfortunately, it sucked.
26779	27699	In what ways did it suck?
28197	32819	It sucked because the tracks weren't really open enough like Excite Truck.
33299	48906	The game itself wasn't very fun because you can do tricks in the air and stuff, but really there's no need to be doing any sort of variety of tricks because you can do the same trick over and over and get the same kind of bonus for it, which is more Nitro.
49486	56769	But the fact is the tracks aren't really straight enough anyways to where you would need the Nitro, so it was kind of dumb.
58254	60536	They tried, and they failed.
60736	79949	The other thing, though, that I do not like about a lot of these racing games is that unlike Excite Truck, which you hold the Wii Remote kind of parallel to the ground, a lot of these games will have it where you're holding it on its side so that you can use those really crappy plastic steering wheel controllers.
81570	85173	And I really hate having to hold it like that because it makes it really uncomfortable for...
85832	88553	for your hands because you have to twist your whole wrist back and stuff.
89033	90014	Sight Trucker is just awesome.
90214	90734	What can I say?
91314	100637	Then, on purpose, I played Offroad Extreme Special Edition, which is a game that got reviewed on IGN, giving it a 1.5.
101538	105179	Yeah, it's deserving of that.
105579	106679	It was just really bad.
109200	112081	Basically, your vehicles in the game kind of control like crap.
112922	113782	Very sluggish.
114501	116823	and I had trouble staying on the track because of that.
117984	120285	But it was fun to get to play it, I guess.
121026	128872	Then, not so crappy games, I got to play Burnout Paradise, which I'm very surprised.
129852	133955	The game, I didn't think it was going to be that good when I played the demo.
133975	141121	It didn't seem like something I would like, but playing the full version of the game, I was completely wrong.
141261	141361	It's
142472	143774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
162932	163953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
185717	187378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
212794	242482	and in fact usually I notice a car will zoom past me and start driving crazy and I'm like okay that's one of the cars and so I'll chase after it and stuff but uh it's just pretty awesome and the races are pretty cool also the music in the game they have a great soundtrack in it although the only flaw they put Avril Lavigne's girlfriend in there so I guess there's gotta be something for everybody but it was a little weird driving and all of a sudden your girlfriend comes on it just felt strange but uh
243550	244711	I highly recommend the game.
244991	246291	I'm going to be playing this for a long time.
248172	248772	Very cool.
249973	251454	I'm actually looking forward to picking up this game, too.
251494	252374	I like the Burnout games.
252394	255175	I'm not huge on a lot of racing games, but I like Burnout quite a bit.
255195	257696	I want to try the online, but the servers, I guess, are not up right now.
258077	262058	Well, seeing as the game isn't totally out yet, that might make sense why.
262278	264359	Yeah.
264860	266760	Oh, and then product placement, there's a ton of it.
266780	270042	There's vans driving around with, like, axe and, you know...
271235	272595	and all sorts of weird shit on there.
272615	273475	Like manly ads.
273896	276416	Yeah, but you can crash into them, which is great.
276436	280737	So, you know, it's like, oh, product placement, destroy!
280757	286318	It would be funnier if you got more points if you destroyed a Tampax billboard or something, you know what I mean?
287798	288458	It's awesome, though.
288598	292119	Seriously, you drive really fast through the game, they'll have like stunt mode and stuff.
293319	293679	It's cool.
294179	297740	I just like, it's like, you know, just crashing and stuff.
297800	298440	I don't know, it's...
300467	301007	Exactly.
302388	304110	Did you try doing, like, your own custom soundtracks?
304130	306371	Because you said you don't like Avril Lavigne or whatever that's in there.
306391	310414	But, like, when I played the last Burnout game on 360, I just used custom soundtracks all the time.
310534	314937	I would basically use the music from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune to Burnout, and it was awesome.
314997	318019	No, actually, I just, they have, you know, the EA tracks or whatever.
318059	320100	You can go in there and shut off which songs you don't like.
320120	323623	So if you don't like Avril Lavigne, you can just turn the track off and you'll never hear it again.
323703	324643	That's a good function.
325144	328686	But, you know, actually what I did is I kept, and I make,
329113	331575	If I had to find it from a cage match, but I may pick this song.
331835	345046	There's a song in there remixed by Jason Nevins that I've been having on repeat because it was the song that they had in the trailer for, what was it, I want to say it was Taxi or something like that.
345747	347108	That really crappy movie with...
348171	351872	Queen Latifah, and what's his name?
352092	356813	There's a cool song, though, but they had it in the trailer, and just racing to that song is pretty awesome.
358253	361273	I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
361293	375256	We actually have two chat rooms now because we have the Justin TV chat, too, but I'm a little worse at being able to stay on top of that one, so we'll try to read both chats, but I'm looking at our main chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and some predictions from Son of Dad for the next Burnout game.
375616	376336	It's Britney, bitch.
377182	378282	Maybe that'll be on the soundtrack.
379163	379503	Who knows?
380243	381724	And that will be turned off as well.
383284	383805	I don't know.
384125	385885	Some Britney songs are actually kind of fun to drive to.
385905	389747	They do incite a lot of rage and the ability to crash into other cars.
389967	391688	I think the online mode's going to be pretty fun.
393148	398030	Because I guess you can just turn it on where people are just racing around with you and stuff, which would be cool.
398370	401912	Because the game itself, I mean, just driving around is pretty fun.
402552	403973	So, I don't know.
404013	404353	I like it.
404853	405073	All right.
406046	407867	Rice Princess Alien Crush Good Taste Actraiser
429670	430330	What else did I play?
430350	431131	I love Actraiser.
431271	432371	I know, Actraiser's so good.
432391	433692	Doesn't it have, like, the best music ever?
433772	434493	It does!
434693	437054	Yuzo Koshiro is the man.
438995	440416	Oh, yeah, we have to get Devil's Crush, too.
440456	442036	Oh, that's right, that's up there now, too, huh?
442397	448720	Well, I just remembered that we played a bit of Alien Crush at my house, and then we had to hook up the TurboGrafx and play Devil's Crush, but now that it's there, it's like, oh, yeah.
449400	453182	I know, seriously, like, because Alien Crush is addictive, so.
453883	458065	Got to 64 on my Orc Hunter, and wow, and whoop-de-doo.
458635	460896	Nothing super exciting, nothing new.
462876	464296	But you are wearing a Silent Hill shirt.
464316	465397	Are you excited for Silent Hill 5?
466197	466857	Yes, I am.
466957	468298	Rumor is it's going to be out by summer.
468658	468898	Really?
468918	469578	I hope that's true.
469858	470638	I hope it is, too.
470698	472659	Did you check out Silent Hill Origins on PSP at all?
472799	473939	No, I don't have a PSP.
474179	475979	I know, but I figured maybe you stole someone else's.
476040	476360	I don't know.
476620	477900	Yeah, that's a good idea.
478000	478500	Ask William.
478560	479680	I bought him one for his birthday.
479700	480281	He never plays it.
480661	481021	Really?
481061	481221	Yeah.
481521	485562	But also take note that Silent Hill Origins is coming out on the PlayStation 2 very soon.
486207	486667	Oh my.
486908	488449	So you can just play it on PS2.
488489	490070	Hmm.
490170	491050	That's an idea.
491190	493912	Someone needs to play the other Silent Hill games.
496133	497474	Is that Nathan you're looking at?
497574	497915	Maybe.
498295	499656	Oh, Nathan, care to defend yourself?
499756	501257	Maybe tell us a little bit about your gaming week?
502117	504579	I have never played a Silent Hill in my life.
504859	507020	Have you played Resident Evil?
507581	511223	I wouldn't say played so much as died a lot.
513224	513485	Alright.
513905	515486	Well, what kind of games have you been playing this week, Nathan?
516221	517902	Alien Crush, a lot.
518442	524225	I don't even know what the point of the game is besides points, but that's all that I care about is more points.
524245	526746	You just want to keep your ball alive is what you want to do.
527606	529587	I try to keep as many balls as possible.
530047	531148	In play at the same time?
531308	531568	Sure.
532348	532868	It's pinball.
533249	533809	That's the point.
535830	538251	Anything else you've been up to this week in the gaming world?
539531	542272	Just today, my level 58...
544414	546695	Torrin Warrior went to Outlands
574610	575330	You're right, I don't.
602145	603286	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
632580	640110	and Pirates Pinball and Spider-Man Pinball that just came out.
640411	645298	I remember you talking about this at one of the pinball shows you went to and I'm just curious if it ever came out but something I heard about
646132	651753	They were going to take a high-def TV and put it on its side and lay it down so it was like a pinball table.
651813	653494	They had six of them there.
655414	657474	Their Ultracade pinball is what they are.
658475	660615	And they're very, very cool.
660795	666176	But I have to say, because what I did is I went and played the virtual tables.
666656	670237	And then I went back to play the actual pins because a lot of them were there.
671197	673178	And they're pretty close.
674823	679684	The physics in them are very, very good, but there's just something not right.
681105	685386	But each of them I think held like six tables, and I think there's a capacity for more.
686786	687447	Sounds interesting.
687887	703771	It was very interesting, but you couldn't get like, you'd only be able to do like certain pins, like there's the standard two flipper, you know, start button, whatever, unless you had something equipped that had the other buttons mapped, like for things with double flippers, where you have to have two sets of flippers.
704266	716977	Two controls for it, or like a special, like the Magna Ball, for example, on... One of those tables that we can't remember.
716997	717298	I know it is.
717318	720000	It's like one that you hit the button and it catches the ball before it drains.
721221	728568	And I want to say, I know it's not on... I want to say that it was on... Whodunit had one.
729609	729969	But like...
731357	732118	You know, things like that.
732158	733518	It would be a little bit more difficult.
733638	735239	They'd have to find a way to map it.
735979	738840	Or the cannon button on Black Rose.
740921	743802	I want to read some other things in chat room right now.
743902	747724	Not related to pinball, unfortunately, but something about the burnout.
747744	753126	We were talking about the custom soundtracks and SSJ100 Matt said, I'm waiting for the next OLR listener to suggest Dragon Force.
753686	756888	That would be an amazing soundtrack to put as a custom soundtrack to a burnout.
756928	757548	We'll see what happens.
758286	761068	Anyhow, we're about to get into the gaming news for the week.
761168	763109	But first, a quick housekeeping.
763710	769874	As many of the folks in our live chat are noticing, we have moved from Operator 11 to a new service called Justin.TV.
769954	773657	So hello to all the Justin.TV people.
773757	776859	The cool thing about Justin.TV is that we now are no longer limited to 40 minutes.
777219	778000	Thanks for watching!
798083	798823	Thank you for watching!
817990	821833	So JustinTV, and our username on JustinTV, of course, is Orange Lounge Radio.
822173	828318	So if you want to check out the cam right now, you just go to www.justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.
829259	833923	All right, that's going to do it for housekeeping, so let's get into some gaming news.
833963	836105	And we'll start off tonight with Loki.
837626	845432	Anyways, I'm sure this is going to come as a big shock to you, but there's a certain game out there that's going to be delayed one month.
846677	852021	So yeah, Nintendo finally came out and said that, guess what, Smash Brothers is delayed to March 9th.
852701	855143	And I'm sure that's the first time that you've ever heard of that.
855483	855704	Ever.
856724	860547	Lucky for the people in Japan, though, it is coming out the 31st of this month.
861728	862568	Also lucky for me.
863669	866291	So for all those people that import their games, they're...
867148	868789	They are A-OK.
868989	870750	But isn't it going to be very heavy on the Japanese?
870770	872851	Are you going to be able to navigate through the game?
872871	875032	I think you'd be able to navigate through the game just fine.
875733	876613	It's a fighting game.
877093	877654	That's true.
877714	878674	It's not going to be that complex.
878914	880195	But there's so many different modes.
880255	886518	If you've been watching what's going on on the dojo, there's so many different modes.
886658	887899	That makes it even easier, though.
888059	891001	I don't think it's going to even matter as much with that because...
892168	895249	First of all, half the time they put up the text, it's going to be in Hiragana.
895569	897790	I'm sorry, either Hiragana or Katakana.
898411	901872	And then there's usually a language select anyway for different regions.
902672	910756	Well, their excuse for it is they said that development is taking slightly longer than expected, which is bullshit since it's coming out in Japan already.
911036	912896	So obviously development's done on it.
913016	913937	It's localization.
914037	918058	It's either taking a long time or they can't press enough copies fast enough.
918158	919799	So one of those.
921500	921840	All right.
922426	933952	Well, is it possible that maybe, well, I guess that's localization, I was thinking maybe translation and all that stuff, but people shouldn't read into this like, OMG, they went back and added a new character or something like that.
934012	935093	No, they're not adding a new character.
936333	940055	Do you think there might be any secret characters that they've been sitting on that they haven't announced yet?
940075	940956	I think so, yeah.
941716	944117	I hope the Eggplant Wizard's in it, because I love Kid Icarus.
944397	947559	Well, I mean, look at, they didn't announce all the new characters.
947579	949560	Why are you laughing at the Eggplant Wizard, Nathan?
950240	951441	I'm thinking of Captain N.
952682	963563	Well, like, you know, Captain N Captain N should be in it Game & Watch, or Mr. Game & Watch He was a secret character that they never talked about Yes, that's true You never know Mr. Game & Watch is awesome
964133	975018	Well, if Eggplant Wizard doesn't make it to Super Smash Bros., perhaps it will make it to the rumored, emphasis on rumored, Kid Icarus game that is being worked on by Factor 5 for the Nintendo Wii.
975678	985382	Rumors are abounding this week, and GoNintendo is reporting that Factor 5 has been offered up the license from Nintendo to make a Kid Icarus game.
986323	989384	Or Kid Icarus, however you want to pronounce it, because that was always a point of contention.
989904	991565	People never knew exactly how to pronounce the game.
993006	993326	Icarus?
994133	998317	Well, regardless, Factor 5 made some previous games on the GameCube.
998657	1003881	I believe they did Star Fox, right?
1004021	1005483	Didn't they do the Star Fox game on GameCube?
1005503	1006083	They may have.
1006303	1006684	I think so.
1007164	1009586	So, anyhow, that would be very exciting.
1009626	1010507	Didn't they do Fire Emblem?
1011388	1011748	Perhaps.
1011768	1012488	I don't remember.
1014790	1015111	Yeah.
1015451	1018514	But, well, Factor 5... No, not Fire... No.
1019314	1021096	No, Fire Emblem wasn't Capcom.
1021276	1021456	Huh.
1022868	1024669	So Breath of Fire was Capcom.
1025689	1031432	Alright, so anyhow, regardless, I am very excited at the potential of having a new Kid Icarus game out there.
1031672	1034293	I just hope they don't kind of like screw it up.
1034453	1037534	I don't know, I don't want it to be 3D or any of that stuff.
1037554	1039575	You just kind of know that things are going to be inevitable.
1040316	1042657	Of course, chatroom saves the day when we forget things.
1042937	1045478	ShadowNextGen says, Factor 5 did the Rogue Squadron games.
1046598	1047058	There you go.
1048739	1050580	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
1051843	1073546	Well, in other news, for anybody who keeps up with the results of video game system sales, it has been pretty clear that the Wii and DS are outselling the Xbox 360 as far as units, but Microsoft is like, uh-uh, we made more money, so we win.
1074750	1082643	So, in fact, they've made $4.8 billion compared to $3.5 billion on the Wii and $2.2 billion on PS3.
1083504	1087530	So, if you're just looking at money, yeah, PS3 does not have it.
1090814	1095177	They also, for the Xbox 360, they've sold 4.62 million units.
1095237	1096097	That's just pretty cool.
1097078	1106363	PS2 sold 3.97 million, PSP 3.82 million, and the PS3 sold 2.56 million for its first year.
1106764	1115689	A lot of that money stuff has to do with the fact, though, that the Nintendo Wii, they make quite a bit of money off every sales of those, whereas Microsoft and Sony still lose money on every one.
1115789	1118551	Yeah, I think that, yeah, so I think that for...
1119901	1131790	If Microsoft is saying that they've made more money with what they lose in production, then overall, yeah, I'd have to say they're definitely having to move a lot more units.
1132411	1139056	But I don't see where the... But the Wii is clearly selling like crazy if they're having trouble stocking them.
1139076	1142518	And this is only the numbers for 2007, too.
1142619	1147042	Obviously, Xbox 360 is still number one in the U.S., although...
1147614	1148875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1172754	1174816	I don't know, maybe it gave them a little bit more attention.
1174856	1178179	I don't think that they got any more than they would have normally gotten anyways.
1178859	1187847	Maybe a little bit, because I know that distribution didn't get as many Wii systems in January because of this whole rain check program, but
1189353	1202798	I don't know how many people that affected, but I'm just kind of curious, because I remember throwing that story out there, and it was kind of like, well, what if Wiis are still really hard to come by in January, which it seems like they are.
1203839	1204119	I don't know.
1204459	1206680	But, yeah, it's...
1207483	1210024	It's still hard to find, and it probably will be for a while.
1210385	1211945	Chat room to the rescue yet again.
1212005	1213146	Jvmon is in there.
1213266	1215887	Chat on orangelaunchradio.com and says, Rob, I work at GameStop.
1216188	1219709	We filled all the pre-orders already and already got extras to sell to people.
1220370	1220870	So there you go.
1220970	1222931	We got the same amount we did November to December.
1223531	1224592	We're still cranking them out there.
1225012	1228214	Well, as far as what the games did themselves, Halo 3 was at the top.
1228974	1231816	It had 4.82 million, and Wii Play was right behind it.
1232808	1234189	which I think was kind of funny.
1234309	1235990	Call of Duty 4 followed that.
1236530	1238611	Guitar Hero 3 on PS2 was behind that.
1239232	1246396	I think the only reason Wii Play did so well is because it was like controller plus cheap games and that made it stand out.
1246476	1254520	And it's like Wii Sports and people love Wii Sports and for a while there it was hard to find remotes and that was the only way you could find it.
1254700	1256361	So, win, win, win.
1256621	1257061	Sneaky.
1257202	1261424	We actually were at Fry's last week when I was having my computer drama
1262225	1269249	and there was a lady there trying to decide whether or not to buy Trauma Center or buy Wii Play and she's like, wait, this has a controller with it and put it down Trauma Center.
1270650	1270890	Wow.
1270910	1271331	That was it.
1272291	1273692	But Trauma Center is so awesome.
1273832	1274272	I know.
1274873	1276694	It's all about the lowest common denominator.
1277954	1278415	This is stupid.
1278435	1278895	For real.
1279015	1279856	There it is right there.
1279896	1281316	Nintendo's secret to success.
1281376	1283037	It's all about the lowest common denominator.
1283578	1283958	For real.
1284858	1286039	Nintendo deer hunting.
1286079	1286439	That's all.
1287560	1288060	That'll win.
1288481	1289061	Let's move on.
1289813	1293935	Nintendo came out and announced a few dates of titles coming out.
1294196	1296017	This is first and third party stuff.
1297397	1304582	For the first half of 2008, some of which we probably already knew about, some I guess were surprising, I don't know.
1304722	1309385	Anyways, one game that was rumored to be coming out soon was Okami on the Wii.
1309825	1311186	That's been dated for the 25th.
1313028	1323273	Wii Fit scheduled for quarter two, which that would coincide with the supposed rumor from 1UP that Wii Fit is supposed to come out May 2nd, or not 2nd, the 20th.
1324273	1332017	And let's see, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, they're going to have some sequels coming out for that in quarter two as well.
1332657	1336799	Crossword DS, Nintendo Crosswords, coming out May 5th.
1338256	1346939	and Professor Layton and the Curious Village, the current number one selling DS title in Japan right now, coming out in the United States on February 10th.
1348299	1350820	And let's see, some other fun stuff for the Wii.
1353440	1357822	February 26th, The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors, the Dragon Quest Swords game.
1359102	1362383	Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore.
1363243	1366464	That's coming out the early part of February as well.
1367774	1369814	And let's see here.
1371015	1373815	Looks like Apuna is scheduled to be coming out from Koei.
1373895	1376876	That's supposed to be a pretty good role-playing game.
1379116	1379936	It sounds dirty.
1380016	1380536	I'm sorry.
1380556	1385157	I'm laughing over here like a three-year-old, but... Apunani.
1385177	1386477	She can't contain herself either.
1387037	1389178	Ironically... It's hilarious.
1390238	1395479	Strangely enough, though, in here, they have Nitro Bike from Ubisoft listed as March...
1396471	1399052	Apparently they didn't realize it's already come out.
1400393	1402114	They didn't get the memo on that.
1402514	1411138	And then, of course, April, we cannot forget Wild Earth African Safari from Majesco, the ripoff of Africa.
1412678	1415800	And Cooking Mama Cook-Off 2 in June.
1415880	1418521	Because I know the first one controlled so well.
1418601	1420802	The Cooking Mama on Wii was horrific.
1421362	1422483	But the DS one's still cool.
1423083	1424584	So, I say.
1425602	1428983	Another cool game that's on the Nintendo DS is Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.
1429003	1430884	That game was pretty awesome on the Nintendo DS.
1431244	1438487	And some screenshots, some rumored screenshots have leaked from a new Castlevania game, although we kind of emphasize this is only a rumor at this time.
1438547	1440588	However, it would really not be a surprise.
1440628	1444069	It's kind of a no-brainer that Konami would probably make a follow-up game to this game.
1444709	1445229	Portrait of Ruin
1466983	1467963	It's unknown at this time.
1468003	1474345	But apparently there's some type of Wii menu item that's being seen in the screenshots on the screen.
1474965	1480467	Would that imply that there's going to be a Wii Castlevania game coming out soon as well then?
1480687	1481287	I would think.
1482627	1483247	I hope so.
1483728	1483948	Why?
1484808	1487269	Because Castlevania is a good franchise.
1487549	1488209	That's why.
1489420	1490661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1509028	1511069	But isn't that, I mean, that would be cheesy, though.
1511089	1513350	They don't have to have, like, you can actually whip.
1513411	1515292	No one says that you... It's not cheesy at all.
1515392	1516232	I would love that.
1516372	1520174	No one says you can't have just a traditional game on the Wii system.
1520214	1520475	Exactly.
1520495	1528119	I mean, people just, for some reason, get it stuck in their heads that they've got to make some, you know, motion control crap and stuff to go along with it.
1528479	1529220	You don't need to.
1530080	1533422	Look at, uh, what is it, you know, Super Paper Mario.
1534062	1538805	I mean, that didn't have too... I mean, it had some stuff, but it was pretty much a traditional game.
1540164	1543167	Macman says in chatroom, Castlevania whip carnival games.
1543827	1544287	There you go.
1546009	1546909	Don't applaud that.
1549311	1554535	Or Simon Belmont or whatever one of the Belmont crew has to tame lions or something like that.
1556717	1565843	GS68 in our chatroom speculates it's probably going to be Castlevania W of I because it has to say we.
1565884	1568886	So he's suggesting Castlevania Wind of Illness.
1569807	1571108	Does that sound Castlevania-esque to you?
1571128	1572568	That's very Castlevania-y.
1572708	1573529	Very Castlevania-esque.
1573789	1578792	But does it have to be like a music, like Symphony, Rondo, Wind of Incontinence?
1581593	1588156	The ones with the... Well... Sorry, JVS.
1589317	1598902	That really only applied to... Well, only applied to Dracula X. Because to be technical, Symphony of the Night slash Nocturne in the Moonlight
1599466	1603409	and all the other ones after that were just Castlevania
1621397	1622237	Now you're talking!
1622917	1623557	I'd buy that.
1623758	1624458	You know what I'd buy?
1624478	1626758	Well, I'm sure we're going to get into this a little bit later.
1626778	1629479	That's probably something Itagaki would be into as well, right?
1629499	1631079	There you go, yeah.
1631499	1633680	He'd have to whip the cowboy hat off his head.
1642341	1642681	Alright.
1643622	1643982	Anyhow.
1645142	1646642	Ew, this is a crappy game.
1646942	1647162	What?
1647442	1648183	From Namco.
1648603	1650443	It's listed as a game coming out in the summer.
1650865	1652606	Active Life, Outdoor Challenge.
1652846	1654067	I'm sorry, I don't want to be active.
1654767	1655608	I refuse to buy that game.
1655628	1656929	I like being active.
1656949	1657529	Maybe you need it.
1658209	1661271	They should have different types of interactive games like that.
1662552	1670697	Anyway, for our friends in the UK, there are a couple of things out for Virtual Console, and I'm very sorry for you all.
1671778	1674439	Well, I mean, one of them was okay, but there's better.
1675020	1678342	Like 1080 snowboarding from the Nintendo 64.
1679517	1680117	Yeah, it's out.
1680337	1680777	I'm sorry.
1682218	1684018	And then Riot Zone for TurboDuo.
1684138	1689140	I'm really sorry because it's not very good.
1690520	1692181	So, sorry.
1693601	1696902	Or, you know, if you're feeling adventurous, you could just say, you know what, forget Jamie's opinion.
1696922	1697863	I'm going to download it anyway.
1698343	1700843	If you want to download it and throw up, be my guest.
1700863	1701364	All right.
1702264	1703344	Well, enjoy or don't.
1704765	1709106	There is one game that's coming out on the WiiWare service at some point here
1710451	1712612	That's actually being scheduled for the second quarter of 2008.
1713153	1719938	It's a game called Platinum, and it's kind of a mix between a shooter and a puzzle game.
1720318	1724961	Now, what I thought was interesting is they were talking about some of the stuff that it will support.
1725482	1732287	One thing, they have a price point on it, which is going to be 1,500 Wii points, so you can kind of expect a lot of these games to be around the $10, $20 range.
1732387	1733908	Or $15 in that case.
1733928	1735229	Well, that's why that's a range, Robb.
1740468	1743110	You see, it falls right in the middle of that range.
1743130	1744211	Alright, I understand.
1744431	1745072	Basic math.
1745112	1745492	I get it.
1745552	1746232	I'm just saying.
1746613	1748534	You say 10 and 20, yet this game's going to be 15.
1749255	1755100	I'm just clarifying for our listeners who may not be following because they fell asleep during your report because they can't understand simple math.
1755160	1756641	Are you insulting our listeners like that?
1756681	1757482	No, I would never.
1761125	1762326	Look, it's Nintendo strategy.
1762386	1763667	Lowest common denominator, right?
1764348	1765869	Yeah, I guess.
1767317	1769498	It's got some interesting stuff though in it.
1769879	1772921	You can play it with the Wii Zapper, although I don't know why.
1774283	1778947	You can play it offline with up to 12 people at the same time.
1780048	1788475	So I guess that would be one person uses a nunchuck, one person uses a remote, and then also the four, that's four controllers, and then four GameCube controllers.
1789135	1789996	That's craziness.
1790917	1793239	I can't even fit that many people in my living room.
1797281	1799222	We did that once, remember WarioWare?
1799242	1800023	11 people.
1800783	1802084	That's right, but that was crazy.
1802104	1804206	That was like a workout because you had to run around.
1804266	1806307	There wasn't enough room in that room for people.
1808288	1810049	It supports DK Bongos.
1810069	1819075	We have finally another game that can utilize the DK Bongos.
1820236	1824359	Apparently they're also planning a version Can you use the Guitar Hero 3 controller too?
1825163	1826164	Oh, sure, why not?
1827645	1828885	If you can use everything.
1829426	1831067	Maybe Armat?
1831087	1831427	Maybe.
1831507	1836290	Actually, I'm sure you probably could, since, you know, it's... That could be like the ultimate showdown.
1836630	1837451	Twelve people.
1838051	1839132	Twelve peripherals.
1839972	1842014	In the ultimate WiiWare showdown.
1842034	1849018	Keep in mind, I think that it's actually pretty funny, because for me, who likes to find however many different controllers will work on a different game...
1850434	1852456	My friend was the one who invented Rod Caliber.
1852556	1853336	But here's the thing, though.
1853877	1860482	This will have a ton of different multiplayer options and peripheral options, but what if the game sucks?
1861062	1866306	It's like, oh, great, I can use all these controllers, but do we really want to play this game?
1866366	1870549	Now, are you sure it's a 12-player game, or is it somewhere in the range of 10 to 14 players?
1870849	1872010	No, it's 12 players.
1872090	1874712	It says, for support for 12 people.
1874752	1875833	It does not say a range of...
1876786	1878067	Game Developers Conference
1900370	1901811	That would actually be a really smart place.
1901851	1903111	It would make lots of sense.
1903151	1908672	And actually, now that I remember seeing this before, this was the first game that was announced for WiiWare at one time.
1908692	1909753	Actually, it doesn't look that bad.
1909813	1911033	It's kind of weird looking, though.
1911053	1913854	It's like, I don't know, how would you describe that?
1915494	1916034	Abstract.
1916974	1917555	Abstract.
1918475	1919315	This is great radio.
1920055	1922516	Rob, describe this screenshot for our listeners.
1922596	1923736	I don't know.
1923896	1924696	It's in space.
1924756	1926657	It's got bejeweled stuff and a sun.
1928821	1930302	From over here, it looked like pizza.
1930322	1930902	You're just hungry.
1930942	1931502	You just want to eat it.
1931602	1932262	All right, that's it.
1932422	1932922	Let's move on.
1934023	1936123	I think that's a good idea, though.
1936163	1942405	We need to do the whole 12 people, 12 peripherals, one game, and have a showdown, and then laugh at how stupid we are.
1943165	1943865	Power Glove wins.
1945266	1945506	Can you?
1948007	1948747	All right, anyhow.
1949667	1952428	Anyway, let's move on to another story.
1953695	1954336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1970948	1972149	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1993391	1997855	I guess they've taken Mario and combined it with, what the hell else?
1997875	2003840	They've got this game Fusion, and they've got, I guess, Kingdom Hearts all worked into one.
2004000	2007804	It's basically a game called Super Mario Bros.
2007844	2012288	Fusion, but it combines Mega Man, Halo, they've got Ghosts and Goblins, Sonic the Hedgehog,
2020202	2021123	Just a bunch of stuff.
2021183	2024525	And it's all made in this one GameMaker 7 program or whatever.
2024565	2028468	But it plays like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros.
2028808	2028468	3.
2028968	2031810	Wow, that's like a Halo stage and we had a Mega Man stage.
2031850	2032551	What else is there here?
2032951	2033811	That's more Mega Man.
2033951	2036173	Yeah, they have the whole entire Bubble Man stage.
2036193	2037754	That is craziness.
2038735	2039896	Somebody was really bored.
2040356	2042357	Yeah, I think that's all we see is the Bubble Man stage now.
2042397	2044138	But you can actually play the demo for it.
2044159	2044239	What?
2047034	2048214	You can throw the bubbles.
2048234	2052656	That's pretty awesome.
2054116	2054637	Very cool.
2055217	2056337	That's very creative.
2056477	2058518	Somebody's got a lot of free time on their hands.
2058538	2060359	That's actually cooler than Asshole Mario.
2061619	2062839	That's quite a compliment.
2063640	2065560	Yeah, because Asshole Mario is really cool.
2065820	2066260	And funny.
2066280	2066961	That's really cool.
2067621	2073583	Macman asks the question, Mario plus Kingdom Hearts plus Mega Man plus Halo plus Sonic equals Will It Blend?
2074872	2075772	Pirates of the Burning Sea on the 22nd
2100963	2127697	Advance Wars Dark Conflict and Burnout Paradise Cruisin' for Wii Donkey Kong Jet Race, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Imagination Invades on DS FDC World Darts Championship 2008 Fantasy Star Universe Ambition of Illuminus Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 Universe at War Earth Assault for PC
2131201	2131541	That it?
2132321	2132621	Yeah.
2132641	2134202	Doesn't seem like that busy of a week over there.
2135162	2135342	Huh.
2136402	2137503	Well, I guess it is January.
2137623	2141144	I guess all the people who are addicted to PSU will be happy.
2142464	2147185	Well, it's not a very busy week over in Japan either, but I'm going out of turn.
2147205	2148206	It's actually supposed to be the U.S.
2148246	2148786	states next.
2148806	2149146	My bad.
2150446	2150926	It's all right.
2151007	2151567	I can wait.
2152827	2156408	Anyways, in the U.S., we have a pretty good week of stuff coming out.
2157208	2159829	My personal favorite, No More Heroes, is coming out for the Wii.
2160441	2161442	Definitely worth picking up.
2162202	2164723	If you don't have a Wii, maybe you'll like this for the DS.
2164783	2167805	Advance Wars Days of Ruin looks pretty awesome.
2169646	2171567	Pirates of the Burning Sea for the PC.
2172728	2175269	Burnout Paradise coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2175670	2181853	If you're looking for more of a casual game, Endless Ocean on the Wii.
2183134	2185595	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games on the DS.
2186536	2188517	One Piece Unlimited Adventure on the Wii.
2189913	2192194	Iridium Runners on PlayStation 2.
2192754	2193514	It's a piece of crap.
2194335	2198256	And Rainbow Islands Evolution on the PSP.
2198356	2199417	Yay!
2199537	2202578	And hopefully you'll be able to get past... Hooray!
2203058	2210861	And exclusive to GameStop, I think it's hooray, Kawasaki Jetski, which is actually supposed to be like Wave Race.
2211261	2211841	Wave Race is cool.
2211861	2215843	But probably not going to be because it's put out by Destineer and every game that they make sucks.
2216443	2216703	But...
2217600	2220061	Cross our fingers, maybe someday their games won't suck.
2221102	2223143	I'm just going to say this about Rainbow Islands on the PSP.
2223343	2228526	I do love Rainbow Islands, the original Rainbow Islands game, and that is where my love for the series ends.
2228886	2232668	Because none of the games after that were really worth getting excited about.
2233309	2235570	Now we'll go over to Japanese... What about Parasol Stars?
2236150	2236811	That's different.
2236971	2241433	I mean, you could say all those games are in the Bubble Bobble universe, I suppose, but... Parasol Stars was great.
2241573	2242554	Parasol Stars was pretty cool.
2243749	2254078	Anyway, going over to Japanese release dates, not a lot on the Xbox 360, but you do have on the PlayStation 3 this week, Juice 2, which I think was delayed from last week, because it came out on all the other systems last week.
2254379	2263607	There really isn't a lot to speak of otherwise on the next-gen systems, but on the current-gen systems, such as PlayStation 2, or I don't know, is it high time for us to start calling it last-gen now?
2264048	2267471	PlayStation 2 is really last-gen, and current-gen is, I guess, last-gen, who knows?
2269584	2270685	How about we just call it PS2?
2297581	2299842	There's another Mahjong game coming out on the DS as well.
2300623	2303624	The Sims 2 Cast Away also comes out on the Nintendo DS.
2304044	2307106	And The Prince of Tennis, Driving Smash Side King.
2307486	2308667	That's an interesting anime.
2308847	2309167	That's right.
2309207	2312329	You too can be the Prince of Tennis in the privacy of your own home.
2312809	2314610	I'd rather be the Prince of the Cosmos.
2315770	2323314	On the Sony PSP, not a whole lot of stuff, but you do have Winning Eleven, Ubiquitous Evolution 2008 coming out on the PSP.
2323334	2326156	A couple other games getting price reductions, such as Luminous 2.
2327085	2329625	That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
2330986	2332086	That's all happy and good.
2333186	2346068	Well, speaking of things that are happy and good, there was a... Well, I'm sure that people have heard about this by now, but there was a guy named Paxton Galvanek who rescued two victims from an overturned SUV in North Carolina.
2348209	2355810	And this guy's supposed to be pretty cool because he, you know, assessed the situation, treated their wounds like with perfect first aid, kept them alive.
2357920	2360722	and his medical background consists of playing America's Army.
2362703	2363004	Wow.
2363784	2386060	Apparently there's a classroom in there and part of the classroom area is basically all the stuff they go through in BASIC which is including a medic class so that you learn BASIC first aid and when he witnessed the accident he basically went right into that mode and the first person he treated was someone who had lost two fingers and so he
2386753	2391296	Used a towel to stop the bleeding and held their hand over their head.
2391416	2395258	I've got a full first aid certification because I have to as a massage therapist.
2395978	2397759	And that's the first thing that you do.
2397799	2403943	You see who's more injured and if they're bleeding, you hold their hand over their head and have them do that.
2403983	2405964	And you also treated somebody for a head wound too.
2406484	2416410	So that by the time someone arrived, which I think is kind of funny because it said it was a soldier that showed up to help them out, everybody was fine.
2417817	2426799	and he actually, uh... I think it's pretty cool, though, if they're putting in, like, actual real first aid techniques in that game, then that's pretty cool.
2427059	2428820	By chance, did he play Trauma Center as well?
2429640	2430300	I don't think so.
2430860	2432881	Because you can learn a little bit from playing Trauma Center.
2433301	2434521	Like, we're not to cut people?
2435461	2438042	You can stitch up somebody by, you know, waving furiously.
2438262	2441643	And then you can also stop time, slow down time if you use your psychic powers.
2441823	2444724	Star, you can totally, like, heal them completely.
2444844	2445104	Wow.
2446630	2448893	Okay, so maybe America's Army is a little more practical.
2449434	2458866	Well, I mean, that was the whole point of that game, though, is to show, you know, what it's supposed to be like to go through, you know, basic and be out, you know, on the field and everything.
2459747	2463312	And I actually think that's kind of cool that someone could just...
2464588	2465889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2488786	2490027	I want to be the medic!
2515189	2515830	Sure, they do.
2515850	2520213	I think it's more of the be all you can be and going into the army can strengthen yourself.
2521254	2521695	Whatever.
2525878	2534686	I think it's like when people are playing an MMO and they pick their class, it's like the same people who would pick a priest because they like to assist and heal people.
2535486	2537068	That's my theory.
2538229	2542072	And of course our chat room is breaking out into a chorus of heal please, heal please.
2544016	2544816	Have you ever played America's Army?
2544836	2546797	It is a rigorous training process just to start the game.
2567624	2571987	They make you take tests before you get your gun, and then it jams.
2572207	2573428	Sounds like fun.
2573988	2574909	Sounds like a lot of fun.
2575429	2579972	LF-10000M, Iraq Instance, tank and healer needed, please send tell.
2580152	2587677	Well, if people are, you know, buying the game for the purpose of what it is, as a simulation, then it needs to be that in-depth.
2588378	2590739	Because, I mean, really the game is just a marketing tool for the army anyway.
2592420	2596703	It is, but... And now this kid is going to be the poster child of that game.
2597219	2599139	Look, see what America's Army can do?
2599560	2602020	Now imagine what would happen if you joined the real military.
2602200	2607901	I was just reading the thing over and saying, you know, when he was talking about what he did, and I was like, that is proper first aid.
2608421	2611502	That's what you're supposed to do, so pay attention.
2611842	2612482	Kudos to you.
2614723	2615383	Hooray.
2615763	2620184	So I guess you really can't stitch up somebody by going like this and flailing your arm about.
2620204	2621444	I refuse to believe it, Rob.
2622324	2623825	All right, let's move on.
2624585	2625065	Anyways.
2626174	2628616	Something along the same lines as America's Army.
2629737	2630358	Okay, maybe not.
2630838	2636623	But apparently the porn industry has dropped their backing for HD DVD.
2637283	2640626	No!
2640846	2645310	And dozens of Xbox 360 owners cry out in pain all at once.
2646851	2650674	I'm going to put my HD DVD player on Craigslist tomorrow.
2651607	2660110	I mean, I don't know if it's everybody, but one studio in particular, Digital Playground, has decided to abandon HDTV and stick solely with Blu-ray.
2661691	2663511	Good for them, I guess.
2663691	2665272	But not every studio.
2665312	2667833	Not every studio, as a lot of people are reporting.
2667973	2669354	It's just Digital Playground.
2670274	2672555	It wasn't... Never mind, I'm not going to say it.
2672795	2674275	And, you know, I don't know.
2676316	2678697	To be honest, I... Let's...
2681590	2683792	Sorry, Irene and I are giggling like three-year-olds over here.
2684312	2687815	Irene's all, you're just hoping it's not Falcon or Colt, huh?
2689557	2691358	No, I mean, it's one studio.
2691418	2692979	I mean, how many porn studios are out there?
2693019	2694501	Seriously, there's a ton of them.
2694781	2704629	But let's see what Digital Playground has to offer us, you know, because... Okay, I mean, seriously, let's see here...
2705586	2711269	They're top-selling titles that you may be missing if you have an HD DVD and you want it in HD.
2713069	2731397	Jack's Teen America 19, Mrs. Bee Haven, Jesse's Juice, Janikova and Blue, Forbidden Tales, Jack's Big Tits Show 4, Hush, and Jesse Jane's Scream.
2732378	2732738	Although...
2733154	2737658	To their credit though, they did produce the Pirates film, and Pirates was hilarious.
2738899	2740000	Hilariously bad.
2740200	2741021	Hilariously bad.
2741841	2748367	Macman suggested the PlayStation 3's newest games, Drake's Penis, Ratchet and Dick, and Heavenly Sword.
2752110	2759096	But here's the thing though, they may have stopped making HD DVDs, but they still sell them.
2759676	2761678	They still have quite a bit of stuff on there.
2762076	2766059	And besides, anyone that actually watches a lot of porn anyways, they don't buy their porn.
2766079	2769881	I mean, come on, this is the internet revolution, you know.
2770221	2772143	Who actually buys porn nowadays?
2772883	2775005	And you can find plenty of it in DivX out there.
2775545	2780108	And remember, your PlayStation 3 also plays DivX, and hopefully Xbox 360 will at some point soon.
2780488	2781389	Where you can stream stuff.
2783030	2785692	I believe Xbox 360 is already playing DivX now after their last patch.
2786452	2787213	Yeah, so...
2788888	2789348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2811638	2812159	Thanks for watching!
2823590	2824610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2848719	2853041	So SingStar does not appear to be doing quite as well as people originally thought.
2853301	2855242	I'm glad they can under-deliver like normal.
2855422	2858543	Now, however, to be fair, Sony did make a response a little later in the week.
2858863	2863164	SingStar Studios said that downloadable songs for SingStore are on the way.
2863765	2865985	The original vision was supposed to be 350, but they missed the mark.
2868086	2873147	However, they are going to put out 18 new tracks on January 18th, which should have already passed.
2874028	2875828	15 English songs and 3 Spanish ones.
2876328	2879009	Including David Bowie and Blur.
2879369	2879809	Not bad.
2881309	2884530	And February 4th is supposed to see the launch of even more songs.
2884550	2885070	That's okay.
2885090	2886311	They only missed the mark by 200 songs.
2890651	2893112	Oh, and 15 of those are in English.
2893472	2896352	Well, they're supposed to be updating it now twice a week.
2896432	2898713	Sorry, not twice a week, twice a month.
2898733	2899273	That's okay.
2899313	2901033	No one needs to be playing SingStar anyways.
2901233	2902954	It's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.
2903414	2904794	I enjoyed it.
2904914	2908435	Karaoke is a horrible, horrible, horrible piece of entertainment, okay?
2908515	2909295	How do you really feel?
2910375	2914756	Plus they have the ability to upload videos of yourself singing.
2915056	2915676	Who would do that?
2915716	2916216	That's lame.
2918517	2919337	I don't know what to tell you.
2921781	2925322	Well, we do have a situation.
2926762	2927022	Uh-oh.
2929483	2930803	Do I have to call out the troops?
2931423	2931623	No.
2932344	2933224	Do I have to get a medic?
2933624	2933884	No.
2936165	2940786	I'm sorry for all of our European listeners who are excited about Uncharted.
2940846	2941906	It's not in 1080i.
2943466	2943746	Sorry.
2945107	2950788	It was only added to the US version later in development, and the PAL version is not going to have it.
2951169	2952630	Thank God, I thought there was a real problem.
2952790	2957712	They said that it would delay the game's release because they have to test it for QA.
2957952	2959473	Sorry!
2960093	2962254	Wait a minute, game developers are QA-ing their games again?
2962294	2962855	That's good news.
2962935	2964315	It'll be 480p.
2964735	2971219	If you really have been out of shape about that, remember, PlayStation 3 games are region-free.
2972399	2977762	So, if you really need your 1080i, to be honest, you're not going to tell the difference between... If you've got an HDTV...
2978872	2981392	Then it doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.
2982373	2982893	No, it shouldn't.
2983533	2984093	So get it!
2984333	2984733	Import it!
2986913	2987754	And there's your workaround.
2988554	2989134	Hooray!
2989194	2990094	Workaround!
2991154	3003556	Speaking of workaround, they finally released the custom firmware from DarkAlex, the guy behind all those wonderful PSP custom firmwares, or at least all the popular ones.
3004656	3005417	He has just released 3.80 M33
3008699	3015965	and it will give you all the wonderful features of 3.8 including the streaming internet radio and all that fun stuff.
3016285	3018366	Plus a bunch of new features as well.
3019547	3037801	One of the cool things I liked about this actually is you can, once you've loaded 3.8 in there, any additional firmware updates that happen to come along from the custom firmware scene, you can actually update them over the internet just like you would your normal PSP firmwares.
3038137	3045439	So you can just, you know, download an update and update it right there, just like you would any official firmware.
3046239	3048020	Which I did, and it was pretty cool.
3049140	3062924	But that's available right now for PSP Slims, and they also have one for the PSP Fat, I guess, that also has some of the stuff for the 1.5 firmware, so you can run your homebrew crap.
3065225	3066285	But try as they may,
3067486	3068307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3084352	3090295	One thing that perhaps Dark Alex maybe wants to work on soon is solving the Dust problem on the PlayStation 3.
3091135	3095637	Because, no, I'm not trying to make a joke that nobody's playing their PlayStation 3, so they're getting dusty.
3095677	3099479	But remember, remember, like, Dust killed somebody's PlayStation?
3099539	3101280	Like, Sony refused to do anything about it or something like that?
3101540	3105662	The guy ended up getting a refund from the credit card company or something like that.
3106496	3110482	Dust is obviously a huge issue for PlayStations.
3110703	3115210	Dude, that PS3 right there looks like someone put it under their sawhorse when they were cutting some wood or something.
3115270	3115951	I mean, this is ridiculous.
3115971	3118015	They do collect dust, though, really easily.
3118335	3119197	They're dust magnets.
3119775	3120255	I'm telling you.
3141722	3142283	and so on.
3142363	3147627	So insert your dust cap joke here, but there is officially a dust cap coming for the PlayStation 3.
3147687	3148908	That's actually pretty cool.
3149248	3150970	That company makes really good stuff.
3151050	3154913	We've got a couple of controllers that they put out.
3155954	3157875	The GameCube ones back in the day.
3157896	3160698	I want a mod that makes my PS3 smoke a cigarette.
3161238	3162599	That would make it even cooler.
3163580	3168845	Or you could just not smoke next to your PlayStation 3 or put it in a well-fitting...
3170270	3172812	Take a hit off this PS3, you'll love it.
3174793	3176454	Suddenly your PlayStation 3 is glowing.
3176775	3177775	Wanna get high?
3179076	3180577	Look at the website though.
3181158	3182839	Did you look at the ad for it?
3183499	3183679	No.
3185040	3186321	It's actually pretty cool.
3186902	3190544	Looking at how all of this fits in, I think it's a very good idea.
3192326	3193346	How it all pieces together?
3193867	3198090	Well, they said that it's charged with static to attract the dust.
3198770	3199911	You know like those static wipes?
3201377	3201857	for dusting.
3202517	3203598	It's the same theory on there.
3203618	3204618	That's actually pretty cool.
3205178	3205418	Wow.
3207399	3208379	I'll link the ad in the chat room.
3208979	3209380	Interesting.
3209400	3212541	Yeah, the ad is available at Hori.jp.
3212581	3215061	Just browse to their products for the Dusk Guard Kit 3.
3215441	3219763	I know, um, I think that GameStop still carries a lot of Hori products.
3220523	3222024	So, shouldn't have any problem.
3222284	3222564	Very cool.
3222604	3223624	Dusk Cap 3.
3224184	3225905	I was always hoping it would come to the US.
3228265	3229726	Well, let's move on with some more news.
3230543	3231704	Well, in other news.
3232045	3234667	And, you know, we said we weren't going to talk about this guy again.
3235108	3237951	But he, who shall not be named, keeps reappearing.
3240173	3242215	Has he opened the Chamber of Secrets this time?
3242536	3243276	He's trying.
3243757	3246500	He's trying to open up a can of drama is what he's doing.
3246840	3247361	Oh, really?
3250264	3250724	Yeah, really.
3252086	3253247	Anyway, um...
3254048	3256629	Jack Thompson, The Butthead, Lord Voldemort
3279597	3308679	and he's quoted saying I was never interviewed about Buzz I never heard about it until I was quoted having allegedly said this about it and what he was quoted as saying is that video games have hurt far more people than they have helped and he said that what he would say well I'm just going to read his quote because he speaks in circles I would never say what I am quoted as saying in any context as the quotation regardless of what it is applied to is absurd on its face
3309326	3313589	How in the world could anyone prove and or quantify that games have hurt more people than they have helped?
3315730	3317471	That sounds to me like he's lying.
3319772	3324115	You know, every time this guy opens his mouth, I don't know about you, but I get a little bit angsty.
3324135	3324995	Do you get a little angsty?
3325236	3325616	Mm-hmm.
3325636	3326536	And you know what?
3326857	3327017	What?
3327037	3334081	Real quick, I was just going to mention that Take-Two actually proactively sued him, so that's also going on right now, too.
3335253	3340276	You know, Loki cut me off, and that makes me even more angsty, so you know it's time to bring on the FUs of the week!
3354225	3363091	An FU to my washing machine for not wanting to wash my hoodie by itself and imbalancing.
3363843	3366064	Because I really wanted to wear my Jack hoodie tonight.
3366965	3368906	My Nightmare Before Christmas one.
3370127	3371388	And I couldn't because it's still wet.
3372548	3374049	I'm really not very instant.
3375570	3376211	Alright.
3376291	3376591	Oh, no.
3376891	3383035	And F you to my cat for throwing up a hairball on my massage diploma.
3383795	3385556	So now I have to go get a reprint of it.
3386377	3387278	And my transcripts.
3387298	3388418	Now I have to get reprints of those.
3388618	3388959	And F you...
3389935	3396220	to my folder from when I first started school because it has all my massage school receipts in it so that I can have myself one big fat tax write-off.
3399062	3399443	All done.
3400123	3400263	And?
3400323	3402825	An FU to the company I work for for not claiming my W-2 yet.
3404106	3404667	For real?
3404807	3405547	I want money!
3405788	3406248	Me too.
3407509	3408310	Loki, your FUs.
3410031	3413714	Um, FU to the theater that I went and saw Cloverfield in.
3414144	3423788	because the entire time the front left speaker was making a noise so it was really annoying the entire movie.
3424028	3425408	Are you sure it wasn't just the monster?
3425788	3426509	I'm pretty sure.
3426809	3433011	And we went and complained to management and they're like, you know, a bunch of little kids running around trying to figure out how to fix the speaker.
3433051	3435072	The monster didn't go have some fourth meal at Taco Bell?
3435392	3436032	I'm pretty sure.
3439053	3439433	Is that it?
3439834	3440354	That's it.
3440814	3443575	My FU of the week goes to the damn flies in here
3444056	3448479	Who have not been served yet with the swatter of justice Are they hiding right now?
3448499	3458585	I think they are I haven't seen one in a little while F you to the fact that the flies hide all week long And then they come out on Sunday, I hate that Anyhow, Rice Princess, Nathan, you guys have anything you want to add?
3459225	3470813	Flies just like listening to the show, jeez F you to being sick and not being able to hear out of my left ear So I sound like an old woman like, eh?
3470833	3473014	Why'd you say that again, Shani?
3473652	3474733	Like, yeah, it's annoying.
3475093	3479315	And then I also second the FU to Cloverfield audiences.
3479795	3481135	Wait, no, you just said the theater, right?
3482136	3482716	The audio.
3483236	3486938	Well, I say FU to the audience, because they're stupid and immature.
3487679	3490740	And they're, like, yelling out what they thought of the movie at the end.
3491080	3493661	That's why I don't go see movies on opening weekend ever.
3494602	3495122	Because of kids.
3496144	3497265	Yeah, there were a bunch of kids.
3497285	3503849	It's not like I went out and said, you know, my opinion on the movie, because I don't care to do that, but people do, and they're stupid, so...
3504669	3505410	F.U.!
3508391	3509532	My only F.U.
3509912	3511453	is for Nintendo.
3512414	3523601	I love you guys, but you gotta really hurry up and make available on the virtual console Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
3523681	3525202	Super Mario RPG
3526866	3530969	Some people haven't played it and don't know how great it is.
3536752	3538053	My games look better.
3538073	3540135	I have one.
3542896	3545398	Have you to know Guardian Legend either?
3545618	3546959	Greatest 8-bit game of all time.
3547459	3549000	We've been saying that for a long time on this show.
3549381	3552583	But I do agree, Super Mario RPG would make a fine addition to Virtual Console.
3554044	3555124	But don't keep holding your breath.
3555905	3556205	Anyhow.
3557040	3559100	Anyway, Loki, anyway.
3561901	3571383	So, this is kind of exciting, and hopefully this comes out in the Wii, because this would be one of those games that could utilize that whipping motion from the Wii Remote.
3571963	3578525	But Leisure Suit Larry, box office bust, is coming to consoles and the PC fall of 2008.
3579425	3583566	And, yes, if you don't remember Leisure Suit Larry, well...
3584850	3586812	XBOX 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and Mobile Phones Team 17, The Worms Games
3614716	3615016	Nice.
3616957	3617317	Oh, cool.
3617398	3622080	And the script, I guess, is being penned by Happy Madison Productions' Alan Covert.
3624301	3627003	Is that Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison or something?
3627523	3630425	Well, Happy Madison is Adam Sandler's production group.
3630445	3631005	Oh, okay.
3631125	3643652	And Alan Covert, he's done such wonderful movies as... I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry, Grandma's Boy, Eight Crazy Nights...
3643973	3651815	Mr. Deeds, Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo, Waterboy, pretty much every other Adam Sandler movie that's been out there.
3651835	3652455	Happy Gilmore.
3654796	3655296	You know what?
3656016	3661718	If only that game had Adam Sandler and the whole Happy Madison group doing the voices in there, that might be cool.
3661878	3664179	Because Rob Schneider in that game, that could be cool.
3664339	3665479	You can do it!
3665719	3666859	All night long.
3667700	3670200	They should make a Leisure Suit Larry movie.
3671401	3672041	Happy Madison.
3672401	3672901	That would be cool.
3673732	3676374	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3703105	3711297	One of the games I actually, one of my favorite games is Burning Rangers, which is also put out by Sonic Team, who can do no wrong.
3712658	3713500	I love Sonic Team.
3714421	3717986	Anyway, the game is basically set in the future where...
3718624	3722887	The only few hazards remaining is one of them is fire.
3723267	3729451	So these are futuristic firefighters who use their super sentai powers to extinguish flames and rescue people.
3729971	3738377	And after you beat the game once, you actually have a random level generator that you can use to change the game each time you go play it.
3739618	3747643	As far as the technical side of it, for people who were Saturn fans, you know that the Saturn was...
3749322	3751404	ADX Audio Compression Fantasy Star Online
3768953	3777377	There was a central dome fire swirl level where one of the main characters from Burning Rangers asked you to help them put out fires and help people.
3778077	3783080	And had the music from the Japanese version of Burning Rangers, which was Angels with Burning Hearts.
3784280	3786721	Two of the vocal songs were in Sonic Pinball Party.
3788122	3794445	Also, the theme song was in Samba de Amigo, if you remember, as one of the downloadable songs.
3795063	3795483	Samba de Amigo
3826307	3827187	Burning Rangers is cool.
3828068	3831149	There you have it, your classic game of the week, Burning Rangers.
3831449	3833670	A game I never played, but maybe I ought to.
3834450	3836811	Well, I will bring that to the Saturn over one day.
3836971	3837631	I think you should.
3838392	3843373	I think it's funny that it goes for bucks on eBay, and I got mine at a convention swap meet for 30 bucks.
3844034	3844254	Wow.
3845314	3846555	Sometimes you find little gems there.
3847135	3847675	So there you go.
3848354	3852519	All right, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of our show.
3852939	3865993	But as you know, Orange Lounge Radio is divvied up into two parts every week, so we will be right back after just a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
3866433	3870758	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
