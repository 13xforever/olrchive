0	20200	Tonight, January 6th, 2008, we'll lose the bound of another Xbox 360 model, Rock Band
20200	24480	gets new songs from the magazine and later this month you can call our show from your
24480	32360	PSP.
32360	36160	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36160	37160	Radio.
37160	41880	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture
41880	43400	and the gamer lifestyle.
43400	47960	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,
47960	48960	Jamie Summers.
48960	49960	Hi.
49960	50960	And how are you Miss Summers?
50960	51960	I'm recovering.
51960	52960	Recovering?
52960	53960	That's right, you've been kind of sick.
53960	59240	I remember last week on our year-end show you were sinacy and sniffly, but you seem
59240	61460	a little better this week.
61460	65540	It took me practically the whole week to get over my sinus infection and drinking to excess
65540	71280	on New Year's Eve did not help, nor did, you know, singing for on Rock Band, nor did that
71280	72280	help.
72280	75840	Yeah, you look like you have about 80% HP this week.
75840	76840	Yeah.
76840	79160	Last week you were in the red, definitely.
79160	86320	Wednesday I got to work and I was just in hell, so I called in on Thursday and Friday
86320	92280	and tried to get to the doctor and apparently all the medical facilities lost power because
92280	94280	of our crazy Alabama-esque storms.
94280	98600	Oh yeah, we'll be talking about that in a moment, our non-gaming bit.
98600	105640	So I ended up having to talk to the advice nurse and sent out the husband to get the
105640	110680	drugs and I'm functional today.
110680	112600	Let me cast cure on you.
112600	116560	I'm on the last day, I'm on the very last of my antibiotics today.
116560	121420	All right, well hopefully that'll work and you'll be backed up to 100% health next week.
121420	123360	Maybe you'll even gain a level.
123360	124360	Hurray!
124360	128240	Joining us as well, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
128240	129240	Hello.
129240	130240	How are you, Loki?
130240	131240	I'm good.
131240	132240	Yeah?
132240	133240	And how are you?
133240	134240	Are you at 100% HP this week?
134240	136960	I'm reading in gadget right now.
136960	137960	Are you?
137960	141640	Well, I'm just catching up on the Sony thing.
141640	146120	That's right, because as we are taping live, we do subject ourselves to a live taping every
146120	150320	week and right now, this very moment as we were taping on this Sunday night, Consumer
150320	153720	Electronics Show is just starting to get underway.
153720	158640	And it's actually kind of funny because I was considering a last minute getaway because
158640	163400	I'm still on vacation from the day job until Wednesday, so William and I were considering
163400	167120	doing another last minute getaway and we were going to go to Disneyland, but then we're
167120	170880	like, we probably shouldn't do that because the crazy storms are on the way and we actually
170880	172680	thought about going to Vegas.
172680	177440	And so I was looking at hotels in Vegas, I'm like, I cannot, why are all the hotel rooms
177440	179280	doubling as of Monday night?
179280	182620	Like we were looking at rooms like Excalibur and Circus Circus and like some of the not
182620	184360	so high end places, right?
184360	189400	And like these places were shooting up to like, you know, twice as much on Monday night
189400	191800	and I couldn't figure out what it was and it finally dawned on me today.
191800	196560	I was like, oh, we couldn't go because Consumer Electronics Show is starting.
196560	197560	And then I was kind of pissed.
197560	200520	I was like, why the fuck didn't I go to Consumer Electronics Show?
200520	204320	I had this time off of work, I totally could have gone if I had planned better.
204320	206480	They don't announce too much at CES.
206480	211500	It's not a lot of gaming stuff, but you know, I happen to be a little bit of a tech nerd
211500	215120	in addition to a gaming nerd, as I'm sure a lot of our fans are.
215120	218040	There's a little bit of tech nerdiness that goes with the gaming nerdiness, right?
218040	219360	Am I right?
219360	220360	Yeah.
220360	221360	So it would be fun to go.
221360	225160	And even William was like, I want to go to that sometime because you know him.
225160	229920	He likes to look at the big TVs and all that stuff and you know, he's the only PlayStation
229920	231480	3 supporter I know of in the world.
231480	233520	Yeah, I support the PlayStation 3.
233520	237120	You know what, I'll be supporting their online services as soon as they come out with those
237120	244080	prepaid cards for their online content because I don't want to set up account and deduct
244080	246280	money with my credit card.
246280	251760	I'd rather use my hundreds of dollars of GameStop credit to buy cards that can translate
251760	252760	to that.
252760	256240	Well, Sony should seriously consider hiring my boyfriend as their major Nelson or something
256240	260400	like that because he'll seriously tell people, you know, with me sitting right there and
260400	265000	you know, I've been fairly critical of Sony, although I like to think I'm fair, but he'll
265000	269280	sit there and tell me, oh no, you want a PlayStation 3 because it has MotorStorm.
269280	273800	You want to get a PlayStation 3 because it has four chips in it and it's like having
273800	275280	four brains.
275280	280120	I'm like, but when you don't have any games to play on those four brains, what's the point?
280120	282880	And we argue about this all the time.
282880	284880	I don't know.
284880	289160	Anyhow, let's, so we'll be talking about Consumer Electronics Show on throughout the night,
289160	291120	but first let's start off a little bit.
291120	293560	Actually I want to talk about this too.
293560	296880	Those storms have been nuts, have been like absolutely crazy.
296880	300720	Now I guess Loki and I are probably spoiled though because we've lived in California our
300720	304000	entire lives and I'll tell you what, for those of you guys who don't live in California,
304000	307800	we are freaking spoiled here when it comes to storms and things like that.
307800	308800	No shit, Sherlock.
308800	312520	And when this, I mean it was like a freaking hurricane coming in or something.
312520	313520	No it wasn't.
313520	316800	I know, but that's how everybody was calling it, like it was a hurricane, it was horrible.
316800	317800	We just had these storms.
317800	319800	It was more like a tropical storm.
319800	323880	But it damn near had us not do a show tonight because my internet was down for the longest
323880	327000	time and I was afraid that we weren't going to be able to do a show tonight because we
327000	328000	had no internet.
328000	331000	This giant tree fell just up the street and knocked out a bunch of power.
331000	333120	A bunch of homes in the block are still without power.
333120	335840	A bunch of the traffic lights were out.
335840	343340	It's like, I don't see why at least Sacramento isn't better prepared for heavy rain because
343340	352640	every winter is the rainy season and a couple of years ago I remember when it wasn't as
352640	355780	windy but it rained as badly.
355780	362000	This is the first time that I've lived in this state that I can safely say that the
362000	368640	weather has woken me up from a deep sleep and that hasn't happened since I lived in
368640	374740	Alabama and actually that happened during the type 2 hurricane so yeah.
374740	378480	You know I wasn't here the night the big storm hit.
378480	384200	I was at Williams that night and then I came back yesterday and one of our trash cans is
384200	385600	gone missing.
385600	386600	No idea where it is.
386600	387600	Have to call the city.
387600	389160	I don't know if it flew up the street or where the hell it is.
389160	390160	It's completely gone.
390160	391160	It's in Oz.
391160	392160	Apparently.
392160	393760	But it's like...
393760	394760	Linda is using it.
394760	397080	Where the fuck am I going to put my trash?
397080	398080	Call the city.
398080	399080	Thankfully I haven't been here.
399080	403560	My roommate, my poor roommate, they went on vacation in Mendocino, this big family vacation.
403560	405640	They spent the whole time up there without power.
405640	407120	They played Yahtzee by Candlelight.
407120	408280	That's how they spent their time.
408280	410480	I've done that before.
410480	411480	What a vacation though.
411480	413700	Actually I played D&D by Candlelight.
413700	418640	But it's one of those things where once you get the house you can't get your money back.
418640	420320	So they just had to kind of grin and bear it.
420320	421320	Anyway, sorry.
421320	422320	It has nothing to do with games.
422320	425800	Well, except for the fact that when there's an outage, you know, no games for you.
425800	426800	Well, I talked to Extafur.
426800	427800	Huh?
427800	431640	I talked to Extafur for a little bit and he said his power was out but that he had his
431640	433440	iPhone so everything was good.
433440	434440	No.
434440	435760	Well, thank God.
435760	438120	He'd called me earlier this week and said, is your power out?
438120	443280	And I'm sitting there with my laptop in my lap and my PC sitting there like chugging
443280	446400	out power from, you know, the wall.
446400	451040	Just like blasting air as I'm like running stress tests and stuff and I'm like, no, my
451040	452520	power hasn't been out.
452520	456240	Well, our power flickered for a little bit.
456240	459320	And I was like, well, that's okay because I'm freaking sick.
459320	461240	I'll just sleep through it.
461240	463360	That was my whole thing.
463360	469960	But I needed to go to the doctor really badly because I had been coughing rather heavily
469960	475880	and I'm sure that a lot of our long time listeners remember when I had the plague.
475880	479880	Basically I had started off as a sinus infection, went into bronchitis, went into pneumonia.
479880	481960	I was sick for three months.
481960	485960	And so my whole thing is I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.
485960	487720	And so I needed to go.
487720	492440	But thankfully the advice nurse gave me good advice.
492440	496880	But I was just thinking about how many people at the medical facilities, you know, like
496880	501880	people with injuries and Dan's point was, he's like, well, I'd rather you be sick for
501880	505560	another couple of weeks than be in the hospital.
505560	507440	And I was like, I know how to drive in this weather.
507440	510640	He's like, yeah, you do, but no one else does.
510640	511640	That's true.
511640	513160	When it rains in California, everybody forgets how to drive.
513160	516760	My drive tire is almost bald, so he wouldn't drive me either.
516760	517760	Only when it rains.
517760	518760	All right.
518760	520920	We're turning into the Weather Channel podcast.
520920	524280	Sorry, guys, but it's definitely been a topic on our minds this week.
524280	527240	And you know, it has impacted our gaming weeks, I'm sure.
527240	530520	I know it impacted mine, but I'll let Jamie start off with how was your gaming week as
530520	531520	we always do.
531520	536160	I tried to play my DS and my eyes hurt too badly from my sinus pressure.
536160	539340	So I basically played a lot of Ragnarok.
539340	542800	And I tried to play pinball and got dizzy.
542800	545240	So I didn't play any more pinball.
545240	553160	But we Dan did break out Assassin's Creed on actually on a near morning.
553160	555280	His buddy Eric broke it out.
555280	559360	So I actually got to see quite a bit more of that in person.
559360	566280	And it's pretty, but I heard quite a bit of cursing coming from the other room on Thursday
566280	568560	when Will came over to play.
568560	571840	And of course, there was lots of rock band.
571840	572840	Lots and lots of rock band.
572840	574600	And I got my Ninja Pass.
574600	581520	The Ninja Pass is this lovely device that uses a micro SD card to load Game Boy DS games.
581520	584480	Oh, okay, I've heard of this.
584480	593680	And so, of course, we cannot on the air condone piracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but
593680	595320	I have the Lindon too.
595320	597240	And I have the Tingle game.
597240	600060	I haven't loaded them yet, but I have them.
600060	602280	I'm okay with doing that to imports.
602280	606920	I think if ethically I'm okay with pirating the imports, because it's kind of one of those
606920	609480	things where it's like, well, if you're not going to release it here, which I know some
609480	612480	people are going to yell at me going, it's still wrong, fine, that's fine.
612480	615680	But my own philosophy is if you're not going to release it here, then I'm going to get
615680	619400	it one way or another, because I'm not paying those insane markup fees.
619400	621620	I mean, it is insane to import a game.
621620	625160	But games that are released here domestically, I don't really pirate.
625160	626400	I buy most of my games.
626400	632720	Well, there's a few games that I got that looked interesting.
632720	636400	I'll have to put in my jump drive and get the names of them, because a few of them I
636400	637400	don't remember.
637400	641800	But I think it'll be a pretty good investment.
641800	645960	I mean, they were like 40 bucks a piece, and my friend ordered them in bulk.
645960	651440	So both my husband and I have one, and I'm looking forward to using the hell out of it
651440	655520	as soon as I can get the reader to work.
655520	657000	All right, well, have fun with that.
657000	659000	Let us know how it goes.
659000	661580	Loki, how was your gaming week?
661580	663640	My gaming week was pretty good.
663640	668840	Actually, I don't know, you guys always call me the tech master Loki and stuff, but I guess
668840	669840	I kind of earned my title.
669840	672680	I brought my 360 back from death.
672680	679280	So that's right, my three-ring 360 is working again, because I'm super awesome like that.
679280	683920	And it just involved taking the whole thing apart and replacing what they call the X-clamp,
683920	686760	which is something that holds the heat sink in place.
686760	692960	And once I did that, it worked fine, so it's pretty awesome.
692960	696320	So now that makes the console count six.
696320	700140	I now own six 360s, which is ridiculous.
700140	704760	So you brought back the red rings of death from the brink of death completely on your
704760	707320	own, and what technique did you use to do it?
707320	716040	It's basically if you search for X-clamp replacement, it literally takes about $6 in parts to do
716040	717040	it.
717040	720360	It's just some screws and a couple washers, and that's about it.
720360	725720	And what you do is because the way they built the clamp, which was genius to begin with,
725720	731040	is it all focuses, it looks like kind of an X with all the points bent down.
731040	735980	And so the middle is closest to the board, and they have a little plastic spacer on there.
735980	742240	So what happens is all the tension from the heat sink actually pushes up in the middle
742240	747920	of the chip, causing it over the time to basically warp the motherboard and possibly ruin some
747920	749180	of the solder joints.
749180	754320	So what you're basically doing is replacing the clamp with four screws with washer spacers
754320	760200	in there, and that way it kind of equals that tension across the entire board so that it's
760200	761200	not bending.
761200	765560	Plus, there was also a nice little foil piece on there, I guess a protective foil layer
765560	769000	on my heat sink, which probably wasn't too good either.
769000	772340	But once I replaced everything, it works fine now.
772340	775500	Let me read some comments from chat, because this is too good, and I have yet to introduce
775500	779640	the always present fourth guest on our show, the chat room over at chat.orangelaungereer.com,
779640	781960	which is much more full tonight than it was last week.
781960	785840	So welcome back everybody, after the holidays, I was just going to say, somebody who hasn't
785840	791000	learned how to change their nickname yet, but this is great, recruit number 6763 says,
791000	796600	and three rings later, Jesus 360 rose again, in regards to Loki's 360.
796600	800960	Frisbee says, Towley brings Xboxes back to life, referring to the towel trick.
800960	802960	Well, you don't really need to do that, actually.
802960	808720	It's kind of weird, because what you're supposed to do after you do that replacement of the
808720	812920	setup, you're supposed to turn it on without fans, and it's supposed to overheat.
812920	818640	Now I did that, basically turn it on, and wait for the three lights to turn the two
818640	822040	lights, but it did it almost instantly, and then I left it on there for about two minutes.
822040	824560	The thing is, though, is it didn't really heat up at all.
824560	827680	Like I mean, I felt the top, I felt the heat sink, felt the bottom, and I would think,
827680	831420	okay, this thing's going to be on fire, but it didn't even feel that different at all.
831420	835640	And poor Akuta, I'm reading this chat, Akuta in chat says, Ugh, I got the red ring of death
835640	839160	this week, the day I got my 360.
839160	840160	That sucks.
840160	843080	It sucks to be you, my friend, I'm sorry to hear it.
843080	846560	You know, it happened to me three days after I bought mine, so it's not too much different.
846560	850400	And honestly, if I hadn't opened my system, I probably would have just sent it in to get
850400	853280	replaced, but I did open my system.
853280	858200	Sakura Max says, Loki, you should just work at the 360 repair center.
858200	861120	Would you consider repairing somebody else's, like a legit system?
861120	865920	If they've actually, you know, I would say if they can't send it back into Microsoft,
865920	871800	then sure, I would do it, because it only took like six bucks with parts, but you know,
871800	875160	it's not guaranteed to work all the time, but from what I read on there, because they
875160	880880	have a thread with all the success stories, about 90% of them get repaired that way.
880880	881880	Wow.
881880	882880	That's amazing.
882880	886020	You know, I figured for six bucks, and it's broken anyways, I mean the worst that'll happen
886020	891040	is I waste six dollars and the 360's not replaced, but it works, so great.
891040	895480	Anyways, beyond all that, I actually played a few games this week.
895480	900080	I borrowed my wife's copy of Planet Puzzle League, because I bought it for her.
900080	901840	Actually, that game's pretty fun.
901840	905920	It reminds me a lot of Luminous, actually, a little bit, because they've got, you know,
905920	909680	kind of good music, it goes with the whole thing, you know, background's kind of flashing
909680	911720	and stuff, but it's a really fun puzzle game.
911720	913680	Do you ever play Pokemon Puzzle League?
913680	914680	No.
914680	915680	Same game?
915680	916680	Same thing.
916680	917680	Yeah.
917680	918680	Well, whatever, that's all right.
918680	919680	It's still fun.
919680	920680	No, it's still fun.
920680	922200	And then, let's see, what else did I play?
922200	926120	I played Crysis, because I finally finished my computer, and that's fun.
926120	931680	I mean, if you played Far Cry Instincts, it's basically the same damn thing, except now,
931680	936320	you know, instead of being like some vampire, not vampire, like a werewolf type thing, you
936320	940660	have this wonderful suit that can, you know, do amazing stuff, and it's very pretty.
940660	944520	My favorite aspect of the entire game is all the wildlife running around, so like, I'll
944520	948360	be fighting off, you know, some Koreans and stuff in the game, and then all of a sudden
948360	953720	I'll see this like, a flock of birds run by, and immediately I turn fire on them, you know,
953720	957520	or I pick up a chicken and huck it up into the air and then fire it.
957520	962520	Or my other favorite is, there was this turtle that I found, ran the beach when you first
962520	966720	land in the beginning of the game, and I wanted to put it back out into the sea, and fortunately
966720	972400	I switched to strength mode, and I threw the turtle, and the impact of the water killed
972400	973400	it.
973400	977760	I also punched it too, because I was trying to pick it up, and I'm like, I don't know
977760	978760	how to pick stuff up.
978760	979760	This game sounds rad.
979760	980760	It's awesome.
980760	985440	You can like, see seagulls like, flying around, literally just fire them all in the air, that's
985440	990680	the best part of the game, just all the like, crap that you can do that's in it.
990680	995160	I want to point out this other comment in chat that's pretty good, one of your most
995160	1001600	vocal critics here in chat, Rasteel UT, who's always condemning you to hell for being such
1001600	1005960	an advocate of modding and all that stuff, has this funny thing to say, he says, if Loki
1005960	1010120	would actually apply himself and do repairs on systems, instead of dedicating himself
1010120	1012440	to game theft, the world would be a better place.
1012440	1016400	Well, it's better now, because that one system that I repaired was my modded system, so now
1016400	1021680	he can send those cards and love letters to Loki at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1021680	1024200	That system will never see live ever again.
1024200	1026300	But my other one, that's a different story.
1026300	1030160	It is interesting though, I mean, for being such a, you know, I get the sense you don't
1030160	1032200	do this stuff to steal.
1032200	1036680	You do this because you like the challenge of modding systems and making them look cool.
1036680	1040740	I mean, that's kind of always why I've kind of turned the eye to it, is that I always
1040740	1043040	think you were more kind of in it for the challenge.
1043040	1047560	I mean, you do own six Xbox 360s, that's way more than an average person would own.
1047560	1052600	Yeah, I don't really want to own that many, but that's alright.
1052600	1055400	GS68 says, banned until 999 AD.
1055400	1056400	Ah, whatever.
1056400	1061880	Oh darn, if one of my 360s gets banned off live, gee, what will I ever do?
1061880	1062880	Alright.
1062880	1063880	Anyway.
1063880	1065880	Anything else for Gaming Weekly?
1065880	1069960	That's it, but before we move on, I wanted to give you guys your Christmas gifts, since
1069960	1071920	I didn't have them last week.
1071920	1072920	Presents!
1072920	1073920	Yay!
1073920	1076200	Okay, so, first off...
1076200	1078640	I don't like it when he sighs before giving his gift.
1078640	1081960	No, no, no, it's not entirely bad.
1081960	1086280	I'm sorry, but one of you does get a gag gift.
1086280	1092480	So for Rob, I have Final Fantasy XII Remnant Wings, because you've actually played through
1092480	1093480	Final Fantasy XII.
1093480	1096680	I haven't played through the whole game, but enough of it, I know what's going on.
1096680	1097680	Sweet.
1097680	1100800	And Jamie, I apologize ahead of time.
1100800	1101800	Don't kill me.
1101800	1103280	No, I'm going to love this.
1103280	1104280	What did Jamie get?
1104280	1111280	But you have a copy of Imagine Babies.
1111280	1113680	That's awesome.
1113680	1115120	The last one they have there.
1115120	1122200	Jamie got a copy of Imagine Babies, with a Z.
1122200	1125160	Take care of up to six babies.
1125160	1128240	Read the back for us, how did they advertise this game?
1128240	1133000	Buy the babies good food, furniture, cute baby outfits, and toys.
1133000	1135000	Customize your house through mini-games.
1135000	1140120	I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
1140120	1144800	It's like, I think everybody in iPod listening land, or however you're listening to this
1144800	1148640	on PSP, whatever, is hearing the dot, dot, dot through their speakers right now.
1148640	1149640	No, that's too good.
1149640	1152800	It actually looks kind of cute.
1152800	1153800	She's coming around.
1153800	1159440	No, as long as they're virtual babies, I don't mind.
1159440	1160440	There you go.
1160440	1163040	You should raise some babies, and then tell the hubby, here's your baby.
1163040	1165160	That would be great.
1165160	1166160	See, there you go.
1166160	1167160	Practical use for it.
1167160	1168160	Yay.
1168160	1171200	I think there's a part in the game where you can shake the baby, so I know.
1171200	1173040	All right.
1173040	1176120	They're actually kind of cute, though.
1176120	1180560	The chat room is irritated, there's no operator 11 tonight, because they wanted to see Jamie's
1180560	1181560	reaction.
1181560	1183040	Sorry guys, operator 11 is screwy.
1183040	1184960	I was staring at it blankly.
1184960	1187020	You could hear the dot, dot, dot through the microphone.
1187020	1188020	You could.
1188020	1189020	Thank you for the thoughtful gift.
1189020	1194960	I was hoping, well, I was kind of trying to get some stuff to play this week, like, was
1194960	1203000	it that, I don't even remember how it's, like, Pot to Pawn or something like that, that one
1203000	1205080	weird one that looks like Loco Roco.
1205080	1212720	And then I was hopefully going to have a copy of Nights to play for a special after show,
1212720	1216960	but seeing as operator 11 is down, that doesn't work.
1216960	1217960	Dope.
1217960	1221080	Mac Man says, hey honey, I'm pregnant with digital babies.
1221080	1222760	That's okay.
1222760	1224080	All right.
1224080	1232320	I could go into detail about, you know, the physical problems that come with being knocked
1232320	1233320	up.
1233320	1234320	Let's not.
1234320	1235320	But I'm not going to.
1235320	1237640	Considering the majority of listeners of our program are young men, I don't know if they
1237640	1240720	want to hear it.
1240720	1242960	Although maybe they should, I don't know.
1242960	1248280	Those that are involved should think twice before asking their significant other to carry
1248280	1254840	a 32 pound, 32 pounds of extra weight plus the hormone influx and having your stomach
1254840	1258160	shoved up behind your lungs.
1258160	1259320	You make it sound so sexy.
1259320	1261640	Does someone have a chainsaw outside?
1261640	1263480	That's the best thing ever.
1263480	1269160	Yeah, I know you guys can't hear this over the thing, but somebody is out there with
1269160	1270160	a.
1270160	1271160	Someone's out there with a chainsaw.
1271160	1275240	Either a chainsaw or like a weed whacker or something, probably trying to clean up debris
1275240	1276240	from the storm.
1276240	1277240	I think it's a chainsaw.
1277240	1282800	Like, you know, those yard work at night is maybe there were repair crews over on the
1282800	1283800	crossroad.
1283800	1285440	Oh, my gosh.
1285440	1286440	It's crazy around here.
1286440	1287440	All right.
1287440	1288440	My gaming week.
1288440	1289720	We're never going to get to the gaming news.
1289720	1292600	You know, what's funny is that a lot of people say I play too much.
1292600	1293600	Wow.
1293600	1294600	Well, guess what?
1294600	1297300	My Internet was down for 24 hours thanks to the storm.
1297300	1298300	So no.
1298300	1299300	Wow.
1299300	1300300	For me, QQ.
1300300	1301300	I was so sad.
1301300	1304560	So I did have to play other games and I spent some time playing Mario Galaxy, which I love
1304560	1306480	more and more every time I play it.
1306480	1307880	It's just amazing.
1307880	1312720	And I love its little bits of retro-ness they have in it in regards to some of the music
1312720	1313720	and things.
1313720	1314920	And I raved about it last week.
1314920	1315920	I don't need to say much more.
1315920	1318200	But I do love me some Mario Galaxy.
1318200	1320000	I also played some more of Rock Band.
1320000	1324060	I played till my arm literally hurt and felt like it was going to fall off.
1324060	1325120	So that was a lot of fun.
1325120	1328640	And then just played through a variety of various Xbox Live arcade games I needed to
1328640	1329640	catch up on.
1329640	1334680	And I made use of my HD DVD player this week because I bought Stardust on HD DVD a couple
1334680	1336520	weeks ago and I never got around to watching it.
1336520	1339120	So I put it in the HD player and was watching that.
1339120	1341520	And that's pretty much how I spent my time with the outage.
1341520	1343360	So there it was.
1343360	1348560	And GS68 says, thank you storms for keeping sky off the warcrack.
1348560	1352900	Frisbee says chainsaw guy from Resident Evil 4 is outside and is coming to get us.
1352900	1353900	I hope not.
1353900	1354900	That would suck.
1354900	1355900	That's a really gruesome ending.
1355900	1358260	I don't know if you've ever had your head chopped off by a chainsaw guy.
1358260	1359600	That sucks.
1359600	1360600	It totally sucks.
1360600	1363600	You know it happens to me all the time.
1363600	1370360	And RusteelUT, who just seems to be a critic in general, he's critical of Loki's stance
1370360	1375240	on things, he's critical of my WoW playing, he says, oh god, no WoW for one whole day.
1375240	1377520	How could sky exist without his second job?
1377520	1379560	But I can do no wrong.
1379560	1380560	Actually you ass.
1380560	1381560	Wow.
1381560	1383280	I love taunting the listeners.
1383280	1384600	No, I respect the opinion.
1384600	1387440	But WoW is my third job.
1387440	1389120	OLR is my second job.
1389120	1391160	And then my day job is my first job.
1391160	1392760	So WoW is my third job.
1392760	1397200	So if you're going to taunt me, get it right.
1397200	1402200	Jamie's chowing down on the whole wheat cookies William made for the New Year's party.
1402200	1403200	They're humpy.
1403200	1404200	They're good.
1404200	1405200	They're really good.
1405200	1406980	They help, they restore 10 HP when you eat them too.
1406980	1407980	So eat a lot.
1407980	1411100	They're also full of fiber.
1411100	1414680	Our work's trying to get a dev kit for 360.
1414680	1415680	What for?
1415680	1416680	I don't know.
1416680	1417680	Just to have?
1417680	1418680	X to go.
1418680	1419680	I hope.
1419680	1420680	Dev kit.
1420680	1426200	Also, I want to point out, I know OP11's down tonight, but we have some new decorations
1426200	1428360	in the studio I guess you'll see next week.
1428360	1434960	I was in this strip mall that had a lot of little stores in it that had imported things.
1434960	1438720	I got a big Kingdom Hearts wall scroll that's now up on the wall that's pretty awesome.
1438720	1440280	I got to say, that's a really great artwork.
1440280	1442760	I don't know where that artwork comes from, but it's great.
1442760	1446880	And a Final Fantasy XIII poster, if you can believe it, which is totally a bootleg I think.
1446880	1450680	I think somebody just took Sony's official release picture and made a poster out of it,
1450680	1452200	but it looks great nonetheless.
1452200	1455720	So some new decorations to look forward to when the cam comes back.
1455720	1458800	Meanwhile, we'll get into some housekeeping tonight.
1458800	1461080	Just some things I wanted to say really quickly.
1461080	1466140	Orange Launch Radio's rotation of music is going to be changing this week, which is going
1466140	1470280	to cause some downtime either Monday or Tuesday during the day, but not a lot of people are
1470280	1473880	listening during the day anyway, so I imagine people probably aren't even going to notice,
1473880	1476960	but I just wanted to get that out there, that the station will be down for a little bit
1476960	1480840	on Monday or Tuesday while the new songs go into rotation.
1480840	1483280	And that's really it.
1483280	1485960	Otherwise, welcome to our first show of 2008.
1485960	1486960	Hurray.
1486960	1493560	And you hate to interrupt, but literally right now Bill Gates is doing his CES keynote, so...
1493560	1496040	Well, let's get into some news.
1496040	1498000	Has he revealed anything yet, or...?
1498000	1501560	No, it says, okay ladies and gentlemen, the keynote will begin in five minutes.
1501560	1502760	Please take your seats.
1502760	1507120	So we'll take a peek during the break and see if there's anything to report on in part
1507120	1511920	B. But meanwhile, I believe there's some rumors about what might be being talked about tonight,
1511920	1512920	yes?
1512920	1513920	Yes.
1513920	1517880	One of the rumors is that there's going to be yet another Xbox 360 SKU coming out.
1517880	1523220	However, from what I remember, the SKU is actually supposed to be from another company,
1523220	1525600	like Toshiba or something like that.
1525600	1531280	But anyways, it's being dubbed the Xbox 360 Ultimate, and it's actually funny because
1531280	1537560	this was reported in Stuff Magazine, because they're known for tech news, I guess.
1537560	1543440	It'll be hitting stores, apparently, by this autumn, and will feature, of course, 1080p
1543440	1551200	HDMI output, built-in Wi-Fi, high-def audio output, cooler 65nm hardware architecture,
1551200	1553080	and a near-silent fan.
1553080	1560520	On top of that, it's going to have an IPTV service, and a 320GB hard drive, and a built-in
1560520	1562440	HD DVD drive.
1562440	1564040	And it's all bullshit.
1564040	1567800	I wouldn't be surprised.
1567800	1570600	Part of me sounds like it's a bit much, I think.
1570600	1571600	The system would be too expensive.
1571600	1577320	But, at the same time, why would Stuff Magazine run something like that, then, if they didn't
1577320	1578880	know that it was coming out?
1578880	1585140	I don't know, it sounds stupid to me, but if it's not being dubbed the Xbox something
1585140	1592400	or other, if it's just, you know, Toshiba's HD DVD player that also plays Xbox 360 games,
1592400	1593400	that kind of thing.
1593400	1596300	Oddly enough, that makes a little more sense to me.
1596300	1602300	And I always thought devices like the Panasonic Q were pretty awesome, and I never understood
1602300	1603400	why they didn't come out here.
1603400	1604840	Like, remember the Panasonic Q?
1604840	1608320	There was a DVD player that came out in Japan that played GameCube games, as well.
1608320	1611680	Well, there was a time, I don't know if they ever came out with them, but they were talking
1611680	1616480	about TVs that were integrated with the original Xbox hardware, so that they could actually,
1616480	1621560	you know, it would be like a built-in DVD player into your TV, but it also plays Xbox,
1621560	1622560	you know, Xbox games.
1622560	1627840	Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's a lot of TVs that have DVD technology built
1627840	1628840	into them.
1628840	1629840	Exactly, something like that.
1629840	1631160	You just put the DVD right in the TV and it plays.
1631160	1632160	Why not?
1632160	1633160	That seems like a logical next step.
1633160	1637200	I'm kind of surprised no gaming company has really done that.
1637200	1638920	I mean, it would seem logical to me.
1638920	1639920	I don't know.
1639920	1640920	I don't know.
1640920	1642280	Well, we'll see.
1642280	1647960	Perhaps that could be something that is revealed tonight during Bill Gates' last CES speech,
1647960	1651720	if I'm not mistaken, right, because he's stepping down or whatever.
1651720	1655240	I shouldn't say stepping down, but stepping aside for a little while, so he won't be doing
1655240	1656240	the keynotes anymore.
1656240	1659400	It's like, yes, I'm too rich to be doing this shit.
1659400	1664000	Well, anyhow, Sony has revealed some of their plans, and one of the big announcements that's
1664000	1668200	going to impact gamers is in regards to the slim PSP.
1668200	1671760	We're going to be getting Skype in late January.
1671760	1676400	Of course, Skype is a program that listeners of our show, I hope, would know very well.
1676400	1680640	After all, we were one of the first Internet programs anywhere years ago to actually have
1680640	1687900	a Skype line, and users have been calling us since like 2003 or 2004 on our Skype line.
1687900	1692360	At Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype, and now folks are going to be able
1692360	1695920	to call from their PSP when this new firmware is released at the end of January, but the
1695920	1702080	only catch is it's only available on the PSP Slims so far.
1702080	1706460	But now, Loki, you say that through your controversial hack-and-crack method, you think that this
1706460	1708080	could work on the PSP fatties.
1708080	1711560	I think so.
1711560	1718480	Right now, they have a lot of the firmware stuff that's locked in for the slim PSP, but
1718480	1724100	some of the custom firmwares have enabled you to do other things, obviously, that might
1724100	1727520	be locked out, except for, of course, video out, obviously, you can't do that on a normal
1727520	1733680	PSP, but I wouldn't be surprised if you see something that will allow this to happen.
1733680	1738240	I can't install this anyways on mine until custom one comes out anyways.
1738240	1742740	That's pretty cool, and I've got to say Skype out and Skype in will be a part of this as
1742740	1746460	well, and of course Skype out and Skype in are the things that let you use Skype as a
1746460	1747560	normal telephone.
1747560	1749120	We use Skype in here on the show.
1749120	1753900	That's how you can call 1-888 at your game OLR, and we use an 800 number forwarder that
1753900	1756480	forwards to our Skype line.
1756480	1758340	Very technical, but it works.
1758340	1759720	It does cost extra, though.
1759720	1760720	Yes, it does.
1760720	1765480	That's not something that's free, but I know somebody that uses Skype as their home phone
1765480	1768620	and they love it.
1768620	1773800	This is just another kind of cool thing for the PSP that's kind of breathing more life
1773800	1774800	into it.
1774800	1779840	I think a lot of people kind of wrote off the PSP when the games weren't so strong,
1779840	1785880	but I think this kind of cements PSP as the handheld device.
1785880	1788000	Notice how I don't call it a handheld gaming system.
1788000	1793960	The DS is supreme, I think, in that category, but the PSP is one hell of a portable device.
1793960	1801920	Now that it does pictures, movies, internet radio, now it does Skype, web surfing.
1801920	1804440	This is like a computer in your pocket now.
1804440	1808040	That's pretty awesome, the PSP that it's turning into.
1808040	1810880	And it has Castlevania, which is odd, but does your iPhone have Castlevania?
1810880	1812880	No, but my DS does.
1812880	1813880	Oh, snap.
1813880	1817160	All right, well that's all I have to say.
1817160	1823040	I'd still prefer that if it was going to be initially a handheld gaming system, it remain
1823040	1824040	a gaming system.
1824040	1826600	They don't need all that extra crap.
1826600	1827600	But I will say this.
1827600	1830680	I mean, I think to some extent, I think that's what the N-Gage was trying to do, too, and
1830680	1833360	remember how much shit the N-Gage got?
1833360	1838080	Because I think at least PSP is still kind of like, I don't know.
1838080	1841660	The way the PSP has done it, they still have kind of focused on games first and everything
1841660	1842660	else is secondary.
1842660	1843660	But I don't know.
1843660	1845240	They've just done it so much better than Nokia did.
1845240	1846880	The N-Gage was a piece of shit.
1846880	1848080	It really was.
1848080	1849080	I don't know.
1849080	1850080	I can't explain that one.
1850080	1860120	I think that the N-Gage could have been better had they gone for, first of all, cartridge
1860120	1865160	bases of those stupid little chip things, something that could actually store enough
1865160	1869520	media to make it look worth playing because I tried playing stuff on that and it was just
1869520	1870520	awful.
1870520	1878680	You know, at least the PSP doesn't, you know, it put a lot of focus into the gaming aspect.
1878680	1885320	It was initially meant to be a gaming system and it has the right kind of media to support
1885320	1887720	the types of games they want to do.
1887720	1888720	Basically it's like this.
1888720	1892300	When I played Castlevania on the PSP, you know, Rondo of Blood, I went, cool!
1892300	1893360	This is cool!
1893360	1897000	When I played Civilization on the N-Gage, a part of me died inside.
1897000	1898000	It was that bad.
1898000	1903560	I mean, it was like one of my favorite games of all time has been raped by a taco.
1903560	1904560	I mean, literally.
1904560	1905560	How about something better?
1905560	1908480	Let me say one thing real quick before we get back into the news because Tiger Claw
1908480	1909920	is mentioning something.
1909920	1915580	I just realized, OLR is competing against American Gladiators tonight because tonight
1915580	1920320	is the return of American Gladiators on NBC.
1920320	1928720	This is all I have to say, TiVo, VCR, DVR, whatever, that's why you got it.
1928720	1933600	Does anyone actually remember the old American Gladiators?
1933600	1934760	Fuck yeah, I do.
1934760	1938560	If you remember that, you remember how often they replayed that show.
1938560	1945200	So that shit was replayed more than Cops, okay, and you know how much Cops is on TV.
1945200	1949040	So just fucking wait, it'll rerun that shit to death.
1949040	1950040	Exactly.
1950040	1953040	Or if you're going to run away and go watch American Gladiators, at least download our
1953040	1955280	podcast and listen to it later, I guess.
1955280	1957000	I guess we can let that slide by.
1957000	1959680	All right, sorry, back to the news.
1959680	1960680	Can I talk?
1960680	1961680	You may.
1961680	1964440	Thank you, sir.
1964440	1971020	For anyone who remembers Target Terror, it's coming out on the Wii as a Zapper game, and
1971020	1977760	it looks awful, but it looks great at the same time, because it was one of those full
1977760	1980680	motion capture type of games.
1980680	1987460	I love Revolution X, so I'm actually sort of thinking about getting this just for the
1987460	1989560	cheese ball factor.
1989560	1997040	I love cheese ball games, so I think that's going to be kind of fun, but you have machine
1997040	2003040	guns and grenade launchers and orbital space lasers and minigames and all kinds of fun
2003040	2005040	stuff.
2005040	2006040	Looks like fun.
2006040	2007040	Yeah.
2007040	2008040	Is it true...
2008040	2010240	Loki, weren't you saying something before the show, though, that they're going to charge
2010240	2013640	like the full retail price for this, 40 bucks or something?
2013640	2014840	Yeah, it's 40 bucks.
2014840	2015840	That's crap tacky.
2015840	2017000	I don't know about that.
2017000	2018400	It's not worth 40 bucks.
2018400	2020740	I'm sure it'll be in the bargain bin before too long.
2020740	2021740	Just give it time, man.
2021740	2026080	If it sucks, they'll drop the price quick.
2026080	2028560	We shall see.
2028560	2034280	Another fun news, if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine, or even if
2034280	2040160	you don't, next month, the February issue, we'll have three exclusive rock band songs
2040160	2041160	for download.
2041160	2045640	Another thing that you should know about the official Xbox magazine discs, say for example
2045640	2050460	you download that content on one friend's account, you can also take it to your friend
2050460	2053320	and your other friend and so on and so forth.
2053320	2059880	Since there's no real way to lock a DVD to a certain 360.
2059880	2061760	So just share.
2061760	2066480	Anyways, three songs are going to be with that.
2066480	2069480	One of which is from Freezeprop.
2069480	2071000	That would be Sprode.
2071000	2074240	Not Super Sprode, but Sprode.
2074240	2077480	Bang Camaro's Rock Rebellion and Count Zero's Shake.
2077480	2080480	Wait, so we don't think the Sprode thing is a typo?
2080480	2083280	Because they don't have a song called just Sprode unless it's something new.
2083280	2086560	It might be something new or maybe a rock version of Super Sprode.
2086560	2089480	Oh, that would make sense.
2089480	2091040	Maybe like a cover of their own song or something.
2091040	2095000	If I remember, Super Sprode wasn't too rocky.
2095000	2099480	Well Super Sprode is fucking rad so I hope it is that song in some type of reincarnation
2099480	2100480	because I love that song.
2100480	2102600	That was a great song in amplitude.
2102600	2104880	But yeah, definitely check it out.
2104880	2108180	I stopped subscribing to this magazine, but I'll have to pick one up.
2108180	2110480	So you're going to buy one so I don't have to?
2110480	2111480	Yeah.
2111480	2112480	Sweet!
2112480	2115480	So this is that whole DVD sharing thing he just said and I was just making sure about
2115480	2116480	that.
2116480	2120960	Alright, well speaking of Rock Band, EA has not ruled out that Rock Band will be coming
2120960	2122520	out on the Wii.
2122520	2125960	You might notice that the Wii is that one system that's sorely missing Rock Band right
2125960	2126960	now.
2126960	2130320	It does have Guitar Hero 3, but no Rock Band.
2130320	2135320	Harmonix themselves has said that the Wii has, quote, an enormous potential for music
2135320	2136560	games.
2136560	2143800	GamePro actually went out and got a quote from EA talking about that there's going to
2143800	2147360	be Rock Band on the Wii eventually.
2147360	2150040	I'm sorry, scratch that.
2150040	2155160	They did not make an official comment on Rock Band on the Wii, but most of us can kind of
2155160	2159840	figure it's got to be coming eventually, especially when you consider the fact that EA likes to
2159840	2161520	port things to all hell.
2161520	2162520	Really?
2162520	2163520	Yeah.
2163520	2164760	You got the truth.
2164760	2169880	I think their only limitation right now is just putting the instruments on the Wii and
2169880	2173460	figuring out something maybe fun to do with them, although I think they're just going
2173460	2179080	to do what they did with like, or not them in particular, but Activision did with Guitar
2179080	2185200	Hero 3 and just, you know, have it hijack the Wi-Fi from, you know, the remote, but
2185200	2187760	I don't know.
2187760	2188760	That's not a bad idea.
2188760	2191280	So in other words, they're not saying no, they're just saying not now.
2191280	2194800	Although they can also do all wired controllers because they have USB ports on there.
2194800	2195800	No, why not?
2195800	2196800	I don't know.
2196800	2200720	Well, we'll see what happens, but in the meantime, the Wii fans are Rock Band-less.
2200720	2201720	Sorry.
2201720	2210840	Well, a Guitar Hero fan, though, actually put together a Kill Bill guitar, I think it's
2210840	2211840	pretty cool.
2211840	2215640	I'll put a link to the picture up in the chat room.
2215640	2223360	But it was basically inspired by, I guess, the, an Evil Dead guitar that someone did
2223360	2224360	too.
2224360	2225360	So that's pretty cool.
2225360	2231920	And it's really not all that hard because all you need to, like for example, a dance
2231920	2239640	friend, Will, got a Sex Pistols one for a penny, so you can find the faceplates or you
2239640	2244400	can make them yourself because they're not that, you know, difficult and just if you've
2244400	2246960	got any artistic ability, customize it yourself.
2246960	2254120	But I'll put a picture of the image in the chat, of the link in chat.
2254120	2256360	That does seem pretty cool, that little Kill Bill guitar.
2256360	2258240	I don't know, I kind of want one of those.
2258240	2261800	I do want to back up for just a minute because there's some comments in our chat room at
2261800	2265240	chat.orangelandrater.com in regards to the Rock Band on the Wii.
2265240	2270000	And I think RawsteelUT stops being critical for a moment to bring up a good point.
2270000	2273880	There's the fact that the Rock Band download content is impossible on the Wii.
2273880	2276040	And that's one of the biggest money makers for Rock Band.
2276040	2277040	So far, yeah.
2277040	2280760	Yeah, so that is a good point, is that the Wii doesn't really support anything like
2280760	2281760	that so far.
2281760	2285000	Although, aren't they supposed to be getting Guitar Hero 3 content next year?
2285000	2291600	Yeah, once, whenever they figure out, you know, how to actually do it.
2291600	2293680	Well, now's the time to figure that out.
2293680	2295800	That's big money they're missing out on right there.
2295800	2298120	Yeah, I'll say.
2298120	2303200	Anyways, some other stuff you can look forward to at least this week, coming out in the United
2303200	2304200	States.
2304200	2309280	A few releases, actually there's some decent stuff coming out, including, let's see, starting
2309280	2314920	things off, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom, that'll be coming out in the 360.
2314920	2319880	Although it looks like this time they kind of went more of the Dynasty Warriors route.
2319880	2324960	Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is coming to the Wii and Playstation 2.
2324960	2329080	So if you're into that hoverboard racing stuff, you can play that.
2329080	2338040	NFL Tour on the Playstation 3 and 360, a good $40 football game, kind of arcade style.
2338040	2343760	Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law on Playstation 2 Wii and the PSP, if you happen to be a fan
2343760	2348000	of the show and like the Phoenix Wright games, you'll definitely like that one.
2348000	2353440	Jackass the Game on DS, if it's anything like the PSP version, you'll definitely like that
2353440	2354720	one.
2354720	2360340	World Championship Paintball for Playstation 2, that is crap.
2360340	2364520	Sea Monster is a prehistoric adventure on the DS, also crap.
2364520	2368880	And then one of the weirdest things to come out in a while, and doesn't look very good
2368880	2379100	either, Dance Dance Revolution, Disney Channel Edition on Playstation 2, oh god.
2379100	2381240	And I believe that's it for this week.
2381240	2388120	You know you want to dance to high school musical songs, Loki.
2388120	2392760	Well coming out over in Japan, finally taking a break from not having any games come out
2392760	2396120	because of the holidays, to getting some stuff come out, or I should say if you're an Xbox
2396120	2398760	360 fan, price reductions.
2398760	2402760	But that's never a bad thing, some price reductions for Armored Core 4 and Table Tennis take place
2402760	2406320	this week, as well as the release of the Xbox 360 Messenger kit.
2406320	2410340	We got that here a little while ago with the integrated MSM Messenger.
2410340	2414120	Not that it's been doing folks a lot of good this week with Xbox Live going up and down,
2414120	2418120	however assuming that those problems are being fixed very soon, the Messenger kit will be
2418120	2421980	doing Japanese MSM fans a lot of good.
2421980	2429880	Also getting a price reduction on the Playstation 3, Armored Core 4's port on Playstation 3.
2429880	2434780	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, a new game from Marvelous Entertainment called Kaitikyoshi
2434780	2445280	Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle Wii, which looks to be some type of anime based game
2445280	2449100	that I think is some type of fighter, it looks kind of like a 3D fighter, I'm sure it's based
2449100	2455360	on, is there an anime called Hitman, that's probably what it is, I'm not sure, whatever
2455360	2457340	it is, there you have it.
2457340	2462680	Also coming out on some other systems, the Nintendo DS is getting a game called Chishiki-O
2462680	2470300	Series Train Master, which is another train sim game, apparently those train sim games
2470300	2474420	are very popular overseas, I haven't seen a train sim game very popular over here since
2474420	2478160	Railroad Tycoon or A-Train, but I guess they're still popular over there.
2478160	2480760	Well there was the big Densha de Go!
2480760	2483000	series that was out for a long time too.
2483000	2484840	I wonder why they're not as popular here.
2484840	2488120	There's a train simulator that even had a big controller for it too.
2488120	2491400	My dad used to buy those games all the time back when we had a Commodore 64, he bought
2491400	2495440	like every train, because he was a conductor before he retired, that's what he did, so
2495440	2496440	he loved that stuff.
2496440	2498240	I just thought it was interesting.
2498240	2501240	Anyhow, that's really it for Japanese releases this week.
2501240	2504280	Alright, what about UK releases?
2504280	2507960	Well, Loki, wait your turn.
2507960	2510240	There's really not a whole lot to talk about.
2510240	2516920	The ninth has Omega 5 on Xbox Live Arcade, Sam & Max 202, Moai Better Blues, that's a
2516920	2522600	cool name, and then that's coming out on the tenth, and the eleventh is PDC World Darts
2522600	2529600	Championship 2008, exciting, but not really.
2529600	2530600	Now you can go.
2530600	2533880	Sam & Max is going to be awesome in Season 2.
2533880	2541320	Anyways, as you mentioned, Omega 5 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week, Hudson's kind
2541320	2546800	of side-scroller shooter game, looks a little bit like R-Type or something like that.
2546800	2553720	Definitely going to be awesome, that's only going to cost you 800 Microsoft points, and
2553720	2557040	no word if there's going to be anything else coming out this week as well, I know last
2557040	2562320	week there was only one item, just Metal Gear, or Metal Slug 3, so I guess maybe this is
2562320	2563880	the only release this week as well.
2563880	2576560	Microsoft, I want rez, really badly, I want rez, rez, I want rez, no rez for you, now
2576560	2577560	!!
2577560	2582280	Alright, so maybe I won't get rez, but there will be some other games on the Virtual Console
2582280	2587720	in the United States of America, Monday's games have been leaked, it appears, the day
2587720	2593580	before, and a real good one coming for the Nintendo this week, Star Tropics is coming
2593580	2598080	to Virtual Console, that was a pretty rad game, that was one of the last really big
2598080	2604520	RPGs, no word yet though if buying it on the Virtual Console will give you that letter
2604520	2608240	that you have to dip in the water in order to get the secret code, otherwise the thought
2608240	2610980	just occurred to me, a lot of people are going to be screwed when they try to play that game
2610980	2611980	on Virtual Console.
2611980	2617480	I think that there will be some sort of compensation made for it, like maybe they'll have to go
2617480	2622000	on Nintendo's site and do some sort of bizarro thing.
2622000	2624720	Or it will be in the digital manual that comes with the game.
2624720	2628160	Oh, there you go, maybe the digital manual in the game will have it.
2628160	2632080	No, there is a scene in this game where you'll need this code, but there's going to be tons
2632080	2633880	of people that don't even think to look there, I bet.
2633880	2634880	I know.
2634880	2635880	That's going to be interesting.
2635880	2636880	I didn't figure it out.
2636880	2637880	They're going to be on Game Facts.
2637880	2640960	I bought the game used and I was like, I don't know what the fucking code is, I don't have
2640960	2645080	the, we have to dip the manual in the water to reveal the code, I'm like, I don't have
2645080	2646080	the manual.
2646080	2648480	Isn't the code 747 and why do I remember that?
2648480	2652680	It's 747, because I remember it because it was like a plane, yeah.
2652680	2655320	Oh my god, you know you've played too many games when?
2655320	2656320	No.
2656320	2659160	I don't need no stinkin' letter.
2659160	2663080	There's a ton of games though that have those little weird quirks built in, like the, what
2663080	2670040	was it, the X-Men game where you had to press reset to reset the machine or something?
2670040	2671040	That's right.
2671040	2673080	On Genesis.
2673080	2674080	So weird.
2674080	2675080	I know.
2675080	2678800	Nothing will ever be as cool though as in regards to like quirky fucking things in games
2678800	2684480	as Metal Gear Solid was a psycho mantis who read your memory card and would go, oh I see
2684480	2685920	you're a Castlevania fan.
2685920	2692200	And it had, it had Xenogears on there, which hadn't, which wasn't released at the time.
2692200	2693280	Creepy creepy.
2693280	2706080	And then, it also, though in Final Fantasy VII, had a reference to Xenogears on it too.
2706080	2711360	Well, also coming out on the Virtual Console this week for the Neo Geo, King of Fighters
2711360	2712360	94.
2712360	2715780	Now, I don't follow the King of Fighters, they're all the same to me, it's one big giant
2715780	2716780	fucking blur.
2716780	2717780	King of Fighters 94.
2717780	2718840	Is 94 a good one?
2718840	2722640	I have that on the Neo Geo CD.
2722640	2723640	It's a good one.
2723640	2729440	KOF 94 was, if I do remember, the first one that was out in the series.
2729440	2735660	And I played tons and tons and tons of that game because they had it at the arcade at
2735660	2743240	my college where I learned the joy of playing with Yuri's butt attack.
2743240	2744240	Interesting.
2744240	2746840	I might have to check it out.
2746840	2749480	You know, I have no Neo Geo games on Virtual Console yet.
2749480	2750480	Do you?
2750480	2751480	Oh, that's sad.
2751480	2753000	My thing is almost filled up.
2753000	2754000	That's the sad part.
2754000	2757120	My screen is almost, like, you know how you can only go to, like, four screens on the
2757120	2758120	Wii?
2758120	2760920	I seriously only have room for a handful of games left because I have so many of those
2760920	2764400	stupid Virtual Console games I keep paying money for.
2764400	2765400	You know what, Rob?
2765400	2770240	Oh, that was another thing, but I'll bring the game up later because it's related to
2770240	2775520	another part of the show, but we broke out Virtual Console stuff at my house too.
2775520	2776520	Oh, nice.
2776520	2783680	But I was going to tell you, one of these days, though, that I can, when we start doing
2783680	2791120	the whatever video cast again, I'll try to bring one of my old systems up for something
2791120	2794680	classic, if you want, and I'll bring the Neo Geo CD.
2794680	2796600	Well, I'll tell you what we're thinking.
2796600	2800800	I'll think aloud here because Operator 11, unfortunately, it seems like it's running
2800800	2802040	on autopilot right now.
2802040	2806100	I don't know what the heck's going on with them, but none of the shows are saving or
2806100	2807960	whatever, which is part of the reason we're not using them.
2807960	2812000	So we're thinking about defecting to another service called Ustream TV, which has no limits
2812000	2813000	on their shows.
2813000	2816840	I just have to make sure it's kosher for us to broadcast video game images, but I don't
2816840	2818080	know why it wouldn't be.
2818080	2821480	But sometimes there's copyright issues that come into play with that, but usually as long
2821480	2828560	as we're, if we're doing any type of commentary with it or whatever, you know, it's fair use,
2828560	2830720	but I don't know, we'll see.
2830720	2835320	Anyhow, back to the Virtual Console story, Star Tropics King Fighters 94, no third game
2835320	2839440	mentioned yet, I guess we'll find out tomorrow, but remember, not every week have they always
2839440	2842840	done three games, so it is possible, it's just a two game week.
2842840	2843840	So we shall see.
2843840	2847240	Well, it looks like they're having something similar to that in the UK.
2847240	2855620	The big release right now is Harvest Moon, coming out on Virtual Console, and I do recall
2855620	2860280	seeing, although I can't find the link on here now, but I did also recall seeing Donkey
2860280	2862600	Kong Country 3.
2862600	2868080	But apparently the link to it is gone from where I read it.
2868080	2870560	Might have been two different weeks or something.
2870560	2877600	Possibly, but Harvest Moon's been the big thing, so you can play that over in the UK.
2877600	2879080	Milk all the cows you want.
2879080	2884040	Yep, carry some chickens and make, you know, friends with your neighbors.
2884040	2885040	There you have it.
2885040	2888040	Speaking of milking things, you know what's kind of crazy?
2888040	2892940	I saw that they're doing a third Lost in Blue game.
2892940	2894200	When did the second one ever come out?
2894200	2896400	Like, I remember they were making one.
2896400	2899160	I think I actually played it for a few seconds at the show.
2899160	2902680	Oh, shit, I don't remember when it came out, I think it was like October-ish.
2902680	2904640	Is that game like really a cult hit or something?
2904640	2906680	I guess, I don't know, I thought the first one sucked.
2906680	2908440	I did not like the first game either.
2908440	2909440	I don't know.
2909440	2910440	Strange.
2910440	2911440	Whatever.
2911440	2916320	Anyways, so apparently Microsoft is a little bit sorry for the fact that Xbox Live has
2916320	2922680	been having issues this last few weeks here, and to apologize for that, they're going
2922680	2929140	to be offering all Xbox Live members around the world one free Xbox Live arcade game.
2929140	2933960	No word on which game it is, or if we're going to get a choice or what.
2933960	2936800	Hopefully it's not something I already own.
2936800	2940600	I've heard rumblings, and you can take this as like a friend of a friend thing, which
2940600	2945740	holds little to no weight, but from what I hear, it's a game that nobody has yet.
2945740	2950960	One of the future releases is going to be free in light of this, and it's not something
2950960	2954000	like Yaris.
2954000	2957920	My mind instantly went to, great, we're going to get the Doritos game for free.
2957920	2961240	No, it's something people actually want, apparently.
2961240	2966180	Yeah, because I'd be sad when Carcassonne was free for everybody, most people were happy
2966180	2968100	about that because hardly anyone bought it.
2968100	2973880	I bought it previously, so I didn't get anything out of that deal, so I hope it's something
2973880	2980080	new like, you know, Rez, coming out next week, for free, would be nice, would be very nice.
2980080	2982320	I don't think anybody would complain if Rez was the game.
2982320	2987900	But yeah, if it's going to be like, like Ross Deal says, it's probably going to be Robotron,
2987900	2991560	or Frogger or something, I think everybody will just be like, wah, and then of course,
2991560	2999880	half the chat room is going, Yaris 2, Yaris 2, anyhow, I really don't know, but I do want
2999880	3002500	to say this, I want to take the opportunity to say this, I don't know if you saw it on
3002500	3009080	our forums, but somebody actually made a YouTube of Yaris set to the music of Dragon Force,
3009080	3013800	as inspired by our show, so I think that might come up in the mailbag later, so I won't blow
3013800	3018000	all the details on that just yet, on how you can access that, but I saw that on our forums,
3018000	3020440	it was kind of cool.
3020440	3026320	Meanwhile, I will mention this about the Xbox Live outages, some people are pissed about
3026320	3032360	this, they're so pissed, they're filing a lawsuit, that's right, when there's a problem
3032360	3035840	that a major company is having, leave it to the parasites to jump on and file a class
3035840	3042040	action lawsuit, three folks out of Texas have filed a class action lawsuit against the company,
3042040	3048340	what they call breach of contract, the lawsuit goes on to whine about, quote, many plaintiffs
3048340	3055640	being kicked offline, blah, blah, blah, and to some extent, I understand these guys where
3055640	3061760	they're pissed off, because Xbox costs $50 a year, so when you're paying for it, especially
3061760	3065960	during the time of year when most people are going to use it, it ought to be working.
3065960	3070960	However, Microsoft, to give them credit, I think has always been a company very good
3070960	3075800	about apologizing when they fuck up, you know what I mean, hence they're going to give out
3075800	3080380	the free game, they've been very forthright in saying, we made a mistake, we're not happy
3080380	3085160	about it, you can tell if you read Major Nelson's blog or his Twitter, he is livid about what's
3085160	3089980	going on, and he's working overtime to try and fix it, it's not like they're sitting
3089980	3093720	on their big duff, not trying to do anything about it, so I kind of give them a little
3093720	3095520	bit of credit, and I forgive them.
3095520	3098040	They don't guarantee that they're always going to be up either.
3098040	3099040	Exactly.
3099040	3103640	Should I sue them because they run maintenance on their server sometimes, and it's not, you
3103640	3107940	know, during a time I want to play, I mean it's not really fair, it's just these drunken
3107940	3111600	people are just trying to get money from whatever, they're all Microsoft, they've got money to
3111600	3114240	spend, let's see if we can get some of it.
3114240	3118680	Well, you know the thing about a class action lawsuit is that it's supposed to represent
3118680	3120280	all users, right?
3120280	3124760	So allow me to say, you do not represent me, I do not wish to participate in this lawsuit.
3124760	3128720	I don't give a shit if they didn't give me anything to compensate me for their live service
3128720	3131220	being down, big deal, it's down for a couple of weeks.
3131220	3134720	You know what, if they really wanted to, they can give me like two weeks free or something
3134720	3136600	like that, it's a big deal.
3136600	3138040	I'd have been fine with that.
3138040	3139960	Just defer, you know, that's...
3139960	3144480	That's what the cable company does when your service is out, you call, complain, they give
3144480	3147280	you a credit for the time your service was out.
3147280	3149520	And a lot of things do that.
3149520	3152120	I'm trying to think of what else, there's something that very commonly gives like the
3152120	3153120	free...
3153120	3156480	I think Warcraft's done that before, they give free days or free week if something goes
3156480	3157480	on.
3157480	3158480	I know other games have done this too.
3158480	3161840	I'm sure Xbox Live would not be opposed to doing something like that.
3161840	3165120	I mean, seriously, are they actually going to try to sue them for what?
3165120	3168800	Like let's just say if they cut out a whole month, that's like $5.
3168800	3173960	Oh my God, you're out $5, poor baby.
3173960	3178160	I'm sure in that user license agreement thingy that you have to...
3178160	3181180	You know how like every time you sign up for something, you have to read the user license
3181180	3183680	agreement and most people just click okay.
3183680	3188300	I could not believe that somewhere in there is not some type of clause that says, we do
3188300	3192840	not guarantee it's going to be up 100% of the time, the service may be down intermittently,
3192840	3193840	you can't hold us...
3193840	3194840	You know, there's got to...
3194840	3197640	The lawyers had to have thought something like this might happen, you know, and put
3197640	3198640	that in there in advance.
3198640	3199640	It's stupid.
3199640	3200640	It's $5.
3200640	3204600	It's not like you're paying, you know, $50 a month or something like that.
3204600	3208600	It's $5, seriously.
3208600	3214040	It's going to cost more in like lawyer fees than you would be getting from, you know,
3214040	3216040	this $5.
3216040	3220120	Frisbee says in chat, terms of service covers it all.
3220120	3222640	There it is.
3222640	3226760	So yeah, so we'll see what happens with this class action lawsuit.
3226760	3232920	We'll keep you guys posted, that is, if anything actually comes of this, but we shall see.
3232920	3233920	So...
3233920	3241640	Well, for anyone who remembers the Tickle Me Elmo craze or how Beanie Babies went, we
3241640	3246580	are having a repeat with a plushie weighted companion cube.
3246580	3251800	This makes me laugh, especially since they've said on Valve's site that they were going
3251800	3254360	to be making more of them.
3254360	3257280	So stupid.
3257280	3263760	Someone paid $365 for a plushie weighted companion cube and opened on eBay.
3263760	3266400	And to that I say, fucking stupid!
3266400	3267480	You want to hear something fucking stupid?
3267480	3273180	What about that retard that paid $9,000 for that Xbox 360 that, or not Xbox 360, Guitar
3273180	3278040	Hero 3 that some father was giving away because his son smoked pot.
3278040	3281480	You're an idiot if you buy Guitar Hero for $9,000.
3281480	3286320	You know how much weed that whole family is going to be able to buy for $9,000, sucka?
3286320	3290480	Do you really, I mean, you do realize that the guy could have been making it all up,
3290480	3294880	and do you realize you paid $9,000 for something that's really easy to find?
3294880	3295880	You idiot!
3295880	3300800	I have a $5 bill, guess what, I took it away from my unborn son because he smoked pot in
3300800	3301960	the future.
3301960	3307120	I want $9,000.
3307120	3308320	And on top of that...
3308320	3309720	You know what's sad?
3309720	3314680	If we signed some piece of OLR memorabilia, like if we took a ferret and signed it or
3314680	3319200	something and tried to put it on eBay, we'd be lucky to get $1.99 for it.
3319200	3321600	I think that we should do something gimmicky like that.
3321600	3322960	You want to do something gimmicky?
3322960	3323960	Let's do something gimmicky.
3323960	3329040	I'll tell you what, I'm going to sign my weighted companion cube and we'll put that up on eBay.
3329040	3330040	A paper one.
3330040	3331040	Yes, we'll make a weighted...
3331040	3333240	There's a paper weighted companion cube online.
3333240	3334240	Fair enough.
3334240	3337480	We will make a weighted companion cube out of paper and sign it and make up some story
3337480	3341960	about how we stole it from a baby in the crib or something and see how much money we get
3341960	3342960	it from it.
3342960	3343960	Okay.
3343960	3347320	We traded a dingo, a baby, for the weighted companion cube.
3347320	3350840	The dingo ate my companion cube!
3350840	3352560	That'd be a hungry dingo.
3352560	3353560	You bastard.
3353560	3354560	Portal 2.
3354560	3355560	The dingo ate my companion cube.
3355560	3356560	That's so stupid, though.
3356560	3357560	Oh my god.
3357560	3358560	I see...
3358560	3364440	Now, I wanted one fairly bad and Dan was actually going to get me one for Christmas, but you
3364440	3367640	know, how long did it take them to sell out?
3367640	3368640	Four hours?
3368640	3370720	Drunami brings up an excellent point.
3370720	3374580	Don't we have an orange bat somewhere still from back in the day?
3374580	3376280	It's in the vault.
3376280	3377280	We might have to get that.
3377280	3381200	We might have to pull that out of the vault because we have a blank one, don't we?
3381200	3382200	No.
3382200	3383200	I thought we did.
3383200	3384200	We could do a new one.
3384200	3385200	We need to get a black...
3385200	3390160	I had to save the original orange bat, though, because it was the one that was signed at...
3390160	3391160	What tournament was that?
3391160	3392160	Now, here's what we're going to do.
3392160	3393160	March Madness.
3393160	3394160	Fine, we'll get a new one.
3394160	3397840	We're going to get an orange bat, sign it, beat something with it, and that'll be our
3397840	3399280	story and then we'll sell it.
3399280	3404760	And then if we put Portal in the search details on eBay, it'll sell.
3404760	3405760	Exactly.
3405760	3408400	We'll say we wrote...
3408400	3411320	We'll just write Portal on the bat.
3411320	3415240	And if it makes enough money, then we'll come visit you.
3415240	3419120	If it makes enough money.
3419120	3425320	We should have one with a reserve up there that's like, um, buy an Orange Lounge Radio
3425320	3426320	visit.
3426320	3429920	Where you have to pay for us to come out and feed us.
3429920	3431160	I don't know about that.
3431160	3433640	Again, we'd be lucky to get $1.99.
3433640	3436040	Anyway, let's move on.
3436040	3442160	Anyways, so Ubisoft has announced Far Cry 2 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3442160	3446960	Of course, the new Far Cry game not being in the tropics, it's actually going to be
3446960	3451560	in the African Savannah, Africa!
3451560	3456600	And you will be able to, you know, destroy stuff and it'll be awesome.
3456600	3458640	But um, I don't know.
3458640	3460000	I can't wait to play it.
3460000	3465040	So um, hopefully it'll come out around the same time as the PC version, which is due
3465040	3467480	out this spring.
3467480	3469760	But um, no word though if that's actually going to happen yet.
3469760	3474000	They just said it's going to ship sometime in Ubisoft's 08-09 fiscal year.
3474000	3477200	So that could be anytime between now and forever.
3477200	3481540	Our chat room, seriously, sorry, not to discount your story, but our chat room, fucking geniuses.
3481540	3482540	They're brilliant.
3482540	3483540	Okay, here it is.
3483540	3488080	They say we're going to sell this as the Orange Companion Bat, and we're going to beat Jamie's
3488080	3493400	copy of Imagine Babies with it, and now it's the beaten companion bat.
3493400	3494400	That's great.
3494400	3495400	Chat room winner.
3495400	3496400	It'll happen.
3496400	3497400	It'll happen.
3497400	3498400	Watch.
3498400	3504000	So, man, I love our chat room.
3504000	3509600	Well, speaking of people who are infinitely awesome, that would be Hideo Kojima.
3509600	3511960	Aha, how's that?
3511960	3512960	Nice transition.
3512960	3514160	I know, I'm awesome tonight.
3514160	3516200	Somebody I would let beat me with an orange bat.
3516200	3520320	I wouldn't let him beat me with an orange bat.
3520320	3526400	But he was basically quoted saying that he thinks that there should be more realistic
3526400	3533560	violence in a game so that you can see the consequences of your actions.
3533560	3539900	He's quoted saying, I don't think there are many games that tackle violence head on.
3539900	3545640	When you hit someone or inflict pain, faces get disfigured, for example, and I want to
3545640	3548360	make games that show that sort of thing.
3548360	3551480	If you don't see the pain, you can't understand what you've done, and you'll pass through
3551480	3555380	battles without taking responsibility for your actions.
3555380	3556480	I don't want to ignore that.
3556480	3561600	I want players to think, even if it's just a little, about what violence and war are.
3561600	3563160	No pain, no game.
3563160	3565120	There you go.
3565120	3570640	But I actually do think that that's a, you know, if they can do it in a freaking racing
3570640	3576040	game, why can't they do it in, you know, Metal Gear or anything like that?
3576040	3582320	I think that that's actually pretty smart, you know, because, you know, especially I
3582320	3587600	was noticing, you know, with the, I guess, parents and people who are saying, oh, violent
3587600	3591440	video games, blah, blah, blah, you know, desensitizing the violence and everything.
3591440	3595520	Well, if they're so desensitizing, then why not put that sort of consequence in a game,
3595520	3598080	you know, see how it, what happens.
3598080	3599960	I think that's actually pretty smart.
3599960	3602840	In Soviet Russia, games shoot you.
3602840	3608960	I think that is a very good idea.
3608960	3613760	That's so, so dumb.
3613760	3615760	I know, it's horrible.
3615760	3620240	Look, the show's free, folks, you know.
3620240	3622640	Can you believe the Writers Guild's on strike right now?
3622640	3626320	Rob's on the cutting edge of comedy right now.
3626320	3628080	Shut up and read the next story.
3628080	3638600	Well, perhaps Yakko Smirnoff is not really the, anyways, that may not be your kind of
3638600	3647040	thing, but hopefully this is, and I hope to God that they don't fuck this up, because
3647040	3648880	they could easily fuck this up.
3648880	3656920	Apparently, though, there is a placeholder for Iron Chef on the Wii, according to GameStop,
3656920	3661720	and it's supposedly coming out in June sometime.
3661720	3664800	I just hope it's not Iron Chef America, because that show fucking sucks.
3664800	3669480	Oh, hell no, it has to be Cheeseball, original Iron Chef.
3669480	3670880	Then that would be awesome.
3670880	3672600	And it needs to have Chairman Kaga.
3672600	3676960	No, this game needs to have us one of the Iron Chefs, Cooking Mama.
3676960	3678560	That would be winnin' awesome.
3678560	3680140	That would be.
3680140	3682600	Mama will have to fix your pathetic performance.
3682600	3685200	It would be great.
3685200	3687120	Come on, Iron Chef meets Cooking Mama.
3687120	3689600	It's destined to happen.
3689600	3694160	Anyhow, I guess this was destined to happen at some point, too.
3694160	3699560	I'm just surprised it took so long for some website to run a story with the headline,
3699560	3703640	Kid Wees on a Wii.
3703640	3706680	You, sir, are on the cutting edge of comedy.
3706680	3711360	That's right, speaking of being on the cutting edge of comedy, this little four-year-old
3711360	3718840	named Ellis Ensley in Fleetwood in the UK, him and his six-year-old brother were fighting
3718840	3721440	over their brand new Nintendo Wii.
3721440	3725640	And by the way, the dad had spent forever trying to get the Nintendo Wii, you know,
3725640	3726640	camping outside and all that.
3726640	3729240	Well, I don't know if he camped outside, but he was, you know, one of those parents.
3729240	3730480	He worked three jobs.
3730480	3734440	He sold his wife to slavery.
3734440	3739720	He had to walk through glass and two miles in the snow and the river just to get to school
3739720	3740720	and buy this Wii.
3740720	3741720	And molten hot lava.
3741720	3743420	That's right.
3743420	3747840	And they got this Wii, and when the four-year-old and the six-year-old started fighting over
3747840	3749680	it, did the kid cry?
3749680	3750680	No.
3750680	3752240	Did he go to his room and pout?
3752240	3753240	No.
3753240	3754360	What did he do?
3754360	3755360	He peed on it.
3755360	3756880	He broke out his Wii and weed on the Wii.
3756880	3761240	That's right, he weed on the Wii and reporters everywhere rejoice that they can finally use
3761240	3762760	that in a headline.
3762760	3764600	I'm just surprised it took so damn long, honestly.
3764600	3769800	Well, his kids are fucking misbehaved anyways if they're pissing on stuff in their house.
3769800	3775340	And let alone the geniuses that are pissing on stuff that's connected to the wall with
3775340	3777040	electricity running through it.
3777040	3778040	I only wish...
3778040	3780320	He's four years old, therefore not very smart.
3780320	3782960	I only wish that he had gotten electrocuted.
3782960	3786280	Still, you need to teach kid a lesson, rub his nose in it.
3786280	3788000	Kid wheezes on Wii?
3788000	3789480	Wii kills kid.
3789480	3790480	Awesome.
3790480	3791480	That's bad.
3791480	3792960	He's four!
3792960	3793960	But still.
3793960	3794960	Hey!
3794960	3795960	Still.
3795960	3797960	Survival of the fittest.
3797960	3798960	Smartest.
3798960	3805560	Hey, when I was four, I knew it was not okay to piss on the electric fence, okay?
3805560	3811120	Yes, when I was four, I was told not to eat the yellow snow, so you know, a lot of us,
3811120	3812120	you know...
3812120	3813600	It doesn't snow here, Rob.
3813600	3817080	It does up the hill a little bit, where we would sometimes travel to.
3817080	3818080	Okay, fine.
3818080	3819080	All right.
3819080	3820080	Anyhow.
3820080	3825280	Son of Dad in chat says, did they both pee on the Wii?
3825280	3829600	Don't cross the streams.
3829600	3835500	Anyhow.
3835500	3842500	Okay, well, that's it for this week's episode of The Classic Game of the Week, and I hope
3842500	3843500	you enjoyed it.
3843500	3848500	If you did, please like and subscribe, and I'll see you in the next one.
3848500	3849500	Bye.
3849500	3850500	Bye.
3850500	3851500	Bye.
3851500	3852500	Bye.
3852500	3853500	Bye.
3853500	3865880	So, Dark Soccer and Linus, what game have you selected as the Classic Game of the Week
3865880	3866880	this week?
3866880	3885320	Well, I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week, and I've been selected as the
3885320	3888320	Classic Game of the Week.
3888320	3903000	I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.
3903000	3912680	I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.
3912680	3930040	You can combine two of the four different weapons to make different unique weapons.
3930040	3938640	It actually spawned a sequel, which was Gunstar Superheroes.
3938640	3940520	We have flies in the building.
3940520	3942840	Yes, while the storms are going on, the flies are like,
3942840	3945640	Ooh, it's warm in the studio.
3945640	3949880	But Gunstar Superheroes came out on Game Boy Advance,
3949880	3954160	which was a pretty cool little game.
3954160	3961160	And then a couple of years ago, Sega put out a Sega Ages collection,
3961160	3965360	which was called the Treasure Box, which had Gunstar Heroes,
3965360	3969840	Dynamite Headdy, and Alien Soldier in the collection.
3969840	3974320	It's a really cool game, and I think one of Treasure's best.
3974320	3978440	For everyone always bitching that Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week is too obscure and
3978440	3982640	hard to find, here's one that you can download on the Wii Virtual Console very easily.
3982640	3986880	That was when we were playing yesterday on Virtual Console.
3986880	3989480	We had it in, and I was like, Hey, that sounds familiar.
3989480	3992200	And Dan was like, It's because it's Gunstar Heroes, duh.
3992200	3993200	And I'm like, Oh yeah.
3993200	3994200	And so he was playing the hell out of that.
3994200	3995200	So Gunstar Heroes is one of the best games ever.
3995200	4003160	All right, so there it is, your Classic Game of the Week at Gunstar Heroes.
4003160	4004160	And it's Treasure.
4004160	4005160	By Treasure.
4005160	4009720	I'm sure at some point before this segment is retired, every Treasure game will have
4009720	4010720	come up at one point.
4010720	4011720	Maybe not.
4011720	4013720	There's a few I'm not too big on.
4013720	4015720	All right, just about.
4015720	4019440	All right, anyhow, that's it for part A. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break,
4019440	4024680	but we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.
4024680	4029200	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4029200	4030200	a week.
4030200	4056760	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
