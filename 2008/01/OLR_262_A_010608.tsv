14061	25059	Tonight, January 6, 2008, rumors abound of another Xbox 360 model, Rock Band gets new songs from the magazine, and later this month you can call our show from your PSP.
32352	36676	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36717	43303	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43383	44464	My name is Rob Roberts.
44645	48569	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48849	49109	Hi.
49470	50150	And how are you, Ms.
50250	50571	Summers?
51031	51772	I'm recovering.
52373	53774	You've been kind of sick.
53814	60579	I remember last week on our year-end show you were sinus-y and sniffly, but you seem a little better this week.
61419	71446	It took me practically the whole week to get over my sinus infection and drinking to excess on New Year's Eve did not help, nor did singing for Odd Rock Band, nor did that help.
72807	75349	You look like you have about 80% HP this week.
76750	78171	Last week you were in the red, definitely.
78675	84296	Wednesday I got to work and I was just in hell.
84496	87457	So I called in on Thursday and Friday and tried to get to the doctor.
88457	94499	And apparently all the medical facilities lost power because of our crazy Alabama-esque storms.
94979	95959	We'll talk about that in a moment.
96719	97540	Our non-gaming bit.
98480	98720	So...
100569	106052	I ended up having to talk to the advice nurse and sent out the husband to get the drugs.
107313	109234	And I'm functional today.
110595	111696	Let me cast Cure on you.
112616	113477	I'm on the last day.
113697	116379	I'm on the very last of my antibiotics today.
116839	117399	All right.
117439	118540	Well, hopefully that'll work.
119100	121161	You'll be backed up to 100% health next week.
121242	122282	Maybe you'll even gain a level.
124604	125004	Hooray.
125924	128026	Joining us as well, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
128306	128686	Hello.
128906	129446	How are you, Loki?
129927	130307	I'm good.
131380	131820	And how are you?
131880	133281	Are you at 100% HP this week?
134102	136904	I'm reading Engadget right now.
137244	137505	Are you?
137765	140687	Well, I'm just catching up on the Sony thing.
141528	146412	That's right, because as we are taping live, we do subject ourselves to a live taping every week.
147013	152457	And right now, this very moment, as we were taping on this Sunday night, Consumer Electronics Show is just starting to get underway.
153438	154959	And it's actually kind of funny because...
156386	156767	and DarkSakura.com.
167725	170086	We probably shouldn't do that because the crazy storms are on the way.
170446	171987	And we actually thought about going to Vegas.
172567	174528	And so I was looking at hotels in Vegas.
174568	179150	I'm like, I cannot â€“ why are all the hotel rooms doubling as of Monday night?
179170	183852	Like we were looking at rooms like Excalibur and Circus Circus and like some of the not-so-high-end places, right?
184252	187834	And like these places were shooting up to like twice as much.
188374	189115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
203500	204281	If I plan better.
204301	205361	They don't announce too much.
206401	214765	It's not a lot of gaming stuff, but I happen to be a little bit of a tech nerd in addition to a gaming nerd, as I'm sure a lot of our fans are.
215006	217907	There's a little bit of tech nerdiness that goes with the gaming nerdiness, right?
218527	218927	Am I right?
219348	219508	Yeah.
219948	220948	So it would be fun to go.
221429	225110	And even William was like, I want to go to that sometime, because you know him.
225150	231333	He likes to look at the big TVs and all that stuff, and he's the only PlayStation 3 supporter I know of in the world.
231493	232774	Yeah, I support the PlayStation 3.
233933	245917	and I'll be supporting their online services as soon as they come out with those prepaid cards for their online content because I don't want to set up an account and deduct money with my credit card.
246197	252039	I'd rather use my hundreds of dollars of GameStop credit to buy cards that can translate to that.
252481	268526	Sony should seriously consider hiring my boyfriend as their Major Nelson or something like that because he'll seriously tell people, with me sitting right there, and I've been fairly critical of Sony, although I like to think I'm fair, but he'll sit there and tell me, oh no, you want a PlayStation 3 because it has Motorstorm.
269246	274748	You want to get a PlayStation 3 because it has four chips in it and it's like having four brains.
275308	279649	I'm like, but when you don't have any games to play on those four brains, what's the point?
280790	282030	And we argue about this all the time.
282912	283212	I don't know.
283933	284213	Anyhow.
286074	290477	So we'll be talking about Consumer Electronics Show on throughout the night, but first let's start off a little bit.
290897	292138	Actually, I want to talk about this too.
293410	294871	Those storms have been nuts.
294991	296452	They've been absolutely crazy.
296812	301394	Now, I guess Loki and I are probably spoiled, though, because we've lived in California our entire lives.
301714	307417	And I'll tell you what, for those of you guys who don't live in California, we are freaking spoiled here when it comes to storms and things like that.
307437	309058	No shit, Sherlock.
309918	312580	It was like a freaking hurricane coming in or something.
312640	313040	No, it wasn't.
313300	314921	I know, but that's how everybody was calling it.
314941	315601	It was a hurricane.
315641	316422	It was horrible.
317002	318563	It was more like a tropical storm.
318863	319123	Yeah.
319623	327445	But it damn near had us not do a show tonight because my internet was down for the longest time and I was afraid that we weren't going to be able to do a show tonight because we had no internet.
327465	330545	This giant tree fell just up the street and knocked out a bunch of power.
331105	332786	A bunch of homes in the block are still without power.
333206	334766	A bunch of the traffic lights were out.
334786	341668	But it's like, I don't see why at least Sacramento isn't better prepared for heavy rain.
342128	342548	I know.
342708	346829	Because every winter is the rainy season.
346849	347749	Yeah.
349198	354739	A couple years ago, I remember when it wasn't as windy, but it rained as badly.
355580	365562	But this is the first time that I've lived in this state that I can safely say that the weather has woken me up from a deep sleep.
367002	369243	And that hasn't happened since I lived in Alabama.
369383	372804	And actually, that happened during the Type 2 hurricane.
373504	373984	So, yeah.
375184	377307	I wasn't here the night the big storm hit.
378167	384634	I was at Williams that night and then I came back yesterday and one of our trash cans is gone.
384954	385274	Missing.
385594	386816	No idea where it is.
387056	389038	I don't know if it flew up the street or where the hell it is.
389118	390039	It's completely gone.
390059	390699	It's in Oz.
391500	392161	Apparently.
393194	396075	But it's like, where the fuck am I going to put my trash?
396995	397475	Call the city.
397655	398776	Thankfully, I haven't been here.
398836	401737	My roommate, my poor roommate, they went on vacation to Mendocino.
402277	403497	This big family vacation.
403537	405098	They spent the whole time up there without power.
405618	406978	They played Yahtzee by Candlelight.
407018	407919	That's how they spent their time.
408319	409259	I've done that before.
410399	411480	What a vacation, though.
411500	413100	Actually, I played D&D by Candlelight.
413640	417302	But it's one of those things where once you get the house, you can't get your money back.
418602	420162	So they just had to kind of grin and bear it.
420242	421803	Anyway, sorry, it has nothing to do with games.
422110	425652	Well, except for the fact that when there's an outage, you know, no games for you.
425672	426393	Well, I talked to Extifer.
426873	427073	Huh?
427273	433037	I talked to Extifer for a little bit, and he said his power was out, but that he had his iPhone, so everything was good.
433057	433097	No.
434698	435518	Well, thank God.
435678	438000	He called me earlier this week and said, oh, is your power out?
438080	451888	And I'm sitting there with my laptop in my lap and my PC sitting there, like, chugging out power from, you know, the wall, just, like, blasting air as I'm, like, running stress tests and stuff, and I'm like, no, my power hasn't been out.
453069	454930	Our power flickered for a little bit.
456151	459293	And I was like, well, that's okay because I'm freaking sick.
459333	460213	I'll just sleep through it.
461134	463075	That was my whole thing.
463135	470019	But I needed to go to the doctor really badly because I had been coughing rather heavily.
470059	474261	And I'm sure that a lot of our longtime listeners remember when I had the plague.
475502	479604	Basically, I started off as a sinus infection, went into bronchitis, went into pneumonia.
480164	481145	I was sick for three months.
482406	484967	My whole thing is I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.
486627	491548	I needed to go, but thankfully, the advice nurse gave me good advice.
492768	498449	I was just thinking about how many people at the medical facilities, people with injuries.
498509	504570	Dan's point was, he's like, well, I'd rather you be sick for another couple of weeks than be in the hospital.
505470	507351	I was like, I know how to drive in this weather.
507391	509371	He's like, yeah, you do, but no one else does.
510475	510975	That's true.
511035	512836	When it rains in California, everybody forgets how to drive.
512876	516577	And my drive tire is almost bald, so he wouldn't drive me either.
516637	517518	Only when it rains.
518658	521019	All right, we're turning into the Weather Channel podcast.
521119	527241	Sorry, guys, but it's definitely been a topic on our minds this week, and it has impacted our gaming weeks, I'm sure.
527261	531043	I know it impacted mine, but I'll let Jamie start off with how was your gaming week, as we always do.
531263	537525	I tried to play my DS, and my eyes hurt too badly from my sinus pressure, so I basically played a lot of Ragnarok.
539444	544267	I tried to play pinball and got dizzy, so I didn't play any more pinball.
546968	552771	Dan did break out Assassin's Creed on New Year morning.
553091	558254	His buddy Eric broke it out, so I actually got to see quite a bit more of that in person.
560815	567499	It's pretty, but I heard quite a bit of cursing coming from the other room on Thursday when Will came over to play.
568474	570735	and of course there was lots of Rock Band.
571615	572315	Lots and lots of Rock Band.
572335	573115	I got my Ninja Pass.
574556	581378	The Ninja Pass is this lovely device that uses a micro SD card to load Game Boy DS games.
583278	583838	Oh, okay.
583958	584359	I've heard of this.
584399	596322	And so, of course we cannot on the air condone piracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I have the Lendon too and I have the Tingle game.
597288	599024	I haven't loaded them yet but I have them
600180	602121	I'm okay with doing that to imports.
602361	611266	I think, ethically, I'm okay with pirating the imports because it's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, if you're not going to release it here, which I know some people are going to yell at me going, it's still wrong.
611426	612046	Fine, that's fine.
612346	616628	But my old philosophy is if you're not going to release it here, then I'm going to get it one way or another.
617449	619350	Because I'm not paying those insane markup fees.
619390	621171	I mean, it is insane to import a game.
621511	624772	But games that are released here domestically, I don't really pirate.
625233	626173	I buy most of my games.
626313	627574	Well, there's a few games that...
631058	632258	I got that looked interesting.
632738	636939	I'll have to put in my jump drive and get the names of them because a few of them I don't remember.
637079	641960	But I think it'll be a pretty good investment.
642000	645220	I mean, they were like $40 a piece, and my friend ordered them in bulk.
645901	647981	So both my husband and I have one.
648981	655242	I'm looking forward to using the hell out of it as soon as I can get the reader to work.
655262	656882	All right, well, have fun with that.
656922	657663	Let us know how it goes.
658883	659803	Loki, how was your gaming week?
660932	662813	Um, my game week was pretty good.
663253	669795	Actually, you know, I don't know, you guys always call me the Tech Master Loki and stuff, but I guess I kind of earned my title.
669895	672056	I brought my 360 back from death.
672616	675697	So that's right, my three ring 360 is working again.
676458	677998	Because I'm super awesome like that.
679098	689342	And, uh, it just involved taking the whole thing apart and replacing what they call the X-Clamp, which is something that holds the heat sink in place, and, uh, once I did that, it worked fine, so.
690401	691001	It's pretty awesome.
692902	695964	So now that makes the console count six.
696504	699746	I now own six 360s, which is ridiculous.
700086	706929	So you brought back the Red Rings of Death from the Brink of Death completely on your own, and what technique did you use to do it?
707229	716094	It's basically, if you search for X-Clamp replacement, it literally takes about $6 in parts to do it.
716707	719970	It's just some screws and a couple washers, and that's about it.
720311	730601	And what you do is because the way they built the clamp, which was genius to begin with, is it all focuses, it looks like kind of an X with all the points bent down.
731001	735566	And so the middle is closest to the board, and they have a little, like, plastic spacer on there.
735953	737034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
765478	766218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
794967	799532	In regards to Loki's 360, Frisbee says, Towelie brings Xboxes back to life.
799932	800954	Referring to the towel trick.
800974	802816	Well, you don't really need to do that, actually.
802836	812806	It's kind of weird, because what you're supposed to do after you do that replacement of the clip, you're supposed to turn it on without fans, and it's supposed to overheat.
812906	813967	Now, I did that.
814328	815389	Basically, you turn it on.
816415	818736	and wait for the three lights to turn the two lights.
818776	821977	But it did it almost instantly, and then I left it on there for about two minutes.
822017	824077	The thing is, though, is it didn't really heat up at all.
824458	826938	Like, I mean, I felt the top, I felt the heatsink, felt the bottom.
827158	830599	Now I think, okay, this thing's going to be on fire, but it didn't even feel that different at all.
831340	833120	And poor Akuda, I'm reading this chat.
833160	837061	Akuda in chat says, ugh, I got the red ring of death this week, the day I got my 360.
837101	839702	That sucks.
839802	841403	It sucks to be you, my friend.
841483	842203	I'm sorry to hear it.
843024	846545	You know, it happened to me three days after I bought mine, so it's not too much different.
846565	852367	And honestly, if I hadn't opened my system, I probably would have just sent it in to get replaced, but I did open my system.
853227	856288	Sakuramax says, Loki, you should just work at the 360 repair center.
858109	860930	Would you consider repairing somebody else's, like a legit system?
861090	870193	If they've actually, you know, I would say if they can't send it back into Microsoft, then sure, I would do it, because it only took like six bucks with parts, but, you know...
871724	880548	It's not guaranteed to work all the time, but from what I read on there, because they have a thread with all the success stories, about 90% of them get repaired that way.
882208	882948	That's amazing.
883009	890992	I figured for $6 and it's broken anyways, the worst that will happen is I waste $6 and the 360 is not replaced, but it works, so great.
891632	895013	Anyways, beyond all that, I actually played a few games this week.
895533	897414	I borrowed my wife's copy of
898001	899962	Planet Puzzle League, because I bought it for her.
900222	901362	Actually, that game is pretty fun.
901802	909785	It reminds me a lot of Luminous, actually, a little bit, because they've got kind of good music that goes with the whole thing, and the background is kind of flashy and stuff.
909805	911546	But it's a really fun puzzle game.
911566	913426	Did you ever play Pokemon Puzzle League?
913926	914146	No.
914287	915047	Same game.
915167	915787	Same thing.
915987	916747	Yeah, well, whatever.
916787	917167	That's all right.
917308	917868	It's still fun.
917888	918328	No, it's still fun.
918368	918568	It is.
918768	919048	I agree.
919268	919608	I had it.
920068	922189	And then, let's see what else they play.
922249	924550	I played Crysis, because I finally finished my computer.
925303	926084	and that's fun.
926304	940137	It's, I mean, if you played Far Cry Instincts, it's basically the same damn thing except now, you know, instead of being like some vampire, not vampire, like a werewolf type thing, you have this wonderful suit that can, you know, do amazing stuff and it's very pretty.
940658	944021	My favorite aspect of the entire game is all the wildlife running around.
944081	949266	So, like, I'll be fighting off, you know, some Koreans and stuff in the game and then all of a sudden I'll see this, like,
949744	952925	A flock of birds run by and immediately I turn fire on them.
953686	957027	Or I pick up a chicken and hook it up into the air and then fire it.
957487	963690	Or my other favorite is there was this turtle that I found around the beach when you first land in the beginning of the game.
964270	966071	And I wanted to put it back out into the sea.
966131	972414	And fortunately I switched to strength mode and I threw the turtle and the impact of the water killed it.
974224	976685	I also punched it, too, because I was trying to pick it up.
977125	978605	I'm like, I don't know how to pick stuff up yet.
978625	979645	This game sounds rad.
979665	980766	It's awesome.
980986	984527	You can see seagulls flying around and literally just fire them all in the air.
984887	989328	That's the best part of the game, just all the crap that you can do that's in it.
990968	993969	I want to point out this other comment in chat that's pretty good.
994669	998650	One of your most vocal critics here in chat, Ross Steel UT, who's always...
999485	1002688	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1018851	1023853	You can send those cards and love letters to Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com That system will never see live ever again.
1024094	1026055	But my other one, that's a different story.
1026275	1031977	It is interesting though, I mean, for being such a, you know, I get the sense you don't do this stuff to steal.
1032137	1036660	You do this because you like the challenge of modding systems and making them look cool.
1036720	1043123	I mean, that's kind of always why I've kind of turned the eye to it is that I always think you were more kind of in it for the challenge.
1043343	1045644	I mean, you do own six Xbox 360s.
1045684	1047405	That's way more than an average person would own.
1047805	1053368	Yeah, I don't really want to own that many, but that's all right.
1053388	1055729	GS68 says, banned until 999 AD.
1055929	1056650	Ah, whatever.
1056830	1056650	9999.
1056930	1057450	Oh, darn.
1057490	1061552	If one of my 360s gets banned off live, gee, what will I ever do?
1061993	1062313	All right.
1062953	1063193	Anyway.
1063513	1064634	Anything else for Gaming Week?
1065715	1066015	That's it.
1066055	1071198	But before we move on, I wanted to give you guys your Christmas gifts since I didn't have them last week.
1071458	1072398	Presents!
1073479	1073839	Yay.
1073859	1073919	Yay.
1074215	1076316	I apologize ahead of time.
1076336	1076716	Don't kill me.
1102455	1103136	I'm going to love this.
1103396	1103836	What did Jamie get?
1103856	1105437	You have a copy of Imagine Babies.
1111041	1111961	That's awesome.
1113662	1114983	The last one they have there.
1115223	1123829	Jamie got a copy of Imagine Babies with a Z. Take care of up to six babies.
1124809	1125990	Read the back for us.
1126270	1127451	How did they advertise this game?
1128206	1132109	Buy the babies good food, furniture, cute baby outfits, and toys.
1132949	1134870	Customize your house through minigames.
1138213	1139734	I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
1140054	1148539	It's like, I think everybody in iPod listening land or however you're listening to this program, PSP, whatever, is hearing the dot dot dot through their speakers right now.
1148920	1149560	No, that's too good.
1149600	1150901	It actually looks kind of cute.
1152682	1153503	She's coming around.
1154423	1156965	No, as long as they're virtual babies, I don't mind.
1159380	1159821	There you go.
1159881	1162684	You should raise some babies and then tell the hubby, here's your baby.
1163465	1164647	That would be great.
1165087	1165928	See, there you go.
1166068	1167230	Practical use for it.
1167410	1170314	I think there's a part in the game where you can shake the baby, so I know.
1173057	1173398	Alright.
1173618	1175740	They're actually kind of cute, though.
1176021	1176842	And the chat room is
1177706	1184692	I was staring at it blankly.
1185192	1188755	Thank you for the thoughtful gift.
1188815	1193719	I was hoping... Well, I was kind of trying to get some stuff to play this week.
1194840	1202205	Was it that... I don't even remember how it's... Patapon or something like that?
1202265	1204507	That one weird one that looks like LocoRoco?
1205027	1205328	And then...
1206263	1209365	Macman says, hey honey, I'm pregnant with digital babies.
1209765	1210546	That's okay.
1210566	1213107	I could go into detail about the physical...
1230492	1231813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1258126	1259447	You make it sound so sexy.
1259547	1261309	Does someone have a chainsaw outside?
1261429	1263530	That's the best thing ever.
1264411	1270956	Yeah, I know you guys can't hear this over the thing, but somebody's out there with a... Someone's out there with a chainsaw.
1270976	1272998	Either a chainsaw or like a... Or a weed whacker.
1273038	1273998	Weed whacker or something.
1274059	1275920	Probably trying to clean up debris from the storm.
1275940	1277061	I think it's a chainsaw.
1277161	1280684	Who like, you know, does yard work at night?
1280884	1283826	There were repair crews over on the crossroad.
1284687	1286408	Oh my gosh, it's crazy around here.
1286528	1287309	Alright, My Gaming Week.
1287881	1289002	We're never going to get to the gaming news.
1289662	1292803	You know what's funny is that a lot of people say I play too much WoW.
1293064	1293844	Well, guess what?
1293924	1299066	My internet was down for 24 hours thanks to the storm, so no WoW for me, QQ.
1299106	1299847	I was so sad.
1300667	1306050	So I did have to play other games, and I spent some time playing Mario Galaxy, which I love more and more every time I play it.
1306430	1313293	It's just amazing, and I love its little bits of retroness they have in it in regards to some of the music and things.
1313874	1314894	I raved about it last week.
1314934	1316555	I don't need to say much more, but I do love...
1317035	1320017	I also played some more of Rock Band.
1320077	1323159	I played till my arm literally hurt and felt like it was going to fall off.
1323979	1324820	So that was a lot of fun.
1325020	1329182	And then just played through a variety of various Xbox Live Arcade games I needed to catch up on.
1329542	1336406	And I made use of my HD DVD player this week because I bought Stardust on HD DVD a couple weeks ago and I never got around to watching it.
1336446	1339047	So I put it in the HD player and was watching that.
1339088	1340889	And that's pretty much how I spent my time with the outage.
1342860	1347423	And GS68 says, Thank you, Storms, for keeping Sky off the war crack.
1348504	1352046	Frisbee says, Chainsaw Guy from Resident Evil 4 is outside and is coming to get us.
1352966	1353407	I hope not.
1353447	1353947	That would suck.
1353967	1355008	That's a really gruesome ending.
1355068	1358129	I don't know if you've ever had your head chopped off by a Chainsaw Guy.
1358149	1358610	That sucks.
1359550	1360231	It totally sucks.
1360491	1362192	You know it happens to me all the time.
1363587	1367549	RustyLUT, who just seems to be a critic in general.
1367569	1370930	He's critical of Loki's stance on things.
1370950	1372431	He's critical of my WoW playing.
1372451	1375152	He says, oh God, no WoW for one whole day.
1375212	1377152	How could Sky exist without his second job?
1377453	1379073	But I apparently can do no wrong.
1379293	1380174	Actually, you ass.
1382182	1383163	I love taunting the listeners.
1383243	1384404	No, I respect the opinion.
1384464	1387226	But WOW is my third job.
1387667	1391029	OLR is my second job, and then my day job is my first job.
1391130	1392291	So WOW is my third job.
1392651	1394472	So if you're going to taunt me, get it right.
1397275	1402759	Jamie's chowing down on the whole wheat cookies William made for the New Year's party.
1403220	1403640	They're good.
1403760	1404361	They're really good.
1404541	1407443	They restore 10 HP when you eat them, too, so eat a lot.
1407904	1409125	They're also full of fiber.
1409145	1410126	Okay.
1411078	1413201	Our work's trying to get a dev kit for 360.
1414603	1415043	What for?
1416646	1417066	I don't know.
1417086	1418789	Just to have?
1419510	1419890	I hope.
1421412	1422013	A dev kit.
1422535	1424015	Also, I want to point out, I know Op.
1424155	1427576	11's down tonight, but we have some new decorations in the studio I guess you'll see next week.
1428456	1434737	I was in this strip mall that had a lot of little stores in it that had imported things.
1435097	1438698	I got a big Kingdom Hearts wall scroll that's now up on the wall that's pretty awesome.
1438718	1440238	I've got to say, that's a really great artwork.
1440318	1442198	I don't know where that artwork comes from, but it's great.
1442658	1446839	And a Final Fantasy XIII poster, if you can believe it, which is totally a bootleg, I think.
1446879	1451580	I think somebody just took Sony's official release picture and made a poster out of it, but it looks great nonetheless.
1452140	1455182	So, some new decorations to look forward to when the cam comes back.
1456523	1458544	Meanwhile, we'll get into some housekeeping tonight.
1458664	1460265	Just some things I wanted to say really quickly.
1461066	1479437	Orange Launch Radio's rotation of music is going to be changing this week, which is going to cause some downtime either Monday or Tuesday during the day, but not a lot of people are listening during the day anyway, so I imagine people probably aren't even going to notice, but I just wanted to get that out there that the station will be down for a little bit on Monday or Tuesday while the new songs go into rotation.
1480618	1480778	And...
1481601	1482161	That's really it.
1483882	1485302	Otherwise, welcome to our first show of 2008.
1504266	1511912	We'll take a peek during the break and see if there's anything we can report on in Part B. But meanwhile, I believe there's some rumors about what might be being talked about tonight, yes?
1512172	1517417	Yes, one of the rumors is that there's going to be yet another Xbox 360 SKU coming out.
1517917	1525042	However, from what I remember, the SKU is actually supposed to be from another company, like Toshiba or something like that.
1525523	1530427	But anyways, it's being dubbed the Xbox 360 Ultimate.
1530467	1533529	And it's actually funny because this was reported in Stuff Magazine.
1535404	1552528	It'll be hitting stores apparently by this autumn and will feature 1080p HDMI output, built-in Wi-Fi, high-def audio output, cooler 65nm hardware architecture, and a near-silent fan.
1553069	1561831	On top of that, it's going to have an IPTV service and a 320GB hard drive and a built-in HD DVD drive.
1562291	1563191	And it's all bullshit.
1564367	1565448	I wouldn't be surprised.
1567630	1570172	Part of me sounds like it's a bit much, I think.
1570572	1571673	The system would be too expensive.
1571693	1578858	But at the same time, why would Stuff Magazine run something like that then if they didn't know that it was coming out?
1579319	1579599	I don't know.
1579639	1592949	It sounds stupid to me, but if it's not being dubbed like the Xbox something or other, if it's just Toshiba's HD DVD player that also plays Xbox 360 games, that kind of thing.
1593234	1595195	Oddly enough, that makes a little more sense to me.
1623783	1624143	Steppin' Aside
1654209	1655615	It's like, yes, I'm too rich to be doing this shit.
1660749	1662910	Sony has revealed some of their plans.
1663010	1667513	One of the big announcements that's going to impact gamers is in regards to the Slim PSP.
1668013	1671094	They're going to be getting Skype in late January.
1671735	1675597	Of course, Skype is a program that listeners of our show, I hope, would know very well.
1676237	1681359	After all, we were one of the first internet programs anywhere years ago to actually have a Skype line.
1682260	1684981	Users have been calling us since 2003 or 2004 on our Skype line.
1687862	1690603	at Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
1691123	1695724	And now folks are going to be able to call from their PSP when this new firmware is released at the end of January.
1695764	1700265	But the only catch is it's only available on the PSP Slims.
1700925	1701405	So far.
1701986	1707987	But now, Loki, you say that through your controversial hack-and-crack method, you think that this could work on the PSP fatties.
1708167	1708647	I think so.
1708867	1710748	I don't see why it can't.
1711368	1716729	Right now, they have a lot of the firmware stuff that's locked in for the Slim PSP, but
1717769	1718690	Thanks for watching!
1738089	1738769	That's pretty cool.
1738849	1743090	And I got to say Skype out and Skype in will be a part of this as well.
1743110	1747471	And of course Skype out and Skype in are the things that let you use basically Skype as a normal telephone.
1747511	1748911	We use Skype in here on the show.
1748971	1751652	That's how you can call 1-888-GAME-OLR.
1752212	1754993	And we use an 800 number forwarder that forwards to our Skype line.
1756313	1757173	Very technical.
1757373	1758093	But it works.
1758313	1759353	It does cost extra though.
1759774	1760294	Yes, it does.
1760334	1761434	That's not something that's free.
1762574	1765195	But I know somebody that uses Skype as their home phone.
1765695	1766655	And they love it.
1768508	1774570	This is just another kind of cool thing for the PSP that's kind of breathing more life into it.
1774590	1785674	I think a lot of people kind of wrote off the PSP when the games weren't so strong, but I think this kind of cements PSP as the handheld device.
1785714	1787974	Notice how I don't call it a handheld gaming system.
1787994	1792656	The DS is supreme, I think, in that category, but the PSP is one hell of a portable device.
1793956	1796377	Now that it does pictures, movies...
1797271	1800592	Internet Radio, now it does Skype, Web Surfing.
1800652	1803934	I mean, this is like a computer in your pocket now.
1804334	1806735	That's pretty awesome, the PSP that's turning into.
1806755	1807215	I like my iPhone.
1807955	1809776	And it has Castlevania, which is odd.
1809816	1811096	But does your iPhone have Castlevania?
1811417	1812397	No, but my DS does.
1813017	1813637	Oh, snap.
1814858	1817119	All right, well, that's all I have to say.
1817139	1823961	I'd still prefer that if it was going to be initially a handheld gaming system, it remain a gaming system.
1824022	1825242	They don't need all that extra crap.
1826437	1850608	but I will say this I mean I think to some extent I think that's what the N-Gage was trying to do too and remember how much shit the N-Gage got because I think at least PSP is still kind of like I don't know the way the PSP has done it they still have kind of focused on games first and everything else is secondary but I don't know they've just done it so much better than Nokia did the N-Gage was a piece of shit it really was I don't know I can't explain that one I think that
1852622	1862708	The N-Gage could have been better had they gone for, first of all, cartridge bases of those stupid little chip things.
1863248	1866930	Something that could actually store enough media to make it look worth playing.
1867951	1869912	I tried playing stuff on that and it was just awful.
1871173	1878617	At least the PSP doesn't... It put a lot of focus into the gaming aspect.
1878677	1881339	It was initially meant to be a gaming system.
1881619	1881999	And the
1882837	1884458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1904485	1905366	How about something better?
1905586	1909609	Let me say one thing real quick before we get back into the news because Tigerclaw is mentioning something.
1910229	1913792	I just realized OLR is competing against American Gladiators tonight.
1914692	1915072	Oh, no.
1915092	1918035	Because tonight is the return of American Gladiators on NBC.
1918275	1918595	I know.
1918615	1919996	What the hell am I doing here?
1920276	1921237	This is all I have to say.
1922117	1927061	TiVo, VCR, DVR, whatever.
1927641	1928502	That's why you got it.
1928702	1933165	Does anyone actually remember the old American Gladiators?
1933545	1934146	Fuck yeah, I do.
1934727	1935347	Can I talk?
1935387	1936047	Thank you, sir.
1964318	1990992	for anyone who remembers Target Terror it's coming out on the Wii as a Zapper game and it looks awful but it looks great at the same time because it was one of those full motion capture type of games and I love Revolution X so I'm actually sort of thinking about getting this just for the cheeseball factor I love cheeseball games
1992347	1994008	So I think that's going to be kind of fun.
1994108	2003495	But you have machine guns and grenade launchers and orbital space lasers and minigames and all kinds of fun stuff.
2004936	2005496	Looks like fun.
2006437	2007818	Yeah.
2007878	2013202	Loki, weren't you saying something before the show, though, that they're going to charge the full retail price for this, $40 or something?
2013782	2014163	Yeah, it's $40.
2014283	2016024	That's crap tech.
2016064	2016704	I don't know about that.
2016905	2017805	It's not worth $40.
2018486	2020187	I'm sure it'll be in the bargain bin before too long.
2020592	2021653	Just give it time, man.
2021713	2023994	If it sucks, they'll drop the price quick.
2025915	2027956	Anyway, we shall see.
2028356	2040822	In other fun news, if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine, or even if you don't, next month, the February issue, we'll have three exclusive Rock Band songs for download.
2041428	2042349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2066435	2068777	One of which is from Freeze Prop.
2069378	2070579	That would be Sprode.
2070879	2073161	Not Super Sprode, but Sprode.
2074202	2077325	Bang Camaro's Rock Rebellion and Count Zero's Shake.
2077505	2080327	Wait, so we don't think the Sprode thing is a typo?
2080347	2083070	Because they don't have a song called just Sprode unless it's something new.
2083090	2086272	It might be something new or maybe a rock version of Super Sprode.
2087133	2088074	Oh, that would make sense.
2089298	2091119	Maybe like a cover of their own song or something.
2091199	2094481	If I remember, Super Sprode was too rocky.
2094941	2099083	Well, Super Sprode is fucking rad, so I hope it is that song and some type of reincarnation.
2099463	2100343	Because I love that song.
2100383	2102024	That was a great song in Amplitude.
2102485	2104726	But yeah, definitely check it out.
2105026	2107567	I stopped subscribing to this magazine, but I'll pick one up.
2108147	2109568	So you're going to buy one so I don't have to?
2109888	2110048	Yeah.
2110308	2110609	Sweet!
2112349	2115491	Because that whole DVD sharing thing he just said, I was just making sure about that.
2116050	2121953	Alright, well, speaking of Rock Band, EA has not ruled out that Rock Band will be coming out on the Wii.
2122493	2126235	You might notice that the Wii is that one system that's sorely missing Rock Band right now.
2126355	2128276	It does have Guitar Hero 3, but no Rock Band.
2130237	2135440	Harmonix themselves has said that the Wii has, quote, an enormous potential for music games.
2136400	2145005	GamePro actually went out and got a quote from EA talking about that there's going to be Rock Band...
2145780	2147181	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2172898	2180884	I don't know.
2185227	2188389	That's not a bad idea.
2188449	2190691	So in other words, they're not saying no, they're just saying not now.
2191171	2194373	Although they can also do all wired controllers because they have USB ports on there.
2194814	2195294	No, why not?
2195874	2196175	I don't know.
2197255	2197996	We'll see what happens.
2198096	2200618	But in the meantime, the Wii fans are rock bandless.
2200638	2200798	Sorry.
2200818	2201058	Sorry.
2202113	2209658	Well, a Guitar Hero fan, though, actually put together a Kill Bill guitar.
2210499	2211520	I think it's pretty cool.
2211560	2214602	I'll put a link to the picture up in the chat room.
2216323	2223768	But it was basically inspired by, I guess, an Evil Dead guitar that someone did, too.
2223928	2224829	So that's pretty cool.
2225390	2228972	And it's really not all that hard, because all you need to... Like, for example...
2231641	2236503	A dance friend, Will, got a Sex Pistols one for a penny.
2237744	2242386	So you can find the faceplates, or you can make them yourself because they're not that difficult.
2243206	2246868	And just if you've got any artistic ability, customize it yourself.
2247488	2253091	But I'll put a picture of the image in the chat, or the link in chat.
2254088	2254548	and DarkSakura.com.
2273797	2275917	And that's one of the biggest money makers for Rock Band.
2275997	2276738	So far, yeah.
2276898	2279118	Yeah, so that is a good point.
2279138	2281559	The Wii doesn't really support anything like that so far.
2281619	2284579	Although, aren't they supposed to be getting Guitar Hero 3 content next year?
2285919	2291121	Yeah, whenever they figure out how to actually do it.
2291821	2293521	Well, now's the time to figure that out.
2293561	2295221	That's big money they're missing out on right there.
2295401	2297122	Yeah, I'll say.
2297802	2298262	Anyways...
2298949	2303750	Some other stuff you can look forward to at least this week coming out in the United States.
2304310	2305170	A few releases.
2305250	2312311	Actually, there's some decent stuff coming out, including, let's see, starting things off, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom.
2313271	2318612	That'll be coming out on the 360, although it looks like this time they kind of went more of the Dynasty Warriors route.
2319993	2323593	Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is coming to the Wii and PlayStation 2.
2324873	2328154	So if you're into that hoverboard racing stuff, you can play that.
2329097	2332358	NFL Tour on the PlayStation 3 and 360.
2333398	2337319	Good $40 football game, kind of arcade style.
2337959	2342500	Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law on PlayStation 2, Wii, and the PSP.
2342981	2347182	If you happen to be a fan of the show and like the Phoenix Wright games, you'll definitely like that one.
2348002	2349502	Jackass the Game on DS.
2350302	2353483	If it's anything like the PSP version, you'll definitely like that one.
2354503	2356684	World Championship Paintball for the PlayStation 2.
2357947	2360028	That is crap.
2360249	2362730	Sea Monster is a prehistoric adventure on the DS.
2363091	2363831	Also crap.
2364392	2369175	And then one of the weirdest things to come out in a while and doesn't look very good either.
2369615	2373438	Dance Dance Revolution Disney Channel Edition on PlayStation 2.
2375459	2375900	Oh, God.
2379042	2380723	And I believe that's it for this week.
2381203	2383725	You know you want to dance to high school musical songs, Loki.
2383745	2384386	No.
2384626	2384846	No.
2385569	2386309	We know who does.
2386729	2387050	Alright.
2388030	2394993	Well, coming out over in Japan, finally taking a break from not having any games come out because of the holidays, to getting some stuff come out.
2395033	2397974	Or I should say, if you're an Xbox 360 fan, price reductions.
2398704	2399765	But that's never a bad thing.
2399845	2406248	Some price reductions for Armored Core 4 and Table Tennis take place this week, as well as the release of the Xbox 360 Messenger Kit.
2406288	2409609	We got that here a little while ago with the integrated MSN Messenger.
2410250	2413731	Not that it's been doing folks a lot of good this week with Xbox Live going up and down.
2414072	2420855	However, assuming that those problems are being fixed very soon, the Messenger Kit will be doing Japanese MSN fans a lot of good.
2421775	2428478	Also getting a price reduction on the PlayStation 3, Armored Core 4's port on PlayStation 3.
2429679	2446947	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, a new game from Marvelous Entertainment called Kaiti Kyoshi Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle Wii, which looks to be some type of anime-based game that I think is some type of fighter.
2446967	2448428	It looks kind of like a 3D fighter.
2448448	2450969	Is there an anime called Hitman?
2451658	2452158	Probably what it is.
2452178	2453379	I don't know.
2453480	2454440	I'm not sure.
2455141	2456182	Whatever it is, there you have it.
2457183	2468852	Also coming out on some other systems, the Nintendo DS is getting a game called Chishikio Series Train Master, which is another train sim game.
2469173	2471535	Apparently those train sim games are very popular overseas.
2471615	2478020	I haven't seen a train sim game very popular over here since Railroad Tycoon or A-Train, but I guess they're still popular over there.
2478524	2483005	There was the big Denja Dago series that was out for a long time too.
2483846	2485666	I wonder why they're not as popular here.
2486186	2487607	Even had a big controller for it too.
2488087	2491048	My dad used to buy those games all the time back when we had a Commodore 64.
2491108	2494569	He bought like every train because he was a conductor before he retired.
2494609	2495149	That's what he did.
2495229	2496149	So he loved that stuff.
2497089	2497789	I thought it was interesting.
2498410	2500810	Anyhow, that's really it for Japanese releases this week.
2501070	2501370	Alright.
2502211	2503111	What about UK releases?
2504271	2506632	Well, um... Loki, wait your turn.
2507788	2509629	There's really not a whole lot to talk about.
2510209	2516590	The 9th has Omega 5 on Xbox Live Arcade, Sam & Max 202, Moai Better Blues.
2516751	2517391	That's a cool name.
2518191	2520131	And then that's coming out on the 10th.
2520191	2523372	And the 11th is PDC World Darts Championship 2008.
2524113	2526833	Exciting, but not really.
2526853	2530994	Sam & Max is going to be awesome.
2532035	2532435	Season 2.
2534026	2534786	Uh, anyways.
2535667	2540069	Um, as you mentioned, Omega 5 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week.
2540289	2542930	Uh, Hudson's kind of side-scroller shooter game.
2543531	2545712	Looks a little bit like R-Type or something like that.
2546552	2547973	Um, definitely gonna be awesome.
2548033	2550834	That's only gonna cost you 800 Microsoft points.
2551855	2552735	And, um...
2553669	2556190	No word if there's going to be anything else coming out this week as well.
2556451	2560333	I know last week there was only one item, just Mel Slug 3.
2561333	2563635	So I guess maybe this is the only release this week as well.
2563935	2566076	Microsoft, I want Rez.
2566676	2567297	Really badly.
2568617	2568737	Huh?
2569178	2569898	I want Rez.
2571019	2571359	Rez!
2571459	2572079	I want Rez!
2574260	2575341	No Rez for you!
2576542	2576862	Now!
2578530	2583793	All right, so maybe I won't get Rez, but there will be some other games on the Virtual Console in the United States of America.
2584433	2591678	Monday's games have been leaked, it appears, the day before, and a real good one coming for the Nintendo this week.
2592178	2594459	Star Tropics is coming to Virtual Console.
2594499	2595640	That was a pretty rad game.
2596000	2596941	I was one of the last...
2597461	2598782	Really big RPGs.
2599803	2607308	No word yet, though, if buying it on the Virtual Console will give you that letter that you have to dip in the water in order to get the secret code.
2607628	2611791	Otherwise, the thought just occurred to me, a lot of people are going to be screwed when they try to play that game on Virtual Console.
2611931	2615013	I think that there'll be some sort of compensation made for it.
2615073	2621718	Like, maybe they'll have to go on Nintendo's site and do some sort of bizarro thing.
2622018	2624380	Or it'll be in the digital manual that comes with the game.
2625199	2625899	Oh, there you go.
2625939	2627760	Maybe the digital manual in the game will have it.
2628140	2630721	No, there is a scene in this game where you'll need this code.
2631081	2633722	But there's going to be tons of people that don't even think to look there, I bet.
2634022	2634262	I know.
2634762	2635542	That's going to be interesting.
2635562	2637403	They're going to be on GameFAQs.
2637483	2640544	I bought the game used, and I was like, I don't know what the fucking code is.
2640684	2644585	We have to dip the manual in the water to reveal the code.
2644745	2645685	I don't have the manual.
2645865	2648886	Isn't the code 747, and why do I remember that?
2649006	2650227	It's 747, because I remember it was a plane.
2650247	2651207	Because it's like a plane, yeah.
2652847	2655128	Oh my god, you know you've played too many games when.
2656009	2657169	I don't need no stinking letter!
2659030	2669655	There's a ton of games that have those little weird quirks built in, like the X-Men game where you had to press reset to reset the machine or something.
2669795	2670576	That's right.
2670656	2671256	On Genesis.
2673037	2673557	So weird.
2674514	2680218	Nothing will ever be as cool, though, in regards to quirky fucking things in games as Metal Gear Solid.
2681078	2683300	Was it Psycho Mantis who read your memory card?
2683600	2683960	Yeah.
2684080	2685741	Oh, I see you're a Castlevania fan.
2685821	2691805	And it had Xenogears on there, which wasn't released at the time.
2692125	2692946	Creepy, creepy.
2693226	2699050	And then it also, though, in Final Fantasy VII, had...
2702639	2704280	I have that on the Neo Geo CD.
2704320	2704860	It's a good one.
2723752	2728373	KOF 94 was, if I do remember, the first one that was out in the series.
2729194	2742818	And I played tons and tons and tons of that game because they had it at the arcade at my college where I learned the joy of playing with Yuri's butt attack.
2745495	2746755	Interesting, I might have to check it out.
2746775	2749196	You know, I have no Neo Geo games on Virtual Console yet.
2749436	2750096	Do you?
2750477	2751217	Oh, that sucks.
2751277	2752677	My thing is almost filled up.
2752777	2753778	That's the sad part.
2753918	2757259	My screen is almost, like, you know how you can only go to like four screens on the Wii?
2757399	2759519	I seriously only have room for a handful of games left.
2759539	2759899	Wow.
2759979	2763300	Because I have so many of those stupid Virtual Console games I keep paying money for.
2764321	2765041	You know what, Rob?
2765141	2765321	Hmm?
2765905	2766145	NeoGeoCD
2795384	2796584	Well, I'll tell you what we're thinking.
2796604	2797325	I'll think aloud here.
2797345	2802026	Because Operator 11, unfortunately, it seems like it's running on autopilot right now.
2802046	2807588	I don't know what the heck's going on with them, but none of the shows are saving or whatever, which is part of the reason we're not using them.
2807908	2812709	So we're thinking about defecting to another service called Ustream TV, which has no limits on their shows.
2813349	2817691	I just have to make sure it's kosher for us to broadcast video game images, but I don't know why it wouldn't be.
2818351	2820652	But sometimes there's copyright issues that come into play with that.
2820732	2821972	But usually as long as we're...
2823300	2828903	If we're doing any type of commentary with it or whatever, it's fair use, but I don't know.
2828923	2829203	We'll see.
2830503	2832584	Anyhow, back to the Virtual Console story.
2832644	2834065	StarTropics, King of Fighters 94.
2834505	2836326	No third game mentioned yet.
2836386	2841868	I guess we'll find out tomorrow, but remember, not every week have they always done three games, so it is possible it's just a two-game week.
2842809	2843409	So we shall see.
2844096	2846898	Well, it looks like they're having something similar to that in the UK.
2847258	2854242	The big release right now is Harvest Moon coming out on Virtual Console.
2854342	2860946	And I do recall seeing, although I can't find the link on here now, but I did also recall seeing Donkey Kong Country 3.
2862407	2867850	But apparently the link to it is gone from where I read it.
2868444	2868804	Lost in Blue Game
2892844	2894265	When did the second one ever come out?
2894365	2895725	Like, I remember they were making one.
2895745	2899667	I think I actually played it for a few seconds at the show.
2899727	2901188	I don't remember when it came out.
2901208	2902409	I think it was like October-ish.
2902649	2904530	Is that game like really a cult hit or something?
2904550	2905070	I guess.
2905230	2905630	I don't know.
2905990	2906411	Weird.
2906891	2908191	I did not like the first game either.
2908592	2908952	I don't know.
2909192	2909492	Strange.
2909632	2909912	Whatever.
2910252	2919417	Anyways, so apparently Microsoft is a little bit sorry for the fact that Xbox Live has been having issues this last few weeks here.
2920389	2928771	and to apologize for that they're going to be offering all Xbox Live members around the world one free Xbox Live arcade game.
2929111	2933031	No word on which game it is or if we're going to get a choice or what.
2933851	2935572	Hopefully it's not something I already own.
2936912	2945273	I've heard rumblings and you can take this as like a friend of a friend thing which holds little to no weight but from what I hear it's a game that nobody has yet.
2945713	2948674	One of the future releases is going to be free in light of this.
2949998	2951899	and it's not something like Yaris.
2953999	2957300	My mind instantly went to, great, we're going to get the Doritos game for free.
2958561	2961122	No, it's something people actually want, apparently.
2961802	2963362	Yeah, because I'd be sad.
2963402	2967664	When Carcassonne was free for everybody, most people were happy about that because hardly anyone bought it.
2968244	2971625	I bought it previously, so I didn't get anything out of that deal.
2972025	2975286	So I hope it's something new, like, you know, Rez.
2976892	2977492	Yaris 2 Yaris 2 Anyhow
2998585	2999205	I really don't know.
2999285	3000246	Oh, but I do want to say this.
3000266	3001266	I want to take the opportunity to say this.
3001306	3010288	I don't know if you saw it on our forums, but somebody actually made a YouTube of Yaris set to the music of Dragon Force as inspired by our show.
3010688	3016710	So I think that might come up in the mailbag later, so I won't blow all the details on that just yet on how you can access that.
3016730	3017850	But I saw that on our forums.
3018391	3019311	That was kind of cool.
3021243	3024084	Meanwhile, I will mention this about the Xbox Live outages.
3024124	3026584	Some people are pissed about this.
3026885	3029325	They're so pissed they're filing a lawsuit.
3029385	3029925	That's right.
3030425	3036707	When there's a problem that a major company is having, leave it to the parasites to jump on and file a class action lawsuit.
3036747	3044229	Three folks out of Texas have filed a class action lawsuit against the company on what they call breach of contract.
3045049	3049490	The lawsuit goes on to whine about, quote, many plaintiffs being kicked offline.
3051898	3053239	and so on and so forth.
3067299	3074825	Microsoft, to give them credit, I think has always been a company very good about apologizing when they fuck up.
3074945	3077186	Hence, they're going to give out the free game.
3077467	3080829	They've been very forthright in saying, we made a mistake, we're not happy about it.
3081149	3086313	You can tell if you read Major Nelson's blog or his Twitter, he is livid about what's going on.
3086613	3088975	He's working overtime to try and fix it.
3089155	3092217	It's not like they're sitting on their big duff not trying to do anything about it.
3092298	3095420	So I kind of give them a little bit of credit and I forgive them.
3095440	3095640	They don't
3095640	3098081	I don't guarantee that they're always going to be up either.
3099101	3105223	Should I sue them because they run maintenance on their server sometimes and it's during a time I want to play?
3105743	3106824	I mean, it's not really fair.
3107164	3109885	It's just these fucking people are just trying to get money from whatever.
3109905	3110805	They're all Microsoft.
3110825	3111985	They've got money to spend.
3112426	3113686	Let's see if we can get some of it.
3114912	3119875	Well, you know the thing about a class action lawsuit is that it's supposed to represent all users, right?
3120195	3122116	So allow me to say you do not represent me.
3122636	3124437	I do not wish to participate in this lawsuit.
3124797	3129199	I don't give a shit if they didn't give me anything to compensate me for their live service being down.
3129259	3129700	Big deal.
3129740	3130700	It's down for a couple weeks.
3131120	3131581	You know what?
3131661	3135082	If they really wanted to, they can give me like two weeks free or something like that.
3135122	3135763	Big deal.
3136643	3137463	I'd have been fine with that.
3158471	3161813	I'm sure Xbox Live would not be opposed to doing something like that.
3161833	3164754	Seriously, are they actually going to try to sue them for what?
3164994	3167675	Let's just say if they cut out a whole month, that's like $5.
3169036	3171077	Oh my God, you're out $5.
3172138	3173258	Poor baby.
3174119	3183583	I'm sure in that user license agreement thingy that you have to... You know how every time you sign up for something, you have to read the user license agreement, and most people just click OK?
3183863	3187565	I could not believe that somewhere in there is not some type of clause that says...
3188089	3188869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3215973	3219775	Frisbee says in chat, Terms of Service covers it all.
3220855	3221295	There it is.
3222576	3226657	So, yeah, so we'll see what happens with this class action lawsuit.
3226677	3232240	We'll keep you guys posted, that is, if anything actually comes of this, but we shall see.
3234200	3245145	Well, for anyone who remembers the Tickle Me Elmo craze or how Beanie Babies went, we are having a repeat with a plushy weighted companion cube.
3246496	3247538	Thanks for watching!
3255859	3257320	Thanks for watching!
3277913	3280335	You're an idiot if you buy Guitar Hero for $9,000.
3280475	3284317	Do you know how much weed that whole family is going to be able to buy for $9,000?
3284537	3285218	Sucka.
3286299	3286959	Do you really?
3287139	3290281	I mean, you do realize that the guy could have been making it all up.
3290401	3294224	And do you realize you paid $9,000 for something that's really easy to find?
3294844	3295525	You idiot.
3295965	3297146	I have a $5 bill.
3297206	3297566	Guess what?
3297646	3301409	I took it away from my unborn son because he smoked pot in the future.
3302049	3302289	I want $9,000. $9,000.
3307012	3309074	and on top of that... You know what's sad?
3309694	3318341	If we signed some piece of OLR memorabilia, like if we took a ferret and signed it or something and tried to put it on eBay, we'd be lucky to get $1.99 for it.
3318521	3321323	I think that we should do something gimmicky like that.
3321563	3322684	You want to do something gimmicky?
3322844	3323705	Let's do something gimmicky.
3323725	3328669	I'll tell you what, I'm going to sign my weighted companion cube and we'll put that up on eBay.
3328689	3329089	A paper one.
3329565	3333007	Yes, we'll make a weighted... There's a paper weighted companion cube online.
3333127	3333587	Fair enough.
3333687	3342391	We will make a weighted companion cube out of paper and sign it and make up some story about how we stole it from a baby in the crib or something and see how much money we get from it.
3343111	3343191	Okay.
3343211	3343531	Be beautiful.
3343551	3347173	We traded a dingo, a baby, for the weighted companion cube.
3347553	3349934	The dingo ate my companion cube!
3350675	3351995	That'd be a hungry dingo.
3352456	3353336	You bastard.
3353416	3354036	Portal 2.
3354256	3355577	The dingo ate my companion cube.
3355597	3356657	So stupid, though.
3356798	3357318	Oh, my God.
3357398	3357718	I see...
3359463	3363545	I wanted one fairly bad, and Dan was actually going to get me one for Christmas.
3364385	3366946	How long did it take them to sell out?
3367026	3367607	Four hours?
3368627	3370568	Drew Nami brings up an excellent point.
3370608	3373989	Don't we have an orange bat somewhere still from back in the day?
3374489	3375450	It's in the vault.
3376230	3377551	We might have to get that.
3377731	3379071	We might have to pull that out of the vault.
3379431	3380652	Because we have a blank one, don't we?
3381252	3381412	No.
3382012	3382533	I thought we did.
3382713	3383353	We could do a new one.
3384202	3391188	I had to save the original orange bat, though, because it was the one that was signed at... What tournament was that?
3391608	3392669	March Madness.
3392689	3393329	We'll get a new one.
3393529	3399114	We'll get a new orange bat, sign it, beat something with it, and that'll be our story, and then we'll sell it.
3399214	3403977	And then if we put Portal in the search details on eBay, it'll sell.
3404318	3404858	Exactly.
3408321	3409982	We'll just write Portal on the bat.
3411194	3414055	and if it makes enough money, then we'll come visit you.
3415216	3416196	If it makes enough money.
3419097	3425780	We should have one with a reserve up there that's like, buy an Orange Sounds Radio visit.
3425800	3429922	Where you have to pay for us to come out and feed us.
3430082	3430842	I don't know about that.
3431662	3432643	Again, we'd be lucky to get $1.99.
3432683	3433143	Anyway, let's move on.
3436833	3441734	Um, so, Ubisoft has announced Far Cry 2 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3442755	3449156	Um, of course, the new Far Cry game, not being in the tropics, it's actually gonna be in the African savannah.
3450196	3450596	Africa!
3451397	3456058	And, um, you will be able to, you know, destroy stuff, and it'll be awesome.
3456498	3458338	But, um, I don't know.
3458718	3459379	I can't wait to play it.
3459959	3460619	So, um...
3462426	3466749	Hopefully it'll come out around the same time as the PC version, which is due out this spring.
3467330	3469652	But no word, though, if that's actually going to happen yet.
3469712	3473915	They just said it's going to ship sometime in Ubisoft's 08-09 fiscal year.
3473955	3475677	So that could be any time between now and forever.
3477178	3481301	Our chatroom, seriously, sorry, not to discount your story, but our chatroom, fucking geniuses.
3481461	3482042	They're brilliant.
3482262	3482902	Okay, here it is.
3483142	3489788	They say we're going to sell this as the Orange Companion Bat, and we're going to beat Jamie's copy of Imagine Babies with it.
3491024	3492665	and now it's the beaten companion bat.
3493165	3493805	That's great.
3493885	3494846	Chat room, winner.
3495386	3495986	It'll happen.
3496126	3496826	It'll happen.
3498607	3502569	So, man, I love our chat room.
3503749	3509171	Well, speaking of people who are infinitely awesome, that would be Hideo Kojima.
3510472	3511752	Aha, how's that?
3511852	3512613	Nice transition.
3512693	3514033	I know, I'm awesome tonight.
3514073	3516014	Somebody I would let beat me with an orange bat.
3516454	3518595	I would let him beat me with an orange bat.
3520072	3531259	But he was basically quoted saying that he thinks that there should be more realistic violence in a game so that you can see the consequences of your actions.
3533398	3562664	he's quoted saying I don't think there are many games that tackle violence head on when you hit someone or inflict pain faces get disfigured for example and I want to make games that show that sort of thing if you don't see the pain you can't understand what you've done and you'll pass through battles without taking responsibility for your actions I don't want to ignore that I want players to think even if it's just a little about what violence and war are no pain no game
3563697	3564157	There you go.
3581062	3582963	In Soviet Russia, games shoot you!
3583043	3584604	I think that's a very good idea.
3611584	3613345	That's so dumb.
3613886	3614586	I know, it's horrible.
3615947	3617288	Look, the show's free, folks.
3620130	3622291	Can you believe the Writer's Guild's on strike right now?
3622451	3625093	Rob's on the cutting edge of comedy right now.
3626514	3627755	Shut up and read the next story.
3628455	3636180	Perhaps Yakko Smirnoff is not really the... Anyways.
3637601	3639943	That may not be your kind of thing.
3640851	3648393	But hopefully this is, and I hope to God that they don't fuck this up, because they could easily fuck this up.
3648993	3659636	Apparently, though, there is a placeholder for Iron Chef on the Wii, according to GameStop, and it's supposedly coming out in June sometime.
3661756	3664797	I just hope it's not Iron Chef America, because that show fucking sucks.
3664977	3668438	Oh, hell no, it has to be Cheeseball Original Iron Chef.
3669361	3670342	Then that would be awesome.
3670803	3672304	And it needs to have Chairman Kaga.
3673005	3675988	No, this game needs to have us one of the Iron Chefs, Cooking Mama.
3676889	3678010	That would be winning awesome.
3678471	3679011	That would be.
3680132	3682195	Mama will have to fix your pathetic performance.
3684217	3684817	It would be great.
3685138	3686940	Come on, Iron Chef meets Cooking Mama.
3687060	3688041	It's destined to happen.
3690724	3690984	Anyhow.
3691929	3694150	I guess this was destined to happen at some point too.
3694190	3701234	I'm just surprised it took so long for some website to run a story with the headline, Kid Weez on a Wii.
3703635	3706656	You, sir, are on the cutting edge of comedy.
3706977	3707537	That's right.
3707577	3709478	Speaking of being on the cutting edge of comedy.
3710194	3711575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3734412	3739496	He had to walk through glass and two miles in the snow and the river just to get to school.
3739816	3741197	And molten hot lava.
3741237	3741877	That's right.
3743338	3749683	And they got this Wii and when the four-year-old and the six-year-old started fighting over it, did the kid cry?
3750023	3750303	No.
3750403	3751684	Did he go to his room and pout?
3751844	3752164	No.
3752805	3753485	What did he do?
3754326	3754926	He peed on it.
3755226	3756687	He broke out his Wii and weed on the Wii.
3756707	3757188	That's right.
3757228	3761931	He weed on the Wii and reporters everywhere rejoiced that they can finally use that in a headline.
3762830	3764591	I'm just surprised it took so damn long, honestly.
3764711	3769114	Well, his kids are fucking misbehaved anyways if they're pissing on stuff in their house.
3769694	3777399	And let alone geniuses that are pissing on stuff that's connected to the wall with electricity running through it.
3777479	3780001	He's four years old, therefore not very smart.
3780441	3782643	I only wish that he had gotten electrocuted.
3783784	3785264	Still, you need to teach kid a lesson.
3785304	3786005	Rub his nose in it.
3786085	3789067	Kid wheeze on wee, wee kills kid.
3790188	3790748	Awesome.
3790768	3791368	That's bad.
3791428	3792089	He's four!
3792109	3792189	Four!
3792870	3793410	But still.
3793751	3794031	Hey!
3795232	3795512	Still.
3795993	3797033	Survival of the fittest.
3797434	3798114	And smartest.
3800957	3804780	When I was four, I knew it was not okay to piss on the electric fence, okay?
3807122	3809463	Yeah, so when I was four, I was told not to eat the yellow snow.
3810064	3813367	So, you know, a lot of us, you know... It doesn't snow here, Rob.
3813607	3816769	It does up the hill a little bit, where we would sometimes travel to.
3817170	3817930	Okay, fine.
3818130	3818851	Alright, anyhow...
3821673	3824718	SonOfDad in chat says, did they both pee on the Wii?
3825059	3826381	Don't cross the streams.
3827623	3828044	Anyhow.
3834901	3837944	DarkSakura and Linus, what game have you selected as the Classic Game of the Week this week?
3859480	3872883	The classic game of the week is Gunstar Heroes, which was a release on the Sega Genesis and is also by one of my favorite game developing companies ever, Treasure.
3873864	3874924	Treasure is awesome.
3874964	3882146	Treasure gave us Silhouette Mirage and Killing the Twist and Mischief Makers and all kinds of fun games too.
3884156	3891418	But Gunstar Heroes is one of the top ones, and it's actually, I think, my husband's favorite game.
3892778	3897800	It's a side-scrolling shooter that has, like, a bajillion boss fights in it, oh my god.
3897880	3900720	Like, you play for five seconds, boss fight!
3901120	3903581	Five more seconds, boss fight.
3903801	3907022	You have, your life is actually calculated...
3908194	3913055	Numerically so that you have to take multiple hits, but when you die, you die.
3913075	3917056	You continue or start at that point.
3917316	3919297	You also get customizable weapons.
3919537	3927979	You start off with... You can combine two of the four different weapons to make different unique weapons.
3928239	3934920	And it actually spawns a sequel, which was Gunstar Super Heroes.
3935200	3936621	It's awful.
3936681	3937381	Stupid puns.
3938630	3940431	We have flies in the building again.
3940631	3945013	Yes, while the storms are going on, the flies are like, ooh, it's warm in the studio.
3945713	3953336	But Gunstar Superheroes came out on Game Boy Advance, which was a pretty cool, really hand-made thing.
3954336	3954717	And then...
3956494	3969665	A couple years ago, Sega put out a Sega Ages collection that was called The Treasure Box, which had Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, and Alien Soldier in the collection.
3970105	3973088	It's a really cool game, and I think one of Treasure's best games.
3974215	3981717	And for everyone always bitching that DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week is too obscure and hard to find, here's one that you can download on the Wii Virtual Console.
3981877	3981977	Yes.
3981997	3982578	Very easily.
3982638	3987299	That was when we were playing yesterday on Virtual Console.
3987479	3989340	And I was like, hey, that sounds familiar.
3989360	3991640	And Dan was like, it's because it's Gunstar Heroes.
3991820	3992180	Duh.
3992200	3993741	And I'm like, oh, yeah.
3994121	3996262	And so he was playing the hell out of that.
3996282	3999683	So Gunstar Heroes is like one of the best games ever.
4000183	4000403	All right.
4000423	4000903	So there it is.
4000923	4003304	Your Classic Game of the Week at Gunstar Heroes.
4003344	4004004	And the treasure of
4005014	4005614	by Treasure.
4005715	4010378	I'm sure at some point before this segment is retired, every Treasure game will have come up at one point.
4011639	4012099	Maybe not.
4012119	4013560	There's a few I'm not too big on.
4013741	4014021	All right.
4014381	4014841	Just about.
4015642	4015882	All right.
4015942	4023828	Anyhow, that's it for Part A. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break, but we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.
4024649	4029632	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4030093	4034396	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
