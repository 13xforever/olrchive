00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:14,730
[SPEAKER_07]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 6th of 2008.

5
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Feels a little weird to be saying that, 2008.

6
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:29,393
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

7
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:54,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they just kind of, they briefly went over everything.

8
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:58,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They were talking a little bit about some mobile platforms and stuff like that.

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, actually, that's what they're talking about a new telephone service right now.

10
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:15,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, I guess their sync service, you know, the one that you keep seeing the commercials for, is basically going to be ripping off OnStar, including, you know, if you get in an accident, sync will call, you know, 911, you know, and then play them a song or something.

11
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,595
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they'll tell them that you've been in an accident and get...

12
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming-related stuff.

13
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:24,856
[SPEAKER_09]: They've announced a whole lot of stuff.

14
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:28,118
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple things they announced, of course.

15
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:33,661
[SPEAKER_09]: They've sold 17.7 million units worldwide so far to date.

16
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:39,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Did $3.5 billion in business through November.

17
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, of course, past the 10 million member mark on live.

18
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:55,014
[SPEAKER_09]: They did announce that their Xbox Live video marketplace is going to have some new additions, including ABC and Disney are going to be bringing their TV shows to live.

19
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:58,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to get Lost and Desperate Housewives.

20
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Lost, Desperate Housewives, that kind of stuff.

21
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

22
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:07,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding MGM movies as well that are going to be coming out.

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,684
[SPEAKER_09]: In the UK, they're going to be offering their medium room service, which is like their IPTV and that kind of thing.

24
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:22,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, there's going to be a company, British Telecommunication, I think, BT.

25
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:27,152
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be partnering with them to use the 360 as a set-top box.

26
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:29,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, you'll be able to watch TV, I guess, through that.

27
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of neat.

28
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,935
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have no...

29
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:36,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.

30
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,508
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still going on.

31
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:43,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now they're doing some phone service and they're showing... What was the thing you were talking about?

32
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:52,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Right when we were doing the music break between Part A and B here live, you were mentioning something about a Zune MySpace type thing?

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they have the Zune Social.

34
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:58,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be basically a part of their website.

35
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,965
[SPEAKER_09]: You can create your own page.

36
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll have your

37
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Zune pick and your Zune tag and that kind of stuff.

38
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:17,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll basically show all your stats, kind of what you're listening to, your top three songs, songs that you've flagged as your favorites, that kind of thing.

39
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Customers will be able to go through there.

40
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's last FM for your Zune.

41
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:22,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of, yeah.

42
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,549
[SPEAKER_09]: You can listen to songs that other people are listening to.

43
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:30,730
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy those songs and you can visit their friends and listen to songs and that kind of thing.

44
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

45
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,668
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46
00:03:50,973 --> 00:04:01,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about being able to hook everything up between the TV, your Windows PC, your mobile PC, your Zoom, etc.

47
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

48
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:09,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Sakuramax is in our chat right now at chat.orangeonline.com and really doesn't give a shit about anything you're saying, Loki.

49
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,363
[SPEAKER_06]: What Sakuramax wants to know is how many copies of Eye of Judgment have moved?

50
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:15,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we really want the update on.

51
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:15,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

52
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:18,785
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't gotten the new MPD numbers yet.

53
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,711
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not close to a million yet, are we?

54
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:23,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't even broke 100,000 yet.

55
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:25,054
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

56
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and go back to the gaming news then.

57
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki will keep one eye on the Consumer Electronics Show speech and let us know.

58
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Just break in.

59
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,900
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything really big is announced, just break in.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,780
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

62
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, let's start things off.

63
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a little bit surprising.

64
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:45,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Nintendo is no longer shipping the Wavebird to stores right now.

65
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:47,727
[SPEAKER_09]: They have kind of phased out that system.

66
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:55,482
[SPEAKER_09]: No word, though, if, you know, I guess... I really wish that they would just allow the classic controller to play GameCube games.

67
00:04:55,582 --> 00:05:01,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would make things a lot easier, because it's a pain in the ass to have to have a GameCube controller to play GameCube games and stuff.

68
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:02,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

69
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:11,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, right now, apparently there's no other way, you know, to play your classic games on the virtual console if you don't have a GameCube controller.

70
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you could buy a wired controller, but, um, or one of those third-party...

71
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,250
[SPEAKER_09]: controllers that's like a WaveBird, like I have.

72
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,213
[SPEAKER_06]: The WaveBird is an amazing piece of hardware, too.

73
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:25,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, everybody knows that it's like a really great game controller.

74
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:32,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it was obviously, you know, it was wireless, kind of before you had the Xbox 360 wireless and PS3, you know, 6-axis or whatever.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a great peripheral.

76
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird that it's going away now before Smash Bros.

77
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:38,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Melee is out.

78
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you were hoping to control Smash Bros.

79
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Melee with a WaveBird, you better get your hands on it if you don't already have one.

80
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:44,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got mine.

81
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have one, sadly.

82
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,971
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I was talking about, real quick, just to break in with the CES stuff.

83
00:05:50,991 --> 00:06:00,514
[SPEAKER_09]: They were talking about how, I guess, this new phone service that they're doing, I think it's called Tell Me.

84
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It will actually allow you to use your phone.

85
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, say, for example, it has GPS and stuff.

86
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:11,897
[SPEAKER_09]: You walk up to a theater, it will show you on the phone what's playing there and that kind of stuff and all the information.

87
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:12,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy tickets.

88
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:26,009
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the other things that they're showing is you can actually use your phone's camera to point in that building and get directions to how to get to the building, what the building is, and that kind of stuff.

89
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,691
[SPEAKER_09]: It will know, I guess.

90
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:29,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaky.

91
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of freaky.

92
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:34,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty soon it's going to be the Jetsons, flying cars, video phones, all that stuff.

93
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,698
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have video phones.

94
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:37,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we kind of do.

95
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,541
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do teleconferencing.

96
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know, actually, I'll say this.

97
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but I gotta say, this is pretty awesome.

98
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I mentioned this last week.

99
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:51,041
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I couldn't have, because the New Year's thing happened after last week.

100
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:55,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a little New Year's get-together here at the place.

101
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:57,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane is obviously a good friend of mine.

102
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Meek Latavi's been on the show before.

103
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,961
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't live here anymore because Konami folded in the Bay Area, so he went back to Kansas.

104
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,722
[SPEAKER_06]: He's back there, and he couldn't come to the party.

105
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:13,584
[SPEAKER_06]: But we got on the Xbox 360 cam, and I hooked up the cam, and so we could all wave at him through the camera.

106
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking on the phone with him at the same time because he doesn't have a headset or whatever.

107
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's kind of like a way for him to kind of see everybody without actually being here.

108
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought that was really neat, you know, and that's kind of a video phone in that regard.

109
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:34,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of what I was thinking because even now a lot of cameras like, you know, that one's got, doesn't that one have a microphone on it?

110
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, EyeSight?

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:35,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:42,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So, really all you need is a camera with a microphone and speaker and there you go.

113
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:49,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the equivalent you had with the Xbox camera and being on the phone.

114
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:54,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too far off to being an everyday thing available in the home, I think.

115
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

116
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of surprising we're not already there.

117
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:01,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember that was a big thing they always talked about in the 80s and 90s was the video phone.

118
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:02,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

119
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more, I think, something that they've put more in a business-oriented type market, though.

120
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've worked at places that had video teleconferencing, so.

121
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:14,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya was asking if we were playing Strip Uno.

122
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,076
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

123
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:15,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Perv.

124
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:50,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do bring up a good point because I have joked on this program that Strip Uno is really the only reason to have an Xbox 360 cam right now.

125
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I found another decent use for it, so there you go.

126
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:55,919
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

127
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:24,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the smacketh was laid downeth, and you cannot actually download full DS games coming to the Wii.

128
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,910
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not in the future.

129
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:35,035
[SPEAKER_06]: What is in the future, however, is what Japan already has, the DS demos being downloaded from your Wii to the Nintendo DS, which I think we all saw coming.

130
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,557
[SPEAKER_06]: That functionality is almost already there to an extent.

131
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:46,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't download them yet, but if you own a copy of Geometry Wars Galaxies, you can actually beam a copy of Geometry Wars DS version to your DS.

132
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So that functionality is already there in some games.

133
00:09:51,543 --> 00:10:06,669
[SPEAKER_06]: But no full DS games at this time, which is fine because that would mean there would have to be a whole other memory unit, which means they would probably unleash a... I'll bet you anything if they do remodel the DS, a new DS remodel is going to come out with some type of onboard memory so they can do that.

134
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:08,169
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

135
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't surprise me.

136
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:09,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

137
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:29,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, someone decided to be original, as I say this in humongous quote fingers, and bring out a peripheral for the cell phone to play different games on that is called a Z-Mote, put out by the company called Z2.

138
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Bluetooth.

139
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:34,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks just like the Wiimote, only smaller.

140
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It fits directly in your palm.

141
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:43,262
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Nintendo Wiimote, isn't the button on the Wiimote referred to as the Z button?

142
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the Z button in games?

143
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:00,747
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nunchuck, it's the Z button.

144
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought.

145
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:06,591
[SPEAKER_06]: When you do a little ground pound in Mario Galaxy, that's the Z button you're hitting, right?

146
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this isn't going to be a lawsuit at all or anything.

147
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:09,293
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

148
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:11,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but it's black.

149
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well then that makes all the difference.

150
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it's matte.

151
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:15,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not shiny.

152
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, shit.

153
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That just means the parts are cheaper.

154
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:23,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

155
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

156
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, seriously, what games are you going to play on your cell phone with this?

157
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:28,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

158
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:30,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, kids.

159
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:36,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you're trying to play Pac-Man, because I can tell you from experience that Super Pac-Man on a cell phone is damn near impossible.

160
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:37,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really.

161
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:43,322
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that's damn near impossible is to get a damn game that's not censored in some way.

162
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:47,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, Metal Slug 3 has been censored in the U.S.

163
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: on Xbox Live Arcade.

164
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:53,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of spewing streams of blood in the zombie stage,

165
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:59,982
[SPEAKER_09]: You spew streaming something, some white substance.

166
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,223
[SPEAKER_09]: White substance, that's even worse, I think.

167
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:03,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Semen.

168
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:09,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you shoot streams of semen.

169
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:13,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways... That's even grosser than blood.

170
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:19,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to fix it so that there's blood again, all you have to do is just...

171
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:21,999
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

172
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug 3 Metal Gear 3

173
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:11,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The zombie stage is like my freaking favorite in the whole game.

174
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:24,070
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, the news about a desensitized version of Metal Slug and the fact that things have to be toned down for us here in America because we can't handle the blood, that just incites rage within us.

175
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you guys, but it motivates us to do a little segment here we call the FUs of the Week.

176
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, my FUs are multiple fold.

177
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:54,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, first is, uh, to being sick because I lost two days of work.

178
00:13:55,024 --> 00:14:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I got sick pay forms, that's okay, but... I just, I turn into a big emo mess whenever I'm really, really sick.

179
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:11,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm just so tired all the time, so I was really just crabby and upset and I hated it.

180
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm feeling better today, but...

181
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back to work tomorrow and on top of that I have to go in early but it's a good reason why I'm going in early because I'm going to my school tomorrow to see how close I am to graduating I might actually qualify for yet my ninth change of major since starting my college career ten years ago and also an F you goes to my right hand middle finger because I've started developing the symptoms of trigger finger in that one as well

182
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:50,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that I might have actually injured something instead of it being some sort of naturally causing thing.

183
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:56,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Because normally Sugarfinger sets in if you're older or do a lot of heavy pulling with your hands and I don't do either.

184
00:14:57,348 --> 00:15:01,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I push and I type and that's about it and that's not what causes Sugarfinger.

185
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get to go back and get another shot in my hand which is going to be fun.

186
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the end.

187
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have anything you want to F you?

188
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:17,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really mad at much of anything other than the really crappy drivers for the NVIDIA cards.

189
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:31,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the latest graphics driver that they have now, for whatever reason, when my system boots up, it keeps flashing black every now and then, and I basically have to switch my resolution down to something lower than switch back up to normal, and it stops.

190
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know why it's doing that, because the older drivers didn't do it.

191
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, so that sucks.

192
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,492
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that kind of really sucks...

193
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:44,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there wasn't really much more announcements, I guess, at CES.

194
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,495
[SPEAKER_09]: At least the Microsoft thing.

195
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:48,176
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

196
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: No Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.

197
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:51,856
[SPEAKER_09]: They're done.

198
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,037
[SPEAKER_09]: They just basically had Slash come on stage and they played some Guitar Hero 3.

199
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:57,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame!

200
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the way an episode of Scooby-Doo would end?

201
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:02,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

202
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash just comes out and everybody rocks out.

203
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a big party.

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty retarded.

205
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

206
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,942
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to whoever stole our garbage can.

207
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,623
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no fucking garbage can now, thanks to the storm.

208
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if God stole it, Mother Nature, or one of the neighbors.

209
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

210
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,265
[SPEAKER_06]: We are missing a fucking garbage can.

211
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's freaky, because, like, where are we going to put the trash?

212
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Call them up.

213
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,406
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.

214
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:28,687
[SPEAKER_06]: This is scary.

215
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:29,867
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a scary notion.

216
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:31,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I still give an FU to that.

217
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:36,089
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Robert M. would like to point out the irony in our chat room.

218
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,990
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dark Sakura gave the finger to her finger.

219
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:41,559
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

220
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says, Sky, perhaps it was stolen by a bum?

221
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the scary thing.

222
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:04,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe it was stolen by a bum, but seriously, why does a bum need a fucking trash can?

223
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:09,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And seriously, why would he hike this far into this, like, development here to steal a trash can?

224
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And why not steal the recycle bin?

225
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:11,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bigger.

226
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,498
[SPEAKER_09]: My guess is it blew away.

227
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:18,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It blew away in the storm, and someone said, hey, free trash can!

228
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:22,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what day, was it the day when he had all the trash cans out the curb?

229
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:23,525
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't the same day.

230
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:24,286
[SPEAKER_06]: We brought them back up.

231
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well that's weird.

232
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is very weird.

233
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,312
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we have no idea.

234
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the weirdest thing ever.

235
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:33,375
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you store your trash cans behind the fence.

236
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:38,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, we'll be doing that from now on, but still, kind of weird, nonetheless.

237
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:41,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I don't understand.

238
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,312
[SPEAKER_06]: If a bum took it because they wanted to, I don't know, live in it or whatever.

239
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:45,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you live in a trash can?

240
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Oscar the Grouch steal my can?

241
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Oscar the Grouch need a new home?

242
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did he not take the... There's three cans.

243
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,442
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a recycle, there's a lawn, and a garbage.

244
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:58,903
[SPEAKER_06]: The garbage one is the smallest.

245
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he lives in a garbage can.

246
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck you, Oscar the Grouch.

247
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:07,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

248
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:10,719
[SPEAKER_06]: ACTION GENRAS

249
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:42,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually announced in Game for Windows Magazine, so this is something for PC gamers.

250
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:48,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being created by Chris Taylor, or I guess he's spearheading it or what have you.

251
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:56,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently it's supposed to be inspired in part by Warcraft 3's modification, Defense of the Ancients.

252
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:03,330
[SPEAKER_09]: From the screenshots, it looked almost like an RTS version of Shadow of the Colossus.

253
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

254
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:09,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have like these Titan things that look like, you know.

255
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:16,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I always like hearing about these games that combine these very interesting types of genres, like RPGs and action.

256
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:17,723
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be kind of interesting.

257
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, almost every game's an action game.

258
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:23,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it kind of makes me think of Kingdom Hearts as like RPG mixed with action, right?

259
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just kind of interested to see what this is.

260
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just think more of an RTS game.

261
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:29,746
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it basically looked like.

262
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,126
[SPEAKER_09]: RTS game, I guess, where you're,

263
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:39,966
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, no release date announced yet.

264
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:42,948
[SPEAKER_06]: All we know is that Demigod is coming soon.

265
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the almighty soon, right?

266
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:50,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Rockstar is going to be...

267
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:52,558
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

268
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is it, like the original Grand Theft Auto?

269
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:27,187
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.

270
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:28,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take it.

271
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: The first Grand Theft Auto game, and the second I believe, are available free on their website.

272
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right, they did that some time ago, I forgot about that.

273
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if you want to play those, because I remember the original Grand Theft Auto, that game was fun.

274
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing like what it is today.

275
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:46,174
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not at all.

276
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:47,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very different.

277
00:20:48,617 --> 00:21:07,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, anyways, uh, let's see here, Just Cause 2 was announced, released some details about it, uh, they're gonna be, I don't know, getting rid of some of the side quests, I guess, in the game, to kind of simplify it a little bit more, make it more, um, I don't know, straightforward.

278
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:13,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're saying that they've identified the key areas that they want to improve for Just Cause 2.

279
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,783
[SPEAKER_09]: They just want to make better use of the huge game world, enhance the stunts, improve the combat, and reward exploration.

280
00:21:20,883 --> 00:21:24,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I don't understand how you can reward exploration but get rid of some of the side quests.

281
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:27,887
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of counterintuitive.

282
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:51,412
[SPEAKER_09]: but apparently the game is not going to be set on the island of San Espirito anymore it's going to be a tropical paradise in Southeast Asia but it will still have Rico Rodriguez as the lead character I don't know, I didn't really play Just Cause I played the demo a lot, that was fun

283
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:58,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that game had a few glitches where you can fly a plane underwater, but, you know, other than that, it looked pretty cool.

284
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold pretty good for a first, you know, a new IP, right?

285
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:03,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it might be one I might pick up.

286
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:08,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually might pick up the original, because I think it's dirt cheap right about now.

287
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:09,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is dirt cheap.

288
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I saw it in a bargain bin the other day.

289
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:11,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

290
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:22,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this isn't coming to a bargain bin anytime soon because the latest and greatest piece of technology for you PC gamers is a brand new video card, NVIDIA's GeForce 9800GX2.

291
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:27,856
[SPEAKER_06]: A blog called HardOCP has gotten a peek at the new card.

292
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:33,882
[SPEAKER_06]: This card is coming out in late February, early March-ish, and it's basically going to replace NVIDIA's

293
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:35,170
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

294
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:57,853
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

295
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:30,860
[SPEAKER_09]: are nowhere near what Nvidia's are, and because of that, Nvidia doesn't really have any competition, so they keep re-releasing their old cards with slightly better processors and that kind of stuff.

296
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So this, essentially, is just two graphics cards shoved on the one card, is what it basically is.

297
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:48,486
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like your Core 2, or the quads that they have, the Intel chips, they're not really a quad-core processor, it's just two Core 2 Duos on one processor.

298
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:50,122
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

299
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:08,827
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

300
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:39,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that I've got one that's 13 inches?

301
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid good money for it, too.

302
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:44,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you did.

303
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I want to know, Loki.

304
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it make WoW run better?

305
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, WoW will run on pretty much anything.

306
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It really will, but it's kind of choppy.

307
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:58,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it make freaking Tabula Rasa run better?

308
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I tried playing a demo of that, and it did not run very well on my computer.

309
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:02,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

310
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:04,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is strange, because it's not like my computer is that old.

311
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Game's a memory hog.

312
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,148
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we do something else, Rob?

313
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,589
[SPEAKER_06]: How about we do some emails?

314
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:18,191
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to get to the mailbag, but something you kids should be thinking about, because it's coming up very soon, not too far after the mailbag.

315
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:24,113
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to bring back a game we haven't done in a long time tonight on the program, and that is Listless.

316
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:27,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're actually going to be looking for a caller in a little while.

317
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet, but we're going to be looking for a caller to play with us.

318
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:34,237
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Listless, and tonight's topic, so you can start thinking about... Well...

319
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:35,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll save that.

320
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep that a secret.

321
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Save it.

322
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you call in right now, Rob will tell us who it is and we'll laugh.

323
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,057
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not going to do that right now.

324
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I am kind of wondering.

325
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:50,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I should get someone to participate in Listless with us so I can tell them the topics so they can start thinking of their list because we don't want to have to come up with it on the spot.

326
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:51,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to say this.

327
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,560
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to participate in Listless tonight and you're available on Skype.

328
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,481
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a trivia question to answer by private message?

329
00:25:58,781 --> 00:25:59,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I like that.

330
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:01,382
[SPEAKER_06]: A trivia question to answer by private message.

331
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

332
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:03,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

333
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you gotta do mails.

334
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:05,405
[SPEAKER_06]: They should probably send it to me.

335
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:06,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, send it to Rob.

336
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:07,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, send it to me.

337
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:07,946
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work for Rob.

338
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,247
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the trivia question?

339
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:09,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything I want?

340
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:14,511
[SPEAKER_06]: How about... I hope you pick something I know the answer to.

341
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:17,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, if you don't know the answer to, I'll tell you anyway.

342
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:18,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

343
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:20,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

344
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make it too hard.

345
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:22,636
[SPEAKER_06]: We want somebody to play.

346
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be easy.

347
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:23,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What's my favorite color?

348
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:26,019
[SPEAKER_06]: What's DarkSakura's favorite color?

349
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

350
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:26,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

351
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, send me a private message with what you think DarkSakura's favorite color is.

352
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: and the first person to get it will play listless with us tonight.

353
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:37,091
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be fun.

354
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell them the topics they can think of their list.

355
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so send a private message to Skye.

356
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, DarkSakura's going to open up the old mailbag and get to work.

357
00:26:44,874 --> 00:26:45,694
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just four.

358
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a fifth one was a thank you.

359
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:52,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Rob, thank you.

360
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:53,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're welcome.

361
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:54,277
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I do?

362
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:56,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

363
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:57,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're welcome.

364
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one comes from...

365
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:07,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say Ryan, who put his full name on here, and I don't read out everybody's full names.

366
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, Hey guys, I was wondering if the Operator 11 feeds on OLR can be downloaded to a computer or a PSP.

367
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:15,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock on, Dragon Force.

368
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, not right now.

369
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as we have... Sorry.

370
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:27,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

371
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:32,750
[SPEAKER_04]: As we've stated earlier, Operator 11 is having mental retardation.

372
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, technical difficulties, so we're not going to say much more about them, right?

373
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving forward, the next email comes from Martin.

374
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin?

375
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR Crew.

376
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:53,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to ask your opinion about a gaming cliché that I think is really, really outdated.

377
00:27:53,746 --> 00:28:02,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I constantly hear many game reviewers and game podcasters talk about how kids are always trying to explain game systems and gaming to parents buying the current-gen systems.

378
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:10,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it really must be pointed out that these supposed naive parents grew up with gaming in their lives, starting with the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES,

379
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: and many kept gaming since they started, myself including.

380
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing up in the 80s, yes, it was sometimes a challenge to teach a parent about what a gaming system could do and their relevance, but gaming has been well established in almost every living room since the 1980s.

381
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think that this need to explain to a parent about what a PlayStation or Nintendo Wii is

382
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,812
[SPEAKER_04]: is really outdated and just plain foolish to think.

383
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: A good portion of all of us oldsters have and continue to game and in some cases know more than their kids about gaming.

384
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:43,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy into the hype.

385
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,743
[SPEAKER_04]: The only parents that do not know what video games are will never get it because they choose not to know about it.

386
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin and all your friends at bunchofdorks.com Nice name for a website, by the way.

387
00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:56,549
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fantastic.

388
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything to say about that?

389
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I was monitoring the trivia question.

390
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:06,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Summarize for me.

391
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, basically saying that, you know, since there have been video games for as long as many of the people out there have, I guess, grown up and are now parents themselves.

392
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So there shouldn't be any excuse for a parent not to be aware of what a system is or what it does.

393
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also do think that

394
00:29:32,186 --> 00:30:00,671
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually do agree that they don't know what it is because they choose not to know about it but I think that it's not really the system so much themselves as the content that they need to be informed about because when we were little you know games didn't look that major you know what I mean we you know true we had Metal Gear and we had Splatterhouse and but they still it was all cartoony looking you know and now it's so realistic that I think that

395
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:04,596
[SPEAKER_04]: There does need to be a degree of caution on the part of the parents.

396
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that case, I can see how they might be naive or misinformed or uninformed.

397
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it's the system so much that people really need a lot of education on.

398
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:19,347
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

399
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we finally got a winner of our stupid trivia thing.

400
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not guess.

401
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:27,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, it took forever.

402
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

403
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:30,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've made any

404
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Secret about it.

405
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:33,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So, next email.

406
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's to me.

407
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, which person sent in that last email?

408
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was... I closed it.

409
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:45,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Martin from a bunch of dorks dot com.

410
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:46,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

411
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:47,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember.

412
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I read this email earlier in the week.

413
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

414
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear I was paying attention to the chat room.

415
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:53,530
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, no.

416
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny about this?

417
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,773
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was reading this, I kind of thought to myself, I was like, okay, as far as the Atari 2600 generation goes,

418
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:02,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody had that.

419
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,584
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

420
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:06,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us were lucky enough to experience that.

421
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:11,326
[SPEAKER_06]: But even, I think, Atari 2600, not everybody in our generation necessarily experienced.

422
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:15,807
[SPEAKER_06]: It was still kind of something that only certain kids on the block had.

423
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:20,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some parts of the country, you weren't as able to find these as easily.

424
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It was still kind of a luxury item.

425
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:22,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put it that way.

426
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:25,090
[SPEAKER_06]: As video games are in general today.

427
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,331
[SPEAKER_06]: But even when I say luxury item, you know...

428
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,252
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

429
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:56,400
[SPEAKER_06]: places in your generation where you were able to have this luxury item, where I think a lot of parents, or people that are now parents, weren't exposed to this when they were young.

430
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:07,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevertheless, even if they were, they remember video games as being Pac-Man, Combat, and not Grand Theft Auto or Manhunt.

431
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It was much different back then.

432
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the case with a lot of them is that

433
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone has been, you know, the hardcore gamer type that, you know, like me and my husband and our person who emailed us or any of us in this room that, you know, once we, you know, grew up and started working, you know, oh, well, that's child stuff.

434
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:29,173
[SPEAKER_04]: We put it away.

435
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do it anymore.

436
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:31,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are more enlightened.

437
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:37,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's as, you know, fine as a recreation item as any.

438
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And we understand that.

439
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:45,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's always been, I think, when they were growing up with that type of thing, oh, well, you're still doing that?

440
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:53,617
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom still says that to me, and I'm like, okay, you sat and played my Nintendo as much as I did when I had it, so what's your excuse?

441
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And now she wants a Wii.

442
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

443
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,122
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom wants a Wii.

444
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:00,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's cute.

445
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But at any rate, that's where I think the difference comes in.

446
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:08,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's right.

447
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Those who don't know, it's because they choose not to know.

448
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,581
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't educated themselves.

449
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all surprised, too.

450
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have a right to be.

451
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:21,225
[SPEAKER_06]: We can move on now.

452
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:21,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

453
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry I was not paying attention fully the first time.

454
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this makes me feel slightly better.

455
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:27,388
[SPEAKER_04]: J-Rod emailed.

456
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:31,390
[SPEAKER_04]: The one who has a really cool quote about Olive Garden.

457
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:39,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DarkSakura, I know this isn't exactly a gaming question, but you said you get a sinus infection every single year for New Year's Eve.

458
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm in the same boat as you, except whenever I have something like a concert to go to, I'll get a sinus infection without question.

459
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:50,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone could ask me to go see a concert tomorrow and I'll develop a sinus infection overnight.

460
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:51,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Woe is us.

461
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, for me, I always get...

462
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the Olive Garden is the shit.

463
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:00,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget never-ending breadsticks.

464
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,820
[SPEAKER_04]: We should just go for salad one day.

465
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to, you know, because you want to come over for movie night because I have to show you Stardust because I love that movie so much.

466
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do Olive Garden that night.

467
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,428
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not completely broke.

468
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do dinner at the Olive Garden.

469
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:32,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

470
00:34:33,092 --> 00:34:33,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeehaw!

471
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

472
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:39,138
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't pay, it'll be my treat because I want never-ending breadsticks.

473
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

474
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get you after my payday.

475
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

476
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:42,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to Indian again.

477
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

478
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:46,703
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole time I was sick, all I wanted was Indian food.

479
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:47,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, Ross Steele?

480
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:50,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Dammit, I need to have it out with him for a minute here.

481
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

482
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:57,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Ross Steele, goddammit, you criticize Loki and his, you know, ways, which I, you know, to some extent I agree with you.

483
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:57,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

484
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,330
[SPEAKER_06]: You criticize me playing WoW.

485
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I do play too much WoW.

486
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:06,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But I draw the line at you criticizing our love of the Olive Garden.

487
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Olive Garden is great.

488
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:12,318
[SPEAKER_06]: The Olive Garden is wonderful, and damn you for thinking otherwise.

489
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:16,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, although, although, one of these days I'm going to have to take you to Pasquale's.

490
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:19,782
[SPEAKER_04]: They're closed on Monday, but they're open on Tuesday.

491
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you get smited with Zuppa Toscana.

492
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:29,226
[SPEAKER_04]: He should get sangria'd in the eye.

493
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:31,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

494
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,147
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

495
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:35,754
[SPEAKER_06]: May a deep fried ravioli fall from heaven onto your head.

496
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good too.

497
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:36,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I love those.

498
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:42,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, this email is titled Yaris made better by Dragon Force.

499
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey OLR, I made this video on YouTube and got the inspiration from you guys and girl.

500
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:51,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should actually start that segment.

501
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:54,911
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of crappy games out there and someone needs to make them watchable.

502
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:59,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I think you guys are great and I will keep saying that because you are and keep going strong.

503
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: To get the video, search for PKJR92 and I'm saying it out loud so that they know what to look up on YouTube or Yaris or Dragon Force or even OLR.

504
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:12,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely, PKJR92.

505
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:14,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, why not?

506
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

507
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.

508
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:18,823
[SPEAKER_06]: is the quote on there.

509
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard that quote before.

510
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:28,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, I did watch the video, and basically he took the trailer for Yaris, the 30-second trailer for Yaris, and put Dragon Force's music behind it, and it's surprisingly effective.

511
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:29,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We do approve.

512
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:34,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will find the link to that YouTube and post it in chat for you all to look at right now.

513
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:37,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not right right now, but, you know.

514
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:38,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

515
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:39,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one last email in.

516
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear Loki watching it right now.

517
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:41,950
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

518
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:43,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't it make the game better?

519
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:44,551
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one last email in.

520
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:45,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a lot better with it.

521
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: From Sakura Maxx.

522
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR, just mailing to say Happy New Year.

523
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I was running a little late since I didn't have computer access while the New Year special was running.

524
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:58,113
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Sakuramax, the one who hasn't annoyed you people in a while.

525
00:36:58,153 --> 00:36:58,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You happy?

526
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:03,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And a person with MassGamerADD, what to play next.

527
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:06,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there we have it.

528
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:11,720
[SPEAKER_06]: No more emails?

529
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

530
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, sorry, I haven't watched the video.

531
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,247
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just going to add a little thing that says I approve.

532
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:21,589
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, see, now everybody in the chat room is like, you need to go have real Italian food.

533
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had real Italian food.

534
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually went to a little place in Sacramento.

535
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if you guys have heard of this, but I always thought I got a kick out of this.

536
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:34,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Español, which means Spain, but it has really good Italian food.

537
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's real Italian places all over.

538
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:41,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there are really, really good places in New York, though, and that's where they're offering to take me.

539
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to say no, especially if you're buying.

540
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:44,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyhow.

541
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:50,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send emails, maybe profess your love for the Olive Garden here on this program.

542
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

543
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:55,351
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if we're not the weather podcast, we're the food podcast.

544
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:55,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God.

545
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything but games.

546
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:58,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be our new tagline.

547
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:00,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything but games.

548
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:01,794
[SPEAKER_04]: We're tired of games.

549
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:02,195
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

550
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing games for like six years.

551
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for something new, don't you think?

552
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

553
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,840
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into tonight's listless.

554
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I'll let you go first.

555
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:13,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

556
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:14,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

557
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:16,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

558
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:26,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you've been playing Team Fortress 2, you may have been noticing that there are some achievements missing for one of the classes you can play, and that would be the Medic.

559
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:37,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to be fixed, hopefully pretty soon, because a German site was listing some brand new achievements, 36 new ones, actually, for the Medic.

560
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:38,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's kind of neat.

561
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:47,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other ones here, they had Heal Under Fire, which is healing somebody while on fire.

562
00:38:48,921 --> 00:39:01,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here, they have one for healing an engineer, healing teammates who've called for a medic, Ubering a friend, and they have some other fun stuff like...

563
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:08,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Bone Saw Spy Caller, or I'm assuming that's Killer, killing an enemy spy with a bone saw.

564
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:13,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I'm going to interrupt this story to show you the fly swimming for his life in my coffee right now.

565
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:18,380
[SPEAKER_09]: That fly is going to be totally hyped up on caffeine.

566
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,281
[SPEAKER_06]: The more he swims, the more hyper he gets.

567
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But goddammit, that just ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee.

568
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:24,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Go flies!

569
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:25,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Asshole.

570
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:26,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Asshole fly.

571
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:36,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, hopefully we'll see some of those soon, maybe in an update or something.

572
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:40,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the chatroom is like, Rob's derailing the show tonight.

573
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:40,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

574
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to say this, though.

575
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:49,923
[SPEAKER_06]: The native Spanish speakers in chatroom are yelling at me and screaming at me, and I should know better, but I only had two years of high school Spanish.

576
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:52,244
[SPEAKER_06]: España is Spain.

577
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Español is a Spaniard.

578
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:55,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Spanish.

579
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know any Spanish.

580
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew that.

581
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sorry.

582
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

583
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Donde Esta El Bano.

584
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I remember.

585
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:10,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody on Ragnarok last night was spamming with Donde Esta La Biblioteca.

586
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, they're telling me to drink the coffee.

587
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,434
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking gross.

588
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:15,755
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is wrong with you people?

589
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say that you are.

590
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:18,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

591
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,676
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a camera.

592
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:21,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, I'm drinking it right now.

593
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:21,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm.

594
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's so gross!

595
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, why are you doing that?

596
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:27,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that fly in my throat.

597
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:28,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so weird.

598
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, he's turning into a fly now.

599
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,894
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so crazy.

600
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is how we're starting off 2008, huh?

601
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear everybody, Rob is crazy.

602
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:43,478
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

603
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get away with much more when Op 11 isn't running.

604
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:48,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll never have a webcam again.

605
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get away with a lot of stuff over here because the camera's never on me.

606
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one week I'm going to just surprise you.

607
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:55,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be Jamie Cam.

608
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.

609
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:02,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put that camera up there and put another camera hidden somewhere that's actually the real camera.

610
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's elaborate.

611
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:06,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Candid camera.

612
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:09,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make that the day I throw up on you.

613
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:16,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of folks have been saying this week with all the Xbox Live downtime, I'm just going to go play PlayStation Network.

614
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's network is free.

615
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to go play that.

616
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:28,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Sony has been polling customers in some of their Asian regions on ways that they can improve the PC and PSP PlayStation Store.

617
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,317
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they're polling about?

618
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:32,817
[SPEAKER_06]: A monthly subscription plan.

619
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:34,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

620
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:39,620
[SPEAKER_06]: So, possibly is Sony looking into charging a monthly fee for the PlayStation Network?

621
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,180
[SPEAKER_06]: But, no.

622
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:41,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

623
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,840
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, go ahead.

624
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,981
[SPEAKER_06]: You're wanting to jump at the bit here to say it.

625
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:45,222
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

626
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:45,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

627
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:51,225
[SPEAKER_09]: They're possibly going to be offering a monthly subscription for unlimited download content.

628
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

629
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Game tap for your PSP, basically, but with Sony's games.

630
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:55,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

631
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That actually isn't a bad idea at all.

632
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hand it to Sony if that's the case.

633
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:09,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the trump on that, I guess, is that there isn't really a whole lot of download content on the PlayStation Network.

634
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:19,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be a definite way, though, to ensure income from the service on a regular basis.

635
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:22,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd pay for that for a month, download everything, and then that's it.

636
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wait a few months.

637
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,941
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it's contractual?

638
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:29,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think services like that are usually contractual, are they?

639
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:30,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are.

640
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like GameTap is, and it's month to month.

641
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

642
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well anyhow, I think it's about time for us to have a list list.

643
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,011
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think?

644
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:40,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it list list time?

645
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:41,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

646
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:51,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, list list is the game where we're going to create the definitive list for something.

647
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:56,376
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, lists are big, especially around this time of year as one year has ended and another begins.

648
00:42:56,436 --> 00:42:58,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Lists are big, so we're going to make our own list tonight.

649
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:03,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have a lot of new listeners since the last time we've done this because we used to do this game a lot and we probably haven't played it in like four months.

650
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:10,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way listless works is that we're going to have four panelists, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and our mystery caller.

651
00:43:10,832 --> 00:43:15,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And each of us are going to give you our top three things that will match the list.

652
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:17,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here's the twist.

653
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:20,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Each one of us takes one thing off the list.

654
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:23,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have 12 that gets taken down to eight.

655
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:26,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And so once we're down to eight, then the chat room votes on the top three things.

656
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will bring us the definitive list.

657
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:35,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And tonight's topic for the list, if you'd like to start posting your suggestions in chat, here it is.

658
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:39,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Gadget I'd like to see them announce at Consumer Electronics Show.

659
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:43,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't have to be gaming related, just any type of tech gadget.

660
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:47,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So the gadget you would like to see them announce at the Consumer Electronics Show.

661
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:50,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be real, it can be crazy, anything you want.

662
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it right here, tonight's list list.

663
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:56,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So let us call the person who correctly guessed...

664
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:00,514
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's favorite color.

665
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:03,895
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can find them in the list, I suddenly can't find them.

666
00:44:07,517 --> 00:44:08,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, folks.

667
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:19,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making them call us.

668
00:44:20,323 --> 00:44:21,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about your favorite color.

669
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite color is very, very dark.

670
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very dark.

671
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:28,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um...

672
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:33,181
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's favorite color was black.

673
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:06,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't check out the keynotes or anything, but I like to watch what they got showing.

674
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:08,631
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about what I said earlier in the show?

675
00:45:08,711 --> 00:45:12,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it true that most game nerds are somewhat of tech nerds too?

676
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:13,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They like to see the latest tech stuff?

677
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you kind of have to be, to tell you the truth.

678
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:22,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with the whole next gen that's going on now.

679
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:28,338
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

680
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,321
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick is the Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0.

681
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And why a Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0?

682
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, it would come out just in time for Rez HD.

683
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

684
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:11,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Rez HD is just around the corner.

685
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:12,163
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good idea.

686
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:13,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants to go next?

687
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:14,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go.

688
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?

689
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:21,325
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick is a remote-directed EMP gun for jamming other people's cell phones.

690
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:27,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And why, pray tell, do you need an EMP gun to jam people's cell phones?

691
00:46:27,837 --> 00:46:40,848
[SPEAKER_04]: For people driving like fucking retards on the road while talking with their phone glued to their face, or people in front of me in line at the grocery store too busy talking on their phone to pay attention to what the hell they're doing.

692
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people need to either die in a fire or hang up the phone.

693
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:45,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Or both.

694
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:46,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably.

695
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:46,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd buy it.

696
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's actually a good idea.

697
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:50,742
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll go next.

698
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:51,782
[SPEAKER_06]: My number three pick.

699
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:52,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know if you've ever seen these.

700
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:58,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen those guns at, like, Target or things that shoot the big blast of air at people?

701
00:46:58,425 --> 00:46:59,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the air cannons.

702
00:46:59,485 --> 00:46:59,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Air zookas.

703
00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:01,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Air zookas.

704
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:02,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Air zookas.

705
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:10,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, air zookas are so awesome, but I want them to introduce, like, an air zooka that will actually blow somebody over because it has so much power in it.

706
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to just call it the supreme air zooka.

707
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:22,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how electronic that gadget is, but I would imagine you'd need a little battery power to make that thing work.

708
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, your number three pick.

709
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,863
[SPEAKER_09]: My number three pick would be kind of a sequel to the AIBO.

710
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:35,247
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the AIPER, and it would be a robotic cat.

711
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:36,388
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have those.

712
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:43,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I want one from Sony because I need my cat to be able to spy on my other cat so I can see what's going on.

713
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:45,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony does have an AIBO cat.

714
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:48,394
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a gray one and a white one and a black one.

715
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,774
[SPEAKER_06]: He can put anything he wants on the list.

716
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:51,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You take it off if you don't like it.

717
00:47:51,775 --> 00:47:52,035
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

718
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

719
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:54,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I sloth?

720
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:56,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah.

721
00:47:56,997 --> 00:47:57,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I ferret.

722
00:47:58,058 --> 00:47:58,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I ferret.

723
00:47:58,498 --> 00:47:58,798
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be cool.

724
00:47:58,838 --> 00:47:59,558
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I ferret.

725
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:00,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I ferret.

726
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:01,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I go with I ferret.

727
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,439
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to change it to I ferret.

728
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I ferret.

729
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So AI ferret.

730
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:07,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

731
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:09,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back to you, SSJ100.

732
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:10,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, what is your number two pick?

733
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,824
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick is...

734
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: An Apple handheld gaming system.

735
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:21,747
[SPEAKER_06]: As is the device of many fanboys' dreams.

736
00:48:21,928 --> 00:48:22,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you an Apple fanboy?

737
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:24,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

738
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

739
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, why then, especially from non-fanboys, should Apple announce a handheld gaming system?

740
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:31,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

741
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:35,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there should be another handheld gaming system in general that's not the N-Gage.

742
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,701
[SPEAKER_06]: As RawSteelUT says, the Pippin Boy?

743
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:41,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it would be?

744
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:44,064
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

745
00:48:44,864 --> 00:48:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: A streaming TV for iPhone.

746
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the YouTube channel, but like actual episodes.

747
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say, YouTube's not good enough for you, huh?

748
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:58,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because you can't really find full episodes of stuff on YouTube, and it's like a limited YouTube.

749
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:01,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So they need to have like a show service.

750
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:05,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, because I don't like to sit in front of the TV because that's just boring to me.

751
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have to have other stuff going on.

752
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:10,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So having it on my iPhone...

753
00:49:10,953 --> 00:49:16,757
[SPEAKER_04]: and I could, you know, watch for a little bit and then go do other crap and then come back and finish watching it when I'm done would be perfect for me.

754
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:23,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm actually going to take my number two pick from the chat room because this is a darn good pick and we can be as silly as we want, right?

755
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:32,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to suggest that a portal gun be unveiled as CES so I can have my very own portal gun because seriously, who couldn't use a portal gun?

756
00:49:34,027 --> 00:49:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I could use one all the time.

757
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so portal gun, there you go.

758
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what would be the number two pick for you?

759
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:44,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, my number two pick also happens to come from Portal.

760
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like the Aperture Science Sentry Bot.

761
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:51,044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the ones that say, hello, and then turn the chute at you.

762
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:52,885
[SPEAKER_09]: They're perfect for the neighbors.

763
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:57,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, those things are such assholes, but okay, yeah, those would be good guard dogs.

764
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:02,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised no one said a companion queue, but I guess we haven't gotten to the number ones yet, so let's see.

765
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:07,614
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt, what is the number one thing you would like to see them debut at CES?

766
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:08,154
[SPEAKER_06]: New Gadget.

767
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:12,698
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one pick is the Dreamcast 2.

768
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega fanboy, eh?

769
00:50:18,842 --> 00:50:22,284
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I just want to see another Sega system.

770
00:50:23,205 --> 00:50:28,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really a fanboy, I just think, you know... Don't you think, though, it's about time to let go?

771
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:30,785
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

772
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:32,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

773
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:37,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, DarkSakura, what would be your number one thing you would like to see them announce at CES?

774
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:39,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Portable Xbox Live Arcade.

775
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:42,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Portable Xbox Live Arcade.

776
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a bad choice.

777
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,763
[SPEAKER_06]: What made you decide to go with that?

778
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:46,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

779
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:15,583
[SPEAKER_04]: We were playing that the other night too.

780
00:51:37,605 --> 00:51:39,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Because seriously, holodecks are awesome.

781
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, what would be your number one pick?

782
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Gadget, you'd like to see them unveil at CES.

783
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,853
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one pick has already been said, which was a portal gun.

784
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:47,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoops.

785
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:51,637
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right, because I didn't really have anything that I thought of.

786
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:53,459
[SPEAKER_09]: But this would be kind of cool.

787
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:04,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's not practical in any sense whatsoever, but we haven't seen anything come from George Foreman in a while, so I want a George Foreman grill that I can cook an entire cow on.

788
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:06,658
[SPEAKER_09]: at one time.

789
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:15,282
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

790
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And it needs to clean the cow's guts out for you and everything.

791
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:20,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Self-cleaning.

792
00:52:21,044 --> 00:52:24,626
[SPEAKER_06]: What, pray tell, would the George Foreman entire cow grill be called?

793
00:52:25,286 --> 00:52:27,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be George Foreman's self-cleaning cow grill.

794
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:37,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what to say.

795
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:42,191
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be very hard because this is a very good list of items that we've built tonight.

796
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:45,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab says the mean lean fat reducing cow machine.

797
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:46,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

798
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It would certainly reduce the size of those cows.

799
00:52:50,394 --> 00:52:50,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

800
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:54,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We said anything.

801
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:59,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few of these items are actually gaming related, I'd like to point out, but it fits the theme of our podcast tonight.

802
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:03,659
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, SJ100 Matt, I posted the list there in private message for your reference.

803
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:06,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go ahead and read it as it stands now.

804
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:13,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to kill the music because this is the serious round because we have 12 items on the list but four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

805
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:34,102
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0, Remote EMP Gun for jamming people's cell phones, Supreme Air Zooka, iFerret, Apple Handheld Gaming System, Streaming TV for iPhone, Portal Gun, Aperture Science Sentry Bot, Dreamcast 2, Portable Xbox Live Arcade, Holodeck, and George Foreman Self-Cleaning Cow Grill.

806
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:36,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

807
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:39,702
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100, Matt, what is not worthy of the list?

808
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go with the Airzooka.

809
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:45,403
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a bastard, but that's all right.

810
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's not that electronic, is it?

811
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:48,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

812
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,945
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Supreme Airzooka is not worthy of the list.

813
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:52,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it isn't really an electronic.

814
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I guess you would need electronics in order to build an Agraver person.

815
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:57,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But how awesome would that be?

816
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:58,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, seriously.

817
00:53:58,787 --> 00:54:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DarkSakura, which of these things is not worthy of the list?

818
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:03,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

819
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:09,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say the Apple handheld gaming system.

820
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:15,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I was expecting Loki to do that.

821
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:16,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to.

822
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I think that Microsoft would do it better.

823
00:54:22,082 --> 00:54:22,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap.

824
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:26,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also the iPhone, which in a way they'll probably turn into a gaming system.

825
00:54:26,585 --> 00:54:28,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know there's going to be stuff coming out on that eventually.

826
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:31,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my iPhone, don't get me wrong.

827
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:40,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that when we have a company that's already established for having quality games out now, I think that's only inevitable.

828
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:41,314
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

829
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:42,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've got to get rid of this.

830
00:54:43,276 --> 00:54:44,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry, SSJ100.

831
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, we're picking on you tonight, but Dreamcast 2 is not worthy of the list.

832
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:49,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

833
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,787
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to happen, kids.

834
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:55,832
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the things I listed were never going to happen.

835
00:54:56,432 --> 00:55:02,459
[SPEAKER_06]: A holodeck has a better chance of happening at a future consumer electronics show or Loki's fucking cow grill.

836
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:03,719
[SPEAKER_06]: S.S.J.

837
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: 100's list.

838
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Airsuka got taken off?

839
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:36,238
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know, but the other three, we eliminated SSJ's entire list.

840
00:55:36,738 --> 00:55:37,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I forgot.

841
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:37,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, okay.

842
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,160
[SPEAKER_06]: No, sorry.

843
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way the cookie crumbles.

844
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:43,744
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt, I'm very sorry.

845
00:55:44,605 --> 00:55:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently your choices just weren't worthy tonight.

846
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:47,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

847
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

848
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:49,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to cry about it?

849
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:51,310
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to go cut myself.

850
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:51,830
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

851
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sorry that things didn't go your way tonight.

852
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:59,316
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, because you don't have any items on the list, we'll still let you vote for the winner.

853
00:55:59,357 --> 00:55:59,897
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that sound?

854
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:01,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that sounds good to me.

855
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:03,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything you want to plug before we hang up on you?

856
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, nope.

857
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:07,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

858
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you too.

859
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I like it when they don't have anything to plug.

860
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:13,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor guy.

861
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:15,977
[SPEAKER_06]: He got his whole list eliminated by us three bastards.

862
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,159
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't happen, it hasn't happened very often.

863
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only think of one other time in ListList where somebody's entire list got eliminated.

864
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:24,284
[SPEAKER_09]: They were mad that I took off the ResTrans by Rear 2.0.

865
00:56:24,324 --> 00:56:24,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

866
00:56:27,031 --> 00:56:29,532
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you improve something that vibrates?

867
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:30,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

868
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:31,992
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that complicated.

869
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:32,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor power.

870
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:33,592
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

871
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:34,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here we go.

872
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:38,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We are left with eight choices that have been deemed worthy of the list.

873
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:38,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Here they are.

874
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:42,434
[SPEAKER_06]: The remote EMP gun for jamming people's cell phones.

875
00:56:42,854 --> 00:56:43,715
[SPEAKER_06]: An iFerret.

876
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:45,875
[SPEAKER_06]: A streaming TV for the iPhone.

877
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:46,995
[SPEAKER_06]: A portal gun.

878
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:48,936
[SPEAKER_06]: An Aperture Science Sentry Bot.

879
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:51,056
[SPEAKER_06]: A portable Xbox Live Arcade.

880
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:52,076
[SPEAKER_06]: A holodeck.

881
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:54,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And a George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.

882
00:56:55,237 --> 00:57:00,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Please send in your votes via private message for your number one and number two picks.

883
00:57:00,758 --> 00:57:04,619
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't label them one and two, I will assume that the first one is your number one pick.

884
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:06,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat.

885
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,420
[SPEAKER_06]: You have about ten minutes while we go over these next few stories.

886
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So place your votes now.

887
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:14,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, we get back into the gaming news with DarkSakura.

888
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:19,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our dear friend who is the...

889
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:28,484
[SPEAKER_04]: God of third party peripherals, Mad Catz, making instruments for Rock Band.

890
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:44,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a multi-year licensing agreement with MTV Games to do wired and wireless bass guitars and a percussion set that's got drumsticks and a microphone and stuff.

891
00:57:45,067 --> 00:57:48,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like we're going to be seeing those come out eventually.

892
00:57:50,263 --> 00:57:51,203
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first half of 2008.

893
00:57:53,384 --> 00:57:58,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one place you probably won't be able to get a good deal on those would be at Best Buy.

894
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:03,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently they had a coupon that was in, I guess, one of the local papers.

895
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:12,071
[SPEAKER_09]: For 20% off of three toys, you basically buy one toy, save 10%, buy two, save 15%, buy three, save 25%.

896
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:22,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, um, oddly enough, um, you know, games are listed as, you know, under the toy section on the website.

897
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:32,265
[SPEAKER_09]: However, if you went into, um, a Best Buy and tried to use that coupon, um, they would not let you because they said that games are not a toy.

898
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:35,068
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, um, let's see here.

899
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:40,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, um, a employee at Best Buy, um,

900
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:46,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So the games and game systems do not apply to that coupon because they're not toys.

901
00:58:46,928 --> 00:58:47,969
[SPEAKER_09]: A toy would be like a doll.

902
00:58:49,629 --> 00:58:52,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, Best Buy ripping people off yet again.

903
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:53,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

904
00:58:57,473 --> 00:58:59,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think of that?

905
00:58:59,273 --> 00:59:01,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Is video games a toy or not?

906
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:05,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they, I don't know.

907
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:05,696
[SPEAKER_09]: It's

908
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:11,008
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're listed under their website as a toy, then yes, I think it would apply as a toy.

909
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,470
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've got to be more clear on that stuff.

910
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're just saying toy does not apply to video games, that's what they should have had the fine print on the coupon.

911
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:22,620
[SPEAKER_09]: But they didn't.

912
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should honor it.

913
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's their own fault.

914
00:59:26,023 --> 00:59:29,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that they're saying, oh, I'm sorry, that's not a toy, well...

915
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:30,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Bait and Switch Gotta love it

916
00:59:51,099 --> 01:00:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well we're going to give just a couple more minutes for listless votes, so get those votes in now, we will announce the winners shortly, and we're going to be taking your Skype calls on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, and pretty soon you'll be able to call in from your PSP apparently, but I'm going to ask first, while we wait for any last minute votes, if there's any last minute stories that any of the hosts would like to cover tonight.

917
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:16,491
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a whole lot.

918
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:25,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony, of course, introduced the 16 gigabyte memory stick duo for, you know, obviously cameras and PSP and stuff like that.

919
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:27,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a whole lot of movies on there.

920
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:32,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a whole lot of games, depending on how you look at it.

921
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:36,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

922
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:38,232
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it.

923
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:39,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been pretty dead.

924
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:41,673
[SPEAKER_06]: H.D.V.D.

925
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:12,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But what can you do?

926
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:14,186
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's the ramifications.

927
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:17,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you think about it, Warner Brothers also owns New Line, which is a huge studio.

928
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:18,509
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Lord of the Rings, right?

929
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,231
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a huge blow.

930
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying that this could single-handedly turn things in Blu-ray's favor.

931
01:01:25,274 --> 01:01:28,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But something to keep in mind, Paramount is still HD DVD exclusive.

932
01:01:28,877 --> 01:01:30,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe there's one other studio that's still... Universal?

933
01:01:31,098 --> 01:01:32,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, HD DVD exclusive.

934
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:36,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So it isn't necessarily over yet, but that is a very big blow.

935
01:01:36,262 --> 01:01:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I'll admit that.

936
01:01:37,122 --> 01:01:37,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that means, you know...

937
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The Batman movies and stuff are going to be Blu-ray exclusive, which kind of sucks.

938
01:01:42,126 --> 01:01:49,150
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also the thing Kmart did too, saying they weren't going to carry Blu-ray.

939
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:58,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one more last minute story, and this is kind of stupid, but apparently some guy shot his son over an Xbox 360 argument.

940
01:01:59,077 --> 01:02:02,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently a 17-year-old in Pennsylvania

941
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:05,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about asshole.

942
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:05,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

943
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:07,493
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the kid doing with a rifle?

944
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:07,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

945
01:02:36,393 --> 01:02:37,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of many questions I have.

946
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:39,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

947
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:39,634
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

948
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:40,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

949
01:02:40,275 --> 01:02:44,537
[SPEAKER_06]: This means we need to fire up something for 2008 here.

950
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:47,879
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the inaugural stupid award of 2008.

951
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

952
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:59,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard these arguments before where somebody is yelling at somebody else and goes, I'm sure it's just like, why don't you just shoot me?

953
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you just kill me?

954
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:03,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean you actually shoot them.

955
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:06,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever heard of, like, a metaphor?

956
01:03:06,979 --> 01:03:11,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, so stupid.

957
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:15,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

958
01:03:15,102 --> 01:03:15,863
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this guy's name?

959
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:18,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, they didn't have his name.

960
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Unknown... Wait, I saw it somewhere.

961
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I gotta look at this.

962
01:03:22,926 --> 01:03:23,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I saw this somewhere.

963
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:26,107
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go to the original site that ran it.

964
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:31,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want to say this happened not that far from where I've been in Pennsylvania before.

965
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:32,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, where the hell was it?

966
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:40,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, person in the... Let's see.

967
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:46,189
[SPEAKER_06]: 60-year-old James Stanley Nidasik shot his 17-year-old son.

968
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So, congratulations, James Stanley.

969
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't pronounce your last name.

970
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:56,073
[SPEAKER_06]: You win the first Stupid Award of 2008, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio, for shooting your son in an argument.

971
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:57,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Ass.

972
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a release date for the Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Bully out in the U.K.,

973
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:06,707
[SPEAKER_04]: March 7th.

974
01:04:07,308 --> 01:04:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting that here too, I believe, right?

975
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:10,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's around March.

976
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet-ish.

977
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:15,152
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be the scholarship edition over here.

978
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to be very nice.

979
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:21,615
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, shall we get to tonight's listless winners?

980
01:04:22,176 --> 01:04:22,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

981
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:25,220
[SPEAKER_06]: It was neck and neck tonight.

982
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Only one vote separated number one and two.

983
01:04:28,262 --> 01:04:36,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything got a vote tonight, which doesn't happen very often in Listless, but somebody in chat wanted a little bit of everything.

984
01:04:36,487 --> 01:04:37,988
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, there could be only three.

985
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:41,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is, your top three gadgets you would like to see them unveil at CES.

986
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,931
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the definitive list.

987
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,012
[SPEAKER_06]: No arguing.

988
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:45,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very scientific method we use here.

989
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done.

990
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: The number three thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is the holodeck.

991
01:04:56,013 --> 01:05:00,455
[SPEAKER_06]: The number two thing you would like to see them debut at CES is a portal gun.

992
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:10,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning the number one thing you would like to see at CES either this year or 2009, the George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.

993
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:11,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

994
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:13,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It bakes the whole fucking cow.

995
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:16,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.

996
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:17,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad for a last minute pick.

997
01:05:18,505 --> 01:05:21,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Now your only trouble is where do you get a cow?

998
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only downside.

999
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: You tip it over and then put it in a bag?

1000
01:05:27,998 --> 01:05:28,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1001
01:05:28,698 --> 01:05:29,038
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1002
01:05:29,098 --> 01:05:30,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You tip it over into the grill.

1003
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:34,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1004
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:36,722
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1005
01:05:38,263 --> 01:05:41,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line of calls then.

1006
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:42,325
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1007
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:44,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1008
01:05:44,466 --> 01:05:46,787
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go ahead and give us a call, we'll take your calls.

1009
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take a few of those.

1010
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:53,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Deal UT says, Loki, you can get a cow carcass at Publix Easy.

1011
01:05:53,464 --> 01:05:54,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here in Florida.

1012
01:05:54,865 --> 01:05:56,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what that is, to be honest.

1013
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:58,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what that is?

1014
01:05:59,048 --> 01:05:59,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1015
01:05:59,808 --> 01:06:00,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1016
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:01,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what that is.

1017
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:02,410
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1018
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:03,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1019
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:06,553
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to give this to me now while we're trying to take calls on Skype?

1020
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:07,553
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1021
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:08,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had to.

1022
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:10,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1023
01:06:10,255 --> 01:06:10,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1024
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Ross Deal UT.

1025
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:15,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Ross Deal UT.

1026
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:15,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1027
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:16,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Friend, buddy, pal.

1028
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:17,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey there.

1029
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:18,060
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1030
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:18,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

1031
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:18,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

1032
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm nothing much.

1033
01:06:20,403 --> 01:06:25,245
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, Publix is a supermarket chain over here in the southeast.

1034
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:29,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Very big supermarket chain.

1035
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:42,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've seen people, I used to work at a Publix once, and yeah, I used to see people getting the cow carcasses.

1036
01:06:42,728 --> 01:06:43,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1037
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:45,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's what they do for Thanksgiving instead of the turkey, I don't know.

1038
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:47,410
[SPEAKER_06]: You put it in your shopping cart.

1039
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I'd like to see them doing on Supermarket Sweep, putting five of those cow carcasses right in the car.

1040
01:06:56,134 --> 01:07:00,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you'd need more than one cart, man, those things are fucking huge.

1041
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:05,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's how they did it on the show, they'd fill up one cart and throw it to their partner and they'd get another cart, alright, anyway.

1042
01:07:06,947 --> 01:07:10,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, would Supermarket Sweep not be the best video game ever?

1043
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:12,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

1044
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:15,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Would Supermarket Sweep not be one of the best video games ever?

1045
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's the kind of shit they need to be doing for Xbox Live.

1046
01:07:18,111 --> 01:07:18,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1047
01:07:19,612 --> 01:07:22,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a good Xbox Live arcade game, actually.

1048
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:23,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope Microsoft's listening.

1049
01:07:23,994 --> 01:07:24,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys are listening.

1050
01:07:24,734 --> 01:07:26,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what else is on your mind, Rusty?

1051
01:07:28,015 --> 01:07:28,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see.

1052
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,116
[SPEAKER_08]: In reaction, a couple of things, actually.

1053
01:07:31,196 --> 01:07:35,198
[SPEAKER_08]: In reaction to the whole Warner Brothers New Line thing, the CES

1054
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:57,417
[SPEAKER_08]: HD DVD press conference got cancelled I heard, it's like they've got their tail between their legs going Well, it's pretty big when you think about it There's only like three exclusive HD DVD studios left And Paramount, like I said in the chat, they're only exclusive because Microsoft paid them a boatload of money

1055
01:07:58,277 --> 01:07:59,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen pornographic Blu-rays on offer.

1056
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:24,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have sworn on this program last year we had a story about that the porn industry had gone with HD DVD for some reason.

1057
01:08:25,009 --> 01:08:27,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the reason, but they went with HD DVD.

1058
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did they go back on that?

1059
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I always said whoever gets porn wins the war.

1060
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:34,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that porn is going to Blu-ray, I'm like, it's over.

1061
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:40,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the problem with porn really is that it's not like back in DVD.

1062
01:08:40,093 --> 01:08:42,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you see porn really moving into the downloadable space.

1063
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:48,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Live Marketplace is going to suddenly offer porn, although they ought to.

1064
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1065
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,716
[SPEAKER_08]: You could say the same thing about Walmart.

1066
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:25,697
[SPEAKER_08]: They carry those movies and they don't carry porn.

1067
01:09:25,737 --> 01:09:38,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft has an image to protect, but what I was about to say is that you can't go five steps in either direction online without dipping into a pay site.

1068
01:09:38,862 --> 01:09:42,484
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I see a lot of the pornographic market going, is online.

1069
01:09:43,324 --> 01:09:47,446
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to worry about people picketing in front of porn shops or whatever.

1070
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:47,586
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a

1071
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,161
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1072
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:14,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the problem is they already did that with the Wii, so, you know.

1073
01:10:14,261 --> 01:10:14,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1074
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:17,644
[SPEAKER_08]: They already did... Yeah, you remember that, like, a few months back.

1075
01:10:17,764 --> 01:10:19,845
[SPEAKER_06]: My child went to X-Tube on the Wii.

1076
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:21,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1077
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:28,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, anything with any sort of internet capability is gonna have pornography.

1078
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:33,495
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern is if it ever went to Xbox Live Arcade, you'd have a bunch of people, you know...

1079
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:39,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch some porn and go play Halo or Uno with their cameras and you'll see them all.

1080
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put porn, stream it off of your 80 gig hard drive.

1081
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:58,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet anything you're only going to get to put pre-selected video clips that just happen to be clips from Sony's latest movies and TV shows.

1082
01:10:58,743 --> 01:11:00,464
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's going to be stuff that's off your hard drive.

1083
01:11:00,484 --> 01:11:01,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be anything, yeah.

1084
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:01,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1085
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:02,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

1086
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:05,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's Porn Palace, only available at home.

1087
01:11:06,525 --> 01:11:08,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to have a virtual porn house at home?

1088
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure, why not?

1089
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be fun.

1090
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:13,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what I want to know is, you know, are they going to be...

1091
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:15,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to let you throw cocks at people in home.

1092
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:17,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they going to throw cocks at people?

1093
01:11:18,213 --> 01:11:18,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Second Life.

1094
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:21,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, did you have something you wanted to say to this?

1095
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:22,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else was Second Life.

1096
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:27,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say Walmart wasn't exactly the best thing to bring up since they actually sold censored versions of movies.

1097
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:30,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Not here.

1098
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:36,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I totally agree with the point that Walmart's just as bigoted as everybody else in this sense.

1099
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:41,521
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to sell the violent movies, but heaven forbid our children see titties.

1100
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:42,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

1101
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:45,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Heaven forbid we teach them responsible sex at a young age.

1102
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Walmart is a huge contradiction.

1103
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,293
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll sell the unrated movies gladly.

1104
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:52,895
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll sell the M-rated games gladly.

1105
01:11:53,196 --> 01:11:56,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But they won't sell porn and they won't sell music with explicit lyrics.

1106
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:57,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I never understood that.

1107
01:11:58,221 --> 01:11:58,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Never.

1108
01:11:59,507 --> 01:12:10,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I will never forget that fucking Sheryl Crow, of all people, got banned from Walmart because she said in one of her songs, she had a lyric about somebody buying a gun at a Walmart store.

1109
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can, in fact, buy guns at Walmart stores.

1110
01:12:12,879 --> 01:12:13,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

1111
01:12:13,139 --> 01:12:14,280
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a hunting section.

1112
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So Walmart fucking banned Sheryl Crow because Sheryl Crow poses this huge threat to society.

1113
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:22,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what's going to happen, you know?

1114
01:12:23,127 --> 01:12:25,670
[SPEAKER_04]: She does, however, pose a huge threat to good music.

1115
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:29,574
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I think of hard fucking core music, I think of Sheryl Crow.

1116
01:12:31,276 --> 01:12:31,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1117
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:34,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, last thing before I go.

1118
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:41,987
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be happy to know that long after it's been released, they're releasing a Stranglehold map pack.

1119
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:43,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd actually heard about that.

1120
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:48,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the email from Midway, except I never played Stranglehold in the first place, so I forgot about that.

1121
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:51,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I was about to say, I mean, it wasn't exactly a best-selling game.

1122
01:12:51,815 --> 01:12:53,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would anyone care at this point?

1123
01:12:54,296 --> 01:13:00,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably they were already making it, thinking the game was going to be huge, and now it's just kind of one of those wah-wah kind of releases, you know?

1124
01:13:01,518 --> 01:13:03,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they kind of have to at this point, huh?

1125
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:05,659
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can make $50 off it, why not?

1126
01:13:10,067 --> 01:13:11,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how are you?

1127
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:38,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine.

1128
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:39,415
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

1129
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calling from Sweden, actually.

1130
01:13:41,336 --> 01:13:42,776
[SPEAKER_06]: You're calling from Sweden?

1131
01:13:42,856 --> 01:13:45,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be like four in the morning over there.

1132
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:49,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm the first one to actually call from Sweden, maybe.

1133
01:13:50,997 --> 01:13:51,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

1134
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:52,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he is.

1135
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:58,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had people in England, and I want to say we've had South America, definitely, Mexico.

1136
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:01,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say we've had another... We've had Denmark.

1137
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Denmark was it, but we haven't had Sweden.

1138
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, welcome to the show.

1139
01:14:07,162 --> 01:14:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good evening, so to say.

1140
01:14:09,303 --> 01:14:09,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

1141
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:26,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a bit pissed last year since, in your years of, your best of year, since never ever spoke about that the expansion for World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, actually came out.

1142
01:14:27,648 --> 01:14:35,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was, but then again, I just was like, wait, did that actually get released?

1143
01:14:35,808 --> 01:14:36,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year?

1144
01:14:37,649 --> 01:14:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like it was a long time ago.

1145
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:39,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1146
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:43,692
[SPEAKER_06]: That did come out in January, and as far as PC games go, that was a huge title.

1147
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in all fairness, and to cover our rears a little bit, we did talk about BlizzCon.

1148
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:50,916
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about The Wrath of the Lich King.

1149
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

1150
01:14:52,277 --> 01:15:02,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been actually... I don't know actually when I got hooked on your show for some reason, but I've been listening to your show like I would say maybe a year and a half.

1151
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:03,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1152
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:19,731
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I had some, what is it, since I've upgraded platform from going from Macintosh to PC nowadays, so I've had, what is it, only a half year that didn't go that well.

1153
01:15:21,832 --> 01:15:24,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, are you a big, do you play WoW yourself?

1154
01:15:24,072 --> 01:15:25,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you really big into Burning Crusade?

1155
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm like, I would say that I'm a huge WoW fan.

1156
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:36,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, players, since that's basically almost the only thing I've played.

1157
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:40,608
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I buy games last year?

1158
01:15:41,188 --> 01:15:52,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was Burning Crusade, and, well, I tried out EVE Online this summer, the summer bit, and then I bought the Orange Box.

1159
01:15:52,972 --> 01:15:53,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Good choice.

1160
01:15:53,272 --> 01:15:53,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Good taste.

1161
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I share with games.

1162
01:15:56,648 --> 01:16:00,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question, though, to you, because I notice you're mentioning a lot of PC games.

1163
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always like to ask our callers who call in from other countries, because I know a lot of times here on this program we focus on, here's what's happening in Japan, here's what's happening in the U.S.

1164
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:15,512
[SPEAKER_06]: We try to cover the overseas stuff, but sometimes it's best to kind of hear it firsthand, what the gaming scene's like overseas.

1165
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:20,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for instance, we've kind of heard from callers that have called from Latin and South American countries talk about that

1166
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:24,175
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the scene is very expensive there.

1167
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:26,897
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you say the gaming scene is like in Sweden?

1168
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it easy to walk into a store and pick up the latest and greatest game or console?

1169
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it a challenge?

1170
01:16:33,562 --> 01:16:34,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a piece of cake.

1171
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is that, well, what?

1172
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:45,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Games are currently quite fun in one way, since the PS3 is...

1173
01:16:50,484 --> 01:17:01,012
[SPEAKER_02]: For the cost of a PS3, you can actually get a decent computer and start playing WoW or Orange Box, whatever you want to.

1174
01:17:02,173 --> 01:17:02,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1175
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:05,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they do say the PS3 is supposed to be a computer.

1176
01:17:05,175 --> 01:17:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least they keep going back and forth on that.

1177
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:07,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a computer.

1178
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:07,857
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not.

1179
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And still, what is it?

1180
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an argument that really the cell engine, which is in the PS3, is not even made for games, so...

1181
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:31,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm assuming that the PlayStation 3 sales in Sweden are similar to that they are here, where there's quite still a big pile of them at the store waiting to be moved.

1182
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:36,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.

1183
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:40,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess maybe we aren't so different after all.

1184
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,559
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at that.

1185
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:48,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you want to cut me off right now, but anyway, I just want to say, Skype,

1186
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:52,780
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

1187
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:59,701
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a 70 Druid, which I'm quite impressed in one way, since, well, what?

1188
01:18:00,922 --> 01:18:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, just well-related.

1189
01:18:04,362 --> 01:18:13,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played World of Warcraft on US servers for one year, and I never even got to level 40.

1190
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:17,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you playing on a PvP server?

1191
01:18:17,324 --> 01:18:18,205
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably why.

1192
01:18:19,205 --> 01:18:20,725
[SPEAKER_02]: PvP server was

1193
01:18:21,403 --> 01:18:22,103
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

1194
01:18:22,383 --> 01:18:23,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Warsong.

1195
01:18:24,364 --> 01:18:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

1196
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:42,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I've developed the infamous altaholic disease, which is that you made one character, and then you get a character like 35 or something, and then you play another one.

1197
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:45,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you repeat that for quite some time.

1198
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:52,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically you have WoW ADD is what we would call it, where you can't focus on one character.

1199
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:55,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I have plenty of friends who do that same thing.

1200
01:18:55,675 --> 01:18:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like that.

1201
01:18:56,455 --> 01:18:58,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't got a character pass level 8.

1202
01:18:59,898 --> 01:19:07,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, really, I actually have 63 mage nowadays.

1203
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:08,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is it?

1204
01:19:08,904 --> 01:19:09,004
[SPEAKER_02]: When...

1205
01:19:11,607 --> 01:19:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: When the Burning Crusade came out, I switched to European servers.

1206
01:19:18,428 --> 01:19:24,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, they made it a lot easier to level.

1207
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:37,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, when the 2.3 patch later that came out just a few months, one month ago or something, not even that, made it a lot easier to level.

1208
01:19:38,190 --> 01:20:06,336
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know what it is, and I do have to wrap up and get going soon, but I will say this about Druid, is that what's amazing about that class is it's one of the last classes I tried playing in WoW, and I think the reason I've stuck with it so long is that you really can do, like, a little bit of everything as a Druid, and that's why I have so much fun with it, because, you know, I can do spam, you know, Moonfire or whatever, but then I can heal, or in a pinch, I can flip in a bear form and, you know, tank, even though I'm not very good at it, because I'm specced for balance, but, you know, it's kind of interesting, so...

1209
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I know how fun Druids is.

1210
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:12,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one at level 45 at the current stage.

1211
01:20:12,284 --> 01:20:13,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you need to take it a little higher.

1212
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:16,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1213
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:30,235
[SPEAKER_02]: They were speaking about, well, what was the New Year's promises or stuff, and my problem is that I was saying that I will get one character level standing, but then I just realized that

1214
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this new MMO that's been announced called Warhammer Age of Reckoning, which is highly anticipated in my ranks, which is Weehoo.

1215
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:54,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it sounds like it could be a big year into 2008.

1216
01:20:55,076 --> 01:21:01,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we don't neglect to mention that at this year's end special, or we might get another call berating us.

1217
01:21:02,117 --> 01:21:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1218
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:05,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we've got to wrap up.

1219
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind letting the international calls go on a long time, though, because I know you've got to stay up very, very late to listen to our program, and we appreciate it.

1220
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:13,079
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you so much.

1221
01:21:13,099 --> 01:21:16,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other quick final thoughts, things you want to share with our listeners?

1222
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:17,480
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1223
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:20,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, just keep on the show.

1224
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:26,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really one of the greatest I have heard so far.

1225
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:27,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

1226
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1227
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Hats off for you.

1228
01:21:33,773 --> 01:21:35,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it very much.

1229
01:21:35,594 --> 01:21:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1230
01:21:35,935 --> 01:21:38,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for staying up and listening to us.

1231
01:21:38,196 --> 01:21:38,776
[SPEAKER_06]: A true fan.

1232
01:21:39,557 --> 01:21:40,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1233
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:45,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually my second attempt in...

1234
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: and listen to your live since I'm usually not well since it's the hour difference is such a huge difference.

1235
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:03,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of these days we're going to have to do a show at noon to give our British and not just British but overseas listeners a break.

1236
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:04,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody over in those time zones.

1237
01:22:05,841 --> 01:22:06,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll have to.

1238
01:22:06,381 --> 01:22:08,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweden, Denmark, all of them.

1239
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I've got to let you go.

1240
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much for the call though.

1241
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:13,323
[SPEAKER_06]: We love hearing from the international folks.

1242
01:22:13,783 --> 01:22:14,283
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

1243
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do one more call if you've got any other calls coming in.

1244
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1245
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:19,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1246
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:20,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Ranma.

1247
01:22:20,913 --> 01:22:21,714
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, everybody?

1248
01:22:21,794 --> 01:22:22,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how you doing, Ranma?

1249
01:22:23,937 --> 01:22:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing good.

1250
01:22:24,918 --> 01:22:26,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm finally recovering from my holidays.

1251
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:27,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So how about you guys?

1252
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:28,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

1253
01:22:28,863 --> 01:22:30,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the card, by the way, on a personal note.

1254
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, no problem.

1255
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, did you get your card yet?

1256
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to check the mail.

1257
01:22:35,614 --> 01:22:38,955
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a pile of it, and I've been sort of too sick to look at anything.

1258
01:22:39,175 --> 01:22:40,495
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's hilarious, Ranma?

1259
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Your car actually got wet because of the storms.

1260
01:22:43,276 --> 01:22:44,716
[SPEAKER_06]: The rain got in my mailbox.

1261
01:22:44,936 --> 01:22:45,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that crazy?

1262
01:22:46,197 --> 01:22:48,417
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that happened to Dan's friend Will.

1263
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:52,878
[SPEAKER_04]: He was expecting the title to his truck, and he found it floating in the gutter.

1264
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1265
01:22:54,138 --> 01:22:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it wasn't that bad.

1266
01:22:55,199 --> 01:23:00,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that the wind actually blew open the little flap, and water got in there.

1267
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

1268
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:01,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1269
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:03,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, sorry Ranma, enough about me boohooing.

1270
01:23:03,893 --> 01:23:04,454
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1271
01:23:05,394 --> 01:23:05,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Not much.

1272
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:06,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make this brief.

1273
01:23:07,034 --> 01:23:08,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally got a chance to play Rock Band.

1274
01:23:09,414 --> 01:23:10,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what'd you think of Rock Band?

1275
01:23:11,395 --> 01:23:12,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It is great.

1276
01:23:12,275 --> 01:23:15,015
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be one of the greatest games I've played all year.

1277
01:23:16,016 --> 01:23:21,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I am probably one of the only people on the planet that thinks that Guitar Hero 3 has a better song list than Rock Band.

1278
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:22,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1279
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just not as into the songs in Rock Band.

1280
01:23:24,237 --> 01:23:27,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will say, Rock Band has some great download songs.

1281
01:23:27,338 --> 01:23:29,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I actually like that Attack song a lot.

1282
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:31,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The one you told me to get.

1283
01:23:31,488 --> 01:23:32,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really like that song.

1284
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:39,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock band's growing on me, but here's my question, because I was just thinking about this earlier today.

1285
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:41,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's your call and everything, but I'm deflecting.

1286
01:23:42,052 --> 01:23:44,113
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think they could do for a rock band 2?

1287
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:47,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Add more instruments.

1288
01:23:47,554 --> 01:23:50,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, a keyboard would be nice for rock band 2.

1289
01:23:50,995 --> 01:23:52,256
[SPEAKER_11]: That I would like to see happen.

1290
01:23:53,376 --> 01:23:55,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I think they should do for rock band 2?

1291
01:23:56,554 --> 01:23:57,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Not have a Rock Band 2.

1292
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should come out with Pop Band.

1293
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:04,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in Pop Band they should get rid of maybe the guitar.

1294
01:24:04,838 --> 01:24:07,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Lose the guitar and put the keyboard in instead.

1295
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:10,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Or lose the bass and put in the keyboard.

1296
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1297
01:24:11,101 --> 01:24:14,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would love to see them do a Pop Band game.

1298
01:24:15,002 --> 01:24:16,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I don't know how that would go over.

1299
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:21,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if they do a Rock Band 2, maybe one of the controls could be a double axe handle controller.

1300
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:22,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that would be badass.

1301
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,044
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty rad to have because that's what my character has.

1302
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a giant double axe controller with a big unicorn on it because you can put stickers on a guitar.

1303
01:24:31,006 --> 01:24:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put a big unicorn on it.

1304
01:24:32,186 --> 01:24:32,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

1305
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan has the tattoo of the snake coming out of the pants.

1306
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:37,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1307
01:24:39,089 --> 01:24:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time he shows it off, he goes, what's a trouser snake?

1308
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,391
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, polka band.

1309
01:24:45,471 --> 01:24:47,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dark Knight says, I got to have cowbells?

1310
01:24:48,092 --> 01:24:50,173
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a polka band, it's got to be Weird Al.

1311
01:24:50,788 --> 01:25:00,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was telling you about this the other day, but our friend was, while she was highly intoxicated, by the way, walking around with a cup and a pencil playing cowbell.

1312
01:25:03,197 --> 01:25:03,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1313
01:25:03,778 --> 01:25:04,618
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1314
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a long time, because I know you've been a long time fan of Konami's Bimani series and DDR and all that stuff, and I know that's how you kind of first came to our station.

1315
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:16,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1316
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:22,281
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think Konami could do to kind of step it up and give Harmonix a little competition?

1317
01:25:24,061 --> 01:25:33,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually bring over more of the Bimani games and fine-tune it more for American audiences instead of... Did we lose him?

1318
01:25:33,343 --> 01:25:33,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

1319
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm right here, sorry.

1320
01:25:36,184 --> 01:25:44,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine-tune it for American audiences instead of... Instead of putting in rehashes of some of the Japanese songs, like with DDR.

1321
01:25:44,206 --> 01:25:45,466
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as I enjoy DDR...

1322
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:47,875
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1323
01:26:15,197 --> 01:26:16,058
[SPEAKER_06]: as the buttons.

1324
01:26:16,178 --> 01:26:16,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1325
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:18,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like a funky version of Whack-A-Mole to me.

1326
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:18,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1327
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that kind of what it looked like?

1328
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Whack-A-Mole to music.

1329
01:26:20,981 --> 01:26:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like touchscreen or something.

1330
01:26:22,262 --> 01:26:23,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of interesting.

1331
01:26:24,103 --> 01:26:25,244
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be friggin' awesome.

1332
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Except how can you play that on a home console?

1333
01:26:27,326 --> 01:26:30,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that's only going to be in arcades, if anything.

1334
01:26:30,968 --> 01:26:31,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

1335
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:40,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one thing I've noticed is that when me and my roommate, when we play Guitar Hero, it's like, eh, eh, we have to trade off controllers back and forth.

1336
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,621
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just more than one person here.

1337
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:44,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, with Rock Band, I mean, my friend brought it up.

1338
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:45,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like for the Christmas party.

1339
01:26:45,661 --> 01:26:48,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like the ultimate party game, you know?

1340
01:26:48,322 --> 01:26:49,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, you have a lot of people.

1341
01:26:49,782 --> 01:26:51,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You got, like, WarioWare.

1342
01:26:51,102 --> 01:26:52,202
[SPEAKER_11]: You got the Mario parties.

1343
01:26:52,282 --> 01:26:56,583
[SPEAKER_11]: But you break out of Rock Band, everybody will just show up and just start playing.

1344
01:26:56,603 --> 01:26:58,804
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you're switching off controllers back and forth.

1345
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:00,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You're just getting together, having a good time.

1346
01:27:00,944 --> 01:27:01,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And, well...

1347
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:03,229
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya DarkSakura

1348
01:27:28,558 --> 01:27:29,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Two quick things.

1349
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:33,800
[SPEAKER_11]: My game of the year was Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

1350
01:27:34,081 --> 01:27:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1351
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:36,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Worst game of the year, Rover vs. Smackdown 08.

1352
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:38,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Why those two?

1353
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:43,124
[SPEAKER_11]: For me to get into a game, you've got to take my full attention.

1354
01:27:43,184 --> 01:27:49,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Any game that can help me kill a 45-minute train ride from homework vice versa is definitely up in my book.

1355
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:54,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And Phantom Hourglass was one of the few DS games that were actually able to have me do that.

1356
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:58,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And as for Raw vs. SmackDown 08, I'm an average wrestling fan.

1357
01:27:58,633 --> 01:28:03,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't like the fact that they took so much out of the Wii version compared to the other versions of the game.

1358
01:28:03,837 --> 01:28:06,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the Wii got the gimped version of the game.

1359
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,541
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it gets worst game of the year.

1360
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:12,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had to ask because you know you're one of like the two people who didn't say Yaris.

1361
01:28:12,464 --> 01:28:13,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So just had to ask.

1362
01:28:13,525 --> 01:28:14,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a 360 yet.

1363
01:28:14,846 --> 01:28:15,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, there you go.

1364
01:28:16,147 --> 01:28:16,407
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1365
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:18,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, DJ Rama S, we got to let you go.

1366
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:19,670
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you so much for calling us always.

1367
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:20,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1368
01:28:20,531 --> 01:28:20,771
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1369
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:21,371
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1370
01:28:21,451 --> 01:28:21,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1371
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:22,272
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1372
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:23,890
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1373
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,982
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I'm going to get a bug lamp for this room and every time it goes bzzz I'm going to laugh.

1374
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:57,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1375
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:00,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Big rigs over the road.

1376
01:29:00,805 --> 01:29:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Racing is really, really, really bad.

1377
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:05,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1378
01:29:06,829 --> 01:29:07,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take your word for it.

1379
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I am not going to play it.

1380
01:29:09,752 --> 01:29:11,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Although not as bad as I thought it would be.

1381
01:29:12,414 --> 01:29:15,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's some where those Wii conspiracy games are even worse.

1382
01:29:15,663 --> 01:29:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1383
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1384
01:29:21,704 --> 01:29:24,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be nowhere without you guys and your word of mouth.

1385
01:29:24,565 --> 01:29:28,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you like what you've heard, please tell two people about our show.

1386
01:29:28,346 --> 01:29:29,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

1387
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:37,028
[SPEAKER_06]: If you tell two people, then slowly we'll take over the world because we don't have any magazines or websites to get million views a month that we can advertise on.

1388
01:29:37,728 --> 01:29:39,829
[SPEAKER_06]: We literally broadcast out of my garage.

1389
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's independent radio at its finest.

1390
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't feel so inclined to tell people, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Dig or Yahoo Podcasts or any of those sites because that works too.

1391
01:29:52,698 --> 01:29:55,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, thank you guys so much for tuning in this week.

1392
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:02,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week we will be back and we'll have more gaming news and more stuff to come in the year 2008.

1393
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully some surprises here on the program.

1394
01:30:05,587 --> 01:30:08,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to book some guests for the upcoming shows.

1395
01:30:08,854 --> 01:30:10,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we'll have some of those in the next few weeks.

1396
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:11,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So more to come.

1397
01:30:12,377 --> 01:30:17,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, I'm Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we're out.

1398
01:30:20,402 --> 01:30:22,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1399
01:30:23,164 --> 01:30:25,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1400
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:35,874
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on our live and podcast programs, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next week!
