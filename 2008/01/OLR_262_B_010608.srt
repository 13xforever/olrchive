00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,800
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 6th of 2008.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,480
Feels a little weird to be saying that, 2008.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Hopefully I can remember to start actually writing that on my check soon.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,120
As we are taping the show tonight, you know, we tape live,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,880
the Consumer Electronics Show is going on, or I should say is kicking off

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,600
with their keynote speeches and Microsoft is delivering theirs right now while we're taping the show.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
Loki's been watching, keeping an eye on it during the break and while we were taping part A.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Anything come up yet? I know they're not finished, but has anything come up so far?

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
Yeah, they just kind of, they briefly went over everything.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,360
They were talking a little bit about some mobile platforms and stuff like that.

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,240
In fact, actually that's what they're talking about a new telephone service right now.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,720
And apparently I guess their sync service, you know, the one that he keeps in the commercials for,

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,680
is basically going to be ripping off OnStar.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Including, you know, if you get in an accident, sync will call, you know, 911, you know,

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,800
and then play them a song or something.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,840
No, they'll tell them that you've been in an accident and get, you know, help and stuff.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,120
But anyways, gaming related stuff, they've announced a whole lot of stuff.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,720
Really the couple things they announced, of course, they've sold 17.7 million units worldwide so far to date.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,960
Did 3.5 billion dollars in business through November.

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
And right now, of course, passed a 10 million member mark on live.

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,280
They did announce that their Xbox Live video marketplace is going to have some new additions,

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,720
including ABC and Disney are going to be bringing their TV shows to live.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,360
So they're going to get, you know, Lost and Desperate Housewives.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,120
Lost, Desperate Housewives, that kind of stuff.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,040
Gotcha.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,680
Also, they're saying that they're going to be adding MGM movies as well, they're going to be coming.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,160
In the UK, they're going to be offering their medium room service, which is like a, you know,

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,680
their IPTV and that kind of thing.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,320
Apparently, though, there's going to be a company, British Telecommunication, I think, BT,

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,120
they're going to be partnering with them to use the 360 as a set-top box.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
So basically, you'll be able to watch TV, I guess, through that.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
So that's kind of neat.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,480
But they have no, you know, Xbox 360 Ultimate or anything like that.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah, though, it's still going on.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,720
It's still going on.

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
Right now, they're doing some phone service and they're showing that you can watch.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,200
What was the thing you were talking about?

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,360
Right when we were doing the, not commercial, but the music break between Part A and B here live,

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,960
you were mentioning something about a Zune MySpace type thing?

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,560
Yeah, they have the Zune Social.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,320
It's going to be, you know, basically a part of their website.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
You can create your own page.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,640
You can make, you know, it'll have your Zune pic and your Zune tag and that kind of stuff.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,800
And it'll basically show all your stats, kind of what you're listening to, your top three songs,

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,280
you know, songs that you've flagged as your favorites, that kind of thing.

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
And customers will be able to go through there.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
So it's last FM for your Zune?

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,840
Sort of, yeah.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
And you can listen to songs that other people are listening to.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
You can buy those songs and you can visit their friends and,

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
you know, listen to songs and that kind of thing.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Interesting.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
Seems like everybody's trying to get in on that MySpace, though.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Kind of, it's going to, we're going to get social networked out before too long.

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,520
I mean, how many of those freaking social network profiles can you have?

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,640
Yeah, and right now they're talking about, you know, connected entertainment, I guess,

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,520
is their theme right now, talking about being able to, you know, hook everything up between,

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,960
you know, the TV, your Windows PC, your mobile PC, your Zune, et cetera.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,440
Interesting.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
Now, Sakura Max is in our chat right now at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
and really doesn't give a shit about anything you're saying, Loki.

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,800
What Sakura Max wants to know is how many copies of Eye of Judgment have moved?

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
That's what we really want the update on.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,600
I don't know.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,880
We haven't gotten the new MPD numbers yet.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,640
But we're not close to a million yet, are we?

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Fuck, we haven't even broken a hundred thousand yet.

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,960
All right.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Let's go ahead and go back to the gaming news then and Loki will keep one eye on the

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
Consumer Electronics Show speech and let us know.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,240
Just break in.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
If anything really big is announced, just break in, okay?

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,400
Definitely.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,720
All right.

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
Anyways, let's start things off, and this is a little bit surprising.

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
Apparently, Nintendo is no longer shipping the Wavebird to stores right now.

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,680
They have kind of phased out that system.

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,920
No word though of, you know, I guess I really wish that they would just allow the classic

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,440
controller to play GameCube games.

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
I think that would make things a lot easier because it's a pain in the ass to have a GameCube

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,760
controller play GameCube games and stuff.

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
I don't know.

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,480
But right now, apparently, there's no other way, you know, to play your classic games

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
on the Virtual Console if you don't have a GameCube controller.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,720
I guess you could buy a wired controller or one of those third-party controllers that's

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
like a Wavebird like I have.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
The Wavebird is an amazing piece of hardware too.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
I mean, everybody knows that.

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,920
It's like a really great game controller and, you know, it was obviously, you know, it was

94
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,800
wireless kind of before you had the Xbox 360 wireless and PS3, you know, 6-axis or whatever.

95
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
Just a great peripheral.

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,040
It's kind of weird that it's going away now before Smash Brothers Melee is out.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,320
So if you were hoping to control Smash Brothers Melee with a Wavebird, you'd better get your

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
hands on it if you don't already have one.

99
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah, I've got mine.

100
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't have one, sadly.

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
One of the things I was talking about, real quick, just to break in with the CES stuff.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,960
They were talking about how, I guess, that there's this new phone service that they're

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,400
doing that I think is called Tell Me.

104
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,480
It will actually allow you to use your phone.

105
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
Like, say for example, it has GPS and stuff.

106
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,640
You walk up to a theater, it will show you on the phone what's playing there and that

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
kind of stuff and all the information.

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,480
You can buy tickets.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,720
One of the other things that they're showing is you can actually use your phone's camera

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
to point in that building and get directions to how to get to the building.

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
What the building is and that kind of stuff.

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520
It will know, I guess.

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Freaky.

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Kind of freaky.

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,480
Pretty soon it's going to be the Jetsons flying cars, video phones, all that stuff.

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,560
We already have video phones.

117
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
I guess we kind of do with the internet.

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
We have teleconferencing.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
Hey, you know, actually, I'll say this.

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,960
I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but I've got to say this is pretty awesome.

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
Maybe I mentioned this last week.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
No, I couldn't have because the New Year's thing happened after last week.

123
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,320
But I had a little New Year's get-together here at the place and Shane is obviously a

124
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,960
good friend of mine.

125
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Meek Latavi has been on the show before, he doesn't live here anymore because Konami

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
folded in the Bay Area, so he went back to Kansas.

127
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
So he's back there and he couldn't come to the party.

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,720
But we got on the Xbox 360 cam and I hooked up the cam and so we could all wave at him

129
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
through the camera.

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,520
I was talking on the phone with him at the same time because he doesn't have a headset

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,080
or whatever.

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
So it was kind of like a way for him to see everybody without actually being here.

133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
I just thought that was really neat.

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
That's kind of a video phone in that regard.

135
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,320
And that's sort of what I was thinking because even now a lot of cameras like that one, Scott,

136
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,720
doesn't that one have a microphone on it?

137
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
Well, iSight, oh yeah.

138
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
So really all you need is a camera with a microphone and speaker and there you go.

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,680
So that was the equivalent you had with the Xbox camera and being on the phone.

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,960
It's not too far off to being an everyday thing available in the home, I think.

141
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah, it's kind of surprising we're not already there because I remember that was a big thing

142
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,920
they always talked about like in the 80s and 90s was the video phone.

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Kind of interesting.

144
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,240
It's more, I think, something that they've put more in a business-oriented type market

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
though because I've worked at places that had video teleconferencing.

146
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
And sometimes I answer the phone right after I get out of the shower.

147
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,640
People don't need to see that, you know what I mean?

148
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,800
So I have the option of, you know, this is an unlisted wall.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,320
Never call this wall again!

150
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
Or a space ball bathroom.

151
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll have to have the phone removed from my bathroom.

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh, space balls.

153
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
Oh, oh that's, oh my god.

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,280
That's been a long time since I've seen that movie.

155
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,320
All right, anyhow, Dark Tetsuya was asking if we were playing Strip Uno.

156
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
No, perv.

157
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,200
But you do bring up a good point because I have joked on this program that Strip Uno

158
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
is really the only reason to have an Xbox 360 cam right now.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
Well, I found another decent use for it, so there you go.

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,520
There was a New York Times story that came out earlier this week that said that pretty

161
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,400
soon on the Nintendo Wii, you are going to be able to download DS games to your Wii.

162
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,160
And we all thought this sounded like a pretty nice idea and something that, you know, seems

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
kind of logical.

164
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
I mean, after all, you can download original Xbox games on your Xbox and you can download

165
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
all these other console, you know, games on your Wii.

166
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
Why not be able to download DS games as well?

167
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,160
Well, the smacketh was laid downeth and you cannot actually download full DS games coming

168
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,560
to the Wii.

169
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
That is not in the future.

170
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,600
What is in the future, however, is what Japan already has, the DS demos being downloaded

171
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,960
from your Wii to the Nintendo DS, which I think we all saw coming.

172
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,480
That functionality is almost already there to an extent.

173
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,560
You can't download them yet, but if you own a copy of Geometry Wars Galaxies, you can

174
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,640
actually beam a copy of Geometry Wars DS version to your DS.

175
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,040
So that functionality is already there in some games.

176
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
But no full DS games at this time, which, you know, is fine because that would mean

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,160
there would have to be a whole other memory unit, which means they would probably unleash

178
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,320
a, you know, I'll bet you anything if they do remodel the DS, a new DS remodel is going

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
to come out with some type of onboard memory so they can do that.

180
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,160
But we'll see.

181
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
It wouldn't surprise me.

182
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,680
Yeah.

183
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,520
Well, someone decided to be original, as I say this in humongous quote fingers, and bring

184
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:26,240
out a peripheral for the cell phone to play different games on that is called a Z-Mote

185
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
put out by the company called Z2.

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
It's a Bluetooth.

187
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,560
It looks just like the Wiimote, only smaller, fits in, you know, directly in your palm,

188
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,680
has an analog stick and buttons on the bottom, and it has a functional motion sensing.

189
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,840
But yeah, it's not based off the Wiimote at all.

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,640
On the Nintendo Wiimote, isn't the button on the Wiimote referred to as the Z button?

191
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Isn't that the Z button in games?

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,080
On the Nunchuck, it's the Z button.

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
That's what I thought.

194
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,520
When you do a little ground pound in Smash, or in Mario Galaxy, that's the Z button you're

195
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,000
hitting, right?

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,880
Mm-hmm.

197
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Yeah, this isn't going to be a lawsuit at all or anything.

198
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,280
No.

199
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh, but it's black.

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, then that makes all the difference.

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
And it looks like it's matte.

202
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
It's not shiny.

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Oh, well, shit.

204
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
That just means the parts are cheaper.

205
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,840
Yeah.

206
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
But I mean, seriously, what games are you going to play on your cell phone with this?

207
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,720
Come on.

208
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,320
Really, kids.

209
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,840
Maybe if you're trying to play Pac-Man, because I can tell you from experience that Super

210
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,880
Pac-Man on a cell phone is damn near impossible.

211
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,840
Yeah, really.

212
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,800
One thing that is damn near impossible is to get a damn game that's not censored in

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,280
some way.

214
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,120
And unfortunately, Metal Slug 3 has been censored in the US on Xbox Live Arcade.

215
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:58,480
Instead of spewing streams of blood in the zombie stage, you spew streaming something,

216
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
some white substance.

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,760
Sweat!

218
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
White substance.

219
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,440
That's even worse, I think.

220
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,280
But yes, you shoot streams of semen.

221
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Anyways, that's even grosser than blood.

222
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,120
But if you want to fix it so that there's blood again, all you have to do is just basically

223
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,280
trick the game into thinking that you're Japanese by changing your region to Japan.

224
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,320
Leave it to the chat room to call it Bukake Slug 3.

225
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,200
You know what, though?

226
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:38,320
That's not anything new from SNK, because I've got Samurai Shodown 2 on Neo Geo, and

227
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,040
if you change your region on it, it will change the blood in the game from red to white.

228
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,280
So that's old hat for them.

229
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,840
Interesting.

230
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,440
By the way, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week, but I did play the Metal Slug

231
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
3 on Xbox Live Arcade, and I've got to say, you know, Loki and I especially give Metal

232
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
Slug a lot of shit on this program for kind of being the same game over and over.

233
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
I did have a shitload of fun with Metal Slug 3.

234
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
I almost called it Metal Gear 3.

235
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,280
Metal Slug 3 is actually a shitload of fun, and I bet it will be a lot of fun to play

236
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,000
in co-op mode.

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
The zombie stage is like my freaking favorite in the whole game.

238
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,760
But nevertheless, the news about a desensitized version of Metal Slug and the fact that things

239
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,560
have to be toned down for us here in America because we can't handle the blood, that just

240
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,080
incites rage within us.

241
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know about you guys, but it motivates us to do a little segment here we call the

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
FUs of the Week.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I just, I turn into a big emo mess whenever I'm really, really sick because I'm just so

244
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,040
tired all the time, so I was really just crabby and upset, and I hated it.

245
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,360
And I'm feeling better today, but, you know, I have to go back to work tomorrow, and on

246
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
top of that, I have to go in early.

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
But it's a good reason why I'm going in early, because I'm going to my school tomorrow to

248
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
see how close I am to graduating.

249
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,560
I might actually qualify for yet my, what, my ninth change of major since starting my

250
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920
college career ten years ago.

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:41,360
So, and also an FU goes to my right-hand middle finger, because I've started developing the

252
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
symptoms of trigger finger in that one as well, so I think that I might have actually

253
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
injured something instead of it being some sort of naturally causing thing, because normally

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,520
trigger finger sets in if you're older or do a lot of heavy pulling with your hands,

255
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
and I don't do either.

256
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,720
I push, and I type, and that's about it, and that's not what causes sugar finger, so I

257
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
get to go back and get another shot in my hand, which is going to be fun.

258
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,360
And that's the end.

259
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,960
Loki, do you have anything you want to FU?

260
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm not really mad at much of anything other than the really crappy drivers for the Nvidia

261
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,680
cards. Currently the latest graphics drivers that they have now, for whatever reason when

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,560
my system boots up, it keeps flashing black every now and then, and I basically have to

263
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,600
switch my resolution down to something lower than switch back up to normal and it stops,

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
so I don't know why it's doing that because the older drivers didn't do it.

265
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,680
But anyways, so that sucks.

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,040
The other thing that kind of really sucks, well, there wasn't really much more announcements,

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,400
I guess, at CES, at least the Microsoft thing, that's it.

268
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,920
No Xbox 360 ultimate or anything like that, they're done.

269
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,280
They just basically had Slash come on stage and they played some Guitar Hero 3.

270
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,960
Lame!

271
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,760
Isn't that the way, like, an episode of Scooby Doo would end?

272
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,400
Something like that.

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,480
The Slash just comes out and everybody rocks out.

274
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,160
Like a big party.

275
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,760
It was pretty retarded.

276
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,840
Right. My FU of the week goes to whoever stole our garbage can.

277
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,560
There's no fucking garbage can now, thanks to the storm.

278
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
I don't know if God stole it, Mother Nature, or one of the neighbors.

279
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
I don't know. We are missing a fucking garbage can.

280
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,640
And it's freaky because, like, where are we going to put the trash?

281
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Call them up.

282
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.

283
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,160
It's scary. It's a scary notion.

284
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,680
Or still give an FU to that.

285
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,400
By the way, Robert M. would like to point out the irony in our chat room.

286
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,880
The Dark Sakura gave the finger to her finger.

287
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,320
It is that finger.

288
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
It is the middle finger.

289
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
It's not pleasant. It doesn't hurt or anything.

290
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,640
It just feels like I can't straighten out my finger once I bend it.

291
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,760
It's like, how am I going to flip people off if my favorite finger is broken?

292
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Tigerclaw says, Skye, perhaps it was stolen by a bum?

293
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,520
You know, that's the scary thing.

294
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,000
Like, maybe it was stolen by a bum, but seriously, why does a bum need a fucking trash can?

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,840
And seriously, why would he hike this far into this, like, development here to steal a trash can?

296
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,240
And why not steal the recycle bin? It's bigger.

297
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,600
My guess is it blew away.

298
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,240
It blew away in the storm, and someone said, hey, free trash can!

299
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,920
Well, what day was it the day when you had all the trash cans out the curb?

300
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,560
I mean, was that-

301
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
No, it wasn't the same day. We brought them back up.

302
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh. Well, that's weird.

303
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
It's, yeah, it is very weird.

304
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
No, we have no idea. It's just the weirdest thing ever.

305
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,240
That's why you store your trash cans behind the fence.

306
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Well, yeah, we'll be doing that from now on, but still, kind of weird, nonetheless.

307
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,360
Yeah, and I don't understand.

308
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
If a bum took it because they wanted to, I don't know, live in it or whatever-

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Why would you live in a trash can? I mean, seriously-

310
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
Did Oscar the Grouch steal my can? Did Oscar the Grouch need a new home?

311
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,160
Why did he not take the- there's three cans.

312
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
There's a recycle, there's a lawn, and a garbage.

313
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,800
The garbage one is the smallest-

314
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,640
Because he lives in a garbage can!

315
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
Well, fuck you, Oscar the Grouch!

316
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,280
Anyhow, maybe one of the neighbors just hit it and was waiting for us to get back or something,

317
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
because I've been out of town, so has my roommate.

318
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
Anyhow, who cares about that anymore?

319
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,440
Let's talk about some PC gaming news, some things announced for PC games this week,

320
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,440
including Gas-Powered Games' next project. It's a game called Demigod,

321
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
and this game sounds kind of cool because it's going to mix role-playing,

322
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,560
real-time strategy, and action genres.

323
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,800
It's actually announced a game for Windows Magazine, so this is something for PC gamers.

324
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,880
It's being created by Chris Taylor, or I guess he's spearheading it or what have you,

325
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,440
and apparently it's supposed to be inspired in part by Warcraft 3's modification,

326
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
Defense of the Ancients.

327
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
It looked, from the screenshots,

328
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,280
it looked almost like an RTS version of Shadow of the Colossus.

329
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,480
Interesting.

330
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,760
Well, they have these Titan things that look like, you know-

331
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,880
I always like hearing about these games that combine these very interesting types of genres,

332
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,680
like RPGs and action, that's going to be kind of interesting.

333
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,480
Well, almost every game is an action game.

334
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,080
It kind of makes me think of Kingdom Hearts, it's like RPG mixed with action, right?

335
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,160
So I'm just kind of interested to see what this is.

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,680
Yeah, just think more of an RTS game, that's what it basically looks like.

337
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,200
RTS game, I guess, where your troops or whatever will gain experience and that kind of thing,

338
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
and then they fight each other, so that's the action part, I don't know.

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,720
Well, no release date announced yet, all we know is that Demigod is coming soon.

340
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
Of course, the almighty soon, right?

341
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:56,080
Well, Rockstar is going to be putting out a little bit more digitally now by working

342
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,680
with Steam's PC download service, so they're going to be putting Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne,

343
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:08,560
and Midnight Club, those different series, up on that service, so that'd be pretty cool.

344
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
That is pretty cool.

345
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,080
That is pretty cool, and I think, if I remember correctly, the first

346
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,800
few games that are going to be on there are going to be pretty cheap.

347
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,480
Like, I think they were like ten bucks.

348
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,840
What is it, like the original Grand Theft Auto, or is it some good stuff?

349
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
No, the Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.

350
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll take it.

351
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,680
The first Grand Theft Auto game, and the second, I believe, are available free on their website.

352
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, that's right, they did that some time ago, I forgot about that.

353
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
So, you know, if you want to play those, because I remember the original Grand Theft Auto,

354
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,680
that game was fun.

355
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
Nothing like what it is today.

356
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
No, not at all.

357
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
Very, very different.

358
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
Anyways, let's see here, Just Cause 2 was announced, or at least some details about it.

359
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,600
They're going to be, I don't know, getting rid of some of the side quests, I guess, in the game,

360
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,280
to kind of simplify it a little bit more, make it more, I don't know, straightforward.

361
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,520
Now, they're saying that they've identified the key areas that they want to improve for Just

362
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
Cause 2, they just want to make better use of the huge game world, enhance the stunts,

363
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,880
improve the combat, and reward exploration, which I don't understand how you can reward exploration,

364
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
but get rid of some of the side quests.

365
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,840
That's kind of counterintuitive.

366
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:37,440
But, apparently, the game is not going to be set on the island of San Esperanto anymore.

367
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,560
It's going to be a tropical paradise in Southeast Asia, but it will still have

368
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,440
Rico Rodriguez as the lead character.

369
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
I don't know, I didn't really play Just Cause.

370
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,520
I played the demo a lot, and that was fun.

371
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
And I know that game had a few glitches where you can fly a plane underwater,

372
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,480
but other than that, it looked pretty cool.

373
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
It's so pretty good for a first, you know, a new IP, right?

374
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,640
Yeah, it might be one I might pick up, actually I might pick up the original,

375
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,160
because I think it's dirt cheap right about now.

376
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,040
I think it is dirt cheap.

377
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
I think I saw it in a bargain bin the other day.

378
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
Well, this isn't coming to a bargain bin anytime soon, because the latest and greatest piece

379
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,480
of technology for you PC gamers is a brand new video card, Nvidia's GeForce 9800 GX2,

380
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,040
a blog called Hard OCP has gotten a peek at the new card.

381
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,320
This card is coming out in late February, early March-ish,

382
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,880
and it's basically going to replace Nvidia's current high-end card, the 8800 Ultra.

383
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
Now, I don't follow a whole lot of what this stuff means,

384
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,520
but I imagine for you PC folks that follow this stuff a little better than I do.

385
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,640
You've got one gigabyte frame buffer, two PCBs,

386
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,400
two 65nm GPUs total, and 256 stream processors total.

387
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,560
In other words, fucking great video,

388
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,360
but it'll be outdated next year when something even better comes out.

389
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,480
Well, shit, this stuff's outdated like within a few months.

390
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,960
Really?

391
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,760
The thing is, yeah, well, fuck, I bought a card for my PC and the day after it was outdated.

392
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
I traded it in though, so I got a better one.

393
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,200
But yeah, essentially, there's a lot of drama going on with PC graphics cards right now,

394
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
because ATI, their cards are nowhere near what Nvidia's are,

395
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
and because of that, Nvidia doesn't really have any competition,

396
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,000
so they keep re-releasing their old cards with slightly better processors and that kind of stuff.

397
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,840
So this, essentially, is just two graphics cards shoved on the one card, is what it basically is.

398
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,200
It's like your Core 2, or the quads that they have, the Intel chips,

399
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,600
they're not really a quad-core processor, it's just two Core 2 duos on one processor.

400
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,680
So that's what it is.

401
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,160
It's going to be about 13 inches long, they said, which is fucking huge for a graphics card.

402
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
Try fitting that in your case.

403
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
But, you know, I'm sure it'll be good.

404
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
13 inches long, you say?

405
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,440
Yeah, and I'm sure it'll be, you know, you can quad SLI them,

406
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
so if you really want to buy four of these cards, you can run them together.

407
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
I don't know why you would, you probably don't need to.

408
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,040
You probably don't need to, but it says 30% faster than the 8800 Ultra.

409
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,880
I know that the card I have right now, which is the 8800 GTS 512, the G92,

410
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,960
that one is a little bit faster than the Ultra, I think, as well.

411
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,640
So save yourself some money, or wait, or buy through a company like EVGA,

412
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,880
where you can step up your cards as new ones come out, so you can always stay with the new stuff.

413
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,280
Dark Sakura, did you hear that I've got one that's 13 inches?

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,120
I paid good money for it, too.

415
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,360
I'm sure you did.

416
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,640
Here's what I want to know, Loki.

417
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
Will it make WoW run better?

418
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
Dude, WoW will run on pretty much anything.

419
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
It really will, but it's kind of choc-

420
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,000
Will it make freaking Tabula Rasa run better?

421
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Because I tried playing a demo of that, and it did not run very well on my computer.

422
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
Probably.

423
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
Which is strange, because it's not like my computer's that old.

424
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
The game's a memory hog.

425
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
How about we do something else, Rob?

426
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
How about we do some emails?

427
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,680
We are going to get to the mailbag, but something you kids should be thinking about,

428
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,560
because it's coming up very soon, not too far after the mailbag,

429
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,480
we're going to bring back a game we haven't done in a long time tonight on the program,

430
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,760
and that is Listless, and we're actually going to be looking for a collar in a little while.

431
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,320
Not yet, but we're going to be looking for a collar to play with us.

432
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
It's Listless in tonight's topic, so you can start thinking about-

433
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
Well, maybe I'll save that.

434
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
I'll keep that a secret.

435
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Save it.

436
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,120
Maybe-

437
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
But if you call in right now, Rob will tell us who it is, and we'll laugh.

438
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
No, I'm not going to do that right now.

439
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,480
But I am kind of wondering, I should get someone to participate in Listless with us,

440
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,200
so I can tell them the topics, then you can start thinking of their list,

441
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
because we don't want to have to come up with it on the spot.

442
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,320
So I'm going to say this, if you want to participate in Listless tonight,

443
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,680
and you're available on Skype-

444
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,640
How about a trivia question to answer by private message?

445
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
Okay, I like that.

446
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
A trivia question to answer by private message.

447
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,440
Okay.

448
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
Well, you got to do mails.

449
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
They should probably send it to me.

450
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,640
Okay, let's send it to Rob.

451
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
All right, send it to me.

452
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,200
What's the trivia question?

453
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,920
Anything I want?

454
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
How about-

455
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
I hope you pick something I know the answer to.

456
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,920
Oh, well, if you don't know the answer to, I'll tell you anyway.

457
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay.

458
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay.

459
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,920
Don't make it too hard.

460
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
We want somebody to play.

461
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:22,800
It'll be easy.

462
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
What's my favorite color?

463
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
What's Dark Soccer's favorite color?

464
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah.

465
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,720
All right.

466
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,160
All right, send me a private message with what you think Dark Soccer's favorite color is.

467
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,400
And the first person to get it will play Listless with us tonight.

468
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,120
That'd be fun.

469
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
And I'll tell them the topics they can think of their list.

470
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
All right, so send a private message to Sky.

471
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,720
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer is going to open up the old mailbag and get to work.

472
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,600
There's just four.

473
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,560
Um, well, a fifth one was a thank you.

474
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
So, Rob, thank you.

475
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Oh, you're welcome.

476
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,160
What did I do?

477
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,360
Oh, okay.

478
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,680
Yeah.

479
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Oh, you're welcome.

480
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Um, the first one, um, comes from, um, I'm just going to say Ryan, who put his full name

481
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,560
on here.

482
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,480
So, and I don't read out everybody's full names.

483
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,440
So, so it says, Hey guys, I was wondering if the operator 11 feeds on OLR can be downloaded

484
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,960
to a computer or a PSP.

485
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,160
Rock on Dragon Force.

486
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
Um, not right now.

487
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
Um, as we have,

488
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:28,480
um, as we've stated earlier, operator 11 is having, um, mental retardation, I'm sorry,

489
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
technical difficulties.

490
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,360
So we're not, um, going to say much more about them.

491
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,840
Right.

492
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,560
So moving forward, the next email comes from, uh, Martin.

493
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,320
Hello, all our crew.

494
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
I just want to ask your opinion about a blaming game.

495
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,840
A gaming cliche that I think is really, really outdated.

496
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
I constantly hear many game reviewers and game podcasters talk about how kids are always

497
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,720
trying to explain game systems and gaming to parents buying the current gen systems.

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,760
I think that it really must be pointed out that these supposed naive parents grew up

499
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,120
with gaming in their lives, starting with the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES and many cats

500
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,800
gaming since they started myself, including growing up in the eighties.

501
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,560
Yes, it was sometimes a challenge to teach a parent about what a gaming system could

502
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,440
do and their relevance, but gaming has been well established almost every living room

503
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
since the 1980s.

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,200
I really think that this need to explain to a parent about what a PlayStation or Nintendo

505
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,840
Wii is, is really outdated and just plain foolish to think a good portion of all of

506
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,280
us oldsters have and continue to game in some cases, no more than their kids about gaming.

507
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,920
No more than their kids about gaming don't buy into the hype.

508
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,780
The only parents that do not know what video games are will never get it because they choose

509
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,440
not to know about it.

510
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,360
Martin and all your friends at bunchofdorks.com.

511
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,880
Nice name for a website by the way.

512
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
That's fantastic.

513
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,080
Do you have anything to say about that?

514
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
I'm sorry, I was monitoring the trivia question.

515
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Summarize for me?

516
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,960
Well, basically saying that since there have been video games for as long as many of the

517
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:21,280
people out there have, I guess, grown up and are now parents themselves, so there shouldn't

518
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,320
be any excuse for a parent not to be aware of what a system is or what it does, but I

519
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:34,800
also do think that, and I actually do agree that they don't know what it is because they

520
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,440
choose not to know about it, but I think that it's not really the system so much themselves

521
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,600
as the content that they need to be informed about because when we were little, games didn't

522
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,720
look that major, you know what I mean?

523
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:59,040
True, we had Metal Gear and we had Splatterhouse, but it was all cartoony looking and now it's

524
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,880
so realistic that I think that there does need to be a degree of caution on the part

525
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,180
of the parents.

526
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,920
So in that case, I can see how they might be naive or misinformed or uninformed, but

527
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,880
I don't think it's the system so much that people really need a lot of education on.

528
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,720
What do you think?

529
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,200
So we finally got a winner of our stupid trivia thing, which-

530
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I could not guess.

531
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,040
Oh my God, it took forever.

532
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,600
Oh my God, I don't think I've made any secret about it.

533
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,640
So next email, oh it's to me.

534
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,040
Wait, which person sent in that last email?

535
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh, that was, I closed it, that was Martin from a bunch of dorks.com, let me see.

536
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,520
I remember, I read this email earlier in the week, sorry, I swear I was paying attention

537
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
to the chat room.

538
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I know.

539
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,320
But anyhow, no, you know what's funny about this?

540
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,760
When I was reading this, I kind of thought to myself, I was like, okay, as far as the

541
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,280
Atari 2600 generation goes, not everybody had that.

542
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,200
That's the thing, is that some of us were lucky enough to experience that, but even

543
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,280
I think Atari 2600, not everybody in our generation necessarily experienced.

544
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,520
It was still kind of something that only certain kids on the block had, and in some parts of

545
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,520
the country, you weren't as able to find these as easily.

546
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,800
It was still kind of a luxury item, let's put it that way, as video games are in general

547
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:33,080
today, but even when I say luxury item, an old system such as a Nintendo 8-bit system

548
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,560
or a PlayStation, those are so cheap now that lots of households have these old video games.

549
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,280
I mean when you met them at the flea market.

550
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,520
Right, but I think sometimes, I guess what I'm trying to say is that perhaps your perspective

551
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,800
is a little bit skewed because you were in this place in your generation where you were

552
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,660
able to have this luxury item, where I think a lot of parents, or people that are now parents

553
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,800
weren't exposed to this when they were young, nevertheless, even if they were, they remember

554
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:08,840
video games as being Pac-Man, combat, and not Grand Theft Auto, or Manhunt, it was much

555
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
different back then.

556
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,040
I think that the case with a lot of them is that not everyone has been the hardcore gamer

557
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,360
type, like me and my husband and our person who emailed us, or any of us in this room,

558
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,240
that once we grew up and started working, oh well that's child stuff, we put it away,

559
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,400
we don't do it anymore, well, we are more enlightened.

560
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,960
And it's as fine as a recreation item as any, and we understand that, but there's always

561
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,800
been, I think, when they were growing up with that type of thing, oh, well you're still

562
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,220
doing that.

563
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,360
My mom still says that to me, and I'm like, okay, you sat and played my Nintendo as much

564
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,080
as I did when I had it, so what's your excuse?

565
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:03,720
And now she wants a Wii, so, my mom wants a Wii, I think that's cute, but at any rate,

566
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,600
that's where I think the difference comes in.

567
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,200
And I think that it's right, those who don't know, it's because they choose not to know,

568
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,700
they haven't educated themselves, so they're all surprised, ew, and they don't have a right

569
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,600
to be.

570
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,880
We can move on now, sorry, sorry I was not paying attention fully the first time.

571
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,420
Aw, this makes me feel slightly better, J-Rod emailed, the one who has a really cool quote

572
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,080
about Olive Garden, says, hey DarkSakura, I know this isn't exactly a gaming question,

573
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,160
but you said you get a sinus infection every single year for New Year's Eve, yes, I'm in

574
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,440
the same boat as you, except whenever I have something like a concert to go to, I'll get

575
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,660
a sinus infection without question.

576
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,200
Someone could ask me to go see a concert tomorrow and I'll develop a sinus infection overnight,

577
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
woe is us.

578
00:33:52,560 --> 00:34:00,240
Yeah, well for me, I always get a bad sinus infection at the end of the year, and then

579
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,320
I get like the flu at the beginning of the year, so I think that they just decided to

580
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,560
gang up on me and give me both at once or some crap like that, and I have to read it,

581
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,320
I have to, Rob.

582
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,920
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the Never Ending Salads.

583
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Dude, the Olive Garden is the shit, don't forget Never Ending Breadsticks.

584
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,960
We should just go for salad one day.

585
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,520
Let's go to Olive Garden, cause you wanna come over for movie night, cause I have to

586
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,320
show you Stardust, cause I love that movie so much, let's do Olive Garden that night.

587
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,800
If I'm not completely broke.

588
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,840
We'll do dinner at the Olive Garden!

589
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Okay!

590
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Yee-haw!

591
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Last email!

592
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Dun dun dun.

593
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,160
If you can't pay, it'll be my treat, cause I want Never Ending Breadsticks.

594
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Okay.

595
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Alright.

596
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
And I'll get you after my payday.

597
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Sweet.

598
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
We'll go to Indian again.

599
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Yes.

600
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
I thought I was sick.

601
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
All I wanted was Indian food.

602
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Okay.

603
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
You know what, Ross Steel?

604
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Damn it.

605
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
I need to have it out with him for a minute here.

606
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Okay.

607
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Okay, Ross Steel.

608
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
God damn it.

609
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,040
You criticize Loki and his, you know, ways, which I, you know, to some extent I agree

610
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
with you.

611
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Fine.

612
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
You criticize me playing WoW.

613
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,900
Maybe I do play, maybe I do play too much WoW, but I draw the line at you criticizing

614
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,360
our love of the Olive Garden.

615
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,760
Dude, the Olive Garden is great.

616
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,520
The Olive Garden is wonderful, and damn you for thinking otherwise.

617
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,200
Although, although, although, one of these days I'm gonna have to take you to Pasquale's.

618
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,080
They're closed on Monday, but they're open on Tuesday.

619
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,240
I hope you get smited with Zuppa Tuscana.

620
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,920
He should get, um, get, uh, uh, Sangreid in the eye.

621
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Exactly.

622
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,200
That would be great.

623
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,760
May a deep-fried ravioli fall from heaven onto your head.

624
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,640
That sounds good too, I love those.

625
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,600
Um, this email is titled Yaris Made Better by Dragonforce.

626
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,480
Hey, O.L.R., I made this video on YouTube and got the inspiration from you guys and

627
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
girl.

628
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,720
I think you should actually start that seg-, uh, should actually start that segment.

629
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,080
There are a lot of crappy games out there and someone needs to make them watchable.

630
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,960
Anyway, I think you guys are great and I will keep saying that, cause you are, and keep

631
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
going strong.

632
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,400
To get the video, search for PKJR92, and I'm saying it out loud so that they know what

633
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,200
to look at, on YouTube, or Yaris, or Dragonforce, or even O.L.R.

634
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,840
Sincerely, PK, is it PKJR92?

635
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Sure why not.

636
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Okay.

637
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
Change is inevitable except from a vending machine.

638
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,920
Is the quote on there?

639
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,680
I've, I've heard that quote before.

640
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,360
And by the way, I did watch the video, and basically he took the trailer for Yaris, the

641
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,160
30 second trailer for Yaris, and put Dragonforce's music behind it, and it's surprisingly effective.

642
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,300
We do approve.

643
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,000
And I will find the link to that YouTube and post it in chat for you all to look at right

644
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
now.

645
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Well, not right, right now, but, you know.

646
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
You know, we got one last email.

647
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,080
I can hear Loki watching it right now.

648
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Yeah.

649
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
What do you think?

650
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Doesn't it make the game better?

651
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
We got one last email in.

652
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
All right, sorry.

653
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
We're getting a lot better with it.

654
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
From SakuraMax.

655
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,440
Hey, O.L.R., just email, just mailing to say Happy New Year.

656
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,360
I was running a little late since I didn't have computer access while the New Year special

657
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
was running.

658
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,300
This is from SakuraMax, the one who hasn't annoyed you people in a while, you happy?

659
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,920
And a person with mass gamer ADD, who, what to play next?

660
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
So, there we have it.

661
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,560
No more emails?

662
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Nope.

663
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Oops, sorry.

664
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm watching the video.

665
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,600
No, I was just going to add a little thing that says I approve.

666
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,400
But anyway, see now everybody in the chat room is like, you need to go have real Italian

667
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
food.

668
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
You need to go have real.

669
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
I have had real Italian food.

670
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I actually went to a little place in Sacramento.

671
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,120
I don't even know if you guys have heard of this, but I always thought I got a kick out

672
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
of this.

673
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,480
It's called Español, which means Spain, but it has really good Italian food.

674
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
So there's real Italian places all over.

675
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,400
I bet there are really, really good places in New York, though, and that's where they're

676
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
offering to take me.

677
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,260
So I'm not going to say no, especially if you're buying.

678
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:50,080
So anyhow, if you want to send emails, maybe profess your love for the Olive Garden here

679
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
on this program.

680
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,960
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

681
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,440
You know, if we're not the weather podcast, we're the food podcast, I swear to God.

682
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Anything but games.

683
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,720
That should be our new tagline.

684
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Anything but games.

685
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
We're tired of games.

686
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
That's right.

687
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
We've been doing games for like six years.

688
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,920
It's time for something new, don't you think?

689
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
All right.

690
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,440
We have a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get into tonight's

691
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
listless.

692
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,800
Loki, I'll let you go first.

693
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Yes.

694
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Anyways, let's see.

695
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,280
So if you've been playing Team Fortress 2, you may have been noticing that there are

696
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,600
some achievements missing for one of the classes you can play, and that would be the medic.

697
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,520
Well, that's going to be fixed hopefully pretty soon, because GermanSight was listening to

698
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,680
some brand new achievements, 36 new ones actually, for the medic.

699
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,480
So that's kind of neat.

700
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,240
And some of the other ones here, they had heal under fire, which is healing somebody

701
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,320
while on fire.

702
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,400
And let's see here, they have one for healing an engineer, healing teammates who've called

703
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:03,720
for a medic, Ubering a friend, and they have some other fun stuff like a bonesaw spy caller,

704
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,360
or I'm assuming that's killer, killing an enemy spy with a bonesaw.

705
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,160
Loki, I'm going to interrupt this story to show you the fly swimming for his life in

706
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,620
my coffee right now.

707
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,560
That fly is going to be totally hyped up on caffeine.

708
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,760
The more he swims, the more hyper he gets.

709
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,880
But, goddammit, that just ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee.

710
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,000
Go flies, asshole, asshole fly.

711
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,800
So yeah, hopefully we'll see some of those soon, maybe in an update or something.

712
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Even the chat room is like, Rob's derailing the show tonight, I am.

713
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,600
I do want to say this though, the native Spanish speakers in chat room are yelling at me and

714
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,560
screaming at me, and I should know better, but I only had two years of high school Spanish.

715
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,760
España is Spain, español is a Spaniard, or Spanish.

716
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,480
I don't know any Spanish, and I knew that.

717
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,360
Well sorry, donde esta el baño, that's what I remember.

718
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,560
Somebody on Ragnarok last night was spamming with donde esta la biblioteca.

719
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,200
Ew, they're telling me to drink the coffee, that's fucking gross.

720
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Ew, no.

721
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,160
What the hell is wrong with you people?

722
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,160
Just say that you are, if you don't have a camera.

723
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm drinking it right now, mmm, delicious, oh no, I feel that fly in my throat, it's

724
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
so weird.

725
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:38,600
Oh my God, he's turning into a fly now, that's so crazy.

726
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
So this is how we're starting off 2008, huh?

727
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,860
Dear everyone, Rob is crazy, the end.

728
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,080
We can get away with much more when Op 11 isn't running.

729
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,760
Maybe we'll never have a webcam again.

730
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,920
I can get away with a lot of stuff over here because the camera's never on me.

731
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,080
Well, one week I'm going to just surprise you, and it'll be Jamie Cam.

732
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
No way, I'll learn.

733
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
And it'll catch you picking your nose.

734
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,100
Or I'll put that camera up there and put another camera hidden somewhere that's actually the

735
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
real camera.

736
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
Oh, it's elaborate.

737
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
But it'll work.

738
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Candid camera.

739
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
All right, anyway.

740
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,160
I'll make that the day I throw up on you.

741
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,960
You know, a lot of folks have been saying this week with all the Xbox Live downtime,

742
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,320
I'm just going to go play PlayStation Network.

743
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,880
Sony's network is free, I'm just going to go play that.

744
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,920
Well, Sony has been polling customers in some of their Asian regions on ways that they can

745
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,960
improve the PC and PSP PlayStation Store.

746
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
One of the things that they're polling about?

747
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,760
A monthly subscription plan.

748
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Hmm.

749
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,800
So possibly is Sony looking into charging a monthly fee for the PlayStation Network?

750
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
But no.

751
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Possibly.

752
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Possibly.

753
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
All right, Loki, go ahead.

754
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,760
You're wanting to jump at the bit here to say it was.

755
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Sorry.

756
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm possibly going to be offering a monthly subscription for unlimited download content.

757
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
That's right.

758
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,200
Game tap for your PSP, basically.

759
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
But with Sony's games.

760
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I like that idea.

761
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,360
That actually isn't a bad idea at all.

762
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,800
I would hand it to Sony if that's the case.

763
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Of course, the trump on that, I guess, is that there isn't really a whole lot of download

764
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,320
content on the PlayStation Network.

765
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:19,200
Would be a definite way, though, to ensure income from the service on a regular basis.

766
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,920
I'd pay for that for a month, download everything, and then that's it.

767
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Just wait a few months.

768
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,280
What if it's contractual?

769
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,760
I don't think services like that are usually contractual, are they?

770
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Some are.

771
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Well, like game tap isn't it?

772
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
It's month-to-month.

773
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
All right.

774
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
All right.

775
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,400
Well, anyhow, I think it's about time for us to have a list list.

776
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
What do you guys think?

777
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Are we going to have a list list time?

778
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Sure.

779
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,000
All right.

780
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,720
List List is the game where we're going to create the definitive list for something.

781
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,040
You know, lists are big, especially around this time of year as one year has ended and

782
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
another begins.

783
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,200
Lists are big, so we're going to make our own list tonight.

784
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,880
I know we have a lot of new listeners since the last time we've done this because we used

785
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,040
to do this game a lot and we probably haven't played it in like four months.

786
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,840
So the way List List works is that we're going to have four panelists, myself, Loki Dark

787
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,640
Soccer and our Mystery Caller, and each of us are going to give you our top three things

788
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,440
that will match the list.

789
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,180
And then here's the twist.

790
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,840
Each one of us takes one thing off the list.

791
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,640
So you have 12 that gets taken down to eight.

792
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,800
So once we're down to eight, then the chat room votes on the top three and that will

793
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,040
bring us the definitive list.

794
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,840
And tonight's topic for the list, if you'd like to start posting your suggestions in

795
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,000
chat, here it is, gadget I'd like to see them announce at Consumer Electronics Show.

796
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,200
It doesn't have to be gaming related, just any type of tech gadget.

797
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,760
So the gadget you would like to see them announce at the Consumer Electronics Show.

798
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,840
It can be real, it can be crazy, anything you want, but that's it right here, tonight's

799
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
List List.

800
00:43:52,840 --> 00:44:01,320
So let us call the person who correctly guessed Dark Soccer's favorite color.

801
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,680
If I can find them in the list, I suddenly can't find them.

802
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:16,800
Live radio, folks.

803
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm making them call us.

804
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,040
Tell us a little bit about your favorite color.

805
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,840
My favorite color is very, very dark, very, very dark.

806
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:35,360
That's right, Dark Soccer's favorite color was matte.

807
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,720
Like my soul.

808
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
That's right.

809
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Just like your soul.

810
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,680
Okay, I tried calling the person and it's busy.

811
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,080
Oh, here we go.

812
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Are you there?

813
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,360
I'm here, yes I am.

814
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,320
Hooray, introduce yourselves, person who won.

815
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,760
This is SSJ100 Matt.

816
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,600
Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

817
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Hi.

818
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,840
I'm fine, all right.

819
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,440
Are you a big fan of Consumer Electronics Show?

820
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,120
Do you look forward to it every year?

821
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,920
I don't check out the keynotes or anything, but I like to watch what they got showing.

822
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,720
What do you think about what I said earlier in the show?

823
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,440
Is it true that most game nerds are somewhat of tech nerds too?

824
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,320
They like to see the latest tech stuff?

825
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:21,080
I think you kind of have to be, to tell you the truth, especially with the whole next

826
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
gen that's going on now.

827
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,400
All right, well tonight's topic is the gadget we would most like to see them announce at

828
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,640
the Consumer Electronics Show.

829
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
Do you have a list?

830
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Your top three?

831
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,080
Yeah, I certainly do.

832
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,160
All right, then we're going to kick it off here.

833
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Let's do the background music one more time just because it's so awesome.

834
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,000
And if at any time you need some suggestions, just look at our chat room.

835
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
They're lighting up in chat there with their suggestions.

836
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,580
All right, SSJ100 Matt, because you're on the phone, you get to start us off tonight.

837
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,240
What is your number three pick?

838
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,600
My number three pick is the Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0.

839
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,080
And why a Rez Trans Vibrator 2.0?

840
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,080
Because it will come out just in time for Rez HD.

841
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
That's a good point.

842
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,680
Rez HD is just around the corner.

843
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,680
That's a good idea.

844
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
Who wants to go next?

845
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I can go.

846
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,620
Dark Sakura, what is your number three pick?

847
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:24,920
My number three pick is a remote-directed EMP gun for jamming other people's cell phones.

848
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,880
And why, pray tell, do you need an EMP gun to jam people's cell phones?

849
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,080
For people driving like fucking retards on the road while talking with their phone glued

850
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,560
to their face, or people in front of me in line at the grocery store too busy talking

851
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,620
on their phone to pay attention to what the hell they're doing.

852
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,640
These people need to either die in a fire or hang up the phone.

853
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Or both.

854
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Preferably not.

855
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
I'd buy it.

856
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
Alright, that's actually a good idea.

857
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,840
Alright, I'll go next.

858
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,520
My number three pick, now I don't know if you've ever seen these, have you ever seen

859
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,520
those guns at like Target or things that shoot the big blast of air at people?

860
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,520
Yeah, the air cannons?

861
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,520
I don't know.

862
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,520
Air cannons?

863
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Airzookas.

864
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Airzookas.

865
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
Airzookas?

866
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,200
Okay, Airzookas are so awesome, but I want them to introduce like an Airzooka that will

867
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,320
actually blow somebody over.

868
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,160
Because it has so much power in it.

869
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,320
So I'm going to just call it the Supreme Airzooka.

870
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,360
And I don't know how electronic that gadget is, but I would imagine you'd need a little

871
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,240
battery power to make that thing work.

872
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,680
Alright, Loki, your number three pick.

873
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,320
My number three pick would be kind of a sequel to the iBo.

874
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,280
It's the iPer, and it would be, you know, a robotic cat.

875
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,680
They already have those.

876
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,720
Well, I want one from Sony, because, you know, I need my cat to be able to spy on my other

877
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,600
cat so I can see what's going on, you know.

878
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,080
Sony does have an iBo cat.

879
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,360
They have a gray one and a white one and a black one.

880
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,160
But he can put anything he wants on the list.

881
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,880
You take it off if you don't like it.

882
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
Alright.

883
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Fine.

884
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
What, iSloth?

885
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
I mean, yeah.

886
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
iFerret.

887
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,880
iFerret.

888
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
Alright, iFerret.

889
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
I go with iFerret.

890
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
You're going to change it to iFerret.

891
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
iFerret.

892
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,680
Alright, we're back to you, SSJ100Matt.

893
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,200
What is your number two pick?

894
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,880
My number two pick is an Apple handheld gaming system.

895
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,940
As is the device of many fanboys' dreams.

896
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,480
Are you an Apple fanboy?

897
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Not really.

898
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Oh, okay.

899
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,400
Well, why then, especially from non-fanboys, should Apple announce a handheld gaming system?

900
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,680
You know what, I think there should be another handheld gaming system in general that's not

901
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,640
the N-Gage.

902
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,760
As RawstealUT says, the Pippin Boy?

903
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Is that what it would be?

904
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Alright, DarkSakura, what's your number two pick?

905
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,520
A streaming TV for iPhone.

906
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,040
Like the YouTube channel, but like actual episodes of stuff.

907
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,840
I was going to say, YouTube's not good enough for you, huh?

908
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,680
Well, because you can't really find full episodes of stuff on YouTube, and it's like a limited

909
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
YouTube.

910
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,680
So they need to have like a show service, like for me, because I don't like to sit in

911
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,120
front of the TV because that's just boring to me.

912
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,840
You know, I have to have other stuff going on.

913
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,520
So having it on my iPhone, and I could watch for a little bit and then go do other crap,

914
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,320
and then come back and finish watching it when I'm done, would be perfect for me.

915
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,120
Alright, I'm actually going to take my number two pick from the chat room, because this

916
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,320
is a darn good pick, and we can be as still as we want, right?

917
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:30,280
So I'm going to suggest that a portal gun be unveiled as CES, so I can have my very

918
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,280
own portal gun.

919
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,160
Because seriously, who couldn't use a portal gun?

920
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,920
I could use one all the time.

921
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,320
So portal gun, there you go.

922
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,680
Loki, what would be the number two pick for you?

923
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,200
My number two pick also happens to come from Portal.

924
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,880
I would like the Aperture Science Sentry Bot.

925
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,400
You know, the ones that say, hello, and then turn the chute at you.

926
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,080
It'd be perfect for the neighbors.

927
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,000
Oh, those things are such assholes, but okay, yeah, those would be good guard dogs.

928
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,600
I'm surprised no one said a companion queue, but I guess we haven't gotten to the number

929
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,480
ones yet, so let's see.

930
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,720
SSJ100Matt, what is the number one thing you would like to see them debut at CES?

931
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,180
New gadget.

932
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:16,080
My number one pick is the Dreamcast 2.

933
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,920
Sega fanboy, eh?

934
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,800
You know what, I just want to see another Sega system.

935
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,600
I'm not really a fanboy, I just think, you know.

936
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,440
Don't you think it's about time to let go?

937
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
No.

938
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,680
Alright, fine.

939
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,840
Alright, Dark Soccer, what would be your number one thing you would like to see them

940
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,600
announce at CES?

941
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,640
Portable Xbox Live Arcade.

942
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,720
Portable Xbox Live Arcade, not a bad choice.

943
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,480
What made you decide to go with that?

944
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,280
Because remember when we were speculating what the interactivity between the Zune and

945
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,280
the Xbox was going to be and we were thinking, because they had the thing where you could

946
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,540
see which of your friends was online at the time and all that, and we had sort of joked

947
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,880
about they should have a way to bring your downloadable content with you.

948
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,840
I think that that would be really awesome.

949
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,200
Did you happen to see, just on a semi-related note, did you happen to see what the number

950
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,000
one most played Xbox Live Arcade game was in 2007, Courtney Major Nelson?

951
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,720
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

952
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,920
We were playing that the other night, too.

953
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Good times.

954
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Alright, my number one...

955
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
And Smash TV.

956
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,040
Smash TV is good times, too, but that's a little older.

957
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,600
My number one pick thing I would like to see them announce at CES, who wouldn't want one

958
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
of these in their house?

959
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,120
It would be the ultimate gadget.

960
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,880
I would like to see them unveil the holodeck.

961
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,160
Seriously, holodecks are awesome.

962
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,880
Alright, Loki, what would be your number one pick gadget you would like to see them unveil

963
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
at CES?

964
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,960
My number one pick has already been said, which was a portal gun, but that's alright,

965
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,400
because I didn't really have anything that I thought of.

966
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,560
But this would be kind of cool.

967
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,640
I know it's not practical in any sense whatsoever, but we haven't seen anything come from George

968
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,720
Foreman in a while, so I want a George Foreman grill that I can cook an entire cow on at

969
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,720
one time.

970
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:17,720
That would be great.

971
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,200
And it needs to clean the cow's guts out for you and everything.

972
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,800
What, pray tell, would the George Foreman entire cow grill be called?

973
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:36,720
It would be George Foreman's self-cleaning cow grill.

974
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,120
I don't know what to say.

975
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,440
This is going to be very hard, because this is a very good list of items that we've built

976
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
tonight.

977
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,160
Black Labs does the mean, lean, fat-reducing cow machine.

978
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,080
It would certainly reduce the size of those cows.

979
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,960
Uh, wow.

980
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,600
We said anything.

981
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,960
Very few of these items are actually gaming-related, I'd like to point out, but if it's the theme

982
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
of our podcast tonight.

983
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,040
Alright, SJ100 Matt, I posted the list there in private message for your reference.

984
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,080
Let me go ahead and read it as it stands now.

985
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,880
I'm going to kill the music, because this is the serious round, because we have twelve

986
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,840
items on the list, but four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

987
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,400
We have Res Trans Vibrator 2.0, Remote EMP Gun for jamming people's cell phones, Supreme

988
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,640
Airzooka, iFerret, Apple Handheld Gaming System, Streaming TV for iPhone, Portal Gun, Aperture

989
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:32,800
Science Sentry Bot, Dreamcast 2, Portable Xbox Live Arcade, Holodeck, and George Foreman's

990
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,080
self-cleaning cow grill.

991
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,120
Four of these things are not worthy of being on the list.

992
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,120
Uh, SJ100 Matt, what is not worthy of the list?

993
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,260
I'm going to go with the Airzooka.

994
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,120
You're a bastard, but that's alright.

995
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,840
I guess it's not that electronic, is it?

996
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Let me see.

997
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,960
Alright, Supreme Airzooka is not worthy of the list.

998
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,760
Yeah, that isn't really an electronic, although I guess you would need electronics in order

999
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,180
to build an aquaver person.

1000
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,520
But how awesome would that be?

1001
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Come on, seriously.

1002
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these things is not worthy of the list?

1003
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,800
Um, I'm going to say the Apple Handheld Gaming System.

1004
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,040
I was expecting Loki to do that.

1005
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,040
Just because...

1006
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,480
I was going to.

1007
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,240
Just because I think that Microsoft would do it better.

1008
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Oh, snap!

1009
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,600
Well, but there's also the iPhone, in which in a way they'll probably turn into a gaming

1010
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
system.

1011
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,480
And you know there's going to be stuff coming out on that eventually.

1012
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,500
I love my iPhone, don't get me wrong, but I think that when we have a company that's

1013
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,960
already established for having quality games out now, I think that's only, you know, inevitable.

1014
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,200
Alright, well I've got to get rid of this.

1015
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,400
I'm so sorry SSJ100 Matt, we're picking on you tonight, but Dreamcast 2 is not worthy

1016
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,680
of the list.

1017
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,880
Because it's not going to happen, kids.

1018
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,120
None of the things I listed were never going to happen.

1019
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,800
A holodeck has a better chance of happening at a future consumer electronics show, or

1020
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:06,720
Loki's fucking cow grill has a better chance than the Dreamcast 2.

1021
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,000
Loki, that being said, we're down to nine items on the list.

1022
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,800
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

1023
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,280
I'm going to have to take off Res Trans Vibrator.

1024
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:20,080
Well, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's one damn game, I mean, if you really...

1025
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
I'd buy it.

1026
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,280
They could just have a vibrator.

1027
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,520
I would like to point out, this doesn't happen very often, but the hosts have effectively

1028
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,720
eliminated all of SSJ100's lists.

1029
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

1030
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,000
Your airzooka got taken off?

1031
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,680
No, I know, but the other three, we eliminated SSJ's entire list.

1032
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
I forgot.

1033
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Okay, okay.

1034
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,160
No, sorry, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

1035
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,560
SSJ100 Matt, I'm very sorry.

1036
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,680
Apparently your choices just weren't worthy tonight.

1037
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,680
Yeah.

1038
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
I'm sorry.

1039
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
Are you going to cry about it?

1040
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,320
No, I'm going to go cut myself.

1041
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,400
All right, well, I'm sorry that things didn't go your way tonight, but hey, because you

1042
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,360
don't have any items on the list, we'll still let you vote for the winner.

1043
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
How's that sound?

1044
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
All right.

1045
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
That sounds good to me.

1046
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,480
All right, anything you want to plug before we hang up on you?

1047
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Nope.

1048
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,280
All right.

1049
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,280
Have a good one.

1050
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,280
Yep, you too.

1051
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,280
All right.

1052
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,720
I like it when they don't have anything to plug.

1053
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,720
Poor guy.

1054
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,680
He got his whole list eliminated by us three bastards.

1055
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,120
That hasn't happened very often.

1056
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,120
I can only think of one other time in list lists where somebody's entire list got eliminated.

1057
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,080
They were mad that I took off the ResTrans vibrator 2.0.

1058
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
Oh, well.

1059
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,520
How do you improve something that vibrates?

1060
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,080
I mean, seriously, it's not that complicated.

1061
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Poor power.

1062
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,080
All right.

1063
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Well, here we go.

1064
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,400
We are left with eight choices that have been deemed worthy of the list.

1065
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Here they are.

1066
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:45,160
The remote EMP gun for jamming people's cell phones, an iFerret, a streaming TV for the

1067
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:51,360
iPhone, a portal gun, an Aperture Science SentryBot, a portable Xbox Live Arcade, a

1068
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,280
Holodeck, and a George Foreman self-cleaning cow grill.

1069
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,780
Please send in your votes via private message for your number one and number two picks.

1070
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,280
If you don't label them one and two, I will assume that the first one is your number one

1071
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,280
pick.

1072
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,680
Send a private message to Sky in the chat.

1073
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,660
You have about 10 minutes while we go over these next few stories, so place your votes

1074
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,660
now.

1075
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,680
Meanwhile, we get back into the gaming news with Dark Sakura.

1076
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:27,320
We have our dear friend who is the god of third-party peripherals, mad cats, making

1077
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,740
instruments for Rock Band.

1078
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:37,140
They have a multi-year licensing agreement with MTV Games to do wired and wireless bass

1079
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:45,120
guitars and a percussion set that's got drumsticks and a microphone and stuff.

1080
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,400
So it looks like we're going to be seeing those come out eventually.

1081
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Awesome.

1082
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,760
This is the first half of 2008.

1083
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,640
Well, one place you probably won't be able to get a good deal on those would be at Best

1084
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:05,320
Buy and apparently they had a coupon that was in, I guess, one of the local papers for

1085
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,520
25% off of three toys.

1086
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,400
You basically buy one toy, save 10%, buy two, save 15, buy three, save 25%.

1087
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:23,160
Well, oddly enough, games are listed as under the toy section on the website.

1088
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:29,760
However, if you went into a Best Buy and tried to use that coupon, they would not let you

1089
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:38,920
because they said that games are not a toys and says, let's see here, apparently an employee

1090
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:46,240
at Best Buy said that games and game systems do not apply to that coupon because they're

1091
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,240
not toys.

1092
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,840
A toy would be like a doll.

1093
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:57,520
Best Buy, ripping people off yet again, awesome.

1094
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,280
So what do you think of that?

1095
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,200
Is video games a toy or not?

1096
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,600
If they're listed under their website as a toy, then yes, I think it would apply as a

1097
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,760
toy, but you've got to be more clear on that stuff.

1098
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,360
If you're just saying a toy does not apply to video games, that's what they should have

1099
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,720
had the fine print on the coupon, but they didn't, I think they should honor it, so that's

1100
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,720
their own fault.

1101
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,360
And the fact that they're saying, oh, I'm sorry, that's not a toy, well, it doesn't

1102
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,120
say it's not and on your website it says it is.

1103
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,680
I'm sure, though, if you looked it up on their website in the store, since it's a different

1104
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,640
website, their intranet, probably would be otherwise, but I don't know, they rip people

1105
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,680
off all the time with this kind of shit.

1106
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,440
Bait and switch, got to love it.

1107
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:55,040
All right, well, we're going to give just a couple more minutes for listless votes,

1108
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,600
so get those votes in now.

1109
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,640
We will announce the winner shortly and we're going to be taking your Skype calls on our

1110
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:06,400
Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and pretty

1111
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,880
soon you'll be able to call in from your PSP apparently, but I'm going to ask first, while

1112
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,480
we wait for any last minute votes, if there's any last minute stories that any of the hosts

1113
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,640
would like to cover tonight.

1114
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,360
There's not a whole lot.

1115
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:23,200
Sony of course introduced the 16 gigabyte memory stick duo for, you know, obviously

1116
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,480
cameras and PSP and stuff like that.

1117
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:32,440
That's a whole lot of movies on there, or a whole lot of games, depending on how you

1118
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,000
look at it.

1119
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,400
I don't know, that's pretty much it.

1120
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,200
It's been pretty dead.

1121
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,380
Yeah, it was a very slow week, I noticed that.

1122
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,800
We had less stories in our show role than usual, so that's all right.

1123
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Next week will be busier after CES, even though CES isn't really a games show, certainly a

1124
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,320
lot of the tech news.

1125
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,720
One thing, speaking of tech, I don't think this came up anywhere, which is strange.

1126
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,480
I thought we had it in our role, but I don't know if you heard, but Warner Brothers is

1127
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,580
sending their support of HD DVD, which is a huge blow to HD DVD supporters, which sucks

1128
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,580
because I'm one of them.

1129
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:12,700
They actually have an HD DVD player, but what can you do?

1130
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,840
In fact, it's the ramifications, because if you think about it, Warner Brothers also owns

1131
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,500
New Line, which is a huge studio.

1132
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,140
They did Lord of the Rings, right?

1133
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,160
This is just a huge blow, and they're saying that this could single-handedly turn things

1134
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,380
in Blu-ray's favor.

1135
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,280
But something to keep in mind, Paramount is still HD DVD exclusive, and I believe there's

1136
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,280
one other studio that's still-

1137
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,280
Universal?

1138
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,360
Yeah, HD DVD exclusive, so it isn't necessarily over yet, but that is a very big blow, even

1139
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,480
I'll admit that, because that means the Batman movies and stuff are going to be Blu-ray exclusive,

1140
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
which kind of sucks.

1141
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:51,100
It was also the thing Kmart did too, saying they weren't going to carry Blu-ray.

1142
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,840
Just one more last minute story, and this is kind of stupid, but apparently some guy

1143
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,980
shot his son over an Xbox 360 argument.

1144
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:08,440
Apparently a 17-year-old in Pennsylvania wanted his father to look at his Xbox 360 for some

1145
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,560
unknown reason, and the father refused.

1146
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,720
An argument ensued, resulting in the kid handing a rifle to his father, telling him to just

1147
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,220
go ahead and shoot him.

1148
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,480
So the father did.

1149
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,920
Now apparently the kid is sedated in a hospital with a bullet lodged in his skull, and the

1150
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,040
father is in jail.

1151
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,040
Talk about asshole.

1152
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,680
What's the kid doing with a rifle?

1153
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,840
That's one of the many questions I have.

1154
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:46,100
Hold on, you know what, I'm sorry, this means we need to fire up something for 2008 here.

1155
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:53,240
This is the inaugural stupid award of 2008, I'm sorry.

1156
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,000
Like I've heard these arguments before where, you know, somebody is yelling at somebody

1157
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,560
else and goes, I'm sure it says like, why don't you just shoot me, why don't you just

1158
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,560
kill me?

1159
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,640
Like, that doesn't mean you actually shoot them.

1160
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,520
Have you ever heard of like a metaphor?

1161
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:16,080
Congratulations, what's this guy's name?

1162
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,080
Uh, they didn't have his name.

1163
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,800
So Unknown Dead 17.

1164
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,080
I saw it somewhere, wait, I gotta look at this, I know I saw this somewhere, you have

1165
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,220
to go to the original site that ran it, because I want to say this happened not that far from

1166
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,120
where I've been in Pennsylvania before.

1167
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,800
Let's see, where the hell was it?

1168
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:48,160
Uh, person, let's see, 60 year old James Stanley Niedasek shot his 17 year old son.

1169
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,840
So congratulations James Stanley, I can't pronounce your last name, you win the first

1170
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,800
stupid award of 2008, courtesy of Orange Launch Radio, for shooting your son in an argument.

1171
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,800
Ass.

1172
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:06,440
Uh, there's a release date for the Xbox 360 and Wii versions of Bully out in the UK, March

1173
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
7th.

1174
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,160
We're getting that here too, I believe, right?

1175
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,240
Yeah, it's around March.

1176
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
Sweet-ish.

1177
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,600
This should be the scholarship edition over here.

1178
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,440
Gonna be very nice.

1179
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,680
Alright, shall we get to tonight's listless winners?

1180
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,760
It was neck and neck tonight, only one vote separated number one and two.

1181
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,800
But everything got a vote tonight, which doesn't happen very often in listless, but somebody

1182
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,560
in chat wanted a little bit of everything.

1183
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,660
But in the end there could be only three, so here it is, your top three gadgets you

1184
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,880
would like to see them unveil at CES.

1185
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,560
This is the definitive list, no arguing, it's a very scientific method we use here, it's

1186
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,840
done.

1187
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:56,040
The number three thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is the holodeck.

1188
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:02,880
The number two thing you'd like to see them debut at CES is a portal gun, meaning the

1189
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,720
number one thing you'd like to see at CES either this year or 2009, the George Foreman

1190
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,760
self-cleaning cow grill.

1191
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
Awesome.

1192
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,720
It bakes the whole fucking cow.

1193
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,320
Beautiful.

1194
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,880
Not bad for a last minute pick to fill in the other number one.

1195
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,280
Now your only trouble is where do you get a cow?

1196
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,160
That's the only downside.

1197
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,900
Tip it over and then put it in a bag, I don't know.

1198
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,600
That's it, you tip it over into the grill.

1199
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,360
Nice.

1200
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,400
Alright.

1201
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,800
Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line of calls then, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

1202
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to go ahead and give us a call.

1203
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,640
We'll take your calls, we'll take a few of those.

1204
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,800
RossdielUT says, Loki, you can get a cow carcass at Publix Easy while here in Florida.

1205
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,200
I don't even know what that is, to be honest.

1206
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,960
Do you know what that is?

1207
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,960
Nope.

1208
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,600
I know, I have no idea what that is.

1209
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
What?

1210
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Oh.

1211
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,960
You have to give this to me now while we're trying to take calls on Skype.

1212
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,960
Alright.

1213
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
Yes, I had to.

1214
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1215
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,080
Hi, this is RossdielUT.

1216
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,080
Hello, RossdielUT.

1217
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
Hi.

1218
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Friend, buddy, pal.

1219
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Hey there.

1220
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,080
What's on your mind?

1221
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,080
Hey.

1222
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,680
Oh, nothing much.

1223
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:27,120
First off, Publix is a supermarket chain over here in the Southeast.

1224
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,520
Very big.

1225
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,340
Very big supermarket chain.

1226
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,340
They don't have those here.

1227
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:35,880
I mean, you can get, like, a lot of meat at the store, but you can't get the whole damn

1228
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
cow.

1229
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,240
Yeah, I've seen people, I used to work at a Publix once, and yeah, I used to see people

1230
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
getting the cow carcasses.

1231
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,240
Wow.

1232
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,240
I guess that's what they do for Thanksgiving instead of a turkey.

1233
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,240
I don't know.

1234
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:52,720
That's something I'd like to see them doing on Supermarket Sweep, putting five of those

1235
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,800
cow carcasses right in the car.

1236
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,760
You'd need more than one cart, man, those things are fucking huge.

1237
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,960
Well that's how they did it on the show, they'd fill up one cart and throw it to their partner

1238
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,600
and they'd get another cart, alright, anyway.

1239
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,640
Would Supermarket Sweep not be the best video game ever?

1240
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,640
I'm sorry?

1241
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,400
I'm sorry, would Supermarket Sweep not be one of the best video games ever?

1242
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,960
Like, that's the kind of shit they need to be doing for Xbox Live.

1243
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,960
Seriously.

1244
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,440
That would be a good Xbox Live or kid game, actually.

1245
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,920
I hope Microsoft's listening.

1246
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
I hope you guys are listening.

1247
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,360
Alright, what else is on your mind, Ross Deal?

1248
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,200
Let's see, in reaction, a couple of things, actually.

1249
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:37,720
In reaction to the whole Warner Bros. New Line thing, the CES HD DVD press conference

1250
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
got cancelled.

1251
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:44,680
I heard, it's like they've got their tail between their legs going, argh argh argh argh.

1252
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,280
Well it's pretty big when you think about it.

1253
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:54,840
There's only like three exclusive HD DVD studios left, and Paramount, like I said in the chat,

1254
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,000
they're only exclusive because Microsoft paid them a boatload of money.

1255
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,620
I have a bad feeling HD DVD's time is running out, and it kind of makes me sad because I

1256
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:08,740
am an HD DVD owner, but here's my question is, I read somewhere that porn was suddenly

1257
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:14,360
supporting both HD DVD and Blu-ray, but I seem to remember we covered an article.

1258
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,640
I've seen pornographic Blu-rays on offer, I've seen them in places.

1259
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,560
I could have sworn on this program last year we had a story about that the porn industry

1260
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,960
had gone with HD DVD for some reason.

1261
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,480
I don't remember the reason, but they went with HD DVD.

1262
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,960
Why did they go back on that?

1263
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,800
Because I always said, whoever gets porn wins the war, and now that porn is going to Blu-ray,

1264
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,960
I'm like, it's over.

1265
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,960
Well the problem with porn really is that it's not like like a DVD, now you see porn

1266
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,680
really moving into the downloadable space, so it's perhaps not as important for the

1267
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:51,040
disc this time around, because it's pretty much all over the internet, there's a site

1268
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,040
everywhere for it.

1269
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,040
You know what I mean?

1270
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,960
It's not like Xbox Live Marketplace is going to suddenly offer porn, although they ought

1271
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,960
to.

1272
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,840
Well, not on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1273
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,760
Why not?

1274
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:07,760
Don't they have a whole slew of horror films that are like the most supreme horror of horror

1275
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
gore fest slash films?

1276
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,760
I mean, if you're going to have one pornographic extremity, why not have another?

1277
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,920
I would consider the amount of violence in those films pornographic to an extent.

1278
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Why not some titties?

1279
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,800
You could say the same thing about Wal-Mart.

1280
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,760
They carry those movies and they don't carry porn.

1281
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:32,800
Microsoft has an image to protect, but what I was about to say is that you can't go five

1282
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:39,580
steps in either direction online without dipping into a pay site, so that's where I see a lot

1283
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:45,120
of the pornographic market going is online, because you don't have to worry about people

1284
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,720
picketing in front of porn shops or whatever.

1285
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,360
It's a lot less trouble than having brick and mortar.

1286
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,520
I'm picketing in front of your internet.

1287
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,560
I know why they can't do porn on Xbox Live, because it would shut it down again.

1288
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,120
I mean, do you think the holidays were bad?

1289
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,440
I mean, the day porn is released on Xbox Live, the internet is going to die.

1290
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,520
Oh, then you'll really see those stupid stories.

1291
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,560
It's a gateway to porn, because none of the parents are going to be...

1292
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:17,360
Well, the problem is they already did that with the Wii, so you remember that a few months

1293
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,360
back.

1294
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:24,840
My child went to XTube on the Wii.

1295
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,760
Anything with any sort of internet capability is going to have pornography.

1296
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:34,400
My concern is if it ever went to Xbox Live or a cage, you'd have a bunch of people go

1297
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,080
on and watch some porn, and they go play Halo or Uno with their cameras, and you see them

1298
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,080
all.

1299
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,980
Well, the PlayStation Network is going to get porn pretty soon, with Home coming out

1300
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:49,560
there, and you're going to be able to put a TV in your home, and you can put porn and

1301
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,800
stream it off of your, well, 88 hard drive.

1302
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,060
I bet anything you're only going to get to put pre-selected video clips that just happen

1303
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,720
to be clips from Sony's latest movies and TV shows.

1304
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,520
No, it's going to be stuff that's off your hard drive.

1305
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
It's going to be anything, yeah.

1306
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Really?

1307
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

1308
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

1309
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,520
Anything on your hard drive, yeah.

1310
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,520
Any available at home.

1311
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Yeah.

1312
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,640
Are you going to have a virtual porn house in Home?

1313
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
Sure, why not?

1314
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
No, it's going to be fun.

1315
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,700
Oh, what I want to know is are they going to be, you throw cocks at people in Home.

1316
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,360
Are they going to throw cocks at people?

1317
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,360
Second Life.

1318
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,720
Jamie, did you have something you wanted to say to this?

1319
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Exactly, everything else is Second Life.

1320
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,800
I was just going to say Walmart wasn't exactly the best thing to bring up, since they actually

1321
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,100
sold censored versions of movies.

1322
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,320
Not here.

1323
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,480
I totally agree with the point that Wal-Mart's just as bigoted as everybody else in this

1324
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,920
sense that they're going to sell the violent movies, but heaven forbid our children see

1325
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,920
titties!

1326
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,040
Oh no!

1327
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,000
Heaven forbid we teach them responsible sex at the young age!

1328
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,960
Wal-Mart is a huge contradiction.

1329
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,720
They'll sell the unrated movies gladly, they'll sell the M-rated games gladly, but they won't

1330
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,280
sell porn and they won't sell music with explicit lyrics.

1331
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,160
I never understood that.

1332
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
Never.

1333
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:04,760
I will never forget that fucking Sheryl Crow, of all people, got banned from Wal-Mart because

1334
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:09,720
she said in one of her songs she had a lyric about somebody buying a gun at a Wal-Mart

1335
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,720
store.

1336
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,040
Well, you can, in fact, buy guns at Wal-Mart stores.

1337
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,040
Yes, you can.

1338
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,040
They have a hunting section.

1339
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,920
So Wal-Mart fucking bans Sheryl Crow, because Sheryl Crow poses this huge threat to society.

1340
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,880
Like what's going to happen, you know?

1341
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,720
She does, however, pose a huge threat to good music.

1342
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:30,240
You know, when I think of hard fucking core music, I think of Sheryl Crow.

1343
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Exactly.

1344
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:40,000
Anyway, last thing before I go, you'll be happy to know that long after it's been released,

1345
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,120
they're releasing a Stranglehold map pack.

1346
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,120
I'd actually heard about that.

1347
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,400
I got the email from Midway, except I never played Stranglehold in the first place, so

1348
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,400
I forgot about that.

1349
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,880
I was about to say, I mean, it wasn't exactly a best-selling game.

1350
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,740
Why would anyone care at this point?

1351
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,000
Usually they were already making it, thinking the game was going to be huge, and now it's

1352
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,120
just kind of one of those wah-wah kind of releases, you know?

1353
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,240
Yeah, they kind of have to at this point, huh?

1354
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Yeah.

1355
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,280
And if you spent the resources on it, if you can make 50 bucks off it, why not?

1356
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,280
Exactly.

1357
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,840
It's better than nothing.

1358
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,600
Try to recover the cost of the people making it.

1359
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,840
All right, well, Rossdiel YouTube, we've got to let you go to take some other calls, but

1360
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,840
thank you very much for your call.

1361
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,840
Have a good one, man.

1362
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,840
Always a lot of fun.

1363
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,840
Bye-bye.

1364
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,840
Bye-bye.

1365
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,640
I think it's so funny, Rossdiel YouTube, because, you know, he's such a critic in chat

1366
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,280
and says a lot of, but when you get him on the phone, he's such a nice guy, oh, laugh

1367
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,280
a lot.

1368
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,280
No, it's cool.

1369
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,280
All right, let's take some more calls.

1370
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,280
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1371
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,280
Who's this?

1372
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,280
Hello.

1373
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,280
This is Arke Rieper in chat.

1374
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,280
Hi.

1375
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,280
How are you?

1376
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,280
I'm fine.

1377
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,280
What's on your mind?

1378
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,420
I'm calling from Sweden, actually.

1379
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,920
You're calling from Sweden?

1380
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,600
It's got to be like four in the morning over there.

1381
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,000
I think I'm the first one to actually call from Sweden, maybe.

1382
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I think so.

1383
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think he is.

1384
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,160
We've had people in, like, England, and I want to say we've had South America, definitely,

1385
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Mexico.

1386
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
Argentina.

1387
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,160
Mexico.

1388
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,160
I want to say we've had another...

1389
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,160
You've had Denmark.

1390
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,160
Denmark was it, but we haven't had Sweden.

1391
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,160
Well, welcome to the show.

1392
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,320
Well, good evening, so to say.

1393
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,800
Well, I don't know.

1394
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:20,960
I was a bit pissed last year, since in your years of years, your best of year, since never

1395
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,440
ever spoke about that the expansion for World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade, actually came

1396
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:37,660
out, but then again, I just was like, wait, did that actually got released last year?

1397
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,440
It seems like it was a long time ago.

1398
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,440
You're right.

1399
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,800
That did come out in January, and as far as PC games go, that was a huge title.

1400
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,600
Now, in all fairness, and to cover our rears a little bit, we did talk about BlizzCon.

1401
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,280
We talked about the wrath of Lich King.

1402
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:58,240
I remember, I don't know actually when I got hooked on your show for some reason, but I've

1403
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:06,180
been listening to your show like, I would say, maybe a year and a half, but then again,

1404
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:14,600
I had some, what is it, since I've upgraded platform from going from Macintosh to PC nowadays,

1405
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:22,960
so I've had, what is it, one and a half year that didn't go that well.

1406
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,960
Do you play WoW yourself?

1407
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,760
Are you really big into Burning Crusade?

1408
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:38,480
I would say that I'm a huge WoW player, since that's basically almost the only thing I played.

1409
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,960
What did I buy games last year?

1410
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:51,320
It was Burning Crusade, and I tried out Eve Online this summer, and then I bought the

1411
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,320
Orange Box.

1412
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,320
Good choice.

1413
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
Good taste.

1414
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,800
And that I share with games, really.

1415
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,880
Here's my question, though, to you, because I notice you're mentioning a lot of PC games,

1416
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,280
and we always like to ask our callers who call in from other countries, because I know

1417
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,240
a lot of times here on this program we focus on, here's what's happening in Japan, here's

1418
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,680
what's happening in the U.S.

1419
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,080
We try to cover the overseas stuff, but sometimes it's best to kind of hear it firsthand, what

1420
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,760
the gaming scene's like overseas.

1421
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,760
For instance, we've kind of heard from callers that have called from Latin and South American

1422
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,360
countries talk about that a lot of the scene is very expensive there.

1423
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,960
What would you say the gaming scene is like in Sweden?

1424
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,720
Is it easy to walk into a store and pick up the latest and greatest game or console, or

1425
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,720
is it a challenge?

1426
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,960
That's like a piece of cake.

1427
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,240
The only problem is that, well, what?

1428
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:53,920
Games are currently quite fun in one way, since the PS3 is, for the cost of a PS3, you

1429
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:00,860
can actually get a decent computer and start playing WoW or Orange Box, whatever you want

1430
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,860
to.

1431
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,860
Interesting.

1432
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,040
Well, they do say the PS3 is supposed to be a computer.

1433
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,800
Well, at least they keep going back and forth on that.

1434
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Yes, it's a computer.

1435
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,800
No, it's not.

1436
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:16,400
And still, I, what is it, they, there was a argument that really that the cell engine,

1437
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:22,360
which is in the PS3, is not even made for games, so.

1438
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:28,680
So I'm assuming that the PlayStation 3 sales in Sweden are similar to that they are here,

1439
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,680
where there's quite still a big pile of them at the store waiting to be moved.

1440
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,680
Yeah.

1441
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,160
Yeah, it really is.

1442
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,200
But then it was, oh.

1443
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,760
So I guess maybe we aren't so different after all.

1444
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,940
When you look at that.

1445
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:53,600
Maybe you want to cut me off right now, but anyway, I just want to say, Sky, what is it?

1446
01:17:53,600 --> 01:18:00,480
You have a 7E Druid, which I'm quite impressed in one way, since, well, what?

1447
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:10,920
In a way, just, well related, I've played World of Warcraft on US servers for one year,

1448
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,560
and I never even got to level 40.

1449
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,480
Are you playing on a PvP server?

1450
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,960
That's probably why.

1451
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,460
PvP servers was, well, was it, it was Warsong.

1452
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:34,320
But here's the thing, I've developed the infamous Altiholic disease, which is that you made,

1453
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:41,160
well, one character, and then you get it to get a character of like 35 or something, and

1454
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:46,360
then you play another one, and then you repeat that for quite some time.

1455
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:52,200
So basically you have WoW ADD is what we would call it, where you just, you can't focus on

1456
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,200
one character.

1457
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,640
I have plenty of friends who do that same thing.

1458
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,320
I was like, I haven't got a character past level 8.

1459
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:09,920
Although, really, I actually have 63 Mage nowadays.

1460
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,720
And well, what is it?

1461
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:18,480
When the Burning Crusade came out, I switched to European servers.

1462
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:24,400
So well, they made it a lot easier to level.

1463
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:33,000
But then again, when the 2.3 patch later, that came out just a few months, one month

1464
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,240
ago or something, not even that, made it a lot easier to level.

1465
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,360
You know, I don't know what it is, and I do have to wrap up and get going soon, but I

1466
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,820
will say this about Druid is that what's amazing about that class is it's one of the last classes

1467
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:49,180
I tried playing in WoW, and I think the reason I've stuck with it so long is that you really

1468
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:52,760
can do a little bit of everything as a Druid, and that's why I have so much fun with it.

1469
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:59,360
Because I can spam Moonfire or whatever, but then I can heal, or in a pinch I can flip

1470
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,120
in a bear form and tank, even though I'm not very good at it because I'm spec'd for balance.

1471
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,280
But you know, it's kind of interesting.

1472
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,240
So yeah, well I know how fun Druid is.

1473
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,320
I got one at level 45 at 2.3.

1474
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,960
Now you need to take it a little higher.

1475
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:24,680
They were speaking about what was the New Year's promises or stuff, and my problem is

1476
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:30,200
that I will say that I will get one character at level 70, but then I just realized that

1477
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:38,360
there's this new MMO that's been announced that's called Warhammer Age of Reckoning,

1478
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:52,520
which is highly anticipated in my ranks, which is Weehoo.

1479
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,120
Well it sounds like it could be a big year into 2008.

1480
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,900
Hopefully we don't neglect to mention that at this year's end special, or we might get

1481
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,000
another call berating us.

1482
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1483
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,440
Anyway, we've got to wrap up.

1484
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,360
I don't mind letting the international calls go on a long time, though, because I know

1485
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:12,400
you've got to stay up very, very late to listen to our program, and we appreciate it.

1486
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,400
But thank you so much.

1487
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:19,000
Do you have any other quick final thoughts, things you want to share with our listeners?

1488
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I don't know.

1489
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,920
Just keep on the way to the show.

1490
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,040
It's really one of the greatest I have heard so far.

1491
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,040
Well thank you.

1492
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
I appreciate that.

1493
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,240
Hats off for you.

1494
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,080
Appreciate it very much.

1495
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,640
Thank you so much for staying up and listening to us, a true fan.

1496
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,280
Take care, buddy.

1497
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:50,880
It is actually my second attempt in listening to you live.

1498
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,560
I'm usually not, well since it's the hour, difference is such a huge difference.

1499
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:01,120
One of these days, we're going to have to do a show at noon to give our British, not

1500
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:05,280
just British, but overseas listeners a break, you know, everybody over in those time zones,

1501
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,280
you know.

1502
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Maybe we'll have to.

1503
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,280
Sweden, Denmark, all of them.

1504
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,280
All right.

1505
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,280
I've got to let you go.

1506
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,640
Thanks so much for the call, though.

1507
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,480
We love hearing from the international folks.

1508
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,480
It's awesome.

1509
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,760
We'll do one more call if you've got any other calls coming in.

1510
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
Hi.

1511
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,760
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1512
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,760
Who's this?

1513
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,760
Hey, it's Ron.

1514
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,760
What's up, everybody?

1515
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,760
Hey.

1516
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,760
How you doing, Rama?

1517
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,760
I'm doing good.

1518
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm finally recovering from my holidays, and so how about you guys?

1519
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm doing fine.

1520
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,160
Thank you for the card, by the way, on a personal note.

1521
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,160
Hey, no problem.

1522
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,440
Jamie, did you get your card yet?

1523
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,620
I have to check the mail.

1524
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:39,240
We have a pile of it, and I've been sort of too sick to look at anything.

1525
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,960
You know what's hilarious, Rama?

1526
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,300
Your car actually got wet because of the storms.

1527
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,640
The rain got in my mailbox.

1528
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,960
Isn't that crazy?

1529
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,960
No.

1530
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,840
That happened to Dan's friend, Will.

1531
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,000
He was expecting the title to his truck, and he found it floating in the gutter.

1532
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Oh, my God.

1533
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,240
Well, it wasn't that bad.

1534
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:00,480
It's just that the wind actually blew open the little flap, and water got in there.

1535
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,480
It's crazy.

1536
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,480
So, anyway, sorry, Rama.

1537
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,480
Enough about me boo-hooing.

1538
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,480
What's on your mind?

1539
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,480
Not much.

1540
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,480
I'll make this brief.

1541
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,960
I finally got a chance to play Rock Band.

1542
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,760
Oh, what did you think of Rock Band?

1543
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,760
It is great.

1544
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,760
It has got to be one of the greatest games I've played all year.

1545
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,480
I am probably one of the only people on the planet that thinks that Guitar Hero 3 has

1546
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,880
a better song list than Rock Band.

1547
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,880
I don't know why.

1548
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,280
I'm just not as into the songs in Rock Band.

1549
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,560
Although, I will say, Rock Band has some great download songs.

1550
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,400
I actually like that Attack song a lot, the one you told me to get.

1551
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,000
I actually really like that song.

1552
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,160
Rock Band's growing on me, but here's my question, because I was just thinking about this earlier

1553
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,160
today.

1554
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,180
I know it's your call and everything, but I'm deflecting.

1555
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:46,440
What do you think they could do for Rock Band 2?

1556
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,360
I have more instruments.

1557
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,160
A keyboard would be nice for Rock Band 2.

1558
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,480
That I would like to see happen.

1559
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,760
You know what I think they should do for Rock Band 2?

1560
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,000
Not have a Rock Band 2.

1561
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,120
I think they should come out with Pop Band.

1562
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:06,520
And I think in Pop Band they should get rid of maybe the guitar, lose the guitar and put

1563
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,860
the keyboard in instead or something.

1564
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,360
Or lose the bass and put it in the keyboard.

1565
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,360
I don't know.

1566
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:15,960
But I would love to see them do a Pop Band game, although I don't know how that would

1567
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,960
go over.

1568
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,560
Well, if they do a Rock Band 2, maybe one of the controls could be a double axe handle

1569
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,560
controller.

1570
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,240
That would be pretty rad to have, because that's what my character has.

1571
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,440
I have a giant double axe controller with a big unicorn on it, because you can put stickers

1572
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,440
on a guitar.

1573
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,440
So I put a big unicorn on it.

1574
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,000
It's awesome.

1575
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Dan has the tattoo of the snake coming out of the pants.

1576
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Nice.

1577
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,720
And every time he shows it off, he goes, what's a trouser snake?

1578
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:48,120
SSJ100 Matt says Polka Band, and Dark Knight says, I gotta have cowbells?

1579
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,120
If there's a Polka Band, it's gotta be Weird Al.

1580
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:56,960
I think I was telling you about this the other day, that our friend was, while she was highly

1581
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:04,000
intoxicated, by the way, walking around with a cup and a pencil playing cowbell.

1582
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,960
That's great.

1583
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,960
So as a long time, because I know you've been a long time fan of Konami's Bimani series

1584
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:17,080
and DDR and all that stuff, and I know that's how you kind of first came to our station.

1585
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:23,200
What do you think Konami could do to kind of step it up and give Harmonix a little competition?

1586
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:30,000
Well, actually bring over more of the Bimani games and fine-tune it more for American audiences

1587
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,880
instead of- Did we lose him?

1588
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,880
Hello?

1589
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,880
Oh, I'm right here.

1590
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,880
Sorry.

1591
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:37,880
Sorry.

1592
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,800
Fine-tune it for American audiences instead of-

1593
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:44,400
Instead of putting in rehashes of some of the Japanese songs, like with DDR.

1594
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:49,600
Since I enjoy DDR, I would like to see more American songs in the game.

1595
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:55,000
That's just me personally, but I know a lot of the die-hard to leave it the way it is.

1596
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,880
Have you heard about that new Konami Bimani game?

1597
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,560
It looks like it's Ju-Beat, but it's pronounced differently.

1598
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,560
I think it's U-Beat.

1599
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
Yeah, U-Beat.

1600
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,560
Have you heard about U-Beat?

1601
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,880
No, I have not.

1602
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,160
It's a new Bimani game that's coming out over there.

1603
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:15,240
It was just location tested a couple weeks ago, and it looks like it uses 16 monitors

1604
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,240
as the buttons.

1605
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,240
I don't know.

1606
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,560
It looked like a funky version of Whac-A-Mole to me.

1607
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,560
Yeah.

1608
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,560
Isn't that kind of what it looked like?

1609
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,560
It was like Whac-A-Mole to music.

1610
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,560
It's like a touch screen or something.

1611
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,280
That might be kind of interesting.

1612
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,280
That would be freaking awesome.

1613
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,360
Except how can you play that on a home console?

1614
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,180
So it's something that's only going to be in arcades, if anything.

1615
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,180
Pretty much.

1616
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,520
One of the things I've noticed is that when me and my roommate, when we play Guitar Hero,

1617
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,360
it's like, eh, eh, we have to trade off controllers back and forth.

1618
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,920
There's just more than one person here.

1619
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,760
I mean with Rock Band, my friend brought it up, it was like for the Christmas party, it

1620
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,120
was like the ultimate party game.

1621
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:53,360
You have a lot of people, you got WarioWare, you got the Mario parties, but you break out

1622
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:58,060
Rock Band, everybody will just show up and you start playing, you're switching off controllers

1623
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,060
back and forth.

1624
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:03,800
You're just getting together, having a good time, and well, when we have Rock Band, we

1625
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:09,880
called it Rockstar because right on the other side of the room, we have all the alcohols,

1626
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,280
all the mixers all set up, so we were definitely having fun with it.

1627
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,640
I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the chat room and of course Dark Tetsuya's got to go and

1628
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,920
be smart and says a DS version would work for U-Beat.

1629
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:28,600
Anyhow, Rama, I got to let you go, wrap up the show here, any quick final thoughts?

1630
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,800
Two quick things.

1631
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:35,520
My game of the year was Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass, and worst game of the year, Role

1632
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,440
vs. SmackDown 08.

1633
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,440
Why those two?

1634
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,240
For me to get into a game, you have to take my full attention.

1635
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:48,720
Any game that can help me kill a 45-minute train ride from homework vice versa is definitely

1636
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,560
up in my book, and Phantom Hourglass was one of the few DS games that were able to have

1637
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,560
me do that.

1638
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,440
As for Role vs. SmackDown 08, I'm an average wrestling fan, I just didn't like the fact

1639
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:04,000
that they took so much out of the Wii version compared to the other versions of the game.

1640
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,360
Basically, the Wii got the gimped version of the game.

1641
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,640
That's why it gets worst game of the year.

1642
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,040
I just had to ask because you're one of the two people who didn't say Yaris, so I just

1643
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,040
had to ask.

1644
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,040
I don't have a 360 yet.

1645
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,040
Ah, there you go.

1646
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:19,200
All right, well, DJ Rama asks, we got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling

1647
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,200
us always.

1648
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,200
Take care.

1649
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,200
All right, you too.

1650
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,200
Bye-bye.

1651
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Bye.

1652
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,200
That's going to do it for calls tonight.

1653
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,200
We've had a lot of very long calls tonight, but that's all right.

1654
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,080
We heard we had some callers we haven't heard from in a while, callers we hear from regularly,

1655
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,880
Rama, and a caller from overseas that we never heard from before who stayed up very, very,

1656
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,080
very late to listen to our program.

1657
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,280
It's quarter to six over there, right?

1658
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,160
We ought to let him go to bed, so we probably should wrap things up.

1659
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:45,280
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1660
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,720
And Dark Sakura, we'll start with you, your final thought.

1661
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,460
Bye.

1662
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,960
My final thought is I'm going to get a bug lamp for this room and every time it goes

1663
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,520
bzzt, I'm going to laugh.

1664
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,520
Loki.

1665
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,120
Big rigs over the road racing is really, really, really bad.

1666
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,760
All right.

1667
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,760
I'll take your word for it because I am not going to play it, although not as bad as I

1668
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,760
thought I would be.

1669
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,760
All right.

1670
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,800
I think there's some where those Wii conspiracy games are even worse.

1671
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,920
Thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent

1672
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,920
radio.

1673
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,920
We appreciate it.

1674
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,600
We would be nowhere without you guys and your word of mouth.

1675
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,880
So if you like what you've heard, please tell two people about our show, spread the word

1676
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,880
about Orange Launch Radio.

1677
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,000
If you tell two people, then slowly we'll take over the world because we don't have

1678
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,780
any magazines or websites to get million views a month that we can advertise on.

1679
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,280
We literally broadcast out of my garage.

1680
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,220
So it's independent radio at its finest.

1681
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:48,000
If you don't feel so inclined to tell people, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes

1682
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,320
or Digg or Yahoo podcasts or any of those sites because that works too.

1683
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,120
Anyhow, thank you guys so much for tuning in this week.

1684
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:01,840
Next week we will be back and we'll have more gaming news and more stuff to come in the

1685
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,540
year 2008.

1686
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:05,800
Hopefully some surprises here on the program.

1687
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,900
I was trying to book some guests for the upcoming shows.

1688
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,080
So hopefully we'll have some of those in the next few weeks.

1689
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,560
So more to come.

1690
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,240
Until then, I'm Rob Roberts.

1691
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,440
She's Dark Sakura.

1692
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,520
He's Loki.

1693
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,520
And we're out.

1694
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:23,040
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
