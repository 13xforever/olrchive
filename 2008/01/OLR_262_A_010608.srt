00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Tonight, January 6th, 2008, we'll lose the bound of another Xbox 360 model, Rock Band

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,480
gets new songs from the magazine and later this month you can call our show from your

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,360
PSP.

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,160
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Radio.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,880
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,400
and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,960
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Hi.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
And how are you Miss Summers?

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm recovering.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Recovering?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
That's right, you've been kind of sick.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,240
I remember last week on our year-end show you were sinacy and sniffly, but you seem

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,460
a little better this week.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,540
It took me practically the whole week to get over my sinus infection and drinking to excess

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,280
on New Year's Eve did not help, nor did, you know, singing for on Rock Band, nor did that

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
help.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, you look like you have about 80% HP this week.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Yeah.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,160
Last week you were in the red, definitely.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:26,320
Wednesday I got to work and I was just in hell, so I called in on Thursday and Friday

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,280
and tried to get to the doctor and apparently all the medical facilities lost power because

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
of our crazy Alabama-esque storms.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Oh yeah, we'll be talking about that in a moment, our non-gaming bit.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,640
So I ended up having to talk to the advice nurse and sent out the husband to get the

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,680
drugs and I'm functional today.

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
Let me cast cure on you.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm on the last day, I'm on the very last of my antibiotics today.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,420
All right, well hopefully that'll work and you'll be backed up to 100% health next week.

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,360
Maybe you'll even gain a level.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Hurray!

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Joining us as well, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Hello.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
How are you, Loki?

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
I'm good.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Yeah?

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
And how are you?

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Are you at 100% HP this week?

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm reading in gadget right now.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Are you?

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,640
Well, I'm just catching up on the Sony thing.

44
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,120
That's right, because as we are taping live, we do subject ourselves to a live taping every

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,320
week and right now, this very moment as we were taping on this Sunday night, Consumer

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Electronics Show is just starting to get underway.

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,640
And it's actually kind of funny because I was considering a last minute getaway because

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm still on vacation from the day job until Wednesday, so William and I were considering

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,120
doing another last minute getaway and we were going to go to Disneyland, but then we're

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,880
like, we probably shouldn't do that because the crazy storms are on the way and we actually

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
thought about going to Vegas.

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,440
And so I was looking at hotels in Vegas, I'm like, I cannot, why are all the hotel rooms

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
doubling as of Monday night?

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,620
Like we were looking at rooms like Excalibur and Circus Circus and like some of the not

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,360
so high end places, right?

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,400
And like these places were shooting up to like, you know, twice as much on Monday night

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
and I couldn't figure out what it was and it finally dawned on me today.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,560
I was like, oh, we couldn't go because Consumer Electronics Show is starting.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
And then I was kind of pissed.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,520
I was like, why the fuck didn't I go to Consumer Electronics Show?

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,320
I had this time off of work, I totally could have gone if I had planned better.

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
They don't announce too much at CES.

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,500
It's not a lot of gaming stuff, but you know, I happen to be a little bit of a tech nerd

64
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,120
in addition to a gaming nerd, as I'm sure a lot of our fans are.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,040
There's a little bit of tech nerdiness that goes with the gaming nerdiness, right?

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
Am I right?

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
So it would be fun to go.

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,160
And even William was like, I want to go to that sometime because you know him.

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,920
He likes to look at the big TVs and all that stuff and you know, he's the only PlayStation

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,480
3 supporter I know of in the world.

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,520
Yeah, I support the PlayStation 3.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,120
You know what, I'll be supporting their online services as soon as they come out with those

74
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,080
prepaid cards for their online content because I don't want to set up account and deduct

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,280
money with my credit card.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,760
I'd rather use my hundreds of dollars of GameStop credit to buy cards that can translate

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
to that.

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,240
Well, Sony should seriously consider hiring my boyfriend as their major Nelson or something

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,400
like that because he'll seriously tell people, you know, with me sitting right there and

80
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,000
you know, I've been fairly critical of Sony, although I like to think I'm fair, but he'll

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,280
sit there and tell me, oh no, you want a PlayStation 3 because it has MotorStorm.

82
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,800
You want to get a PlayStation 3 because it has four chips in it and it's like having

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
four brains.

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm like, but when you don't have any games to play on those four brains, what's the point?

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,880
And we argue about this all the time.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I don't know.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,160
Anyhow, let's, so we'll be talking about Consumer Electronics Show on throughout the night,

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,120
but first let's start off a little bit.

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,560
Actually I want to talk about this too.

90
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,880
Those storms have been nuts, have been like absolutely crazy.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Now I guess Loki and I are probably spoiled though because we've lived in California our

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
entire lives and I'll tell you what, for those of you guys who don't live in California,

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,800
we are freaking spoiled here when it comes to storms and things like that.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
No shit, Sherlock.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,520
And when this, I mean it was like a freaking hurricane coming in or something.

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
No it wasn't.

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
I know, but that's how everybody was calling it, like it was a hurricane, it was horrible.

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
We just had these storms.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
It was more like a tropical storm.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,880
But it damn near had us not do a show tonight because my internet was down for the longest

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,000
time and I was afraid that we weren't going to be able to do a show tonight because we

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
had no internet.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This giant tree fell just up the street and knocked out a bunch of power.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,120
A bunch of homes in the block are still without power.

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
A bunch of the traffic lights were out.

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,340
It's like, I don't see why at least Sacramento isn't better prepared for heavy rain because

107
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:52,640
every winter is the rainy season and a couple of years ago I remember when it wasn't as

108
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,780
windy but it rained as badly.

109
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,000
This is the first time that I've lived in this state that I can safely say that the

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,640
weather has woken me up from a deep sleep and that hasn't happened since I lived in

111
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,740
Alabama and actually that happened during the type 2 hurricane so yeah.

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,480
You know I wasn't here the night the big storm hit.

113
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,200
I was at Williams that night and then I came back yesterday and one of our trash cans is

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
gone missing.

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
No idea where it is.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Have to call the city.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't know if it flew up the street or where the hell it is.

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
It's completely gone.

119
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
It's in Oz.

120
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Apparently.

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,760
But it's like...

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Linda is using it.

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,080
Where the fuck am I going to put my trash?

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Call the city.

125
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Thankfully I haven't been here.

126
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,560
My roommate, my poor roommate, they went on vacation in Mendocino, this big family vacation.

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640
They spent the whole time up there without power.

128
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,120
They played Yahtzee by Candlelight.

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
That's how they spent their time.

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
I've done that before.

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
What a vacation though.

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,700
Actually I played D&D by Candlelight.

133
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,640
But it's one of those things where once you get the house you can't get your money back.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
So they just had to kind of grin and bear it.

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Anyway, sorry.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
It has nothing to do with games.

137
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Well, except for the fact that when there's an outage, you know, no games for you.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Well, I talked to Extafur.

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Huh?

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,640
I talked to Extafur for a little bit and he said his power was out but that he had his

141
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
iPhone so everything was good.

142
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
No.

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,760
Well, thank God.

144
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,120
He'd called me earlier this week and said, is your power out?

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,280
And I'm sitting there with my laptop in my lap and my PC sitting there like chugging

146
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,400
out power from, you know, the wall.

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Just like blasting air as I'm like running stress tests and stuff and I'm like, no, my

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,520
power hasn't been out.

149
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,240
Well, our power flickered for a little bit.

150
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,320
And I was like, well, that's okay because I'm freaking sick.

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,240
I'll just sleep through it.

152
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,360
That was my whole thing.

153
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,960
But I needed to go to the doctor really badly because I had been coughing rather heavily

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,880
and I'm sure that a lot of our long time listeners remember when I had the plague.

155
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Basically I had started off as a sinus infection, went into bronchitis, went into pneumonia.

156
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,960
I was sick for three months.

157
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,960
And so my whole thing is I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,720
And so I needed to go.

159
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,440
But thankfully the advice nurse gave me good advice.

160
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,880
But I was just thinking about how many people at the medical facilities, you know, like

161
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
people with injuries and Dan's point was, he's like, well, I'd rather you be sick for

162
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,560
another couple of weeks than be in the hospital.

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,440
And I was like, I know how to drive in this weather.

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,640
He's like, yeah, you do, but no one else does.

165
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
That's true.

166
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,160
When it rains in California, everybody forgets how to drive.

167
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,760
My drive tire is almost bald, so he wouldn't drive me either.

168
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Only when it rains.

169
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
All right.

170
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,920
We're turning into the Weather Channel podcast.

171
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,280
Sorry, guys, but it's definitely been a topic on our minds this week.

172
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,240
And you know, it has impacted our gaming weeks, I'm sure.

173
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,520
I know it impacted mine, but I'll let Jamie start off with how was your gaming week as

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
we always do.

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,160
I tried to play my DS and my eyes hurt too badly from my sinus pressure.

176
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,340
So I basically played a lot of Ragnarok.

177
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,800
And I tried to play pinball and got dizzy.

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,240
So I didn't play any more pinball.

179
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:13,160
But we Dan did break out Assassin's Creed on actually on a near morning.

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,280
His buddy Eric broke it out.

181
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,360
So I actually got to see quite a bit more of that in person.

182
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,280
And it's pretty, but I heard quite a bit of cursing coming from the other room on Thursday

183
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,560
when Will came over to play.

184
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
And of course, there was lots of rock band.

185
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Lots and lots of rock band.

186
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,600
And I got my Ninja Pass.

187
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,520
The Ninja Pass is this lovely device that uses a micro SD card to load Game Boy DS games.

188
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Oh, okay, I've heard of this.

189
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,680
And so, of course, we cannot on the air condone piracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but

190
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,320
I have the Lindon too.

191
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,240
And I have the Tingle game.

192
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,060
I haven't loaded them yet, but I have them.

193
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm okay with doing that to imports.

194
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,920
I think if ethically I'm okay with pirating the imports, because it's kind of one of those

195
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,480
things where it's like, well, if you're not going to release it here, which I know some

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
people are going to yell at me going, it's still wrong, fine, that's fine.

197
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
But my own philosophy is if you're not going to release it here, then I'm going to get

198
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,400
it one way or another, because I'm not paying those insane markup fees.

199
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,620
I mean, it is insane to import a game.

200
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,160
But games that are released here domestically, I don't really pirate.

201
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
I buy most of my games.

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Well, there's a few games that I got that looked interesting.

203
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,400
I'll have to put in my jump drive and get the names of them, because a few of them I

204
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
don't remember.

205
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,800
But I think it'll be a pretty good investment.

206
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,960
I mean, they were like 40 bucks a piece, and my friend ordered them in bulk.

207
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,440
So both my husband and I have one, and I'm looking forward to using the hell out of it

208
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,520
as soon as I can get the reader to work.

209
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,000
All right, well, have fun with that.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let us know how it goes.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,580
Loki, how was your gaming week?

212
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,640
My gaming week was pretty good.

213
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,840
Actually, I don't know, you guys always call me the tech master Loki and stuff, but I guess

214
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I kind of earned my title.

215
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,680
I brought my 360 back from death.

216
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,280
So that's right, my three-ring 360 is working again, because I'm super awesome like that.

217
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,920
And it just involved taking the whole thing apart and replacing what they call the X-clamp,

218
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,760
which is something that holds the heat sink in place.

219
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,960
And once I did that, it worked fine, so it's pretty awesome.

220
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,320
So now that makes the console count six.

221
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,140
I now own six 360s, which is ridiculous.

222
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,760
So you brought back the red rings of death from the brink of death completely on your

223
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,320
own, and what technique did you use to do it?

224
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:56,040
It's basically if you search for X-clamp replacement, it literally takes about $6 in parts to do

225
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
it.

226
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,360
It's just some screws and a couple washers, and that's about it.

227
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,720
And what you do is because the way they built the clamp, which was genius to begin with,

228
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,040
is it all focuses, it looks like kind of an X with all the points bent down.

229
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,980
And so the middle is closest to the board, and they have a little plastic spacer on there.

230
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,240
So what happens is all the tension from the heat sink actually pushes up in the middle

231
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,920
of the chip, causing it over the time to basically warp the motherboard and possibly ruin some

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,180
of the solder joints.

233
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,320
So what you're basically doing is replacing the clamp with four screws with washer spacers

234
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,200
in there, and that way it kind of equals that tension across the entire board so that it's

235
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
not bending.

236
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,560
Plus, there was also a nice little foil piece on there, I guess a protective foil layer

237
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,000
on my heat sink, which probably wasn't too good either.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,340
But once I replaced everything, it works fine now.

239
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,500
Let me read some comments from chat, because this is too good, and I have yet to introduce

240
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,640
the always present fourth guest on our show, the chat room over at chat.orangelaungereer.com,

241
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,960
which is much more full tonight than it was last week.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,840
So welcome back everybody, after the holidays, I was just going to say, somebody who hasn't

243
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,000
learned how to change their nickname yet, but this is great, recruit number 6763 says,

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,600
and three rings later, Jesus 360 rose again, in regards to Loki's 360.

245
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Frisbee says, Towley brings Xboxes back to life, referring to the towel trick.

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Well, you don't really need to do that, actually.

247
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,720
It's kind of weird, because what you're supposed to do after you do that replacement of the

248
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,920
setup, you're supposed to turn it on without fans, and it's supposed to overheat.

249
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,640
Now I did that, basically turn it on, and wait for the three lights to turn the two

250
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,040
lights, but it did it almost instantly, and then I left it on there for about two minutes.

251
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,560
The thing is, though, is it didn't really heat up at all.

252
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Like I mean, I felt the top, I felt the heat sink, felt the bottom, and I would think,

253
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,420
okay, this thing's going to be on fire, but it didn't even feel that different at all.

254
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,640
And poor Akuta, I'm reading this chat, Akuta in chat says, Ugh, I got the red ring of death

255
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,160
this week, the day I got my 360.

256
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
That sucks.

257
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,080
It sucks to be you, my friend, I'm sorry to hear it.

258
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,560
You know, it happened to me three days after I bought mine, so it's not too much different.

259
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,400
And honestly, if I hadn't opened my system, I probably would have just sent it in to get

260
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,280
replaced, but I did open my system.

261
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,200
Sakura Max says, Loki, you should just work at the 360 repair center.

262
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,120
Would you consider repairing somebody else's, like a legit system?

263
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,920
If they've actually, you know, I would say if they can't send it back into Microsoft,

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,800
then sure, I would do it, because it only took like six bucks with parts, but you know,

265
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,160
it's not guaranteed to work all the time, but from what I read on there, because they

266
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,880
have a thread with all the success stories, about 90% of them get repaired that way.

267
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Wow.

268
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
That's amazing.

269
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,020
You know, I figured for six bucks, and it's broken anyways, I mean the worst that'll happen

270
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,040
is I waste six dollars and the 360's not replaced, but it works, so great.

271
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,480
Anyways, beyond all that, I actually played a few games this week.

272
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,080
I borrowed my wife's copy of Planet Puzzle League, because I bought it for her.

273
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,840
Actually, that game's pretty fun.

274
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,920
It reminds me a lot of Luminous, actually, a little bit, because they've got, you know,

275
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,680
kind of good music, it goes with the whole thing, you know, background's kind of flashing

276
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,720
and stuff, but it's a really fun puzzle game.

277
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,680
Do you ever play Pokemon Puzzle League?

278
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
No.

279
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Same game?

280
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Same thing.

281
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Yeah.

282
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Well, whatever, that's all right.

283
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
It's still fun.

284
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
No, it's still fun.

285
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,200
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

286
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,120
I played Crysis, because I finally finished my computer, and that's fun.

287
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,680
I mean, if you played Far Cry Instincts, it's basically the same damn thing, except now,

288
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,320
you know, instead of being like some vampire, not vampire, like a werewolf type thing, you

289
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,660
have this wonderful suit that can, you know, do amazing stuff, and it's very pretty.

290
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,520
My favorite aspect of the entire game is all the wildlife running around, so like, I'll

291
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,360
be fighting off, you know, some Koreans and stuff in the game, and then all of a sudden

292
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,720
I'll see this like, a flock of birds run by, and immediately I turn fire on them, you know,

293
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,520
or I pick up a chicken and huck it up into the air and then fire it.

294
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Or my other favorite is, there was this turtle that I found, ran the beach when you first

295
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,720
land in the beginning of the game, and I wanted to put it back out into the sea, and fortunately

296
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,400
I switched to strength mode, and I threw the turtle, and the impact of the water killed

297
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
it.

298
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,760
I also punched it too, because I was trying to pick it up, and I'm like, I don't know

299
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
how to pick stuff up.

300
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
This game sounds rad.

301
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
It's awesome.

302
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,440
You can like, see seagulls like, flying around, literally just fire them all in the air, that's

303
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,680
the best part of the game, just all the like, crap that you can do that's in it.

304
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,160
I want to point out this other comment in chat that's pretty good, one of your most

305
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,600
vocal critics here in chat, Rasteel UT, who's always condemning you to hell for being such

306
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,960
an advocate of modding and all that stuff, has this funny thing to say, he says, if Loki

307
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,120
would actually apply himself and do repairs on systems, instead of dedicating himself

308
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,440
to game theft, the world would be a better place.

309
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,400
Well, it's better now, because that one system that I repaired was my modded system, so now

310
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,680
he can send those cards and love letters to Loki at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

311
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,200
That system will never see live ever again.

312
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,300
But my other one, that's a different story.

313
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,160
It is interesting though, I mean, for being such a, you know, I get the sense you don't

314
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,200
do this stuff to steal.

315
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,680
You do this because you like the challenge of modding systems and making them look cool.

316
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,740
I mean, that's kind of always why I've kind of turned the eye to it, is that I always

317
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,040
think you were more kind of in it for the challenge.

318
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,560
I mean, you do own six Xbox 360s, that's way more than an average person would own.

319
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,600
Yeah, I don't really want to own that many, but that's alright.

320
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,400
GS68 says, banned until 999 AD.

321
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Ah, whatever.

322
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,880
Oh darn, if one of my 360s gets banned off live, gee, what will I ever do?

323
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Alright.

324
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Anyway.

325
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Anything else for Gaming Weekly?

326
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,960
That's it, but before we move on, I wanted to give you guys your Christmas gifts, since

327
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,920
I didn't have them last week.

328
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Presents!

329
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Yay!

330
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay, so, first off...

331
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,640
I don't like it when he sighs before giving his gift.

332
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,960
No, no, no, it's not entirely bad.

333
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,280
I'm sorry, but one of you does get a gag gift.

334
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,480
So for Rob, I have Final Fantasy XII Remnant Wings, because you've actually played through

335
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Final Fantasy XII.

336
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,680
I haven't played through the whole game, but enough of it, I know what's going on.

337
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Sweet.

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,800
And Jamie, I apologize ahead of time.

339
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Don't kill me.

340
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
No, I'm going to love this.

341
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
What did Jamie get?

342
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:31,280
But you have a copy of Imagine Babies.

343
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,680
That's awesome.

344
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,120
The last one they have there.

345
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,200
Jamie got a copy of Imagine Babies, with a Z.

346
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,160
Take care of up to six babies.

347
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,240
Read the back for us, how did they advertise this game?

348
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,000
Buy the babies good food, furniture, cute baby outfits, and toys.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Customize your house through mini-games.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

351
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,800
It's like, I think everybody in iPod listening land, or however you're listening to this

352
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,640
on PSP, whatever, is hearing the dot, dot, dot through their speakers right now.

353
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
No, that's too good.

354
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,800
It actually looks kind of cute.

355
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
She's coming around.

356
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,440
No, as long as they're virtual babies, I don't mind.

357
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
There you go.

358
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,040
You should raise some babies, and then tell the hubby, here's your baby.

359
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,160
That would be great.

360
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
See, there you go.

361
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Practical use for it.

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Yay.

363
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
I think there's a part in the game where you can shake the baby, so I know.

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,040
All right.

365
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,120
They're actually kind of cute, though.

366
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,560
The chat room is irritated, there's no operator 11 tonight, because they wanted to see Jamie's

367
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
reaction.

368
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Sorry guys, operator 11 is screwy.

369
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,960
I was staring at it blankly.

370
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,020
You could hear the dot, dot, dot through the microphone.

371
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
You could.

372
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Thank you for the thoughtful gift.

373
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,960
I was hoping, well, I was kind of trying to get some stuff to play this week, like, was

374
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:03,000
it that, I don't even remember how it's, like, Pot to Pawn or something like that, that one

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,080
weird one that looks like Loco Roco.

376
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:12,720
And then I was hopefully going to have a copy of Nights to play for a special after show,

377
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
but seeing as operator 11 is down, that doesn't work.

378
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Dope.

379
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,080
Mac Man says, hey honey, I'm pregnant with digital babies.

380
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
That's okay.

381
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,080
All right.

382
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,320
I could go into detail about, you know, the physical problems that come with being knocked

383
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
up.

384
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Let's not.

385
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
But I'm not going to.

386
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,640
Considering the majority of listeners of our program are young men, I don't know if they

387
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,720
want to hear it.

388
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
Although maybe they should, I don't know.

389
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,280
Those that are involved should think twice before asking their significant other to carry

390
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,840
a 32 pound, 32 pounds of extra weight plus the hormone influx and having your stomach

391
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,160
shoved up behind your lungs.

392
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,320
You make it sound so sexy.

393
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,640
Does someone have a chainsaw outside?

394
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,480
That's the best thing ever.

395
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,160
Yeah, I know you guys can't hear this over the thing, but somebody is out there with

396
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
a.

397
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Someone's out there with a chainsaw.

398
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,240
Either a chainsaw or like a weed whacker or something, probably trying to clean up debris

399
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
from the storm.

400
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I think it's a chainsaw.

401
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,800
Like, you know, those yard work at night is maybe there were repair crews over on the

402
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
crossroad.

403
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,440
Oh, my gosh.

404
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
It's crazy around here.

405
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
All right.

406
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
My gaming week.

407
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
We're never going to get to the gaming news.

408
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,600
You know, what's funny is that a lot of people say I play too much.

409
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Wow.

410
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Well, guess what?

411
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,300
My Internet was down for 24 hours thanks to the storm.

412
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
So no.

413
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Wow.

414
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
For me, QQ.

415
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
I was so sad.

416
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,560
So I did have to play other games and I spent some time playing Mario Galaxy, which I love

417
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,480
more and more every time I play it.

418
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,880
It's just amazing.

419
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,720
And I love its little bits of retro-ness they have in it in regards to some of the music

420
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
and things.

421
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
And I raved about it last week.

422
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
I don't need to say much more.

423
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,200
But I do love me some Mario Galaxy.

424
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
I also played some more of Rock Band.

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,060
I played till my arm literally hurt and felt like it was going to fall off.

426
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,120
So that was a lot of fun.

427
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,640
And then just played through a variety of various Xbox Live arcade games I needed to

428
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
catch up on.

429
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,680
And I made use of my HD DVD player this week because I bought Stardust on HD DVD a couple

430
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,520
weeks ago and I never got around to watching it.

431
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,120
So I put it in the HD player and was watching that.

432
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
And that's pretty much how I spent my time with the outage.

433
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
So there it was.

434
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,560
And GS68 says, thank you storms for keeping sky off the warcrack.

435
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,900
Frisbee says chainsaw guy from Resident Evil 4 is outside and is coming to get us.

436
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
I hope not.

437
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
That would suck.

438
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
That's a really gruesome ending.

439
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,260
I don't know if you've ever had your head chopped off by a chainsaw guy.

440
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,600
That sucks.

441
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
It totally sucks.

442
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
You know it happens to me all the time.

443
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,360
And RusteelUT, who just seems to be a critic in general, he's critical of Loki's stance

444
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,240
on things, he's critical of my WoW playing, he says, oh god, no WoW for one whole day.

445
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,520
How could sky exist without his second job?

446
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,560
But I can do no wrong.

447
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Actually you ass.

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Wow.

449
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,280
I love taunting the listeners.

450
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,600
No, I respect the opinion.

451
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,440
But WoW is my third job.

452
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,120
OLR is my second job.

453
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,160
And then my day job is my first job.

454
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,760
So WoW is my third job.

455
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,200
So if you're going to taunt me, get it right.

456
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Jamie's chowing down on the whole wheat cookies William made for the New Year's party.

457
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
They're humpy.

458
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
They're good.

459
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
They're really good.

460
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,980
They help, they restore 10 HP when you eat them too.

461
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
So eat a lot.

462
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,100
They're also full of fiber.

463
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,680
Our work's trying to get a dev kit for 360.

464
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
What for?

465
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I don't know.

466
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Just to have?

467
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
X to go.

468
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I hope.

469
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Dev kit.

470
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,200
Also, I want to point out, I know OP11's down tonight, but we have some new decorations

471
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,360
in the studio I guess you'll see next week.

472
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,960
I was in this strip mall that had a lot of little stores in it that had imported things.

473
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
I got a big Kingdom Hearts wall scroll that's now up on the wall that's pretty awesome.

474
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,280
I got to say, that's a really great artwork.

475
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,760
I don't know where that artwork comes from, but it's great.

476
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,880
And a Final Fantasy XIII poster, if you can believe it, which is totally a bootleg I think.

477
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,680
I think somebody just took Sony's official release picture and made a poster out of it,

478
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,200
but it looks great nonetheless.

479
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,720
So some new decorations to look forward to when the cam comes back.

480
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Meanwhile, we'll get into some housekeeping tonight.

481
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,080
Just some things I wanted to say really quickly.

482
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,140
Orange Launch Radio's rotation of music is going to be changing this week, which is going

483
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,280
to cause some downtime either Monday or Tuesday during the day, but not a lot of people are

484
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,880
listening during the day anyway, so I imagine people probably aren't even going to notice,

485
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,960
but I just wanted to get that out there, that the station will be down for a little bit

486
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,840
on Monday or Tuesday while the new songs go into rotation.

487
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,280
And that's really it.

488
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,960
Otherwise, welcome to our first show of 2008.

489
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Hurray.

490
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,560
And you hate to interrupt, but literally right now Bill Gates is doing his CES keynote, so...

491
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,040
Well, let's get into some news.

492
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,000
Has he revealed anything yet, or...?

493
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,560
No, it says, okay ladies and gentlemen, the keynote will begin in five minutes.

494
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
Please take your seats.

495
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,120
So we'll take a peek during the break and see if there's anything to report on in part

496
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,920
B. But meanwhile, I believe there's some rumors about what might be being talked about tonight,

497
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
yes?

498
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Yes.

499
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,880
One of the rumors is that there's going to be yet another Xbox 360 SKU coming out.

500
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,220
However, from what I remember, the SKU is actually supposed to be from another company,

501
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,600
like Toshiba or something like that.

502
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,280
But anyways, it's being dubbed the Xbox 360 Ultimate, and it's actually funny because

503
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,560
this was reported in Stuff Magazine, because they're known for tech news, I guess.

504
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,440
It'll be hitting stores, apparently, by this autumn, and will feature, of course, 1080p

505
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,200
HDMI output, built-in Wi-Fi, high-def audio output, cooler 65nm hardware architecture,

506
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,080
and a near-silent fan.

507
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,520
On top of that, it's going to have an IPTV service, and a 320GB hard drive, and a built-in

508
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,440
HD DVD drive.

509
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
And it's all bullshit.

510
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,800
I wouldn't be surprised.

511
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Part of me sounds like it's a bit much, I think.

512
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
The system would be too expensive.

513
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,320
But, at the same time, why would Stuff Magazine run something like that, then, if they didn't

514
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,880
know that it was coming out?

515
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,140
I don't know, it sounds stupid to me, but if it's not being dubbed the Xbox something

516
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:32,400
or other, if it's just, you know, Toshiba's HD DVD player that also plays Xbox 360 games,

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
that kind of thing.

518
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,300
Oddly enough, that makes a little more sense to me.

519
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:42,300
And I always thought devices like the Panasonic Q were pretty awesome, and I never understood

520
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,400
why they didn't come out here.

521
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,840
Like, remember the Panasonic Q?

522
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,320
There was a DVD player that came out in Japan that played GameCube games, as well.

523
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,680
Well, there was a time, I don't know if they ever came out with them, but they were talking

524
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,480
about TVs that were integrated with the original Xbox hardware, so that they could actually,

525
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,560
you know, it would be like a built-in DVD player into your TV, but it also plays Xbox,

526
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
you know, Xbox games.

527
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,840
Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's a lot of TVs that have DVD technology built

528
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
into them.

529
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Exactly, something like that.

530
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,160
You just put the DVD right in the TV and it plays.

531
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Why not?

532
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
That seems like a logical next step.

533
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm kind of surprised no gaming company has really done that.

534
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,920
I mean, it would seem logical to me.

535
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
I don't know.

536
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
I don't know.

537
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,280
Well, we'll see.

538
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,960
Perhaps that could be something that is revealed tonight during Bill Gates' last CES speech,

539
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,720
if I'm not mistaken, right, because he's stepping down or whatever.

540
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,240
I shouldn't say stepping down, but stepping aside for a little while, so he won't be doing

541
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
the keynotes anymore.

542
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,400
It's like, yes, I'm too rich to be doing this shit.

543
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,000
Well, anyhow, Sony has revealed some of their plans, and one of the big announcements that's

544
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,200
going to impact gamers is in regards to the slim PSP.

545
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,760
We're going to be getting Skype in late January.

546
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,400
Of course, Skype is a program that listeners of our show, I hope, would know very well.

547
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,640
After all, we were one of the first Internet programs anywhere years ago to actually have

548
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,900
a Skype line, and users have been calling us since like 2003 or 2004 on our Skype line.

549
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,360
At Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype, and now folks are going to be able

550
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,920
to call from their PSP when this new firmware is released at the end of January, but the

551
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,080
only catch is it's only available on the PSP Slims so far.

552
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,460
But now, Loki, you say that through your controversial hack-and-crack method, you think that this

553
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,080
could work on the PSP fatties.

554
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,560
I think so.

555
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,480
Right now, they have a lot of the firmware stuff that's locked in for the slim PSP, but

556
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,100
some of the custom firmwares have enabled you to do other things, obviously, that might

557
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,520
be locked out, except for, of course, video out, obviously, you can't do that on a normal

558
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,680
PSP, but I wouldn't be surprised if you see something that will allow this to happen.

559
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,240
I can't install this anyways on mine until custom one comes out anyways.

560
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,740
That's pretty cool, and I've got to say Skype out and Skype in will be a part of this as

561
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,460
well, and of course Skype out and Skype in are the things that let you use Skype as a

562
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,560
normal telephone.

563
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,120
We use Skype in here on the show.

564
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,900
That's how you can call 1-888 at your game OLR, and we use an 800 number forwarder that

565
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,480
forwards to our Skype line.

566
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,340
Very technical, but it works.

567
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,720
It does cost extra, though.

568
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Yes, it does.

569
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,480
That's not something that's free, but I know somebody that uses Skype as their home phone

570
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,620
and they love it.

571
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,800
This is just another kind of cool thing for the PSP that's kind of breathing more life

572
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
into it.

573
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,840
I think a lot of people kind of wrote off the PSP when the games weren't so strong,

574
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,880
but I think this kind of cements PSP as the handheld device.

575
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,000
Notice how I don't call it a handheld gaming system.

576
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,960
The DS is supreme, I think, in that category, but the PSP is one hell of a portable device.

577
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,920
Now that it does pictures, movies, internet radio, now it does Skype, web surfing.

578
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,440
This is like a computer in your pocket now.

579
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,040
That's pretty awesome, the PSP that it's turning into.

580
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,880
And it has Castlevania, which is odd, but does your iPhone have Castlevania?

581
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
No, but my DS does.

582
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Oh, snap.

583
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,160
All right, well that's all I have to say.

584
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,040
I'd still prefer that if it was going to be initially a handheld gaming system, it remain

585
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
a gaming system.

586
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,600
They don't need all that extra crap.

587
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
But I will say this.

588
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,680
I mean, I think to some extent, I think that's what the N-Gage was trying to do, too, and

589
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,360
remember how much shit the N-Gage got?

590
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,080
Because I think at least PSP is still kind of like, I don't know.

591
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,660
The way the PSP has done it, they still have kind of focused on games first and everything

592
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
else is secondary.

593
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
But I don't know.

594
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,240
They've just done it so much better than Nokia did.

595
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,880
The N-Gage was a piece of shit.

596
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
It really was.

597
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
I don't know.

598
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
I can't explain that one.

599
00:30:50,080 --> 00:31:00,120
I think that the N-Gage could have been better had they gone for, first of all, cartridge

600
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,160
bases of those stupid little chip things, something that could actually store enough

601
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,520
media to make it look worth playing because I tried playing stuff on that and it was just

602
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
awful.

603
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,680
You know, at least the PSP doesn't, you know, it put a lot of focus into the gaming aspect.

604
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,320
It was initially meant to be a gaming system and it has the right kind of media to support

605
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,720
the types of games they want to do.

606
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Basically it's like this.

607
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,300
When I played Castlevania on the PSP, you know, Rondo of Blood, I went, cool!

608
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,360
This is cool!

609
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,000
When I played Civilization on the N-Gage, a part of me died inside.

610
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was that bad.

611
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,560
I mean, it was like one of my favorite games of all time has been raped by a taco.

612
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I mean, literally.

613
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
How about something better?

614
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,480
Let me say one thing real quick before we get back into the news because Tiger Claw

615
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
is mentioning something.

616
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,580
I just realized, OLR is competing against American Gladiators tonight because tonight

617
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,320
is the return of American Gladiators on NBC.

618
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,720
This is all I have to say, TiVo, VCR, DVR, whatever, that's why you got it.

619
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,600
Does anyone actually remember the old American Gladiators?

620
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,760
Fuck yeah, I do.

621
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,560
If you remember that, you remember how often they replayed that show.

622
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:25,200
So that shit was replayed more than Cops, okay, and you know how much Cops is on TV.

623
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,040
So just fucking wait, it'll rerun that shit to death.

624
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Exactly.

625
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Or if you're going to run away and go watch American Gladiators, at least download our

626
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,280
podcast and listen to it later, I guess.

627
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,000
I guess we can let that slide by.

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,680
All right, sorry, back to the news.

629
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Can I talk?

630
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
You may.

631
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,440
Thank you, sir.

632
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,020
For anyone who remembers Target Terror, it's coming out on the Wii as a Zapper game, and

633
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,760
it looks awful, but it looks great at the same time, because it was one of those full

634
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,680
motion capture type of games.

635
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:07,460
I love Revolution X, so I'm actually sort of thinking about getting this just for the

636
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,560
cheese ball factor.

637
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:17,040
I love cheese ball games, so I think that's going to be kind of fun, but you have machine

638
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,040
guns and grenade launchers and orbital space lasers and minigames and all kinds of fun

639
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
stuff.

640
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Looks like fun.

641
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Yeah.

642
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Is it true...

643
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,240
Loki, weren't you saying something before the show, though, that they're going to charge

644
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,640
like the full retail price for this, 40 bucks or something?

645
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,840
Yeah, it's 40 bucks.

646
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
That's crap tacky.

647
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,000
I don't know about that.

648
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
It's not worth 40 bucks.

649
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,740
I'm sure it'll be in the bargain bin before too long.

650
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
Just give it time, man.

651
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,080
If it sucks, they'll drop the price quick.

652
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,560
We shall see.

653
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,280
Another fun news, if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine, or even if

654
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,160
you don't, next month, the February issue, we'll have three exclusive rock band songs

655
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
for download.

656
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,640
Another thing that you should know about the official Xbox magazine discs, say for example

657
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,460
you download that content on one friend's account, you can also take it to your friend

658
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,320
and your other friend and so on and so forth.

659
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Since there's no real way to lock a DVD to a certain 360.

660
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,760
So just share.

661
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,480
Anyways, three songs are going to be with that.

662
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,480
One of which is from Freezeprop.

663
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,000
That would be Sprode.

664
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,240
Not Super Sprode, but Sprode.

665
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,480
Bang Camaro's Rock Rebellion and Count Zero's Shake.

666
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Wait, so we don't think the Sprode thing is a typo?

667
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,280
Because they don't have a song called just Sprode unless it's something new.

668
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
It might be something new or maybe a rock version of Super Sprode.

669
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,480
Oh, that would make sense.

670
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,040
Maybe like a cover of their own song or something.

671
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,000
If I remember, Super Sprode wasn't too rocky.

672
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,480
Well Super Sprode is fucking rad so I hope it is that song in some type of reincarnation

673
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
because I love that song.

674
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,600
That was a great song in amplitude.

675
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,880
But yeah, definitely check it out.

676
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,180
I stopped subscribing to this magazine, but I'll have to pick one up.

677
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,480
So you're going to buy one so I don't have to?

678
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Yeah.

679
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Sweet!

680
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,480
So this is that whole DVD sharing thing he just said and I was just making sure about

681
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
that.

682
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Alright, well speaking of Rock Band, EA has not ruled out that Rock Band will be coming

683
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,520
out on the Wii.

684
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,960
You might notice that the Wii is that one system that's sorely missing Rock Band right

685
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
now.

686
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
It does have Guitar Hero 3, but no Rock Band.

687
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Harmonix themselves has said that the Wii has, quote, an enormous potential for music

688
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,560
games.

689
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,800
GamePro actually went out and got a quote from EA talking about that there's going to

690
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,360
be Rock Band on the Wii eventually.

691
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,040
I'm sorry, scratch that.

692
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,160
They did not make an official comment on Rock Band on the Wii, but most of us can kind of

693
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,840
figure it's got to be coming eventually, especially when you consider the fact that EA likes to

694
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,520
port things to all hell.

695
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Really?

696
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Yeah.

697
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,760
You got the truth.

698
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,880
I think their only limitation right now is just putting the instruments on the Wii and

699
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,460
figuring out something maybe fun to do with them, although I think they're just going

700
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,080
to do what they did with like, or not them in particular, but Activision did with Guitar

701
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Hero 3 and just, you know, have it hijack the Wi-Fi from, you know, the remote, but

702
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
I don't know.

703
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
That's not a bad idea.

704
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,280
So in other words, they're not saying no, they're just saying not now.

705
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,800
Although they can also do all wired controllers because they have USB ports on there.

706
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
No, why not?

707
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I don't know.

708
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,720
Well, we'll see what happens, but in the meantime, the Wii fans are Rock Band-less.

709
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Sorry.

710
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:50,840
Well, a Guitar Hero fan, though, actually put together a Kill Bill guitar, I think it's

711
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
pretty cool.

712
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,640
I'll put a link to the picture up in the chat room.

713
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:03,360
But it was basically inspired by, I guess, the, an Evil Dead guitar that someone did

714
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
too.

715
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
So that's pretty cool.

716
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,920
And it's really not all that hard because all you need to, like for example, a dance

717
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,640
friend, Will, got a Sex Pistols one for a penny, so you can find the faceplates or you

718
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,400
can make them yourself because they're not that, you know, difficult and just if you've

719
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
got any artistic ability, customize it yourself.

720
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,120
But I'll put a picture of the image in the chat, of the link in chat.

721
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,360
That does seem pretty cool, that little Kill Bill guitar.

722
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,240
I don't know, I kind of want one of those.

723
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,800
I do want to back up for just a minute because there's some comments in our chat room at

724
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,240
chat.orangelandrater.com in regards to the Rock Band on the Wii.

725
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,000
And I think RawsteelUT stops being critical for a moment to bring up a good point.

726
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,880
There's the fact that the Rock Band download content is impossible on the Wii.

727
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,040
And that's one of the biggest money makers for Rock Band.

728
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
So far, yeah.

729
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,760
Yeah, so that is a good point, is that the Wii doesn't really support anything like

730
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
that so far.

731
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,000
Although, aren't they supposed to be getting Guitar Hero 3 content next year?

732
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,600
Yeah, once, whenever they figure out, you know, how to actually do it.

733
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,680
Well, now's the time to figure that out.

734
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,800
That's big money they're missing out on right there.

735
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,120
Yeah, I'll say.

736
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,200
Anyways, some other stuff you can look forward to at least this week, coming out in the United

737
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
States.

738
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,280
A few releases, actually there's some decent stuff coming out, including, let's see, starting

739
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,920
things off, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom, that'll be coming out in the 360.

740
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,880
Although it looks like this time they kind of went more of the Dynasty Warriors route.

741
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,960
Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is coming to the Wii and Playstation 2.

742
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,080
So if you're into that hoverboard racing stuff, you can play that.

743
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:58,040
NFL Tour on the Playstation 3 and 360, a good $40 football game, kind of arcade style.

744
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,760
Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law on Playstation 2 Wii and the PSP, if you happen to be a fan

745
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,000
of the show and like the Phoenix Wright games, you'll definitely like that one.

746
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,440
Jackass the Game on DS, if it's anything like the PSP version, you'll definitely like that

747
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,720
one.

748
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,340
World Championship Paintball for Playstation 2, that is crap.

749
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,520
Sea Monster is a prehistoric adventure on the DS, also crap.

750
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,880
And then one of the weirdest things to come out in a while, and doesn't look very good

751
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:39,100
either, Dance Dance Revolution, Disney Channel Edition on Playstation 2, oh god.

752
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,240
And I believe that's it for this week.

753
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:48,120
You know you want to dance to high school musical songs, Loki.

754
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,760
Well coming out over in Japan, finally taking a break from not having any games come out

755
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,120
because of the holidays, to getting some stuff come out, or I should say if you're an Xbox

756
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,760
360 fan, price reductions.

757
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,760
But that's never a bad thing, some price reductions for Armored Core 4 and Table Tennis take place

758
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,320
this week, as well as the release of the Xbox 360 Messenger kit.

759
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,340
We got that here a little while ago with the integrated MSM Messenger.

760
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,120
Not that it's been doing folks a lot of good this week with Xbox Live going up and down,

761
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,120
however assuming that those problems are being fixed very soon, the Messenger kit will be

762
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,980
doing Japanese MSM fans a lot of good.

763
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:29,880
Also getting a price reduction on the Playstation 3, Armored Core 4's port on Playstation 3.

764
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,780
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, a new game from Marvelous Entertainment called Kaitikyoshi

765
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:45,280
Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle Wii, which looks to be some type of anime based game

766
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,100
that I think is some type of fighter, it looks kind of like a 3D fighter, I'm sure it's based

767
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:55,360
on, is there an anime called Hitman, that's probably what it is, I'm not sure, whatever

768
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,340
it is, there you have it.

769
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,680
Also coming out on some other systems, the Nintendo DS is getting a game called Chishiki-O

770
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:10,300
Series Train Master, which is another train sim game, apparently those train sim games

771
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,420
are very popular overseas, I haven't seen a train sim game very popular over here since

772
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,160
Railroad Tycoon or A-Train, but I guess they're still popular over there.

773
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,760
Well there was the big Densha de Go!

774
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,000
series that was out for a long time too.

775
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,840
I wonder why they're not as popular here.

776
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,120
There's a train simulator that even had a big controller for it too.

777
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,400
My dad used to buy those games all the time back when we had a Commodore 64, he bought

778
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,440
like every train, because he was a conductor before he retired, that's what he did, so

779
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
he loved that stuff.

780
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,240
I just thought it was interesting.

781
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Anyhow, that's really it for Japanese releases this week.

782
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,280
Alright, what about UK releases?

783
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,960
Well, Loki, wait your turn.

784
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,240
There's really not a whole lot to talk about.

785
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,920
The ninth has Omega 5 on Xbox Live Arcade, Sam & Max 202, Moai Better Blues, that's a

786
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,600
cool name, and then that's coming out on the tenth, and the eleventh is PDC World Darts

787
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Championship 2008, exciting, but not really.

788
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Now you can go.

789
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,880
Sam & Max is going to be awesome in Season 2.

790
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:21,320
Anyways, as you mentioned, Omega 5 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week, Hudson's kind

791
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,800
of side-scroller shooter game, looks a little bit like R-Type or something like that.

792
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,720
Definitely going to be awesome, that's only going to cost you 800 Microsoft points, and

793
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,040
no word if there's going to be anything else coming out this week as well, I know last

794
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,320
week there was only one item, just Metal Gear, or Metal Slug 3, so I guess maybe this is

795
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,880
the only release this week as well.

796
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:56,560
Microsoft, I want rez, really badly, I want rez, rez, I want rez, no rez for you, now

797
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
!!

798
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,280
Alright, so maybe I won't get rez, but there will be some other games on the Virtual Console

799
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,720
in the United States of America, Monday's games have been leaked, it appears, the day

800
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,580
before, and a real good one coming for the Nintendo this week, Star Tropics is coming

801
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,080
to Virtual Console, that was a pretty rad game, that was one of the last really big

802
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,520
RPGs, no word yet though if buying it on the Virtual Console will give you that letter

803
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,240
that you have to dip in the water in order to get the secret code, otherwise the thought

804
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,980
just occurred to me, a lot of people are going to be screwed when they try to play that game

805
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,980
on Virtual Console.

806
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,480
I think that there will be some sort of compensation made for it, like maybe they'll have to go

807
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,000
on Nintendo's site and do some sort of bizarro thing.

808
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,720
Or it will be in the digital manual that comes with the game.

809
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,160
Oh, there you go, maybe the digital manual in the game will have it.

810
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,080
No, there is a scene in this game where you'll need this code, but there's going to be tons

811
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,880
of people that don't even think to look there, I bet.

812
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I know.

813
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
That's going to be interesting.

814
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I didn't figure it out.

815
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
They're going to be on Game Facts.

816
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,960
I bought the game used and I was like, I don't know what the fucking code is, I don't have

817
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,080
the, we have to dip the manual in the water to reveal the code, I'm like, I don't have

818
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
the manual.

819
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,480
Isn't the code 747 and why do I remember that?

820
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,680
It's 747, because I remember it because it was like a plane, yeah.

821
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,320
Oh my god, you know you've played too many games when?

822
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
No.

823
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,160
I don't need no stinkin' letter.

824
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,080
There's a ton of games though that have those little weird quirks built in, like the, what

825
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:30,040
was it, the X-Men game where you had to press reset to reset the machine or something?

826
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
That's right.

827
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,080
On Genesis.

828
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
So weird.

829
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
I know.

830
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,800
Nothing will ever be as cool though as in regards to like quirky fucking things in games

831
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,480
as Metal Gear Solid was a psycho mantis who read your memory card and would go, oh I see

832
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,920
you're a Castlevania fan.

833
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,200
And it had, it had Xenogears on there, which hadn't, which wasn't released at the time.

834
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,280
Creepy creepy.

835
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:06,080
And then, it also, though in Final Fantasy VII, had a reference to Xenogears on it too.

836
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,360
Well, also coming out on the Virtual Console this week for the Neo Geo, King of Fighters

837
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
94.

838
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,780
Now, I don't follow the King of Fighters, they're all the same to me, it's one big giant

839
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
fucking blur.

840
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
King of Fighters 94.

841
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,840
Is 94 a good one?

842
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,640
I have that on the Neo Geo CD.

843
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
It's a good one.

844
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,440
KOF 94 was, if I do remember, the first one that was out in the series.

845
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,660
And I played tons and tons and tons of that game because they had it at the arcade at

846
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:43,240
my college where I learned the joy of playing with Yuri's butt attack.

847
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Interesting.

848
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,840
I might have to check it out.

849
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,480
You know, I have no Neo Geo games on Virtual Console yet.

850
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Do you?

851
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Oh, that's sad.

852
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,000
My thing is almost filled up.

853
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's the sad part.

854
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,120
My screen is almost, like, you know how you can only go to, like, four screens on the

855
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,120
Wii?

856
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,920
I seriously only have room for a handful of games left because I have so many of those

857
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,400
stupid Virtual Console games I keep paying money for.

858
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
You know what, Rob?

859
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,240
Oh, that was another thing, but I'll bring the game up later because it's related to

860
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,520
another part of the show, but we broke out Virtual Console stuff at my house too.

861
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Oh, nice.

862
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:23,680
But I was going to tell you, one of these days, though, that I can, when we start doing

863
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:31,120
the whatever video cast again, I'll try to bring one of my old systems up for something

864
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,680
classic, if you want, and I'll bring the Neo Geo CD.

865
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,600
Well, I'll tell you what we're thinking.

866
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,800
I'll think aloud here because Operator 11, unfortunately, it seems like it's running

867
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,040
on autopilot right now.

868
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,100
I don't know what the heck's going on with them, but none of the shows are saving or

869
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,960
whatever, which is part of the reason we're not using them.

870
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,000
So we're thinking about defecting to another service called Ustream TV, which has no limits

871
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
on their shows.

872
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,840
I just have to make sure it's kosher for us to broadcast video game images, but I don't

873
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,080
know why it wouldn't be.

874
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,480
But sometimes there's copyright issues that come into play with that, but usually as long

875
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,560
as we're, if we're doing any type of commentary with it or whatever, you know, it's fair use,

876
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,720
but I don't know, we'll see.

877
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,320
Anyhow, back to the Virtual Console story, Star Tropics King Fighters 94, no third game

878
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,440
mentioned yet, I guess we'll find out tomorrow, but remember, not every week have they always

879
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,840
done three games, so it is possible, it's just a two game week.

880
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
So we shall see.

881
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,240
Well, it looks like they're having something similar to that in the UK.

882
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:35,620
The big release right now is Harvest Moon, coming out on Virtual Console, and I do recall

883
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,280
seeing, although I can't find the link on here now, but I did also recall seeing Donkey

884
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,600
Kong Country 3.

885
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,080
But apparently the link to it is gone from where I read it.

886
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,560
Might have been two different weeks or something.

887
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:57,600
Possibly, but Harvest Moon's been the big thing, so you can play that over in the UK.

888
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,080
Milk all the cows you want.

889
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,040
Yep, carry some chickens and make, you know, friends with your neighbors.

890
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,040
There you have it.

891
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,040
Speaking of milking things, you know what's kind of crazy?

892
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,940
I saw that they're doing a third Lost in Blue game.

893
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,200
When did the second one ever come out?

894
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,400
Like, I remember they were making one.

895
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,160
I think I actually played it for a few seconds at the show.

896
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,680
Oh, shit, I don't remember when it came out, I think it was like October-ish.

897
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,640
Is that game like really a cult hit or something?

898
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,680
I guess, I don't know, I thought the first one sucked.

899
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,440
I did not like the first game either.

900
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
I don't know.

901
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
Strange.

902
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
Whatever.

903
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,320
Anyways, so apparently Microsoft is a little bit sorry for the fact that Xbox Live has

904
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:42,680
been having issues this last few weeks here, and to apologize for that, they're going

905
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:49,140
to be offering all Xbox Live members around the world one free Xbox Live arcade game.

906
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,960
No word on which game it is, or if we're going to get a choice or what.

907
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,800
Hopefully it's not something I already own.

908
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,600
I've heard rumblings, and you can take this as like a friend of a friend thing, which

909
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,740
holds little to no weight, but from what I hear, it's a game that nobody has yet.

910
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,960
One of the future releases is going to be free in light of this, and it's not something

911
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,000
like Yaris.

912
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,920
My mind instantly went to, great, we're going to get the Doritos game for free.

913
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,240
No, it's something people actually want, apparently.

914
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,180
Yeah, because I'd be sad when Carcassonne was free for everybody, most people were happy

915
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,100
about that because hardly anyone bought it.

916
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,880
I bought it previously, so I didn't get anything out of that deal, so I hope it's something

917
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:40,080
new like, you know, Rez, coming out next week, for free, would be nice, would be very nice.

918
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,320
I don't think anybody would complain if Rez was the game.

919
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,900
But yeah, if it's going to be like, like Ross Deal says, it's probably going to be Robotron,

920
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,560
or Frogger or something, I think everybody will just be like, wah, and then of course,

921
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:59,880
half the chat room is going, Yaris 2, Yaris 2, anyhow, I really don't know, but I do want

922
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,500
to say this, I want to take the opportunity to say this, I don't know if you saw it on

923
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,080
our forums, but somebody actually made a YouTube of Yaris set to the music of Dragon Force,

924
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,800
as inspired by our show, so I think that might come up in the mailbag later, so I won't blow

925
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,000
all the details on that just yet, on how you can access that, but I saw that on our forums,

926
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,440
it was kind of cool.

927
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,320
Meanwhile, I will mention this about the Xbox Live outages, some people are pissed about

928
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:32,360
this, they're so pissed, they're filing a lawsuit, that's right, when there's a problem

929
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,840
that a major company is having, leave it to the parasites to jump on and file a class

930
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,040
action lawsuit, three folks out of Texas have filed a class action lawsuit against the company,

931
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,340
what they call breach of contract, the lawsuit goes on to whine about, quote, many plaintiffs

932
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:55,640
being kicked offline, blah, blah, blah, and to some extent, I understand these guys where

933
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,760
they're pissed off, because Xbox costs $50 a year, so when you're paying for it, especially

934
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,960
during the time of year when most people are going to use it, it ought to be working.

935
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,960
However, Microsoft, to give them credit, I think has always been a company very good

936
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,800
about apologizing when they fuck up, you know what I mean, hence they're going to give out

937
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,380
the free game, they've been very forthright in saying, we made a mistake, we're not happy

938
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,160
about it, you can tell if you read Major Nelson's blog or his Twitter, he is livid about what's

939
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,980
going on, and he's working overtime to try and fix it, it's not like they're sitting

940
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,720
on their big duff, not trying to do anything about it, so I kind of give them a little

941
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,520
bit of credit, and I forgive them.

942
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,040
They don't guarantee that they're always going to be up either.

943
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Exactly.

944
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,640
Should I sue them because they run maintenance on their server sometimes, and it's not, you

945
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,940
know, during a time I want to play, I mean it's not really fair, it's just these drunken

946
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,600
people are just trying to get money from whatever, they're all Microsoft, they've got money to

947
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,240
spend, let's see if we can get some of it.

948
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,680
Well, you know the thing about a class action lawsuit is that it's supposed to represent

949
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,280
all users, right?

950
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,760
So allow me to say, you do not represent me, I do not wish to participate in this lawsuit.

951
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,720
I don't give a shit if they didn't give me anything to compensate me for their live service

952
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,220
being down, big deal, it's down for a couple of weeks.

953
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,720
You know what, if they really wanted to, they can give me like two weeks free or something

954
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,600
like that, it's a big deal.

955
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,040
I'd have been fine with that.

956
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,960
Just defer, you know, that's...

957
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,480
That's what the cable company does when your service is out, you call, complain, they give

958
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,280
you a credit for the time your service was out.

959
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,520
And a lot of things do that.

960
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,120
I'm trying to think of what else, there's something that very commonly gives like the

961
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
free...

962
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,480
I think Warcraft's done that before, they give free days or free week if something goes

963
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,480
on.

964
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,480
I know other games have done this too.

965
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,840
I'm sure Xbox Live would not be opposed to doing something like that.

966
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,120
I mean, seriously, are they actually going to try to sue them for what?

967
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,800
Like let's just say if they cut out a whole month, that's like $5.

968
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,960
Oh my God, you're out $5, poor baby.

969
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm sure in that user license agreement thingy that you have to...

970
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,180
You know how like every time you sign up for something, you have to read the user license

971
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,680
agreement and most people just click okay.

972
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,300
I could not believe that somewhere in there is not some type of clause that says, we do

973
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,840
not guarantee it's going to be up 100% of the time, the service may be down intermittently,

974
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
you can't hold us...

975
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
You know, there's got to...

976
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,640
The lawyers had to have thought something like this might happen, you know, and put

977
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
that in there in advance.

978
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
It's stupid.

979
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
It's $5.

980
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,600
It's not like you're paying, you know, $50 a month or something like that.

981
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,600
It's $5, seriously.

982
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:34,040
It's going to cost more in like lawyer fees than you would be getting from, you know,

983
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,040
this $5.

984
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,120
Frisbee says in chat, terms of service covers it all.

985
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,640
There it is.

986
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,760
So yeah, so we'll see what happens with this class action lawsuit.

987
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,920
We'll keep you guys posted, that is, if anything actually comes of this, but we shall see.

988
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,920
So...

989
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:01,640
Well, for anyone who remembers the Tickle Me Elmo craze or how Beanie Babies went, we

990
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,580
are having a repeat with a plushie weighted companion cube.

991
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:11,800
This makes me laugh, especially since they've said on Valve's site that they were going

992
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,360
to be making more of them.

993
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,280
So stupid.

994
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,760
Someone paid $365 for a plushie weighted companion cube and opened on eBay.

995
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,400
And to that I say, fucking stupid!

996
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,480
You want to hear something fucking stupid?

997
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,180
What about that retard that paid $9,000 for that Xbox 360 that, or not Xbox 360, Guitar

998
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:38,040
Hero 3 that some father was giving away because his son smoked pot.

999
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,480
You're an idiot if you buy Guitar Hero for $9,000.

1000
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,320
You know how much weed that whole family is going to be able to buy for $9,000, sucka?

1001
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,480
Do you really, I mean, you do realize that the guy could have been making it all up,

1002
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,880
and do you realize you paid $9,000 for something that's really easy to find?

1003
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
You idiot!

1004
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,800
I have a $5 bill, guess what, I took it away from my unborn son because he smoked pot in

1005
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,960
the future.

1006
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,120
I want $9,000.

1007
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,320
And on top of that...

1008
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,720
You know what's sad?

1009
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,680
If we signed some piece of OLR memorabilia, like if we took a ferret and signed it or

1010
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,200
something and tried to put it on eBay, we'd be lucky to get $1.99 for it.

1011
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,600
I think that we should do something gimmicky like that.

1012
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,960
You want to do something gimmicky?

1013
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Let's do something gimmicky.

1014
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,040
I'll tell you what, I'm going to sign my weighted companion cube and we'll put that up on eBay.

1015
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
A paper one.

1016
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Yes, we'll make a weighted...

1017
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,240
There's a paper weighted companion cube online.

1018
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,240
Fair enough.

1019
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,480
We will make a weighted companion cube out of paper and sign it and make up some story

1020
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,960
about how we stole it from a baby in the crib or something and see how much money we get

1021
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
it from it.

1022
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
Okay.

1023
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,320
We traded a dingo, a baby, for the weighted companion cube.

1024
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,840
The dingo ate my companion cube!

1025
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,560
That'd be a hungry dingo.

1026
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
You bastard.

1027
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Portal 2.

1028
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
The dingo ate my companion cube.

1029
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
That's so stupid, though.

1030
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
Oh my god.

1031
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
I see...

1032
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:04,440
Now, I wanted one fairly bad and Dan was actually going to get me one for Christmas, but you

1033
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,640
know, how long did it take them to sell out?

1034
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,640
Four hours?

1035
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,720
Drunami brings up an excellent point.

1036
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,580
Don't we have an orange bat somewhere still from back in the day?

1037
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,280
It's in the vault.

1038
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
We might have to get that.

1039
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,200
We might have to pull that out of the vault because we have a blank one, don't we?

1040
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
No.

1041
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
I thought we did.

1042
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,200
We could do a new one.

1043
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
We need to get a black...

1044
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,160
I had to save the original orange bat, though, because it was the one that was signed at...

1045
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
What tournament was that?

1046
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Now, here's what we're going to do.

1047
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,160
March Madness.

1048
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,160
Fine, we'll get a new one.

1049
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,840
We're going to get an orange bat, sign it, beat something with it, and that'll be our

1050
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,280
story and then we'll sell it.

1051
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,760
And then if we put Portal in the search details on eBay, it'll sell.

1052
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,760
Exactly.

1053
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,400
We'll say we wrote...

1054
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,320
We'll just write Portal on the bat.

1055
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,240
And if it makes enough money, then we'll come visit you.

1056
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,120
If it makes enough money.

1057
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:05,320
We should have one with a reserve up there that's like, um, buy an Orange Lounge Radio

1058
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
visit.

1059
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,920
Where you have to pay for us to come out and feed us.

1060
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,160
I don't know about that.

1061
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,640
Again, we'd be lucky to get $1.99.

1062
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,040
Anyway, let's move on.

1063
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:22,160
Anyways, so Ubisoft has announced Far Cry 2 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1064
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,960
Of course, the new Far Cry game not being in the tropics, it's actually going to be

1065
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,560
in the African Savannah, Africa!

1066
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,600
And you will be able to, you know, destroy stuff and it'll be awesome.

1067
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,640
But um, I don't know.

1068
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,000
I can't wait to play it.

1069
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,040
So um, hopefully it'll come out around the same time as the PC version, which is due

1070
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,480
out this spring.

1071
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,760
But um, no word though if that's actually going to happen yet.

1072
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,000
They just said it's going to ship sometime in Ubisoft's 08-09 fiscal year.

1073
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,200
So that could be anytime between now and forever.

1074
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,540
Our chat room, seriously, sorry, not to discount your story, but our chat room, fucking geniuses.

1075
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,540
They're brilliant.

1076
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,540
Okay, here it is.

1077
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,080
They say we're going to sell this as the Orange Companion Bat, and we're going to beat Jamie's

1078
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,400
copy of Imagine Babies with it, and now it's the beaten companion bat.

1079
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
That's great.

1080
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Chat room winner.

1081
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
It'll happen.

1082
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
It'll happen.

1083
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Watch.

1084
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,000
So, man, I love our chat room.

1085
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,600
Well, speaking of people who are infinitely awesome, that would be Hideo Kojima.

1086
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,960
Aha, how's that?

1087
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
Nice transition.

1088
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,160
I know, I'm awesome tonight.

1089
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,200
Somebody I would let beat me with an orange bat.

1090
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,320
I wouldn't let him beat me with an orange bat.

1091
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,400
But he was basically quoted saying that he thinks that there should be more realistic

1092
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,560
violence in a game so that you can see the consequences of your actions.

1093
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:59,900
He's quoted saying, I don't think there are many games that tackle violence head on.

1094
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:05,640
When you hit someone or inflict pain, faces get disfigured, for example, and I want to

1095
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,360
make games that show that sort of thing.

1096
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,480
If you don't see the pain, you can't understand what you've done, and you'll pass through

1097
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,380
battles without taking responsibility for your actions.

1098
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,480
I don't want to ignore that.

1099
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,600
I want players to think, even if it's just a little, about what violence and war are.

1100
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,160
No pain, no game.

1101
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,120
There you go.

1102
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,640
But I actually do think that that's a, you know, if they can do it in a freaking racing

1103
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,040
game, why can't they do it in, you know, Metal Gear or anything like that?

1104
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:42,320
I think that that's actually pretty smart, you know, because, you know, especially I

1105
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,600
was noticing, you know, with the, I guess, parents and people who are saying, oh, violent

1106
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,440
video games, blah, blah, blah, you know, desensitizing the violence and everything.

1107
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,520
Well, if they're so desensitizing, then why not put that sort of consequence in a game,

1108
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,080
you know, see how it, what happens.

1109
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,960
I think that's actually pretty smart.

1110
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,840
In Soviet Russia, games shoot you.

1111
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:08,960
I think that is a very good idea.

1112
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,760
That's so, so dumb.

1113
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
I know, it's horrible.

1114
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,240
Look, the show's free, folks, you know.

1115
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,640
Can you believe the Writers Guild's on strike right now?

1116
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,320
Rob's on the cutting edge of comedy right now.

1117
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,080
Shut up and read the next story.

1118
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:38,600
Well, perhaps Yakko Smirnoff is not really the, anyways, that may not be your kind of

1119
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:47,040
thing, but hopefully this is, and I hope to God that they don't fuck this up, because

1120
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,880
they could easily fuck this up.

1121
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:56,920
Apparently, though, there is a placeholder for Iron Chef on the Wii, according to GameStop,

1122
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,720
and it's supposedly coming out in June sometime.

1123
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,800
I just hope it's not Iron Chef America, because that show fucking sucks.

1124
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,480
Oh, hell no, it has to be Cheeseball, original Iron Chef.

1125
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,880
Then that would be awesome.

1126
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,600
And it needs to have Chairman Kaga.

1127
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,960
No, this game needs to have us one of the Iron Chefs, Cooking Mama.

1128
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,560
That would be winnin' awesome.

1129
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,140
That would be.

1130
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,600
Mama will have to fix your pathetic performance.

1131
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,200
It would be great.

1132
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,120
Come on, Iron Chef meets Cooking Mama.

1133
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,600
It's destined to happen.

1134
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,160
Anyhow, I guess this was destined to happen at some point, too.

1135
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,560
I'm just surprised it took so long for some website to run a story with the headline,

1136
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,640
Kid Wees on a Wii.

1137
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,680
You, sir, are on the cutting edge of comedy.

1138
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,360
That's right, speaking of being on the cutting edge of comedy, this little four-year-old

1139
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:58,840
named Ellis Ensley in Fleetwood in the UK, him and his six-year-old brother were fighting

1140
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,440
over their brand new Nintendo Wii.

1141
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,640
And by the way, the dad had spent forever trying to get the Nintendo Wii, you know,

1142
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,640
camping outside and all that.

1143
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,240
Well, I don't know if he camped outside, but he was, you know, one of those parents.

1144
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,480
He worked three jobs.

1145
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,440
He sold his wife to slavery.

1146
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,720
He had to walk through glass and two miles in the snow and the river just to get to school

1147
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,720
and buy this Wii.

1148
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
And molten hot lava.

1149
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,420
That's right.

1150
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:27,840
And they got this Wii, and when the four-year-old and the six-year-old started fighting over

1151
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,680
it, did the kid cry?

1152
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,680
No.

1153
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,240
Did he go to his room and pout?

1154
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,240
No.

1155
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,360
What did he do?

1156
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,360
He peed on it.

1157
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,880
He broke out his Wii and weed on the Wii.

1158
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,240
That's right, he weed on the Wii and reporters everywhere rejoice that they can finally use

1159
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,760
that in a headline.

1160
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,600
I'm just surprised it took so damn long, honestly.

1161
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,800
Well, his kids are fucking misbehaved anyways if they're pissing on stuff in their house.

1162
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:55,340
And let alone the geniuses that are pissing on stuff that's connected to the wall with

1163
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,040
electricity running through it.

1164
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,040
I only wish...

1165
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,320
He's four years old, therefore not very smart.

1166
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,960
I only wish that he had gotten electrocuted.

1167
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,280
Still, you need to teach kid a lesson, rub his nose in it.

1168
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,000
Kid wheezes on Wii?

1169
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,480
Wii kills kid.

1170
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,480
Awesome.

1171
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,480
That's bad.

1172
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,960
He's four!

1173
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,960
But still.

1174
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Hey!

1175
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,960
Still.

1176
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Survival of the fittest.

1177
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Smartest.

1178
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:25,560
Hey, when I was four, I knew it was not okay to piss on the electric fence, okay?

1179
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:31,120
Yes, when I was four, I was told not to eat the yellow snow, so you know, a lot of us,

1180
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
you know...

1181
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,600
It doesn't snow here, Rob.

1182
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,080
It does up the hill a little bit, where we would sometimes travel to.

1183
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
Okay, fine.

1184
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,080
All right.

1185
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,080
Anyhow.

1186
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:45,280
Son of Dad in chat says, did they both pee on the Wii?

1187
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,600
Don't cross the streams.

1188
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,500
Anyhow.

1189
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:02,500
Okay, well, that's it for this week's episode of The Classic Game of the Week, and I hope

1190
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,500
you enjoyed it.

1191
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,500
If you did, please like and subscribe, and I'll see you in the next one.

1192
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Bye.

1193
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Bye.

1194
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Bye.

1195
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Bye.

1196
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Bye.

1197
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:25,880
So, Dark Soccer and Linus, what game have you selected as the Classic Game of the Week

1198
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
this week?

1199
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:45,320
Well, I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week, and I've been selected as the

1200
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,320
Classic Game of the Week.

1201
01:04:48,320 --> 01:05:03,000
I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.

1202
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:12,680
I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.

1203
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:30,040
You can combine two of the four different weapons to make different unique weapons.

1204
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:38,640
It actually spawned a sequel, which was Gunstar Superheroes.

1205
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,520
We have flies in the building.

1206
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,840
Yes, while the storms are going on, the flies are like,

1207
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,640
Ooh, it's warm in the studio.

1208
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,880
But Gunstar Superheroes came out on Game Boy Advance,

1209
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,160
which was a pretty cool little game.

1210
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:01,160
And then a couple of years ago, Sega put out a Sega Ages collection,

1211
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,360
which was called the Treasure Box, which had Gunstar Heroes,

1212
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,840
Dynamite Headdy, and Alien Soldier in the collection.

1213
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,320
It's a really cool game, and I think one of Treasure's best.

1214
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,440
For everyone always bitching that Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week is too obscure and

1215
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,640
hard to find, here's one that you can download on the Wii Virtual Console very easily.

1216
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,880
That was when we were playing yesterday on Virtual Console.

1217
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,480
We had it in, and I was like, Hey, that sounds familiar.

1218
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,200
And Dan was like, It's because it's Gunstar Heroes, duh.

1219
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
And I'm like, Oh yeah.

1220
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
And so he was playing the hell out of that.

1221
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
So Gunstar Heroes is one of the best games ever.

1222
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:43,160
All right, so there it is, your Classic Game of the Week at Gunstar Heroes.

1223
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,160
And it's Treasure.

1224
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,160
By Treasure.

1225
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,720
I'm sure at some point before this segment is retired, every Treasure game will have

1226
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,720
come up at one point.

1227
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,720
Maybe not.

1228
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,720
There's a few I'm not too big on.

1229
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,720
All right, just about.

1230
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,440
All right, anyhow, that's it for part A. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break,

1231
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,680
but we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.

1232
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,200
