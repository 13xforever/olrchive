1
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:25,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 6, 2008, rumors abound of another Xbox 360 model, Rock Band gets new songs from the magazine, and later this month you can call our show from your PSP.

2
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:36,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:43,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:49,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

7
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you, Ms.

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Summers?

9
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm recovering.

10
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:53,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been kind of sick.

11
00:00:53,814 --> 00:01:00,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember last week on our year-end show you were sinus-y and sniffly, but you seem a little better this week.

12
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:11,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me practically the whole week to get over my sinus infection and drinking to excess on New Year's Eve did not help, nor did singing for Odd Rock Band, nor did that help.

13
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you have about 80% HP this week.

14
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week you were in the red, definitely.

15
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:24,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday I got to work and I was just in hell.

16
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:27,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called in on Thursday and Friday and tried to get to the doctor.

17
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:34,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently all the medical facilities lost power because of our crazy Alabama-esque storms.

18
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in a moment.

19
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Our non-gaming bit.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

21
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:46,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up having to talk to the advice nurse and sent out the husband to get the drugs.

22
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:49,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm functional today.

23
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:51,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me cast Cure on you.

24
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:53,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the last day.

25
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the very last of my antibiotics today.

26
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,399
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

27
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully that'll work.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,161
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be backed up to 100% health next week.

29
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll even gain a level.

30
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:05,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

31
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining us as well, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

32
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:08,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

33
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:09,446
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Loki?

34
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:10,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you?

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you at 100% HP this week?

37
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:16,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading Engadget right now.

38
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:17,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you?

39
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just catching up on the Sony thing.

40
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, because as we are taping live, we do subject ourselves to a live taping every week.

41
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:32,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, this very moment, as we were taping on this Sunday night, Consumer Electronics Show is just starting to get underway.

42
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually kind of funny because...

43
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:36,767
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

44
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,086
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably shouldn't do that because the crazy storms are on the way.

45
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually thought about going to Vegas.

46
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was looking at hotels in Vegas.

47
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:59,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I cannot â€“ why are all the hotel rooms doubling as of Monday night?

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were looking at rooms like Excalibur and Circus Circus and like some of the not-so-high-end places, right?

49
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And like these places were shooting up to like twice as much.

50
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,281
[SPEAKER_01]: If I plan better.

52
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,361
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't announce too much.

53
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:34,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lot of gaming stuff, but I happen to be a little bit of a tech nerd in addition to a gaming nerd, as I'm sure a lot of our fans are.

54
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,907
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of tech nerdiness that goes with the gaming nerdiness, right?

55
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:38,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?

56
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:39,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

57
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:40,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be fun to go.

58
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And even William was like, I want to go to that sometime, because you know him.

59
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,333
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes to look at the big TVs and all that stuff, and he's the only PlayStation 3 supporter I know of in the world.

60
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I support the PlayStation 3.

61
00:03:53,933 --> 00:04:05,917
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll be supporting their online services as soon as they come out with those prepaid cards for their online content because I don't want to set up an account and deduct money with my credit card.

62
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:12,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather use my hundreds of dollars of GameStop credit to buy cards that can translate to that.

63
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:28,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony should seriously consider hiring my boyfriend as their Major Nelson or something like that because he'll seriously tell people, with me sitting right there, and I've been fairly critical of Sony, although I like to think I'm fair, but he'll sit there and tell me, oh no, you want a PlayStation 3 because it has Motorstorm.

64
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:34,748
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get a PlayStation 3 because it has four chips in it and it's like having four brains.

65
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, but when you don't have any games to play on those four brains, what's the point?

66
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And we argue about this all the time.

67
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:43,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

68
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:44,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

69
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:50,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be talking about Consumer Electronics Show on throughout the night, but first let's start off a little bit.

70
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:52,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to talk about this too.

71
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Those storms have been nuts.

72
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been absolutely crazy.

73
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:01,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I guess Loki and I are probably spoiled, though, because we've lived in California our entire lives.

74
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:07,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, for those of you guys who don't live in California, we are freaking spoiled here when it comes to storms and things like that.

75
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,058
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit, Sherlock.

76
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a freaking hurricane coming in or something.

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,040
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but that's how everybody was calling it.

79
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:15,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a hurricane.

80
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It was horrible.

81
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:18,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more like a tropical storm.

82
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:19,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

83
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:27,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But it damn near had us not do a show tonight because my internet was down for the longest time and I was afraid that we weren't going to be able to do a show tonight because we had no internet.

84
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:30,545
[SPEAKER_02]: This giant tree fell just up the street and knocked out a bunch of power.

85
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,786
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of homes in the block are still without power.

86
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,766
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of the traffic lights were out.

87
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:41,668
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, I don't see why at least Sacramento isn't better prepared for heavy rain.

88
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:42,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

89
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every winter is the rainy season.

90
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:47,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

91
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:54,739
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple years ago, I remember when it wasn't as windy, but it rained as badly.

92
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the first time that I've lived in this state that I can safely say that the weather has woken me up from a deep sleep.

93
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And that hasn't happened since I lived in Alabama.

94
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, that happened during the Type 2 hurricane.

95
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:13,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

96
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:17,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't here the night the big storm hit.

97
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:24,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Williams that night and then I came back yesterday and one of our trash cans is gone.

98
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:25,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Missing.

99
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,816
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea where it is.

100
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it flew up the street or where the hell it is.

101
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely gone.

102
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Oz.

103
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

104
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:36,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, where the fuck am I going to put my trash?

105
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:37,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Call the city.

106
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:38,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, I haven't been here.

107
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:41,737
[SPEAKER_02]: My roommate, my poor roommate, they went on vacation to Mendocino.

108
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: This big family vacation.

109
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,098
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent the whole time up there without power.

110
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,978
[SPEAKER_02]: They played Yahtzee by Candlelight.

111
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:47,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they spent their time.

112
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that before.

113
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,480
[SPEAKER_02]: What a vacation, though.

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I played D&D by Candlelight.

115
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of those things where once you get the house, you can't get your money back.

116
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just had to kind of grin and bear it.

117
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, it has nothing to do with games.

118
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except for the fact that when there's an outage, you know, no games for you.

119
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:06,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I talked to Extifer.

120
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:07,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

121
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to Extifer for a little bit, and he said his power was out, but that he had his iPhone, so everything was good.

122
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

123
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:15,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank God.

124
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,000
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me earlier this week and said, oh, is your power out?

125
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:31,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sitting there with my laptop in my lap and my PC sitting there, like, chugging out power from, you know, the wall, just, like, blasting air as I'm, like, running stress tests and stuff, and I'm like, no, my power hasn't been out.

126
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Our power flickered for a little bit.

127
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, that's okay because I'm freaking sick.

128
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just sleep through it.

129
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,075
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my whole thing.

130
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But I needed to go to the doctor really badly because I had been coughing rather heavily.

131
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:54,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that a lot of our longtime listeners remember when I had the plague.

132
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I started off as a sinus infection, went into bronchitis, went into pneumonia.

133
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:01,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sick for three months.

134
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole thing is I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.

135
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:11,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed to go, but thankfully, the advice nurse gave me good advice.

136
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:18,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking about how many people at the medical facilities, people with injuries.

137
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's point was, he's like, well, I'd rather you be sick for another couple of weeks than be in the hospital.

138
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I know how to drive in this weather.

139
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,371
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, you do, but no one else does.

140
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:30,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

141
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,836
[SPEAKER_02]: When it rains in California, everybody forgets how to drive.

142
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:36,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And my drive tire is almost bald, so he wouldn't drive me either.

143
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:37,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Only when it rains.

144
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're turning into the Weather Channel podcast.

145
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:47,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys, but it's definitely been a topic on our minds this week, and it has impacted our gaming weeks, I'm sure.

146
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:51,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it impacted mine, but I'll let Jamie start off with how was your gaming week, as we always do.

147
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play my DS, and my eyes hurt too badly from my sinus pressure, so I basically played a lot of Ragnarok.

148
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:04,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play pinball and got dizzy, so I didn't play any more pinball.

149
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:12,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan did break out Assassin's Creed on New Year morning.

150
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:18,254
[SPEAKER_03]: His buddy Eric broke it out, so I actually got to see quite a bit more of that in person.

151
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty, but I heard quite a bit of cursing coming from the other room on Thursday when Will came over to play.

152
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,735
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course there was lots of Rock Band.

153
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:32,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of Rock Band.

154
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:33,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my Ninja Pass.

155
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:41,378
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ninja Pass is this lovely device that uses a micro SD card to load Game Boy DS games.

156
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:43,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

157
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of this.

158
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:56,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, of course we cannot on the air condone piracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I have the Lendon too and I have the Tingle game.

159
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't loaded them yet but I have them

160
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with doing that to imports.

161
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, ethically, I'm okay with pirating the imports because it's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, if you're not going to release it here, which I know some people are going to yell at me going, it's still wrong.

162
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:12,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, that's fine.

163
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:16,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But my old philosophy is if you're not going to release it here, then I'm going to get it one way or another.

164
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not paying those insane markup fees.

165
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is insane to import a game.

166
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,772
[SPEAKER_02]: But games that are released here domestically, I don't really pirate.

167
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy most of my games.

168
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:27,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a few games that...

169
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that looked interesting.

170
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:36,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to put in my jump drive and get the names of them because a few of them I don't remember.

171
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:41,960
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it'll be a pretty good investment.

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they were like $40 a piece, and my friend ordered them in bulk.

173
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So both my husband and I have one.

174
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to using the hell out of it as soon as I can get the reader to work.

175
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, have fun with that.

176
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:57,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know how it goes.

177
00:10:58,883 --> 00:10:59,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

178
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:02,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my game week was pretty good.

179
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:09,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know, I don't know, you guys always call me the Tech Master Loki and stuff, but I guess I kind of earned my title.

180
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought my 360 back from death.

181
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:15,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right, my three ring 360 is working again.

182
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm super awesome like that.

183
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:29,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it just involved taking the whole thing apart and replacing what they call the X-Clamp, which is something that holds the heat sink in place, and, uh, once I did that, it worked fine, so.

184
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

185
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:35,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that makes the console count six.

186
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:39,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I now own six 360s, which is ridiculous.

187
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:46,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So you brought back the Red Rings of Death from the Brink of Death completely on your own, and what technique did you use to do it?

188
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:56,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically, if you search for X-Clamp replacement, it literally takes about $6 in parts to do it.

189
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:59,970
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some screws and a couple washers, and that's about it.

190
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:10,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you do is because the way they built the clamp, which was genius to begin with, is it all focuses, it looks like kind of an X with all the points bent down.

191
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:15,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the middle is closest to the board, and they have a little, like, plastic spacer on there.

192
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:17,034
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:46,218
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

194
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:19,532
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to Loki's 360, Frisbee says, Towelie brings Xboxes back to life.

195
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Referring to the towel trick.

196
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't really need to do that, actually.

197
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:32,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird, because what you're supposed to do after you do that replacement of the clip, you're supposed to turn it on without fans, and it's supposed to overheat.

198
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:33,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did that.

199
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you turn it on.

200
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,736
[SPEAKER_01]: and wait for the three lights to turn the two lights.

201
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,977
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did it almost instantly, and then I left it on there for about two minutes.

202
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:44,077
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, though, is it didn't really heat up at all.

203
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I felt the top, I felt the heatsink, felt the bottom.

204
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think, okay, this thing's going to be on fire, but it didn't even feel that different at all.

205
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And poor Akuda, I'm reading this chat.

206
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuda in chat says, ugh, I got the red ring of death this week, the day I got my 360.

207
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,702
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

208
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:01,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks to be you, my friend.

209
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear it.

210
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it happened to me three days after I bought mine, so it's not too much different.

211
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:12,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, if I hadn't opened my system, I probably would have just sent it in to get replaced, but I did open my system.

212
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakuramax says, Loki, you should just work at the 360 repair center.

213
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you consider repairing somebody else's, like a legit system?

214
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:30,193
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've actually, you know, I would say if they can't send it back into Microsoft, then sure, I would do it, because it only took like six bucks with parts, but, you know...

215
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:40,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not guaranteed to work all the time, but from what I read on there, because they have a thread with all the success stories, about 90% of them get repaired that way.

216
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:42,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.

217
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:50,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured for $6 and it's broken anyways, the worst that will happen is I waste $6 and the 360 is not replaced, but it works, so great.

218
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:55,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, beyond all that, I actually played a few games this week.

219
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I borrowed my wife's copy of

220
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Planet Puzzle League, because I bought it for her.

221
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that game is pretty fun.

222
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:09,785
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of Luminous, actually, a little bit, because they've got kind of good music that goes with the whole thing, and the background is kind of flashy and stuff.

223
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,546
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a really fun puzzle game.

224
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever play Pokemon Puzzle League?

225
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:14,146
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

226
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:15,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Same game.

227
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:15,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.

228
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:16,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, whatever.

229
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

230
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:17,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still fun.

231
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:18,328
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's still fun.

232
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:18,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

233
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

234
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:19,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it.

235
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let's see what else they play.

236
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Crysis, because I finally finished my computer.

237
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,084
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's fun.

238
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:40,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, if you played Far Cry Instincts, it's basically the same damn thing except now, you know, instead of being like some vampire, not vampire, like a werewolf type thing, you have this wonderful suit that can, you know, do amazing stuff and it's very pretty.

239
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:44,021
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite aspect of the entire game is all the wildlife running around.

240
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:49,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, I'll be fighting off, you know, some Koreans and stuff in the game and then all of a sudden I'll see this, like,

241
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:52,925
[SPEAKER_01]: A flock of birds run by and immediately I turn fire on them.

242
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I pick up a chicken and hook it up into the air and then fire it.

243
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:03,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Or my other favorite is there was this turtle that I found around the beach when you first land in the beginning of the game.

244
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to put it back out into the sea.

245
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately I switched to strength mode and I threw the turtle and the impact of the water killed it.

246
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I also punched it, too, because I was trying to pick it up.

247
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't know how to pick stuff up yet.

248
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,645
[SPEAKER_01]: This game sounds rad.

249
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:20,766
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

250
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:24,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see seagulls flying around and literally just fire them all in the air.

251
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:29,328
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part of the game, just all the crap that you can do that's in it.

252
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:33,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point out this other comment in chat that's pretty good.

253
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your most vocal critics here in chat, Ross Steel UT, who's always...

254
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,688
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

255
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send those cards and love letters to Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com That system will never see live ever again.

256
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:06,055
[SPEAKER_02]: But my other one, that's a different story.

257
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:11,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting though, I mean, for being such a, you know, I get the sense you don't do this stuff to steal.

258
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:16,660
[SPEAKER_02]: You do this because you like the challenge of modding systems and making them look cool.

259
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's kind of always why I've kind of turned the eye to it is that I always think you were more kind of in it for the challenge.

260
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you do own six Xbox 360s.

261
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That's way more than an average person would own.

262
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:33,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't really want to own that many, but that's all right.

263
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, banned until 999 AD.

264
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, whatever.

265
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:36,650
9999.

266
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, darn.

267
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,552
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of my 360s gets banned off live, gee, what will I ever do?

268
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:42,313
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

269
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:43,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

270
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else for Gaming Week?

271
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:46,015
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

272
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:51,198
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we move on, I wanted to give you guys your Christmas gifts since I didn't have them last week.

273
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Presents!

274
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:53,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

275
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:53,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

276
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize ahead of time.

277
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:56,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't kill me.

278
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:23,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to love this.

279
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:23,836
[SPEAKER_01]: What did Jamie get?

280
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,437
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a copy of Imagine Babies.

281
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:31,961
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

282
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:34,983
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one they have there.

283
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:43,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie got a copy of Imagine Babies with a Z. Take care of up to six babies.

284
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:45,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the back for us.

285
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,451
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they advertise this game?

286
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:52,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy the babies good food, furniture, cute baby outfits, and toys.

287
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Customize your house through minigames.

288
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

289
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:08,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I think everybody in iPod listening land or however you're listening to this program, PSP, whatever, is hearing the dot dot dot through their speakers right now.

290
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,560
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's too good.

291
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually looks kind of cute.

292
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:13,503
[SPEAKER_02]: She's coming around.

293
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:16,965
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as long as they're virtual babies, I don't mind.

294
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,821
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

295
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:22,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You should raise some babies and then tell the hubby, here's your baby.

296
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,647
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

297
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:25,928
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there you go.

298
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:27,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Practical use for it.

299
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a part in the game where you can shake the baby, so I know.

300
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:33,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

301
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,740
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually kind of cute, though.

302
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chat room is

303
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:44,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I was staring at it blankly.

304
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the thoughtful gift.

305
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:53,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping... Well, I was kind of trying to get some stuff to play this week.

306
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:02,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it that... I don't even remember how it's... Patapon or something like that?

307
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,507
[SPEAKER_01]: That one weird one that looks like LocoRoco?

308
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:05,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

309
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:09,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Macman says, hey honey, I'm pregnant with digital babies.

310
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:10,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

311
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:13,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go into detail about the physical...

312
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:31,813
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

313
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You make it sound so sexy.

314
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:01,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Does someone have a chainsaw outside?

315
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best thing ever.

316
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:10,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know you guys can't hear this over the thing, but somebody's out there with a... Someone's out there with a chainsaw.

317
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Either a chainsaw or like a... Or a weed whacker.

318
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed whacker or something.

319
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably trying to clean up debris from the storm.

320
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a chainsaw.

321
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:20,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Who like, you know, does yard work at night?

322
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:23,826
[SPEAKER_03]: There were repair crews over on the crossroad.

323
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, it's crazy around here.

324
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, My Gaming Week.

325
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,002
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never going to get to the gaming news.

326
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:32,803
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny is that a lot of people say I play too much WoW.

327
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:33,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

328
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:39,066
[SPEAKER_02]: My internet was down for 24 hours thanks to the storm, so no WoW for me, QQ.

329
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:39,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so sad.

330
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:46,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did have to play other games, and I spent some time playing Mario Galaxy, which I love more and more every time I play it.

331
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just amazing, and I love its little bits of retroness they have in it in regards to some of the music and things.

332
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:54,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I raved about it last week.

333
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to say much more, but I do love...

334
00:21:57,035 --> 00:22:00,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I also played some more of Rock Band.

335
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:03,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I played till my arm literally hurt and felt like it was going to fall off.

336
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:04,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a lot of fun.

337
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just played through a variety of various Xbox Live Arcade games I needed to catch up on.

338
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:16,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made use of my HD DVD player this week because I bought Stardust on HD DVD a couple weeks ago and I never got around to watching it.

339
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put it in the HD player and was watching that.

340
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much how I spent my time with the outage.

341
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And GS68 says, Thank you, Storms, for keeping Sky off the war crack.

342
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:32,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says, Chainsaw Guy from Resident Evil 4 is outside and is coming to get us.

343
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope not.

344
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:33,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That would suck.

345
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really gruesome ending.

346
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've ever had your head chopped off by a Chainsaw Guy.

347
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

348
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally sucks.

349
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,192
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it happens to me all the time.

350
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:47,549
[SPEAKER_02]: RustyLUT, who just seems to be a critic in general.

351
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,930
[SPEAKER_02]: He's critical of Loki's stance on things.

352
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,431
[SPEAKER_02]: He's critical of my WoW playing.

353
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,152
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, oh God, no WoW for one whole day.

354
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,152
[SPEAKER_02]: How could Sky exist without his second job?

355
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:59,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But I apparently can do no wrong.

356
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:00,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you ass.

357
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I love taunting the listeners.

358
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I respect the opinion.

359
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But WOW is my third job.

360
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:11,029
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR is my second job, and then my day job is my first job.

361
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So WOW is my third job.

362
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to taunt me, get it right.

363
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:22,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's chowing down on the whole wheat cookies William made for the New Year's party.

364
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.

365
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,361
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really good.

366
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: They restore 10 HP when you eat them, too, so eat a lot.

367
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,125
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also full of fiber.

368
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:30,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

369
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Our work's trying to get a dev kit for 360.

370
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:35,043
[SPEAKER_01]: What for?

371
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:37,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

372
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:38,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to have?

373
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.

374
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:42,013
[SPEAKER_02]: A dev kit.

375
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to point out, I know Op.

376
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:47,576
[SPEAKER_02]: 11's down tonight, but we have some new decorations in the studio I guess you'll see next week.

377
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in this strip mall that had a lot of little stores in it that had imported things.

378
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:58,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a big Kingdom Hearts wall scroll that's now up on the wall that's pretty awesome.

379
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to say, that's a really great artwork.

380
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:02,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that artwork comes from, but it's great.

381
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:06,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Final Fantasy XIII poster, if you can believe it, which is totally a bootleg, I think.

382
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody just took Sony's official release picture and made a poster out of it, but it looks great nonetheless.

383
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So, some new decorations to look forward to when the cam comes back.

384
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, we'll get into some housekeeping tonight.

385
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:20,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some things I wanted to say really quickly.

386
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:39,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Launch Radio's rotation of music is going to be changing this week, which is going to cause some downtime either Monday or Tuesday during the day, but not a lot of people are listening during the day anyway, so I imagine people probably aren't even going to notice, but I just wanted to get that out there that the station will be down for a little bit on Monday or Tuesday while the new songs go into rotation.

387
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:40,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

388
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:42,161
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

389
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, welcome to our first show of 2008.

390
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:11,912
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take a peek during the break and see if there's anything we can report on in Part B. But meanwhile, I believe there's some rumors about what might be being talked about tonight, yes?

391
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:17,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, one of the rumors is that there's going to be yet another Xbox 360 SKU coming out.

392
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:25,042
[SPEAKER_01]: However, from what I remember, the SKU is actually supposed to be from another company, like Toshiba or something like that.

393
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:30,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, it's being dubbed the Xbox 360 Ultimate.

394
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually funny because this was reported in Stuff Magazine.

395
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:52,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be hitting stores apparently by this autumn and will feature 1080p HDMI output, built-in Wi-Fi, high-def audio output, cooler 65nm hardware architecture, and a near-silent fan.

396
00:25:53,069 --> 00:26:01,831
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, it's going to have an IPTV service and a 320GB hard drive and a built-in HD DVD drive.

397
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all bullshit.

398
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised.

399
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me sounds like it's a bit much, I think.

400
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:11,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The system would be too expensive.

401
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:18,858
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, why would Stuff Magazine run something like that then if they didn't know that it was coming out?

402
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:19,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

403
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:32,949
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds stupid to me, but if it's not being dubbed like the Xbox something or other, if it's just Toshiba's HD DVD player that also plays Xbox 360 games, that kind of thing.

404
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly enough, that makes a little more sense to me.

405
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:04,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Steppin' Aside

406
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yes, I'm too rich to be doing this shit.

407
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:42,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony has revealed some of their plans.

408
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:47,513
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big announcements that's going to impact gamers is in regards to the Slim PSP.

409
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:51,094
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be getting Skype in late January.

410
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:55,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Skype is a program that listeners of our show, I hope, would know very well.

411
00:27:56,237 --> 00:28:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, we were one of the first internet programs anywhere years ago to actually have a Skype line.

412
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Users have been calling us since 2003 or 2004 on our Skype line.

413
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:10,603
[SPEAKER_02]: at Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

414
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:15,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And now folks are going to be able to call from their PSP when this new firmware is released at the end of January.

415
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:20,265
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only catch is it's only available on the PSP Slims.

416
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So far.

417
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:27,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, Loki, you say that through your controversial hack-and-crack method, you think that this could work on the PSP fatties.

418
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:28,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

419
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:30,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why it can't.

420
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:36,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, they have a lot of the firmware stuff that's locked in for the Slim PSP, but

421
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:38,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

422
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:58,769
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

423
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:03,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to say Skype out and Skype in will be a part of this as well.

424
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course Skype out and Skype in are the things that let you use basically Skype as a normal telephone.

425
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We use Skype in here on the show.

426
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you can call 1-888-GAME-OLR.

427
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use an 800 number forwarder that forwards to our Skype line.

428
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:17,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Very technical.

429
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:18,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But it works.

430
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:19,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It does cost extra though.

431
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:20,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it does.

432
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:21,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something that's free.

433
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know somebody that uses Skype as their home phone.

434
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:26,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And they love it.

435
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:34,570
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just another kind of cool thing for the PSP that's kind of breathing more life into it.

436
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:45,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people kind of wrote off the PSP when the games weren't so strong, but I think this kind of cements PSP as the handheld device.

437
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice how I don't call it a handheld gaming system.

438
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,656
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS is supreme, I think, in that category, but the PSP is one hell of a portable device.

439
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it does pictures, movies...

440
00:29:57,271 --> 00:30:00,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet Radio, now it does Skype, Web Surfing.

441
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:03,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is like a computer in your pocket now.

442
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,735
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome, the PSP that's turning into.

443
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:07,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my iPhone.

444
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has Castlevania, which is odd.

445
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:11,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But does your iPhone have Castlevania?

446
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:12,397
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but my DS does.

447
00:30:13,017 --> 00:30:13,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

448
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:17,119
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, that's all I have to say.

449
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:23,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd still prefer that if it was going to be initially a handheld gaming system, it remain a gaming system.

450
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,242
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need all that extra crap.

451
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:50,608
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will say this I mean I think to some extent I think that's what the N-Gage was trying to do too and remember how much shit the N-Gage got because I think at least PSP is still kind of like I don't know the way the PSP has done it they still have kind of focused on games first and everything else is secondary but I don't know they've just done it so much better than Nokia did the N-Gage was a piece of shit it really was I don't know I can't explain that one I think that

452
00:30:52,622 --> 00:31:02,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The N-Gage could have been better had they gone for, first of all, cartridge bases of those stupid little chip things.

453
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:06,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that could actually store enough media to make it look worth playing.

454
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing stuff on that and it was just awful.

455
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the PSP doesn't... It put a lot of focus into the gaming aspect.

456
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,339
[SPEAKER_03]: It was initially meant to be a gaming system.

457
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:21,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And the

458
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

459
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,366
[SPEAKER_03]: How about something better?

460
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:49,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say one thing real quick before we get back into the news because Tigerclaw is mentioning something.

461
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:53,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized OLR is competing against American Gladiators tonight.

462
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:55,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

463
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:58,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Because tonight is the return of American Gladiators on NBC.

464
00:31:58,275 --> 00:31:58,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

465
00:31:58,615 --> 00:31:59,996
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell am I doing here?

466
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:01,237
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all I have to say.

467
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:07,061
[SPEAKER_01]: TiVo, VCR, DVR, whatever.

468
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:08,502
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you got it.

469
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:13,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone actually remember the old American Gladiators?

470
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:14,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah, I do.

471
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:15,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I talk?

472
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:16,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

473
00:32:44,318 --> 00:33:10,992
[SPEAKER_03]: for anyone who remembers Target Terror it's coming out on the Wii as a Zapper game and it looks awful but it looks great at the same time because it was one of those full motion capture type of games and I love Revolution X so I'm actually sort of thinking about getting this just for the cheeseball factor I love cheeseball games

474
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's going to be kind of fun.

475
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:23,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have machine guns and grenade launchers and orbital space lasers and minigames and all kinds of fun stuff.

476
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like fun.

477
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

478
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, weren't you saying something before the show, though, that they're going to charge the full retail price for this, $40 or something?

479
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:34,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's $40.

480
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:36,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crap tech.

481
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:36,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.

482
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:37,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth $40.

483
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:40,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it'll be in the bargain bin before too long.

484
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:41,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it time, man.

485
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:43,994
[SPEAKER_01]: If it sucks, they'll drop the price quick.

486
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:47,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we shall see.

487
00:33:48,356 --> 00:34:00,822
[SPEAKER_01]: In other fun news, if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine, or even if you don't, next month, the February issue, we'll have three exclusive Rock Band songs for download.

488
00:34:01,428 --> 00:34:02,349
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:28,777
[SPEAKER_01]: One of which is from Freeze Prop.

490
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:30,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Sprode.

491
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Super Sprode, but Sprode.

492
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:37,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang Camaro's Rock Rebellion and Count Zero's Shake.

493
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:40,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so we don't think the Sprode thing is a typo?

494
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't have a song called just Sprode unless it's something new.

495
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,272
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be something new or maybe a rock version of Super Sprode.

496
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that would make sense.

497
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a cover of their own song or something.

498
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,481
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember, Super Sprode was too rocky.

499
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:59,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Super Sprode is fucking rad, so I hope it is that song and some type of reincarnation.

500
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:00,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love that song.

501
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great song in Amplitude.

502
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:04,726
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely check it out.

503
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped subscribing to this magazine, but I'll pick one up.

504
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to buy one so I don't have to?

505
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:10,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

506
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:10,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet!

507
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:15,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that whole DVD sharing thing he just said, I was just making sure about that.

508
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, speaking of Rock Band, EA has not ruled out that Rock Band will be coming out on the Wii.

509
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:26,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You might notice that the Wii is that one system that's sorely missing Rock Band right now.

510
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have Guitar Hero 3, but no Rock Band.

511
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix themselves has said that the Wii has, quote, an enormous potential for music games.

512
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:45,005
[SPEAKER_02]: GamePro actually went out and got a quote from EA talking about that there's going to be Rock Band...

513
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,181
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

514
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:20,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

515
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad idea.

516
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:30,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, they're not saying no, they're just saying not now.

517
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:34,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they can also do all wired controllers because they have USB ports on there.

518
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:35,294
[SPEAKER_02]: No, why not?

519
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:36,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

520
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:37,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

521
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, the Wii fans are rock bandless.

522
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

523
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:41,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

524
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:49,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a Guitar Hero fan, though, actually put together a Kill Bill guitar.

525
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty cool.

526
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a link to the picture up in the chat room.

527
00:36:56,323 --> 00:37:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was basically inspired by, I guess, an Evil Dead guitar that someone did, too.

528
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:04,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

529
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really not all that hard, because all you need to... Like, for example...

530
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:16,503
[SPEAKER_03]: A dance friend, Will, got a Sex Pistols one for a penny.

531
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:22,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find the faceplates, or you can make them yourself because they're not that difficult.

532
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And just if you've got any artistic ability, customize it yourself.

533
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:33,091
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll put a picture of the image in the chat, or the link in chat.

534
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:34,548
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

535
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the biggest money makers for Rock Band.

536
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, yeah.

537
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:59,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that is a good point.

538
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:01,559
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii doesn't really support anything like that so far.

539
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, aren't they supposed to be getting Guitar Hero 3 content next year?

540
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:11,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whenever they figure out how to actually do it.

541
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now's the time to figure that out.

542
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:15,221
[SPEAKER_02]: That's big money they're missing out on right there.

543
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll say.

544
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:18,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways...

545
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:23,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other stuff you can look forward to at least this week coming out in the United States.

546
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,170
[SPEAKER_01]: A few releases.

547
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:32,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's some decent stuff coming out, including, let's see, starting things off, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom.

548
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:38,612
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be coming out on the 360, although it looks like this time they kind of went more of the Dynasty Warriors route.

549
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:43,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is coming to the Wii and PlayStation 2.

550
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:48,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're into that hoverboard racing stuff, you can play that.

551
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:52,358
[SPEAKER_01]: NFL Tour on the PlayStation 3 and 360.

552
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:57,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Good $40 football game, kind of arcade style.

553
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:02,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law on PlayStation 2, Wii, and the PSP.

554
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:07,182
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to be a fan of the show and like the Phoenix Wright games, you'll definitely like that one.

555
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackass the Game on DS.

556
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:13,483
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's anything like the PSP version, you'll definitely like that one.

557
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:16,684
[SPEAKER_01]: World Championship Paintball for the PlayStation 2.

558
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:20,028
[SPEAKER_01]: That is crap.

559
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:22,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea Monster is a prehistoric adventure on the DS.

560
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:23,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Also crap.

561
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:29,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the weirdest things to come out in a while and doesn't look very good either.

562
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:33,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance Dance Revolution Disney Channel Edition on PlayStation 2.

563
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:35,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

564
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that's it for this week.

565
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you want to dance to high school musical songs, Loki.

566
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:44,386
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

567
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:44,846
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

568
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:46,309
[SPEAKER_01]: We know who does.

569
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:47,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

570
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:54,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, coming out over in Japan, finally taking a break from not having any games come out because of the holidays, to getting some stuff come out.

571
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I should say, if you're an Xbox 360 fan, price reductions.

572
00:39:58,704 --> 00:39:59,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's never a bad thing.

573
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:06,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Some price reductions for Armored Core 4 and Table Tennis take place this week, as well as the release of the Xbox 360 Messenger Kit.

574
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We got that here a little while ago with the integrated MSN Messenger.

575
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it's been doing folks a lot of good this week with Xbox Live going up and down.

576
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:20,855
[SPEAKER_02]: However, assuming that those problems are being fixed very soon, the Messenger Kit will be doing Japanese MSN fans a lot of good.

577
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Also getting a price reduction on the PlayStation 3, Armored Core 4's port on PlayStation 3.

578
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:46,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, a new game from Marvelous Entertainment called Kaiti Kyoshi Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle Wii, which looks to be some type of anime-based game that I think is some type of fighter.

579
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of like a 3D fighter.

580
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an anime called Hitman?

581
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably what it is.

582
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:53,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

583
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

584
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, there you have it.

585
00:40:57,183 --> 00:41:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out on some other systems, the Nintendo DS is getting a game called Chishikio Series Train Master, which is another train sim game.

586
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:11,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently those train sim games are very popular overseas.

587
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:18,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a train sim game very popular over here since Railroad Tycoon or A-Train, but I guess they're still popular over there.

588
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:23,005
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the big Denja Dago series that was out for a long time too.

589
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why they're not as popular here.

590
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:27,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Even had a big controller for it too.

591
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:31,048
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad used to buy those games all the time back when we had a Commodore 64.

592
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:34,569
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought like every train because he was a conductor before he retired.

593
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:35,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he did.

594
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:36,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So he loved that stuff.

595
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was interesting.

596
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's really it for Japanese releases this week.

597
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

598
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,111
[SPEAKER_02]: What about UK releases?

599
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um... Loki, wait your turn.

600
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:49,629
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really not a whole lot to talk about.

601
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:56,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The 9th has Omega 5 on Xbox Live Arcade, Sam & Max 202, Moai Better Blues.

602
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:57,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool name.

603
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:00,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's coming out on the 10th.

604
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:03,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 11th is PDC World Darts Championship 2008.

605
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:06,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting, but not really.

606
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:10,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam & Max is going to be awesome.

607
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Season 2.

608
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:14,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, anyways.

609
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:20,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as you mentioned, Omega 5 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week.

610
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Hudson's kind of side-scroller shooter game.

611
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:25,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks a little bit like R-Type or something like that.

612
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:27,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely gonna be awesome.

613
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:30,834
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only gonna cost you 800 Microsoft points.

614
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:32,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um...

615
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:36,190
[SPEAKER_01]: No word if there's going to be anything else coming out this week as well.

616
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:40,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I know last week there was only one item, just Mel Slug 3.

617
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess maybe this is the only release this week as well.

618
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:46,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft, I want Rez.

619
00:42:46,676 --> 00:42:47,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Really badly.

620
00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:48,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

621
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:49,898
I want Rez.

622
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Rez!

623
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:52,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Rez!

624
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,341
[SPEAKER_02]: No Rez for you!

625
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:56,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Now!

626
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,793
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so maybe I won't get Rez, but there will be some other games on the Virtual Console in the United States of America.

627
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:11,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday's games have been leaked, it appears, the day before, and a real good one coming for the Nintendo this week.

628
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:14,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Tropics is coming to Virtual Console.

629
00:43:14,499 --> 00:43:15,640
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a pretty rad game.

630
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the last...

631
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Really big RPGs.

632
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:27,308
[SPEAKER_02]: No word yet, though, if buying it on the Virtual Console will give you that letter that you have to dip in the water in order to get the secret code.

633
00:43:27,628 --> 00:43:31,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, the thought just occurred to me, a lot of people are going to be screwed when they try to play that game on Virtual Console.

634
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:35,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there'll be some sort of compensation made for it.

635
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:41,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, maybe they'll have to go on Nintendo's site and do some sort of bizarro thing.

636
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:44,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it'll be in the digital manual that comes with the game.

637
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:45,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

638
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:47,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the digital manual in the game will have it.

639
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there is a scene in this game where you'll need this code.

640
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,722
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's going to be tons of people that don't even think to look there, I bet.

641
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:54,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

642
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:55,542
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be interesting.

643
00:43:55,562 --> 00:43:57,403
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be on GameFAQs.

644
00:43:57,483 --> 00:44:00,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the game used, and I was like, I don't know what the fucking code is.

645
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:04,585
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to dip the manual in the water to reveal the code.

646
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:05,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the manual.

647
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:08,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't the code 747, and why do I remember that?

648
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:10,227
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 747, because I remember it was a plane.

649
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like a plane, yeah.

650
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:15,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you know you've played too many games when.

651
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:17,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need no stinking letter!

652
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:29,655
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton of games that have those little weird quirks built in, like the X-Men game where you had to press reset to reset the machine or something.

653
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:30,576
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

654
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:31,256
[SPEAKER_03]: On Genesis.

655
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So weird.

656
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:40,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing will ever be as cool, though, in regards to quirky fucking things in games as Metal Gear Solid.

657
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Psycho Mantis who read your memory card?

658
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:43,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

659
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see you're a Castlevania fan.

660
00:44:45,821 --> 00:44:51,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had Xenogears on there, which wasn't released at the time.

661
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:52,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Creepy, creepy.

662
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it also, though, in Final Fantasy VII, had...

663
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that on the Neo Geo CD.

664
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good one.

665
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: KOF 94 was, if I do remember, the first one that was out in the series.

666
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played tons and tons and tons of that game because they had it at the arcade at my college where I learned the joy of playing with Yuri's butt attack.

667
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:46,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, I might have to check it out.

668
00:45:46,775 --> 00:45:49,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have no Neo Geo games on Virtual Console yet.

669
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

670
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:51,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sucks.

671
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:52,677
[SPEAKER_02]: My thing is almost filled up.

672
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sad part.

673
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,259
[SPEAKER_02]: My screen is almost, like, you know how you can only go to like four screens on the Wii?

674
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously only have room for a handful of games left.

675
00:45:59,539 --> 00:45:59,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

676
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have so many of those stupid Virtual Console games I keep paying money for.

677
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

678
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:05,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm?

679
00:46:05,905 --> 00:46:06,145
[SPEAKER_03]: NeoGeoCD

680
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you what we're thinking.

681
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:37,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think aloud here.

682
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Operator 11, unfortunately, it seems like it's running on autopilot right now.

683
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:47,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the heck's going on with them, but none of the shows are saving or whatever, which is part of the reason we're not using them.

684
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:52,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking about defecting to another service called Ustream TV, which has no limits on their shows.

685
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:57,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to make sure it's kosher for us to broadcast video game images, but I don't know why it wouldn't be.

686
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes there's copyright issues that come into play with that.

687
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:01,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually as long as we're...

688
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,903
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're doing any type of commentary with it or whatever, it's fair use, but I don't know.

689
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

690
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:12,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, back to the Virtual Console story.

691
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:14,065
[SPEAKER_02]: StarTropics, King of Fighters 94.

692
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: No third game mentioned yet.

693
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:21,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll find out tomorrow, but remember, not every week have they always done three games, so it is possible it's just a two-game week.

694
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So we shall see.

695
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:26,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like they're having something similar to that in the UK.

696
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:34,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The big release right now is Harvest Moon coming out on Virtual Console.

697
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do recall seeing, although I can't find the link on here now, but I did also recall seeing Donkey Kong Country 3.

698
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:47,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently the link to it is gone from where I read it.

699
00:47:48,444 --> 00:47:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost in Blue Game

700
00:48:12,844 --> 00:48:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: When did the second one ever come out?

701
00:48:14,365 --> 00:48:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I remember they were making one.

702
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I actually played it for a few seconds at the show.

703
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:21,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember when it came out.

704
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like October-ish.

705
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that game like really a cult hit or something?

706
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

707
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:25,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

708
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

709
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:28,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not like the first game either.

710
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:28,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

711
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:29,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Strange.

712
00:48:29,632 --> 00:48:29,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

713
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:39,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so apparently Microsoft is a little bit sorry for the fact that Xbox Live has been having issues this last few weeks here.

714
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:48,771
[SPEAKER_01]: and to apologize for that they're going to be offering all Xbox Live members around the world one free Xbox Live arcade game.

715
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:53,031
[SPEAKER_01]: No word on which game it is or if we're going to get a choice or what.

716
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it's not something I already own.

717
00:48:56,912 --> 00:49:05,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard rumblings and you can take this as like a friend of a friend thing which holds little to no weight but from what I hear it's a game that nobody has yet.

718
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:08,674
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the future releases is going to be free in light of this.

719
00:49:09,998 --> 00:49:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not something like Yaris.

720
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:17,300
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind instantly went to, great, we're going to get the Doritos game for free.

721
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:21,122
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's something people actually want, apparently.

722
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:23,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'd be sad.

723
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:27,664
[SPEAKER_02]: When Carcassonne was free for everybody, most people were happy about that because hardly anyone bought it.

724
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:31,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it previously, so I didn't get anything out of that deal.

725
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:35,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope it's something new, like, you know, Rez.

726
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:37,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaris 2 Yaris 2 Anyhow

727
00:49:58,585 --> 00:49:59,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.

728
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:00,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but I do want to say this.

729
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:01,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take the opportunity to say this.

730
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:10,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you saw it on our forums, but somebody actually made a YouTube of Yaris set to the music of Dragon Force as inspired by our show.

731
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:16,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that might come up in the mailbag later, so I won't blow all the details on that just yet on how you can access that.

732
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw that on our forums.

733
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.

734
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, I will mention this about the Xbox Live outages.

735
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:26,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are pissed about this.

736
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:29,325
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so pissed they're filing a lawsuit.

737
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:29,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

738
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:36,707
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's a problem that a major company is having, leave it to the parasites to jump on and file a class action lawsuit.

739
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:44,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Three folks out of Texas have filed a class action lawsuit against the company on what they call breach of contract.

740
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:49,490
[SPEAKER_02]: The lawsuit goes on to whine about, quote, many plaintiffs being kicked offline.

741
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:53,239
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.

742
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:14,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, to give them credit, I think has always been a company very good about apologizing when they fuck up.

743
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:17,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence, they're going to give out the free game.

744
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been very forthright in saying, we made a mistake, we're not happy about it.

745
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:26,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell if you read Major Nelson's blog or his Twitter, he is livid about what's going on.

746
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:28,975
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working overtime to try and fix it.

747
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:32,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they're sitting on their big duff not trying to do anything about it.

748
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of give them a little bit of credit and I forgive them.

749
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:35,640
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't

750
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't guarantee that they're always going to be up either.

751
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:45,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I sue them because they run maintenance on their server sometimes and it's during a time I want to play?

752
00:51:45,743 --> 00:51:46,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not really fair.

753
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,885
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just these fucking people are just trying to get money from whatever.

754
00:51:49,905 --> 00:51:50,805
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all Microsoft.

755
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got money to spend.

756
00:51:52,426 --> 00:51:53,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can get some of it.

757
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:59,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know the thing about a class action lawsuit is that it's supposed to represent all users, right?

758
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:02,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So allow me to say you do not represent me.

759
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:04,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not wish to participate in this lawsuit.

760
00:52:04,797 --> 00:52:09,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit if they didn't give me anything to compensate me for their live service being down.

761
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:09,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Big deal.

762
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: It's down for a couple weeks.

763
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,581
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

764
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,082
[SPEAKER_01]: If they really wanted to, they can give me like two weeks free or something like that.

765
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:15,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Big deal.

766
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:17,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have been fine with that.

767
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:41,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Xbox Live would not be opposed to doing something like that.

768
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, are they actually going to try to sue them for what?

769
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:47,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say if they cut out a whole month, that's like $5.

770
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:51,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, you're out $5.

771
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:53,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor baby.

772
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:03,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure in that user license agreement thingy that you have to... You know how every time you sign up for something, you have to read the user license agreement, and most people just click OK?

773
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not believe that somewhere in there is not some type of clause that says...

774
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:08,869
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

775
00:53:35,973 --> 00:53:39,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says in chat, Terms of Service covers it all.

776
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:41,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

777
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:46,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, so we'll see what happens with this class action lawsuit.

778
00:53:46,677 --> 00:53:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep you guys posted, that is, if anything actually comes of this, but we shall see.

779
00:53:54,200 --> 00:54:05,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for anyone who remembers the Tickle Me Elmo craze or how Beanie Babies went, we are having a repeat with a plushy weighted companion cube.

780
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

781
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:17,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

782
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:40,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an idiot if you buy Guitar Hero for $9,000.

783
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:44,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how much weed that whole family is going to be able to buy for $9,000?

784
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucka.

785
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:46,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really?

786
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:50,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you do realize that the guy could have been making it all up.

787
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:54,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you realize you paid $9,000 for something that's really easy to find?

788
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:55,525
[SPEAKER_01]: You idiot.

789
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:57,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a $5 bill.

790
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:57,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

791
00:54:57,646 --> 00:55:01,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it away from my unborn son because he smoked pot in the future.

792
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:02,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I want $9,000. $9,000.

793
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,074
[SPEAKER_03]: and on top of that... You know what's sad?

794
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:18,341
[SPEAKER_02]: If we signed some piece of OLR memorabilia, like if we took a ferret and signed it or something and tried to put it on eBay, we'd be lucky to get $1.99 for it.

795
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:21,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we should do something gimmicky like that.

796
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do something gimmicky?

797
00:55:22,844 --> 00:55:23,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do something gimmicky.

798
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:28,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what, I'm going to sign my weighted companion cube and we'll put that up on eBay.

799
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:29,089
[SPEAKER_01]: A paper one.

800
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:33,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we'll make a weighted... There's a paper weighted companion cube online.

801
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:33,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

802
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:42,391
[SPEAKER_02]: We will make a weighted companion cube out of paper and sign it and make up some story about how we stole it from a baby in the crib or something and see how much money we get from it.

803
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:43,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

804
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:43,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Be beautiful.

805
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:47,173
[SPEAKER_01]: We traded a dingo, a baby, for the weighted companion cube.

806
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,934
[SPEAKER_03]: The dingo ate my companion cube!

807
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a hungry dingo.

808
00:55:52,456 --> 00:55:53,336
[SPEAKER_02]: You bastard.

809
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal 2.

810
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:55,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The dingo ate my companion cube.

811
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So stupid, though.

812
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:57,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

813
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:57,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I see...

814
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:03,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted one fairly bad, and Dan was actually going to get me one for Christmas.

815
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:06,946
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take them to sell out?

816
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:07,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Four hours?

817
00:56:08,627 --> 00:56:10,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew Nami brings up an excellent point.

818
00:56:10,608 --> 00:56:13,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we have an orange bat somewhere still from back in the day?

819
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the vault.

820
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have to get that.

821
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:19,071
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have to pull that out of the vault.

822
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:20,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have a blank one, don't we?

823
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:21,412
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

824
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:22,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we did.

825
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do a new one.

826
00:56:24,202 --> 00:56:31,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to save the original orange bat, though, because it was the one that was signed at... What tournament was that?

827
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: March Madness.

828
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:33,329
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get a new one.

829
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:39,114
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get a new orange bat, sign it, beat something with it, and that'll be our story, and then we'll sell it.

830
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:43,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we put Portal in the search details on eBay, it'll sell.

831
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:44,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

832
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just write Portal on the bat.

833
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: and if it makes enough money, then we'll come visit you.

834
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,196
[SPEAKER_03]: If it makes enough money.

835
00:56:59,097 --> 00:57:05,780
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have one with a reserve up there that's like, buy an Orange Sounds Radio visit.

836
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you have to pay for us to come out and feed us.

837
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

838
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:12,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we'd be lucky to get $1.99.

839
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:13,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on.

840
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:21,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, Ubisoft has announced Far Cry 2 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

841
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:29,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of course, the new Far Cry game, not being in the tropics, it's actually gonna be in the African savannah.

842
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:30,596
Africa!

843
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:36,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you will be able to, you know, destroy stuff, and it'll be awesome.

844
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:38,338
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I don't know.

845
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:39,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to play it.

846
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:40,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um...

847
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:46,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it'll come out around the same time as the PC version, which is due out this spring.

848
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,652
[SPEAKER_01]: But no word, though, if that's actually going to happen yet.

849
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:53,915
[SPEAKER_01]: They just said it's going to ship sometime in Ubisoft's 08-09 fiscal year.

850
00:57:53,955 --> 00:57:55,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be any time between now and forever.

851
00:57:57,178 --> 00:58:01,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chatroom, seriously, sorry, not to discount your story, but our chatroom, fucking geniuses.

852
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:02,042
[SPEAKER_02]: They're brilliant.

853
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here it is.

854
00:58:03,142 --> 00:58:09,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They say we're going to sell this as the Orange Companion Bat, and we're going to beat Jamie's copy of Imagine Babies with it.

855
00:58:11,024 --> 00:58:12,665
[SPEAKER_02]: and now it's the beaten companion bat.

856
00:58:13,165 --> 00:58:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

857
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:14,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room, winner.

858
00:58:15,386 --> 00:58:15,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll happen.

859
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:16,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll happen.

860
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:22,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, I love our chat room.

861
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:29,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of people who are infinitely awesome, that would be Hideo Kojima.

862
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha, how's that?

863
00:58:31,852 --> 00:58:32,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice transition.

864
00:58:32,693 --> 00:58:34,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm awesome tonight.

865
00:58:34,073 --> 00:58:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody I would let beat me with an orange bat.

866
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I would let him beat me with an orange bat.

867
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was basically quoted saying that he thinks that there should be more realistic violence in a game so that you can see the consequences of your actions.

868
00:58:53,398 --> 00:59:22,664
[SPEAKER_03]: he's quoted saying I don't think there are many games that tackle violence head on when you hit someone or inflict pain faces get disfigured for example and I want to make games that show that sort of thing if you don't see the pain you can't understand what you've done and you'll pass through battles without taking responsibility for your actions I don't want to ignore that I want players to think even if it's just a little about what violence and war are no pain no game

869
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:24,157
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

870
00:59:41,062 --> 00:59:42,963
[SPEAKER_03]: In Soviet Russia, games shoot you!

871
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:44,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very good idea.

872
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:13,345
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so dumb.

873
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:14,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's horrible.

874
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:17,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, the show's free, folks.

875
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you believe the Writer's Guild's on strike right now?

876
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:25,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob's on the cutting edge of comedy right now.

877
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:27,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up and read the next story.

878
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:36,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps Yakko Smirnoff is not really the... Anyways.

879
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,943
[SPEAKER_01]: That may not be your kind of thing.

880
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:48,393
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully this is, and I hope to God that they don't fuck this up, because they could easily fuck this up.

881
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:59,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, though, there is a placeholder for Iron Chef on the Wii, according to GameStop, and it's supposedly coming out in June sometime.

882
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:04,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope it's not Iron Chef America, because that show fucking sucks.

883
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:08,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell no, it has to be Cheeseball Original Iron Chef.

884
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:10,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that would be awesome.

885
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:12,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs to have Chairman Kaga.

886
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:15,988
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this game needs to have us one of the Iron Chefs, Cooking Mama.

887
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:18,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be winning awesome.

888
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:19,011
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be.

889
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Mama will have to fix your pathetic performance.

890
01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:24,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great.

891
01:01:25,138 --> 01:01:26,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Iron Chef meets Cooking Mama.

892
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's destined to happen.

893
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:30,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

894
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:34,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this was destined to happen at some point too.

895
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:41,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just surprised it took so long for some website to run a story with the headline, Kid Weez on a Wii.

896
01:01:43,635 --> 01:01:46,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You, sir, are on the cutting edge of comedy.

897
01:01:46,977 --> 01:01:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

898
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of being on the cutting edge of comedy.

899
01:01:50,194 --> 01:01:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

900
01:02:14,412 --> 01:02:19,496
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to walk through glass and two miles in the snow and the river just to get to school.

901
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And molten hot lava.

902
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:21,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

903
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:29,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got this Wii and when the four-year-old and the six-year-old started fighting over it, did the kid cry?

904
01:02:30,023 --> 01:02:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

905
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:31,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he go to his room and pout?

906
01:02:31,844 --> 01:02:32,164
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

907
01:02:32,805 --> 01:02:33,485
[SPEAKER_02]: What did he do?

908
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:34,926
[SPEAKER_02]: He peed on it.

909
01:02:35,226 --> 01:02:36,687
[SPEAKER_03]: He broke out his Wii and weed on the Wii.

910
01:02:36,707 --> 01:02:37,188
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

911
01:02:37,228 --> 01:02:41,931
[SPEAKER_02]: He weed on the Wii and reporters everywhere rejoiced that they can finally use that in a headline.

912
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just surprised it took so damn long, honestly.

913
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:49,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, his kids are fucking misbehaved anyways if they're pissing on stuff in their house.

914
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:57,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And let alone geniuses that are pissing on stuff that's connected to the wall with electricity running through it.

915
01:02:57,479 --> 01:03:00,001
[SPEAKER_03]: He's four years old, therefore not very smart.

916
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:02,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I only wish that he had gotten electrocuted.

917
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you need to teach kid a lesson.

918
01:03:05,304 --> 01:03:06,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Rub his nose in it.

919
01:03:06,085 --> 01:03:09,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Kid wheeze on wee, wee kills kid.

920
01:03:10,188 --> 01:03:10,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

921
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:11,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bad.

922
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:12,089
[SPEAKER_02]: He's four!

923
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:12,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Four!

924
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:13,410
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.

925
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:14,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

926
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:15,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.

927
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:17,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Survival of the fittest.

928
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:18,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And smartest.

929
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:24,780
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was four, I knew it was not okay to piss on the electric fence, okay?

930
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:29,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when I was four, I was told not to eat the yellow snow.

931
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:33,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of us, you know... It doesn't snow here, Rob.

932
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It does up the hill a little bit, where we would sometimes travel to.

933
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fine.

934
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow...

935
01:03:41,673 --> 01:03:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: SonOfDad in chat says, did they both pee on the Wii?

936
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cross the streams.

937
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

938
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,944
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura and Linus, what game have you selected as the Classic Game of the Week this week?

939
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:32,883
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game of the week is Gunstar Heroes, which was a release on the Sega Genesis and is also by one of my favorite game developing companies ever, Treasure.

940
01:04:33,864 --> 01:04:34,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Treasure is awesome.

941
01:04:34,964 --> 01:04:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Treasure gave us Silhouette Mirage and Killing the Twist and Mischief Makers and all kinds of fun games too.

942
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:51,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gunstar Heroes is one of the top ones, and it's actually, I think, my husband's favorite game.

943
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:57,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a side-scrolling shooter that has, like, a bajillion boss fights in it, oh my god.

944
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you play for five seconds, boss fight!

945
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Five more seconds, boss fight.

946
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:07,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, your life is actually calculated...

947
01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:13,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Numerically so that you have to take multiple hits, but when you die, you die.

948
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:17,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You continue or start at that point.

949
01:05:17,316 --> 01:05:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You also get customizable weapons.

950
01:05:19,537 --> 01:05:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You start off with... You can combine two of the four different weapons to make different unique weapons.

951
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:34,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually spawns a sequel, which was Gunstar Super Heroes.

952
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

953
01:05:36,681 --> 01:05:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid puns.

954
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We have flies in the building again.

955
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, while the storms are going on, the flies are like, ooh, it's warm in the studio.

956
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:53,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gunstar Superheroes came out on Game Boy Advance, which was a pretty cool, really hand-made thing.

957
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:54,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

958
01:05:56,494 --> 01:06:09,665
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple years ago, Sega put out a Sega Ages collection that was called The Treasure Box, which had Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, and Alien Soldier in the collection.

959
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:13,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cool game, and I think one of Treasure's best games.

960
01:06:14,215 --> 01:06:21,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And for everyone always bitching that DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week is too obscure and hard to find, here's one that you can download on the Wii Virtual Console.

961
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

962
01:06:21,997 --> 01:06:22,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easily.

963
01:06:22,638 --> 01:06:27,299
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when we were playing yesterday on Virtual Console.

964
01:06:27,479 --> 01:06:29,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, hey, that sounds familiar.

965
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan was like, it's because it's Gunstar Heroes.

966
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

967
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, yeah.

968
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was playing the hell out of that.

969
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:39,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gunstar Heroes is like one of the best games ever.

970
01:06:40,183 --> 01:06:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

971
01:06:40,423 --> 01:06:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

972
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Classic Game of the Week at Gunstar Heroes.

973
01:06:43,344 --> 01:06:44,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And the treasure of

974
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: by Treasure.

975
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:50,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure at some point before this segment is retired, every Treasure game will have come up at one point.

976
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:52,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not.

977
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:53,560
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few I'm not too big on.

978
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:54,021
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

979
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:54,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about.

980
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:55,882
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

981
01:06:55,942 --> 01:07:03,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's it for Part A. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break, but we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.

982
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

983
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
