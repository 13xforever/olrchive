With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Lowkey

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, January 27th, 2008, Fox News ruffles the feathers of the gaming community,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sega Master System games are poised to make a comeback, and is the Gizmondo about to be revived?

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'm here with you every week, and also here with you every week, usually.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Usually she's punctual. It's the one and only...

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here early, Rob.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
DarkSakura, she was actually here very early tonight.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I wasn't very early, but I was on time.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She was very punctual. She was quite punctual.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She gets an A for her attendance tonight.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And I brought specials.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You did. You brought specials.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we'll go ahead and introduce specials.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She's very special to us, actually, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's one of our official Orange Lounge Radio lesbians.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Give it up for Chris.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello, how are you?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am fine. How are you doing, Chris?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm okay.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've had coffee with lots of sugar, and before that we had frozen yogurt with lots of sugar.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I'm getting ready to blow.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're happy!

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, if I'm not mistaken, this may very well be your last appearance on Orange Lounge Radio for a little while.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, not like ever, ever, but for a little while, right?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to desperately, desperately try.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But to come back here, because I've been in, for those of you who do not know,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been going back and forth from LA to my home in the South Bay, Los Gatos,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
because my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I've been kind of being their chauffeur to whatever it is they need and stuff like that.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I've kind of been their little slave, which I don't mind.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But sorry to hear about the family circumstance. It's rough, I know.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's hard, but you know what, people are old, and that kind of stuff happens.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I've been going back and forth, and I'm also moving to Madison, Wisconsin in March,

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
if all goes according to plan for school, and I have a girlfriend there, so pluses.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it's got to be someone very special to get you to move from sunny, warm, wonderful California to,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
oh my fucking lord, it's cold, Wisconsin.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no, the accent is kind of like this, you know.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Awesome.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, you've got to get yourself one of those. That's all feel nice.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, you kids have fun. I know you guys are going to have a lot of fun together, living together and stuff.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But I'm going to be trying to come back more and more.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You better.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because I actually, we got a new addition to the family.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh. Oh, really?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My dad's girlfriend gave birth to a little girl.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Aw.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On the 17th.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And you're going to visit your little sister once in a while.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All right.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So she's adorable and crying and driving her mother up the wall.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, on a more, on a...

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That takes a whole lot, doesn't it?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh-huh.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Going back to games and gaming type like conventions for a little bit,

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
are you going to be going to the Chicago convention this year, Ayson?

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am. I'm going to Ayson.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You are.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You know, actually, some of our listeners are really trying to get us to go, and I'm going to try to make it happen.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So...

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Good.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, I definitely will come.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, I'll have an apartment, so you guys are willing to sit.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We'll have a pillow fight. It'll be fun.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, boy.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, for those...

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There you go, the official OLR battle royale pillow fight.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's what we need to do.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I was actually going to try and get a press pass to see if I can do some interviews for you guys.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I had a really cool idea, which I want to discuss with you later.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But for those of you who are going to Ayson, I will be there.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll be at the art table with my girlfriend, Megan, and a bunch of other really awesome artists that are going to show up.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Awesome.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, so look for me.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, I'll have blue hair and stuff.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm very easy to spot.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We haven't introduced the one and only...

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me switch mics for you so he has his normal back.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The one and only tech master, Loki.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hi.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How you doing, Loki?

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I finished the sandwich.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sorry I ignored you for a little bit there, but, you know, lesbians cater a little more to our demographic than you do.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I know.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm just kidding.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How...

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where would we be without Loki?

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Loki's a very important part of this show.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You having a good week, Loki?

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I had an okay week.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
All right.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go ahead and move on just a little bit.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But it's tradition to let the ladies go first.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It involved some cooking mama.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It involved a lot of burnout because I had to watch Dan play it and crash a bunch of stuff.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And it involved a whole crap ton of Ragnarok Online.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And I found another game that I'm thinking about checking out, thanks to Heather.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's that?

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Perfect World.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Free play, free download, and according to her, it takes everything...

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, and this is her perspective.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Took everything she hated about World of Warcraft and everything she hated about Guild Wars

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,000
and removed them and combined the best parts.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Interesting.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you have any examples?

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like, what types of things?

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or...

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She was really drunk.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
Well, you'll know more...

125
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,920
You'll know more about it when you're able to get in there.

126
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
It was really nice.

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,200
On top of that, certain wear classes get, like, flying pets.

128
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,760
They look like gigantic manta rays.

129
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
And you get your...

130
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,280
You can get the nether rays in World of Warcraft, to be fair.

131
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
And you get your mounts at level 40.

132
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
That's not bad.

133
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
What was it called again?

134
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Perfect World.

135
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Perfect World.

136
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
It's a Malaysian MMO.

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
But it's free.

138
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Completely free.

139
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Download.

140
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Free everything.

141
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,600
In this world, the Erwin family is writhing because of the thought of flying rays.

142
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
You're horrible.

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Actually, that also kind of brings me back to, was it, if you're living in Las Vegas...

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,760
We can't stop here.

145
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,760
This is backcountry.

146
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,720
DarkSakura, anything else you'd like to share about your gaming week?

147
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,120
It wasn't a game, but we watched Torchwood, and it was hot.

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
I found some other friends of mine.

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I would have never guessed.

150
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,600
They were talking to me, and they're like, Rob, you have to watch Torchwood.

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,040
It's the hottest show on TV.

152
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,160
You realize that this is a Doctor Who spin-off, right?

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
No, I do.

154
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
That's what I said.

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
I was like, you know it's a Doctor Who spin-off, right?

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,640
I said, one of my friend girls is obsessed with this series.

157
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
And they're like, oh yeah.

158
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
We like Doctor Who, too.

159
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
I was like, oh, cool.

160
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,920
If you take Torchwood and rearrange it, it spells Doctor Who.

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,720
Before we get to some more gaming weeks, I'm assuming you're all finished.

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Yes?

163
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
All done?

164
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Yes.

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,000
I just want to read some comments from the chat.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Africa.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Chat.orangemunchradio.com.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's see.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What was this?

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
Oh, Tiger Claw asks, Skye, next week is the Super Bowl.

172
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,080
Will there be a show by then?

173
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Damn right there's going to be a show during the Super Bowl.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,960
I could care less about the Super Bowl, so absolutely we'll be doing a show, because

175
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
you know what?

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,460
I think some folks out there would like to have some alternative programming to the Super

177
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
Bowl.

178
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
So you know what?

179
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,360
We have the Puppy Bowl.

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,520
Yes, we do have the Puppy Bowl, and don't they have the Kitty Bowl usually, too?

181
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,640
They're doing it, and they're doing a $25 sushi buffet at the place on that day, and

182
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
I'm thinking about going.

183
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Nice.

184
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Nice.

185
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Let's see.

186
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
What else?

187
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Other comments from chat.

188
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Let's see.

189
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Tiger Claw just heard that Black Wolf is going to do a show on Saturday next week to the

190
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Super Bowl.

191
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Well, that's Black Wolf.

192
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
That's Bobby's project.

193
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
He likes sports, though, see?

194
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Yeah, Bobby can watch it.

195
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Just like my roommate.

196
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm sure my roommate's going to have some guys over here watching the Super Bowl.

197
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,600
We'll be out here doing our nerdy show.

198
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
All right.

199
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Let's get back to games.

200
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,120
Loki, how was your gaming week?

201
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,360
My gaming week was pretty much just Burnout Paradise.

202
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
I played countless hours of it.

203
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,320
Actually, it's not countless because I took a look at my stats there, and I actually have

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,480
ten and a half hours put into it, but it's awesome.

205
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,080
You keep finding new things in there, and actually, I found quite a bit of the hidden

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
stuff.

207
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,880
I have almost all the jumps done, and about half the billboards and half the smashes,

208
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,760
and I'm working to get my Class A license, and haven't played online yet, because the

209
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,880
servers were giving me crap earlier this week, so I just kind of avoided them, but I may

210
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,440
try some online stuff a little later.

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
It's fun, though.

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Are you going to play me online?

213
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,320
Because I got my copy, so you'll kill me, but that's all right.

214
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
No, it'll be fun.

215
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,960
There's a lot of stuff you can do, like co-op, challenges and stuff, so that might be fun.

216
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,760
And then I got a Vectrex.

217
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,440
That's right, you won the Vectrex that you were talking about last week, huh?

218
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes.

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
How did that go?

220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,680
It went okay.

221
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,680
I have it on my desk now, and people are like, oh my god, I remember that!

222
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,520
And to be honest, it's just kind of a desk piece, you know, I don't really play much

223
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,760
on it.

224
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,560
I did try some of the games that came with it, Star Trek, the game.

225
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,960
I understand it about as much as I understood it before, which is not very much.

226
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
I don't like that game at all.

227
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,480
I did play Frenzy, though, I think it's called Frenzy, no, Berserk, I'm sorry.

228
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Same game, though.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
But that was pretty fun.

230
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,680
And then there was this game, Hyperchase, it might not have been Hyperchase, but it

231
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,280
was some sort of racing game, and that was kind of fun.

232
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,760
And then they had, of course, the one that's built into it, which is Space Minds, and it

233
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,840
was pretty cool.

234
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,360
But the only thing is, originally I had planned on leaving it on all day long, just to leave

235
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,940
it at my desk and people can come by and take a look at it and have some sort of demo loop,

236
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,840
but none of those games ever had a demo loop, and it also makes a really annoying buzzing

237
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,600
sound, so I was like, crap, I can't do that.

238
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,020
So I just turned it on when people wanted to take a look at it.

239
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,960
Also one of the controllers is broken, so I had to fix that.

240
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,120
But I can get a new controller for like ten bucks if I really want to.

241
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,440
They actually make quite a few games.

242
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,360
People are still making games for that system.

243
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Really?

244
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I had no idea.

245
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,220
All homebrew stuff, of course, but there's new carts coming out as of last year still,

246
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,200
so that's kind of neat, I guess.

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,040
A complete waste of money, but it's neat, nonetheless.

248
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,560
It's nice to have.

249
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,440
And then, let's see, what else did I get?

250
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,840
I haven't gotten it yet, but I have a copy of, God, I don't remember what it's called

251
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
now.

252
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,560
It's one of the bit generation titles, but that one's coming, hopefully I get to play

253
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
that this week.

254
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,160
And, what else, oh, I got, I'm actually planning on selling my Sega Saturns, because I found

255
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
an emulator that works perfectly on my computer.

256
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,600
I didn't even know you had a Sega Saturn.

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I have two.

258
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What?

259
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah.

260
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Wow.

261
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Well, I bought them at a garage sale, not a garage sale, at a Danayo's flea market,

262
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,160
because for some reason I wanted to play Panzer Dragoon Zui, because I thought, oh my God,

263
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,560
it was so awesome, I love that game, and I went back and played it, and I'm like, wow,

264
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,040
this wasn't very good at all, but I hate that.

265
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,000
I need to get a stall and some other stuff, but yeah, it's okay, but since now that I

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,640
have something that will actually play them on the PC, I don't really need them anymore,

267
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,480
so there's this local game shop, which I've been meaning to go to for weeks now, called

268
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Fairgame, and they carry all the vintage stuff, everything from the Vectrex up through Playstation

269
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,920
3 stuff, so hopefully they will be able to buy that.

270
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
And I do have games with it, I don't remember which games, so I have like two copies of

271
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,000
Madden 97 for some reason, like Bug 2, a Knight's Demo, and like some other stuff, Machine Head,

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,480
and I don't know, but I don't know, maybe I can put it on eBay though, cool cool.

273
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,200
And Saints Row, as usual, oh and, I think I meant, but not during the show, another

274
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,840
360 died, another one red ringed, apparently I had one that was starting to freeze up on

275
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,640
me, so I figured, okay, I'm going to cut it off the pass and just put a new heat sink

276
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
on it so that it will work better.

277
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,360
Well, put the new heat sink on it, didn't really fix anything, and so I tried pulling

278
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,760
the heat sink off again and maybe applying a little more thermal grease on spots that

279
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,200
may have missed some, and there was a big empty spot on there, so I went ahead and put

280
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,800
some thermal grease on there, reset it all back on there, and sure enough it three rings

281
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,520
on me, so I'm like, crap, and now I can't fix that one, so I'm going to hit it with

282
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,880
blunt objects until it works, or it won't work and who gives a crap because I still

283
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,600
have five, but I wanted six because my boss wants to play again and we had someone else

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,440
join us up when he was busy doing something else, so now someone's taken his place, but

285
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
he wants to play again.

286
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Alright.

287
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Oh well, soon you lose.

288
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,080
You always have busy gaming weeks, you can manage to play a lot.

289
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,600
I try, well we play at work, we play Saints Row, we play lots of Saints Row, lots of Saints

290
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,680
Row and lots of Burnout Paradise because that game, you know, it's really crazy, I thought

291
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,960
this week I would have been playing some No More Heroes, but I haven't gotten around

292
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
to that yet.

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Not yet, but soon.

294
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,020
No, I don't know if I'm going to get around to it anytime soon either because next week

295
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,080
is Smash Bros. coming out in Japan, so hopefully we'll have that soon.

296
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,560
Hopefully, you've got to give us your thoughts.

297
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
Alright, well let's keep them moving.

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's go over to Chris.

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
I don't know, Chris, if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week,

300
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
but let's hear it.

301
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,200
Well, aside from playing WoW, which I seem to be doing on a regular basis now.

302
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Addict.

303
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Shut up.

304
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
No, I have no room to talk whatsoever, seriously.

305
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Yeah, I heard you just got a 70, so.

306
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,720
I wouldn't say just got, but yeah.

307
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
Oh, okay, well you know, I've been kind of out of it, so.

308
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Gaming World of Warcraft.

309
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
I have a character up to level 24 now.

310
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Rock.

311
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,000
Hey, everybody start somewhere, but you're a Draenei, huh?

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,480
No, I'm actually, I don't have, I've just now started getting into, because Megan is

313
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,200
starting to play, and she's got all of her friends playing, and all of them have like

314
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
epics.

315
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Oh, wow.

316
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,640
And I'm learning now what they're learning, so I'm like hearing all this shit, like farm,

317
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,920
it's like, oh, I'm farming.

318
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,840
I didn't know for the longest time what that meant.

319
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,040
That's, oh, you got to start something.

320
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, I got to, you know, because I was just a casual player, I don't go like for hours

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,360
on end, you know, just playing, and I'm like, shut up, and I don't need to look more like

322
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,320
a noob than I already am, but it was, you know, so I just finally, you know, I'm starting

323
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,520
to get more into it, but I don't have like a main.

324
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
So wait, do you horde or alliance now?

325
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Both.

326
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Both?

327
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,240
I don't have a main, I just switch back and forth.

328
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
You need to make your main a horde, for the horde.

329
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,680
But Megzi's main is a gnome, so to play with her, shut up, to play with her, I made a gnome,

330
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,960
but the problem is that I'm like 10 levels lower than her, so playing with her in that

331
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,940
is kind of stupid, so I keep making more characters to try and play with her, because she keeps

332
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,680
making more characters, and it's just not working, but yeah, aside from that, I did

333
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,800
a lot of D&D stuff, so that makes me happy.

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Cool.

335
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah, I have to.

336
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
What's your school kind of gaming?

337
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,720
Yeah, I've got like maybe four or five friends in LA that have always, have like, oh, we

338
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,440
need to run a game, we need to run a game, and so I finally caved in and started making

339
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,400
an adventure, because I don't like all the new, the pre-made ones, so I've been working

340
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,840
on that a lot, and I freaking am annoyed at fourth edition that's coming out, but apparently

341
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,480
everybody does that with every edition that comes out, so no room to talk.

342
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
They're never going to make everybody happy, sadly.

343
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I don't like it.

344
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
All right.

345
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,040
And people need to make me happy, because I'm important.

346
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
You are important.

347
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Thank you.

348
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
All right.

349
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
We're going to move on, though, with gaming weeks now, if I can.

350
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
May I have permission?

351
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I hope so.

352
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes.

353
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
All right.

354
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
You may, Rob.

355
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
My gaming week, I actually took a little bit of a break from WoW.

356
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,200
I mean, I've been playing some, but I went back to another type of RPG that I just missed.

357
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,560
I haven't touched it in a while, and I decided to go back and play some Oblivion, because

358
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I love that game, because you can just run around and do nothing.

359
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,280
It's the Seinfeld of video games.

360
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,040
I mean, if you want to ignore the main plot and just do whatever you want, you can.

361
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
It's beautiful.

362
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440
I noticed you playing that this week.

363
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes.

364
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,280
And I decided last time I did a fighter type, so this time I just went all out mage, because

365
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm having a lot of fun summoning creatures to do my bidding and throwing fireballs at

366
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
people.

367
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
It's great.

368
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I don't know why I get attacked.

369
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm screwed.

370
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,120
But I create an army to go after people.

371
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
It's awesome.

372
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I love Oblivion.

373
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.

374
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,560
I never get past the towns, because I'm too busy violating the animals, punching the horses

375
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,600
so they get pissed off, and apparently the townsfolk don't look too kindly upon that,

376
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,680
but it's still fun.

377
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,080
Otherwise, not a whole lot.

378
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
There's pretty much just been that has taken up a lot of my gaming week.

379
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,880
I just had this random Oblivion splurge, but I have been playing Burnout Paradise a little

380
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
bit.

381
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,800
Not enough to give a full review on just yet, but I do notice it's kind of like Test Drive

382
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,520
and Burnout mixed together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

383
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
It's different.

384
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
It's a little different.

385
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I don't know.

386
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
I kind of like the structure of the old Burnout games.

387
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm not sure how I feel about this whole open world thing.

388
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,680
It's a little weird, but I'm giving it a shot.

389
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,280
I haven't taken it online either, which I hear is the best part, so we'll wait.

390
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,560
I do find it interesting, though, that it interacts with the camera to take your picture

391
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
and stuff.

392
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
That's kind of strange.

393
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,000
All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about housekeeping, and then we are going

394
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,520
to get into tonight's gaming news.

395
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Tonight in housekeeping, just a reminder, we are now broadcasting, simulcasting on

396
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,680
Justin TV, so a big hello to all the people who are watching us right now on Justin TV.

397
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Our Justin TV channel is www.Justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio, and the other cool thing

398
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,520
about Justin TV is that people can create their own highlights of the show.

399
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,720
So some people went in and made a highlight of, I don't know, me yelling no like Darth

400
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Vader last week.

401
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I don't know why that was so funny.

402
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
So I made that a highlight.

403
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Okay, here's the one that got me, though.

404
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,960
Somebody made a highlight of the pie eating during the break.

405
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,080
But Justin TV is interesting because you can kind of see us even when the mics aren't hot,

406
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,920
so it's kind of fun.

407
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
So there's that over at Justin TV.

408
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,800
Also, next week on the show, an Orange Lounge radio first, and actually what may be, I'm

409
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,640
not sure, I don't want to stake the claim to this, but what may be a video game podcast

410
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,320
first, actually.

411
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,240
Next week on the show, we are going to have a musical guest.

412
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,080
That's right, we're going to have a musical guest here in studio, and her name on YouTube

413
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,440
is Amyxia is her name, and she is fairly well known, at least 28,000 people and counting

414
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
know her, for her cover of Still Alive.

415
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:37,400
So we found out she was local to us, so we sent her an email and said, hey, this might

416
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,360
seem a little random, but do you want to come on our little podcast and sing the song for

417
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
us?

418
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
And she said, sure.

419
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,040
So she's going to be here next week doing her cover of Still Alive, live here in studio.

420
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,120
It's an OLR first musical guest, and we're very excited.

421
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,840
She's going to be a guinea pig for that whole thing.

422
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
So it's cool.

423
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
We're very excited.

424
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,960
All right, so she'll be here in studio next week, as will the rest of us here.

425
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,920
I don't know if we have any other guests scheduled for the next few weeks.

426
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
Are we going to get the chocolate rain guy at some point?

427
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,160
We're not going to get the chocolate rain guy.

428
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
She's the YouTube celeb.

429
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,680
We're going to get in the studio, and then we've got to look for people from other places.

430
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
So there you have it.

431
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,960
Yeah, one day I want Dragon Force here in studio.

432
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,720
That's the ultimate dream.

433
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I will.

434
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
You'll fly in from...

435
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah, that's right.

436
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
All right.

437
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,600
That would be so complete.

438
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
That's like a scene out of Wayne's World right there.

439
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
For real.

440
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
For real.

441
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
All right.

442
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,160
Anyhow, now why is the chat room saying they should get the chocolate rain guy?

443
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Why?

444
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
What the hell does the chocolate rain guy have to do with video games?

445
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I mean, come on.

446
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,560
But Amixia sings about, you know, she does a cover of Still Alive.

447
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
She's video game related.

448
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,520
Chocolate rain has nothing to do with video games.

449
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Actually...

450
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
But it is funny.

451
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
I will say this.

452
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
I will say this.

453
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,440
An old friend of Orange Lounge Radio is experiencing a little bit of internet fame of his own,

454
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
I guess, speaking of people who have said they will come on the show.

455
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,120
He did a remix of this guy from American Idol.

456
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,000
Rinaldo LaPaz was his name.

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
He did this song called We Are Brothers Forever, and it was kind of one of those things you

458
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
laugh.

459
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:21,800
And Justin, who we knew from, like, years ago playing DDR, he did a remix of it.

460
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,900
This has nothing to do with video games, but you can't help but admit that thing's gotta

461
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
be DDR-inspired.

462
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,760
Well, he did that, and he said, I emailed him, I'm like, dude, when are you gonna come

463
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
on the show again?

464
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You're, like, famous and stuff.

465
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
You gotta come back.

466
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,760
He said he would come back and talk games with us and maybe show us some more remixes.

467
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Who knows?

468
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,440
I ran into him in a line for a movie.

469
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Really?

470
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
A couple months ago.

471
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,680
No, like, a couple months ago, but I don't remember what movie we were seeing.

472
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Nice.

473
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,800
All right, so anyhow, lots of things to look forward to on Orange Launch Radio coming up.

474
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,840
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

475
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,800
Loki, please take us to video game chat, because obviously we're having problems with that

476
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
tonight.

477
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,780
All right, well, there is a big old stink this week having to do with Fox News and Mass

478
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
Effect.

479
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,960
Apparently, they aired a little segment called Sex Box, and they were talking about how Mass

480
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,280
Effect featured a full digital character nudity and had explicit sex and all this stuff.

481
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,760
And, of course, anyone that's played Mass Effect knows that that's completely false.

482
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,720
But nonetheless, though, they were on there.

483
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:37,080
They actually had an expert, I'd say a psychology expert or something, who was kind of pimping

484
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,840
out her book.

485
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,560
And at the same time, also in defense, they had Jeff Knightley, who was basically from

486
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
EA.

487
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Isn't it Jeff Keighley?

488
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Keighley Knightley.

489
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Knightley is Kira Knightley.

490
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
She's Pirates of the Caribbean.

491
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Jeff Keighley.

492
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Caribbean.

493
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Caribbean.

494
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Whatever.

495
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,000
So, Orange Lounge Radio, we pronounce stuff good.

496
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,200
I learned it how to read.

497
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,000
I learned it on Orange Lounge.

498
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,440
Anyways, so, all you need to know, okay, is that basically they went back and forth for

499
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,600
about 30 seconds talking about this game.

500
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,460
The psychologist and, you know, the host hadn't played the game, but yet they were still claiming

501
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,000
all this stuff.

502
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,040
So anyways, as the week progressed, I went kind of crazy.

503
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,360
First EA was saying, you know, they're pissed off that all this stuff was said.

504
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,080
This is complete outright lies.

505
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,560
They want a correction from Fox to basically fess up to not having played the game and

506
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,520
just making up lies off the cuff.

507
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,640
So of course Fox said, no, we're not going to do a correction, but hey, you can come

508
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,960
on to one of our shows again.

509
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
And to which, you know, basically they said fuck off.

510
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Anyways, apparently the woman, of course, the psychologist, she has a book called The

511
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,120
Cult of Perfection and it happened to be on Amazon.

512
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,320
Well, gamers got pissed off and they, of course, you know, realized, hey, her book's on there.

513
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
And so they left her a bunch of negative reviews clearly stating that they have not read her

514
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,360
book but that it's, you know, inappropriate for minors and that it's like, here's the

515
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,440
thing that got me...

516
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
It's not that funny, Chris.

517
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,240
But it's the exact same thing she was doing.

518
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,320
Yeah, it was, which is ironic, but the internet is LOL like that, I mean, seriously.

519
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,480
But here's the thing, I don't know how many of you actually went on to Amazon and started

520
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
reading the book.

521
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
It's like, you know, it's a self-help book for women.

522
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,040
It's like something they give out to young women.

523
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,840
Here's the best part, by now when we're talking about this, all those negative reviews have

524
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,320
been removed, the ones that gamers left.

525
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
What's left, though, is still negative reviews.

526
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,560
They weren't good to begin with, I mean, so...

527
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, here's the thing is that I actually started reading some of the book, and I'm

528
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,920
thinking, as I'm reading it, I'm going, why was she invited to talk about video games?

529
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Her book has nothing to do.

530
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,380
I mean, if you're going to bring on someone to dog video games, fucking, you know which

531
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,400
attention whore whose initials start with J and T will be there at the drop of the hat

532
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,960
to come talk about video games and bash them, come on.

533
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
At least call him.

534
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,800
She's too busy chasing an ambulance, you know, so...

536
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Apparently.

537
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Anyways, so, you know, like I said, they trashed her book on Amazon, or all of her books, apparently

538
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,360
she has a few books, and they all suck, including Ben-There-Done-That-Kept-The-Jewelry and The

539
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,320
Fixer-Upper-Man, which is talking about how all men are fixer-uppers, so, yeah, she's

540
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
awesome.

541
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,600
I hope, you know, I gotta wonder, I mean, don't get me wrong, she is pretty hot, okay,

542
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
so I'll give you that.

543
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
She's pretty hot.

544
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm sorry.

545
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,720
No, she's not, she's got a fucked up nose, and she's got that pose that looks like it's

546
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
post-metapause.

547
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,920
Okay, whatever, okay, well, she's a deranged woman.

548
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,360
Anyways, so, to be fair-

549
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,040
She clearly sounds retarded.

550
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,200
To be fair, I don't know if you're gonna cover this, maybe I'm cutting you off, I don't care,

551
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,320
she retracted her statement, she retracted, I was just getting there, anyways, I just

552
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
got served.

553
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,440
I remember Cooper Lawrence did retract her statement, saying that, you know, she really

554
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,640
regrets saying that, and now seeing the game's sex scenes, seeing it's kind of a joke, you

555
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:32,080
know, she's seen more explicit sexual content on Lost than, you know, this game, so.

556
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,960
Or other Fox programming, such as 24, Family Guy, which had a whole thing about side boob,

557
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
if I remember right, I mean, I-

558
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
It's my side boob.

559
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,340
Anyways, that's all you see in Mass Effect, is a little side boob, come on.

560
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,200
And then, of course, not to be left out, Adam Sessler actually gave his opinion on the whole

561
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,200
thing, and I thought he actually phrased it quite well, you know, plus one respect from

562
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,640
me, for him, but, you know.

563
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,560
From one nerdy white guy to another.

564
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Exactly, you know.

565
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Congrats.

566
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,900
But, you know, because usually I think he's kind of a tool, but, you know, actually, he

567
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,120
wasn't bad, you know, I don't know, I think he made his point quite nicely, and, you know,

568
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,680
basically this whole thing is ridiculous, and he also dogged her book without reading

569
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
it, so.

570
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay, internets, I, I lolled at the whole, you know, bashing her book when you hadn't

571
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,160
read it, just doing the same thing she did, however, she did apologize, people screw up,

572
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,220
she made a mistake, I say leave her alone, you need to fight the real enemy.

573
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,640
Who is the real enemy in this case?

574
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Fox News.

575
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Fox News.

576
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,440
I dare and balance my big fat ass, I mean, come on, this isn't even a political thing,

577
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,920
this is nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, this is just about,

578
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,120
that was the most piss poorly researched thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

579
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Did you see the round table discussion that came afterwards?

580
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,320
Oh, oh, oh my God, I wanted to barf, Chris, any thoughts?

581
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,360
You know, I don't know if you'd already heard about this, I posted this in my LJ, and, you

582
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,640
know, I posted the entire interview, and it's just like, the retardedness of these people

583
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,600
just blew my head off, you know, it's like they're like saying, God, I can't even remember

584
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,040
now, you know, it's just like, you know, I don't want my child to have to be subject

585
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,600
to this, and like totally going off on, I don't remember what they said, no, but it

586
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,760
was just like.

587
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,060
I just can't, I didn't know, literally one of them was like, I just can't believe that

588
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,520
we as parents have to monitor everything our children play.

589
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh God, yeah, exactly, here, here, I'll, I'll, I have this direct from my LJ, I'll just

590
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,840
write what, or I'll just read off kind of the part I said.

591
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,840
As to the blonde bimbo, I know being a parent is hard, and you just magically get pregnant

592
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,760
and are forced to care for a baby that you had no responsibility in creating it all,

593
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
but there is all sorts, and there is all sorts of bad stuff coming from places like the interwebs

594
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
and video games, but do us all a favor and attempt to sound a little more mature when

595
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,280
you say that simply monitoring what your child sees is a much, is a much harder job.

596
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,520
Now here's even better, Daryl, you know, you know, I know a lot of these, um, you know,

597
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,800
adults are playing video games and stuff, but you know when those adults are gone, you

598
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,640
know their kids are, they're playing, they're playing their parents' video games, I'm like,

599
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,520
well then why don't you fucking put the parental, you know, protection or codes and stuff on

600
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,200
there to fix that, I mean, since you're aware that they're going to be playing your games,

601
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,320
why don't you, I don't know, solve the problem?

602
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,000
It was just one of the most journalistically irresponsible things I've ever seen in my

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,760
entire life, and they should all be ashamed of themselves for having their names attached

604
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,280
to that piece, except for Jeff Keighley, which, you know, obviously was the only one that

605
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,040
knew what he was talking about, the only one that knew anything about games, honestly.

606
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,880
I laugh when he's like, have you played this game?

607
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,560
Well, no, but I've watched videos on it.

608
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,000
He knew, going in, he knew, well, to his credit, obviously he's a smart guy, you know, he's

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,740
a well-respected journalist, he probably knew going into this, he's like, Fox News wants

610
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,680
me to talk about video games, yeah, I know what's going to happen.

611
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Like he knew, he knew somebody was going to come on there that didn't know their shit,

612
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,960
he had enough smarts to have the foresight, I mean, you could tell that was his first

613
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,280
question right out of the gate, you know.

614
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,760
Oh, oh, and then my favorite, Darryl, well, Darryl, you know, finding the ratings is so

615
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,760
hard, you know, you have to look on the back of the box and it's not there, actually, no,

616
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,600
you're wrong, it's on the front of the box, and on the back of the box, so you're an idiot.

617
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,840
Whereas on a movie poster, it's a tiny little thing at the very bottom of the poster, I

618
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,320
mean, you know, and the ratings, it's okay, the ratings on movies are all on the back

619
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,800
of the box, not one rating is on the front of the box unless it's, of course, you know,

620
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,520
pimping out that it's an unrated director's cut or something like that.

621
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,060
I think it's just disgusting and hypocritical when Fox Television runs all the stuff that's

622
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,400
way more pornographic than Mass Effect could ever be, which is actually kind of a shame

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,200
because Mass Effect should have been a little more pornographic, but anyhow, it's beside

624
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,480
the point, but Fox TV, like, you know, you see way worse things on there, I swear to

625
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,440
God everybody involved from Fox News with that little piece needs to come on the TV

626
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,360
and apologize for being an asshat, I will accept nothing less.

627
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,520
I want that blondie to come out and say, I, blondie, apologize to the world for being

628
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,480
an asshat, that's what I want.

629
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
It'll never happen.

630
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
When was that, Chris?

631
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,880
Well, I mean, I'm going to start studying psychology, this is what I want to do with

632
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,320
my life, and I just love the psychologist that came on, she was like, you know, discussing

633
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,040
the psychologies of, you know, all the, you know, children see this and they think it's

634
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
real.

635
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,000
No, they don't.

636
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,680
Video games and any sort of entertainment, this does not count, you know, if your child

637
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,760
is going off and killing people because of video games, psychologically, that's not the

638
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,880
video game's fault, it's because your child is mentally unstable, and guess whose fucking

639
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,400
fault that is?

640
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Your fault.

641
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
The parent's fault.

642
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,320
It all stems back from the parents, you know, they're probably going through the first stage

643
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,120
of development and they fucked up majorly, so, you know, I just love it when these people

644
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,040
sit there and tell you, it's like, you know, video games and all this stuff, it's hurting

645
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,740
our children, they're, you know.

646
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,220
To be fair, there are mental conditions that, you know, could be, but that's usually outside

647
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,480
the norm, you know, a lot of these kids on Maury Povich who are out of control and stuff,

648
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
that's the parents.

649
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,360
That's again, well, if it is a psychological disorder that requires medication, again,

650
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,720
I give that back to, yeah, that's not the parent's fault that their child is like that

651
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,080
because there's a chemical imbalance that's going on, but the parent needs to be responsible

652
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,800
enough to understand that and take them to the proper doctors and explain to them the

653
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,840
proper, you know, it all stems back to your responsibility as a parent of what you want

654
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,040
your child to see and do.

655
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,440
Alright, we've got to stop giving Fox News so much attention here on this program, but

656
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,120
I do want to respond to some stuff in chat here.

657
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,600
Chat at orangehonestradio.com, some comments, rostielut says, Sky, you have to understand

658
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,720
that Fox News is struggling to get beyond its little niche of right-wing shitheads.

659
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,720
They're nothing more than a bottom-run cable networks.

660
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Their ratings are probably lower than Lifetime and Spike.

661
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,040
I don't know.

662
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,960
Let's see, binary667 says, what do you have against Blondie?

663
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,280
That's some quality music.

664
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,760
Obviously, when I say Blondie, I'm not saying Debra Harry has to come apologize.

665
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
She didn't do anything.

666
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,000
If Debra Harry has to apologize for anything, have her apologize for the Blondie reunion

667
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
album.

668
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But, anyway, that's besides the point.

669
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You know who I'm talking about.

670
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm not talking about Debra Harry.

671
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Let's see, Porto Combat says, Fox News, you are not the father.

672
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:44,040
Sadly enough, if there was an argument or something like Springer or Maury Povich or

673
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,560
something like that, it would actually probably be more intelligent than what's on Fox News

674
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
right now.

675
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Alright, we've got to get back to some happier topics.

676
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,400
Things that won't make us so damn angry.

677
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
If we hadn't done this right out the gate, we'd probably be doing the FUs right about

678
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,080
now, but we'll have to save those for later.

679
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,840
Let's talk about something happy.

680
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,800
Let's get some happy news here to make us forget this whole Fox debacle.

681
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,640
Res HD, that's a nice happy subject, right?

682
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,880
You know what's even better?

683
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,960
Is that it is very possible this game is coming out this week, especially a lot of people

684
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,280
seem to think so are convinced.

685
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,240
Well, you said it's going to come out this month, and I think this is the last week left.

686
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
There is that.

687
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,800
And then also, there was a quote from Q Entertainment, quote, the game is being prepped and it's

688
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
just waiting for the green light.

689
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Maybe next week?

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,200
So, in other words, basically, Q Entertainment is just saying, we're done, it's there, waiting

691
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,640
to go, we're just waiting for someone at Microsoft to push the button.

692
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:44,160
So that will be very happy when Res HD, I'll have that on my TV all the time, and we'll

693
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,360
never have a need to put my TV on Fox News ever again.

694
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,460
Well, I was reading, they had an interview with Mizuguchi about how to play it with the

695
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,440
other controllers and stuff, they said put one on your feet, put one on your back or

696
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,000
something like that, and I don't know what to do with the third one.

697
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,480
Put it in a happy place.

698
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,040
Put it in the spot that most suits you.

699
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Let's just leave it at that, right, Jamie?

700
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,800
I guess so.

701
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,080
Man, some people are desperate.

702
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Anyway, there is a contest going on in the UK.

703
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,360
Microsoft is having some Halo fans to make videos about Master Chief in everyday situations

704
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,660
that do not involve Halo.

705
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,020
And if they win, then they will be accepted, well, they will get to go to a film school

706
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,840
for a month in LA for, I guess, special lessons, but they said you can use a video camera,

707
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:51,000
you can use the game itself, animation, however you want to do it, it just has to, you know,

708
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,320
be Master Chief in a situation apart from the Halo universe.

709
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:03,200
And it's for European gamers over 18, submissions are to be in between January 31st and March

710
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
21st this year.

711
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,200
Here's an idea, kids, and if you win with this idea, you only have to, you know, credit

712
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,840
me.

713
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,000
Master Chief responding to this Fox News story.

714
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Think about it.

715
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,720
Well, for anyone who's interested in it, it's Halo Re-Cut, is what the contest is called.

716
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,240
It's at xbox.com slash en dash gb slash Halo Re-Cut, all one word.

717
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
So if you want to check it out.

718
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Well, I hope somebody we know wins it, so good luck to all of you.

719
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,320
If you win it, send us an email.

720
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Yes.

721
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,520
We'll interview you.

722
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,480
Another first person shooter game that's pretty fun, Team Fortress 2 is going to be getting

723
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,280
some unlockable weapons and new game modes pretty soon, which is pretty awesome.

724
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,960
They're one of the first earned weapons, I guess, that's going to be for the medic, and

725
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,040
it's an over-healer, which apparently I believe is a tool you can use to give a temporary

726
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:05,160
boost to your other player's health up to 150%.

727
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,000
And this is also part of the balancing that Valve is doing.

728
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,440
They're also going to be talking about some other unlockable weapons, including a healing

729
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,400
ray and some other stuff.

730
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,480
Also they were going to be introducing a new map, Gold Rush, and there's going to be another

731
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,920
one coming out as well, it's a remake, I guess, of an older map called Badlands, and basically

732
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,100
in Gold Rush the blue team must escort a mining cart through tunnels, and the cart moves faster

733
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:45,080
with the more blue team members nearby, but stops completely if a red player gets near.

734
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,640
So that's kind of neat, I like how they're mixing it up and supporting the game well

735
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,000
after it's come out, so looking forward to it.

736
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,360
That's always good to see a game get a lot of lovin' after it's still out, which is yet

737
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,680
another reason, going back to what I said earlier in the show, why I love Oblivion.

738
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,840
They were coming out with new shit for that game for a long time, and granted they're

739
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
done now, but...

740
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,560
I wish they had multiplayer in that, or at least co-op or something like that.

741
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,200
It's almost like they built the game to have that at one point, because when you conjure

742
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,000
things, like let's say I conjure a skeleton, my character's name is Bunny, don't laugh,

743
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,520
but when you actually point at the skeleton it says, Bunny's Skeleton.

744
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,440
Almost like it was built so that at one point it was going to have a multiplayer environment,

745
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
you know what I mean?

746
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,120
Like why would it need to say it's my skeleton, couldn't it just say your skeleton, or conjured

747
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
skeleton?

748
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
Hell, they could just re-release the game with multiplayer built into it.

749
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
They probably will.

750
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,880
Kind of like how they do it with Twisted Metal, Black Online, or something like that.

751
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,280
That might be how they try to hold this over for Elder Scrolls V.

752
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
That'd be cool.

753
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Who knows?

754
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,520
Well, another game that continues to get some love after it's out is Halo 3, but this isn't

755
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,640
anything official.

756
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,640
This is actually something that's been put together for your iPhone.

757
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:58,060
It's a website called www.ihalostats.com, and it's a website that's built specifically

758
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,320
for your iPhone that will allow you to check your Halo stats from anywhere.

759
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Why you'd want to do that, I don't really know, but hey, you have that option.

760
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,420
It's for picking up chicks, of course.

761
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,400
It's like, dude, look how awesome I am in Halo 3.

762
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,880
Think of how awesome I'll be in bed.

763
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Think about it.

764
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Exactly.

765
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,820
But there's a little disclaimer right there on the website, iHaloStats.com is not affiliated

766
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,140
with Bungie LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

767
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,980
So it is something completely fan-made, and to their credit, you know what, even if I

768
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,600
think this is a little, I don't know, useless, it's kind of cool in that, you know, hey,

769
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,520
somebody had a weird idea and kind of built this whole thing, and it seems to run pretty

770
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
well.

771
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,240
So, you know, props to them for seeing their strange idea through to completion, if that

772
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,000
makes any sense at all.

773
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,440
I don't know.

774
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,640
Well, for more gaming news, for anyone who is a fan of Condemned, Condemned 2 comes out

775
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:03,180
on March 11th, according to Sega, and it's gory and violent and weird.

776
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,200
Which means I'm going to go put a pre-order down right now, right?

777
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I won't.

778
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,280
Well, actually, the first one was kind of, it was just freaky, it's like a serial killer

779
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
type game, you know?

780
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,360
Now that I think about it, we did start Condemned, but I don't think that after a little bit

781
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,820
of it, I was too much into it afterwards.

782
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,000
All you need to know about Condemned 2, and I can sell it to you in one sentence, it has

783
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,160
exploding babies.

784
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,740
You know what, Loki, that might have done it, actually, that's pretty awesome.

785
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Exploding babies?

786
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm looking at this picture of a guy with a meat hook.

787
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Why does it go boom?

788
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,760
Why are they exploding?

789
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,960
I don't know.

790
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,640
Somebody exploded them?

791
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't know.

792
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
How old are they?

793
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Well, they're babies!

794
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I mean, Chris!

795
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:00,340
I'm sorry, I just came from a household where there was just a week-old infant in my arms

796
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,440
holding just sort of exploding babies, sad me.

797
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Shut up!

798
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,240
Well, at least it wasn't ticking.

799
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,320
Here's my advice, Chris.

800
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Don't play Condemned 2.

801
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,840
There's plenty of other video games out there for your enjoyment.

802
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Why don't you play?

803
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,440
Here, Chris, I want you to go get a game.

804
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,280
It's called Imagine Babies.

805
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I have it in my backpack.

806
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,800
It's nothing but happy babies, rainbows, diaper changing, I don't know.

807
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,960
It's all the glory of having babies.

808
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,280
That's the first time I changed a diaper in my life, and I really enjoyed it.

809
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,720
That's a different type of exploding baby.

810
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
I'm breaking out the DS right now.

811
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Yeah, it's not like that.

812
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,320
All right, Condemned 2, now with exploding babies, enjoy, March 11th.

813
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,360
Well, there's another game I'm looking forward to, far more than Condemned 2.

814
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,480
Of course, that would be Grand Theft Auto IV, and the announcement that it was actually

815
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,640
coming out this spring instead of the end of this year, or possibly not this year.

816
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,440
That's just all sorts of awesome.

817
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,840
It's dated now for April 29th, and it will be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 3

818
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,720
and Xbox 360, as well as a special edition, which I already have preordered, and I can't

819
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
wait.

820
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,200
The other thing, though, Rockstar was commenting on why it's been delayed, and they said, of

821
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,680
course, one of the contributing factors was that they had some technical challenges with

822
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,360
the PlayStation 3 version, and, of course, they wouldn't go into what the challenges

823
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
were.

824
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,960
They said it's not an issue anymore because both versions are now neck and neck in their

825
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
development phases.

826
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,440
We were just having problems getting the hookers just right in the PlayStation 3 version.

827
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,560
Yeah, so they basically said it's really no surprise to anyone that the PS3 was definitely

828
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,560
a contributing factor to the delay.

829
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,840
I have to go back to the last story because this is too good.

830
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,400
In our chat room, Ekum, which is just Mike spelled backwards, says, imagine exploding

831
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,480
babies coming to a DS near you.

832
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,300
By the way, exploding babies are in the trailer for the game, so watch the trailer for the

833
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,720
game and you will see the exploding babies.

834
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,960
Chris, don't watch the trailer for Gundam 2, please.

835
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,360
Oh my god, this is too cute.

836
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,800
You're actually playing Imagine Babies here in the studio?

837
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Yeah.

838
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,160
Get that filth out of my house.

839
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,800
You need to blame Loki, he gave it to me.

840
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,360
You know what you should be playing, Dark Sakura, is a wonderful game on Xbox Live called

841
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,820
Every Extend Extra Extreme.

842
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,320
That game is pretty awesome and it's on PSP as well.

843
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,840
The only gripe I have with the Xbox Live one is that the game doesn't get a whole lot of

844
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,480
variety in it in the basic modes.

845
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,160
It doesn't have quite the same hypnotic backgrounds that the PSP one had and the skins don't change

846
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,260
that much, but to make up for that lack of variety, to Q Entertainment's credit, they

847
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,360
have the custom tracks mode in the game and I think a lot of people forget about this.

848
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,240
You can actually play Every Extend Extra Extreme with your own custom tracks.

849
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,280
The problem with the mode this week is that it wasn't perfect.

850
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,260
You can either manually put in the BPM or you can tap it out to get the beats per second

851
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,120
or beats per minute or what have you, but you couldn't exactly fine tune it until now.

852
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,840
Q Entertainment has released a code that will allow you to make a fine adjustment to your

853
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
custom music.

854
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,800
You better write this one down because it's very complicated.

855
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,580
Very complicated code to remember.

856
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
Here you go.

857
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
This is the code.

858
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,560
At the start menu, you're going to use the left and right triggers to put in this code.

859
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Here it is.

860
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Get your pencils ready.

861
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Here it is.

862
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Left.

863
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Right.

864
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
Left.

865
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Right.

866
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,560
Left.

867
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Right.

868
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Left.

869
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Right.

870
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Left.

871
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
Right.

872
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Left.

873
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
Left.

874
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Left.

875
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
Ok, right.

876
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Alright, there you go.

877
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,300
Wait, wait, wait, what was after left?

878
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300
Ah, right.

879
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,300
Ok.

880
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
So there it is.

881
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,400
So you can just have a Q Entertainment overload this week if you want to do this fine tuning

882
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,460
mode and then Res HD and hell you could play 99 Nights if you're at it if you want to play

883
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,600
a bad Q Entertainment game.

884
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,680
emotion It wasn't that bad.

885
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,460
It wasn't that bad.

886
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,560
It just wasn't that good either.

887
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
It was ok.

888
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
It was better than probably Kingdom Under Fire Circles.

889
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,360
Well, here's the thing. I have Q Entertainment up on a pedestal. I mean, seriously. Luminous, every extent.

890
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,460
Actually, you know I love my puzzle games. I have Q Entertainment up on a very high pedestal.

891
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,360
I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi a lot.

892
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,860
They need to stick to the puzzle music games. Do not deviate from the puzzle music games.

893
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:34,660
Although, can you imagine if 99 Nights had, like, some sort of musical beat thing to it, just like, you know...

894
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,460
Oh my god, okay.

895
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:35,960
Rez?

896
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,160
All you had to do, yeah, seriously, to make 99 Nights cooler, all you had to do was be slashing people to techno music,

897
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,460
and that would have been the coolest game ever.

898
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,860
Who wouldn't want to kill people to bad techno music? Come on.

899
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,360
That would be pretty awesome, like, something mixing, like, Dynasty Warriors with, like, Rez.

900
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:50,860
Hello?

901
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,560
I'd dig a- Hey!

902
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,460
I would totally play that.

903
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,360
Get on the ball, people!

904
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,860
Exploding babies in time with the music? Come on.

905
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,460
It'd be fun.

906
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,960
That would be kind of... wrong, but, you know, um...

907
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,460
If you want to be abstract, then sure, go the space draft route, you know?

908
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,960
They could do weasel stomping mode.

909
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,360
Son of Dad says Gunpei is God.

910
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,760
That's one of the few Q Entertainment games I haven't played is Gunpei.

911
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,560
Gunpei is great.

912
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,660
I've heard it's pretty good.

913
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,360
Uh, Gerardimo says, Rob, don't forget Meteos Disney Magic. That's worse than 99 Nights.

914
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,060
I enjoyed the original Meteos, actually, quite a bit, but...

915
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,360
I didn't play the Disney one. Did you play Disney Meteos?

916
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,960
Um, I've seen... I've seen it been played before, but I thought it was cute.

917
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,960
But I'm a Disney freak, so, you know, look at my online screen name, Disney Funk 10, so...

918
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,760
Shut up!

919
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,460
Nerd.

920
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,760
All right. How about some release dates? Let's travel the globe and find out what's coming soon to a retail store near you.

921
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,660
We'll start with Europe.

922
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,160
Do you need release, Rob?

923
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,860
Um, I don't know how to answer that.

924
00:46:50,860 --> 00:47:01,060
How about on the 30th we get Chestmaster Live on Xbox 360 and ResHD given a date of the 30th in the UK.

925
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,760
On the first is Bombermanland on Wii. Try saying that three times fast.

926
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Flat Out Head On on PSP, Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom, yay.

927
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,460
Lineage 2, The Camel on PC.

928
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,560
Um, PDC World Championship Darts 2008 on DS, which is really exciting, isn't it?

929
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,660
Yeah.

930
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:29,060
Puzzle Quest, Challenger of the Warlords on Wii, Sims 2 Castaway Stories on PC, and Zoo Hospital on DS.

931
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,660
Zoo Hospital? Oh boy!

932
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,260
Isn't that exciting?

933
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,760
Zoo Host-able.

934
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,860
I would like to know how many people have pre-orders on Zoo Hospital.

935
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,860
I've got mine in there. Do you?

936
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,660
Just making sure I don't want to miss out on Zoo Hospital.

937
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:56,260
You know, I was hoping that Chestmaster Live was actually Chestmaster Live, you know, like a pornographic version of it or something.

938
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,260
That'd be kind of cool, but no.

939
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:09,660
Let's see, the US isn't, you know, that busy this week, actually. It's pretty scarce.

940
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,460
And there's not going to be much that you're going to be interested in unless you love Bomberman.

941
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,260
In which case, there's a couple games for you.

942
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,760
Bomberman Land for the Wii and the PSP coming out.

943
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,660
A little mini-game with some adventure stuff in there as well.

944
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,560
And it's Bomberman, so there you go.

945
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,960
Bomberman Land Touch 2 for the DS is coming out.

946
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Pursuit Force Xtreme Justice on the PSP.

947
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,160
And The Sims Castaway Stories on the PC.

948
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
What kind of stories do they have to tell?

949
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,660
Help! I'm trapped in a knock-off game of a once-popular franchise.

950
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,160
Help! I'm lost on an island.

951
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,660
Anything else to note?

952
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,060
I was just seeing if there's anything else that's funny.

953
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,660
Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

954
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,460
Wait, say that one more time.

955
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,360
Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

956
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,260
So we have Zoo Hospital coming out in Europe, and we have...

957
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,260
Is it the same game with just a different name or something?

958
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,760
Or is there really that big of a demand out there in the game marketplace for Zoo Hospital?

959
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,560
Dude, there's a lot of freaking Pet Vet games.

960
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:29,360
There's actually one that's kind of neat. It's a little different than your usual pet-the-animals-and-they-are-better type game.

961
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,760
They actually have one that's done like Phoenix Wright, that's a pet hospital game.

962
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,560
That's kind of neat.

963
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,760
I guess it's cute because it's a good game for kids.

964
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,760
It's a good game for kids, I'm sure, because how many...

965
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,460
Objection! You're not sick! You're faking any damn dog!

966
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,760
There's tons of eight- and nine-year-olds that want to be veterinarians when they grow up, you know?

967
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,760
So, I mean, I can...

968
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,260
If you want, I can go even more obscure here. We've got...

969
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:07,760
What is it? Pacific Storm Allies, AGEOD's American Civil War, 1861 through 1865.

970
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,260
Whoo! That's awesome!

971
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,560
And that's it.

972
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,960
Really, I don't want to go into any more details unless there's another Tycoon game,

973
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,360
because, you know, every week there's got to be a Tycoon game.

974
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Oh, here's the one I was talking about, Paws and Claws Pet Resort.

975
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
But that's not for this week.

976
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,560
Pet Resort?

977
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,660
Pet Resort.

978
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,860
Awesome.

979
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,160
It used to be Paws and Claws Pet Resort Tycoon, so...

980
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,160
All right, let's head over to Japanese release dates.

981
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,560
Oh my god, this is so... You guys, seriously, look at this.

982
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,360
How ridiculous-looking is that?

983
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,460
You get to pamper the pets.

984
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,560
It does look kind of cute in a really, like, excess kind of way.

985
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,960
All the animals have little hats and sunglasses on and shirts. That's so cute.

986
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,660
Like, really cute, as in, like, a Scholastic Weekly type cute.

987
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,360
Highlights for children type cute.

988
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,060
Yeah, exactly.

989
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,960
Exactly.

990
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,560
All right, let's go to Japanese release dates, because this is one of the fun parts of the show,

991
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,360
is getting to hear me horribly butcher the pronunciation of Japanese titles coming soon to Japan.

992
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,060
But we'll start with easy ones on the Xbox 360 Devil May Cry 4 on January 31st.

993
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:20,760
Need for Speed Pro Street also hitting January 31st, as well as Sega Rally Revo also hitting as well.

994
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,660
By the way, there is a Xbox 360 Plus Devil May Cry.

995
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,760
It's a bundle pack, also comes out in Japan on the 31st of this month.

996
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,560
Traveling over to some other systems, taking a look at the PlayStation 3.

997
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,560
Of course, they're getting Devil May Cry 4 on that system as well.

998
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,860
They're also getting Disgaea Hour of Darkness 3 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 on the 31st.

999
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:48,260
Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, as well as Assassin's Creed makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

1000
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,660
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, not a whole lot.

1001
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,960
There's a game called Family Ski coming out from Namco Bandai on the 31st.

1002
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,660
And I believe that uses the Wii Fit Balance Board, if you have it.

1003
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,060
Oh, yes, that one. That's right.

1004
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,860
We heard about that earlier, that Namco was putting that together for use with the Wii Fit.

1005
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,360
So that's coming out this week, for those of you guys that bought Wii Fit over there.

1006
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,260
Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, because you know Need for Speed has to come out everywhere.

1007
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,760
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, another version of Need for Speed Pro Street.

1008
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,160
Also, Tales of Destiny, the Director's Cut makes its way out on the PlayStation 2.

1009
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,960
Cyanide with an X, I guess maybe that's Cyanide is coming out as well.

1010
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,760
Is that on the PS2?

1011
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,760
On the PS2.

1012
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,260
That's a pretty cool game, actually. It's like a shoot-em-up game.

1013
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,060
Bullet Hill.

1014
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:44,460
This game is called, also coming out on the 31st, is called Your, Memories Off, Girls Style.

1015
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,160
That's not one sentence, it's split up.

1016
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,060
It's Your, Memories Off, Girls Style comes out as well.

1017
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't know quite what that is, but it's probably yet another game that's like, you know, I don't know.

1018
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,460
It sounds like a dating sim for some reason, but I don't know.

1019
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:05,360
Also coming out, Izumo II, Double Tacked comes out from GN Software on the PlayStation 2 this week.

1020
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,860
Moving to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.

1021
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,560
Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad.

1022
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
I'm not making that up.

1023
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
Loop Salad?

1024
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,160
Loop Salad comes out on the DS this week.

1025
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,960
What the fuck?

1026
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,460
Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad. I'm not even kidding, that's what it is.

1027
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,560
There's a little penguin on the cover, it looks cute.

1028
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
Weird looking thing.

1029
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,160
That comes out on the Nintendo DS as well as

1030
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:35,160
Hiromichi Onisan no Ayako Taisunavi comes out from Dorasu this week on the Nintendo DS.

1031
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:41,460
And I love the cover, it's this very, very happy Japanese man standing in front of a rainbow.

1032
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,160
Not that I'm sure it's insinuating anything, I'm just saying.

1033
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,560
Is that like, you know, the Japanese version of the Wiggles over there or something like that?

1034
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,260
It could be, actually, that's a very distinct thought.

1035
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,360
So I linked that in chat, because, yeah, I don't know, he's very happy.

1036
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,860
He's like Richard Simmons happy.

1037
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,760
You should get a t-shirt with that on the front there.

1038
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,060
Ah, it would be, yeah.

1039
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,460
He's like the Japanese Ronald McDonald.

1040
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,460
Yeah, I know that.

1041
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:10,060
That picture is waiting to be 4chan'd into something, seriously.

1042
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,460
Seriously, chat.

1043
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:18,060
Look this game up if you're listening on the podcast and didn't get a chance to get the link in chat.

1044
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:24,860
Lastly, let's go to Sony PSP, where there's a game called Patapon coming out on January 1st.

1045
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,060
I have that on my PSP right now.

1046
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,960
You like that? Is it good?

1047
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,260
Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

1048
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,360
Well, Jesus.

1049
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,560
That's the eye of all one.

1050
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,360
And lastly but not least, Sega Rally Revo also coming out on the Sony PSP.

1051
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,960
I'll tell you what, I'll play it during break, and then I'll tell you how it is.

1052
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,460
Yeah, you should tell us.

1053
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,360
Alright, let's move on. Back to the gaming news.

1054
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:54,860
Well, to move even further over to the UK, you know, there was the drama going on regarding the release of Manhunt 2.

1055
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:59,160
And they had said that, yeah, it would be okay, there would be no harm in the game.

1056
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,360
Well, the High Court has said, nah, it's gonna be harmful, so we don't want it.

1057
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:14,160
Actually even stating that the Video Appeals Committee misinterpreted the term of actual harm,

1058
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,460
and that they should have considered a wider realm of harm.

1059
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:32,260
So, it will not be released in its current incarnation, because it will not be rated by the BBFC, which is the British form of film classification.

1060
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,460
And there's no telling if it will be in any incarnation released.

1061
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:45,260
You know, just a message to our friends over there in the UK who might be, you know, legally involved in all this.

1062
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,760
Just release the damn game, because seriously, it's not gonna sell anyway.

1063
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,060
They've all heard from us that the game sucks.

1064
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:55,660
So, you know, just stop wasting the dollars, you know, getting the court order.

1065
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,760
It's not that good anymore.

1066
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,360
Just let them sell it, no one's gonna buy it. It sucks.

1067
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,560
It was good when, you know, we didn't know what the game was gonna be like,

1068
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,760
but now that it's been out, and we've seen the reviews, and we've played it, and we've kind of gotten over the,

1069
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,560
oh wow, this was violent, okay, let's move along.

1070
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,060
You know, if the British board wants to look at something, I mean, condemn 2.

1071
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,260
Hello, exploding babies?

1072
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,260
I mean, that might necessitate a ban or something.

1073
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,760
But you don't understand, though, Rob.

1074
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,060
Exploding babies, I mean, that has nothing to do with, like, sexual stuff.

1075
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,260
So, you know, that's also another reason why we...

1076
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,760
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1077
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,960
Exploding babies, that's not as offensive as ripping off someone's testicles with pliers.

1078
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,060
What?

1079
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,160
Alright, let's keep moving with the gaming news.

1080
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,160
So, let's see here.

1081
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,160
This isn't really a big surprise.

1082
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:53,860
Ubisoft has confirmed that there's gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming in their next fiscal year,

1083
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,560
which, you know, 2008, I guess that starts in March.

1084
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Big whoop.

1085
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,560
I mean, we already knew this was kind of rumored to be coming out anyways,

1086
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,060
and I see some, you know, artwork here that they were showing off.

1087
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:17,260
No word, though, on when exactly it's gonna be out, because their fiscal year runs from basically March of this year through April of 2009.

1088
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,260
So, somewhere in between there, we're gonna get a new Prince of Persia game.

1089
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:26,560
And hopefully it looks like this, you know, piece of artwork that they have, because it looks like Strider.

1090
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,060
But, you know, not a big surprise.

1091
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Hmm.

1092
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,260
I'm going to the chat room and looking at some comments.

1093
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,260
If you want to go to chat.orangelaungeradio.com and leave some comments.

1094
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,260
Going back to the last story, RawstealUT says,

1095
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,260
No more Manhunt 2, angry face.

1096
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:51,260
Frisbee says, Come on, guys, Manhunt 2 is not a game to get locked up in the government.

1097
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,260
Sonofdad says, Manhunt 2, no plastic knife attachment for the Wiimote yet?

1098
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,260
They have those.

1099
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,260
Shut up.

1100
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:03,260
It's not a plastic knife, but it's a plastic sword, and then they've got, you know, stuff like that.

1101
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,260
But, I don't know.

1102
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,260
Let's see.

1103
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,260
GS68 says, I should maybe take a break from game politics.

1104
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,260
The story they've been running make me want to stab random people, I guess, in response.

1105
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,260
Well, see, wait a minute.

1106
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,260
Now, see, you're displaced anger there is part of the problem.

1107
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,260
You know, video games make you want to stab random people.

1108
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,260
No, I'm kidding.

1109
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,260
I know that's just a question.

1110
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,260
I'm sure in Japan, though, they probably have a knife attachment for, you know, the Wiimote.

1111
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,260
I mean, they have attachments for all the different weapons in Ghost Squad in there,

1112
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,260
so a knife maybe.

1113
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,260
That'd be kind of neat.

1114
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,260
You could pretend that the shark gun's a knife.

1115
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,260
That's just, yeah, I mean, do you really need that?

1116
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,260
I mean, come on.

1117
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,260
It's a little strange.

1118
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,260
Well, did you ever see the, did you see that story this week?

1119
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,260
Someone made a replica energy sword.

1120
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,260
No.

1121
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,260
They made, it's an actual sword, but they made it, you know, look like the energy sword from Halo 3.

1122
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,260
Interesting.

1123
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,260
Some people have a lot of free time on their hands.

1124
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:07,260
All right, well, let's move over to the PSP, and unfortunately, Sony needs a little more time on their hands

1125
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,260
because Skype was announced for the PSP.

1126
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,260
Remember, we talked about Skype a couple weeks ago on the show.

1127
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,260
It's going to be coming to the PSP if you own a PSP Lite, that is,

1128
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,260
because the lights have more memories on board, but they've been delayed.

1129
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:23,260
Skype was supposed to hit the PSP on the 24th along with some companion microphones.

1130
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,260
However, Sony had to come out with a press release that says in part,

1131
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:33,260
quote, it was found that the microphone did not meet the Skype specifications, in part, to obtain certification.

1132
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,260
Sorry, you still sound like a douche.

1133
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,260
That is unacceptable.

1134
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
If you've been listening to this show for any length of time,

1135
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:44,260
there's a lot of people on Skype whose microphones have probably failed a lot of types of certifications.

1136
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,260
I know that.

1137
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,260
I know what you're doing.

1138
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,260
I'm so excited to be honest with you.

1139
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,260
Yeah, it sounds like it works to me because that's how all the Skype calls sound like.

1140
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,260
I know.

1141
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,260
Can we have Skype certify all our listeners' microphones or something?

1142
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,260
Just kidding.

1143
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,260
We heart the listeners and the ones that call in on Skype,

1144
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,260
but just don't forget to call Echo 1-2-3 before you call our show.

1145
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,260
That's all we ask, okay?

1146
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,260
Anyhow, so no news yet on when this will be coming out for sure,

1147
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,260
but we imagine the delay is not going to be that long.

1148
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,260
I could imagine there's going to be third-party microphones and stuff like that.

1149
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,260
I know there's headsets already for some of the SOCOM games,

1150
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,260
which I imagine you could probably use those for Skype.

1151
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,260
I don't understand why they're delaying all this stuff.

1152
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,260
Oh, I'm probably guessing because everything that's Sony-related

1153
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,260
seems to be delayed one time or another.

1154
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,260
Yeah, it's kind of funny because, of course, all the Sony haters came out and said,

1155
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,260
here we go again, delay station 3.

1156
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,260
Like all the cool stuff.

1157
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,260
Except this is a delay station portable, okay?

1158
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,260
That's true, that's true.

1159
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,260
All right, really quick, some comments from chat,

1160
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,260
and then we'll get to the next story Jamie's going to do for us.

1161
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,260
ActDef says in chat, yes, if you sell something with the Skype name,

1162
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,260
you have to be certified by them.

1163
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,260
So that is part of the point is that the microphones are chatted to you

1164
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,260
as they get it, you know, Best Buy, Circuit City, whatever.

1165
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,260
It's just some random mic that happens to be a USB mic.

1166
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,260
But if you're going to sell something with the Skype name on it,

1167
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,260
like the PSP's going to do, it has to be Skype certified, which makes sense.

1168
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,260
And Tiger Claw says pretty soon the Skype calls on OLR

1169
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:08,260
are going to be done by people using Skype on their PSP.

1170
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,260
I don't think that's actually going to be a bad thing at all because, hey,

1171
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,260
if the mics are certified and everything's been tested,

1172
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,260
you know it's going to work.

1173
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,260
So I look forward to that day actually.

1174
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,260
I don't know about you guys, but that'll be good.

1175
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,260
I'll cry.

1176
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,260
Why would you cry?

1177
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Because...

1178
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,260
Cry tears of joy or tears of pain?

1179
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,260
Cry tears of apathy.

1180
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,260
I can't wait to talk on my PSP out in public looking like a complete douche.

1181
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,260
Exactly.

1182
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,260
Yo, what's up, man?

1183
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,260
I'm totally on my PSP.

1184
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,260
You know what it is?

1185
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,260
It's the N-Gage all over again.

1186
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:42,260
You don't have to side talk on it because it has a microphone.

1187
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,260
Although the microphone that they're going to have is like

1188
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,260
plugs into the USB thing on the front,

1189
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,260
I think on the top of the actual system,

1190
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,260
which doesn't make any sense to me when you think about it

1191
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,260
because why won't they just have a headset or something they can plug in?

1192
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,260
I know.

1193
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
So instead you're just like, hello?

1194
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,260
Hello?

1195
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,260
Talking with the PSP in front of you and be like, hi.

1196
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,260
How's it going?

1197
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,260
Yeah, totally.

1198
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,260
Or do like they have with the iPhone.

1199
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,260
Their headphones are so smart.

1200
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,260
They've got just a little tiny microphone,

1201
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,260
but I was outside in the wind talking to my mom on it

1202
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
and she heard me just fine.

1203
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,260
I've got to say this.

1204
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:21,260
There's Justin TV chat and there's our chat at Orange Laundry Radio.

1205
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,260
Mac Man's making smart ass comments in both.

1206
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:27,260
He says in the Justin TV chat, echo 123 is for wussies.

1207
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,260
Call in with no sure quality test.

1208
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,260
Hell, don't even buy a microphone.

1209
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,260
You, sir, are part of the problem.

1210
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,260
But he says in chat at orangelaundryradio.com,

1211
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,260
yo, I'm on my PSP.

1212
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,260
Want to pick me up?

1213
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,260
Want to pick me up?

1214
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,260
Sorry, I just.

1215
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,260
No.

1216
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,260
No, I don't want to pick you up.

1217
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,260
Can I do my story now?

1218
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,260
Yes, you may.

1219
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
Something that's even more retarded than Skype.

1220
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,260
Uh-oh.

1221
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,260
Well, then that microphone anyway.

1222
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,260
Someone made an eye of judgment table

1223
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,260
to make up for the fact that the camera is easily bumped into poor lighting.

1224
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:03,260
So he takes this little table and builds a custom hardwood replica of the mat

1225
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:06,260
and apparently it works just fine,

1226
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,260
but I was like, people like this game enough to care?

1227
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
Has that sold any more copies?

1228
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,260
Oh, no, I don't think it has.

1229
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,260
What is the latest update on the eye of judgment numbers?

1230
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,260
Still hasn't broke another 100,000 or even 10,000.

1231
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:24,260
Can we count table sales as part of the million?

1232
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:28,260
Honestly, if you want to, go right ahead.

1233
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,260
Before, I mentioned it in that thread because I was egging on people in there.

1234
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,260
I said I'd be surprised if it surpassed 300,000 units.

1235
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,260
But right now, it's really starting to flatten off.

1236
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:47,260
I mean, it sold 4,000 units in the U.S. only in the last week or so.

1237
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,260
All right, since now we are going to add table counts,

1238
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,260
what were we at, 160,000?

1239
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:56,260
Adding the tables, we're now up to 160,001

1240
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,260
because that's how many of these tables will probably sell.

1241
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,260
Well, it's just this guy that made it.

1242
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,260
It doesn't say anything about it being retailed.

1243
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,260
Oh, okay.

1244
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,260
I mean, there's a comment on there that it would be retail ready

1245
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,260
if they add like a cup holder,

1246
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,260
but he just made this for himself.

1247
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,260
So this is unacceptable.

1248
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
Where am I going to put my drink on this table?

1249
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,260
This guy's pretty hardcore to do something like that.

1250
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,260
You've got to be a pretty hardcore Eye of Judgment fan.

1251
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,260
This guy's name is Matt, and he plays as Havok.

1252
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,260
Watch out for Havok.

1253
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:30,260
And I'm just still boggled.

1254
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:34,260
I guess if you like it enough and you want to do that,

1255
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,260
I guess kudos to you.

1256
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:39,260
But from my perspective, since I don't really care for Eye of Judgment,

1257
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:43,260
I'm just like, okay.

1258
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,260
I know, I'm always kind of like,

1259
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,260
you could have built like a house for a cat or a dog.

1260
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:53,260
But then I think about that I did actually have my place mat

1261
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,260
that I made when I played Magic back in the day.

1262
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,260
It wasn't a table.

1263
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,260
It was a plastic mat.

1264
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,260
It used to be the shit, now it's the crap.

1265
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,260
All right, let's move on.

1266
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,260
Please, before we get into Magic the Gathering talk,

1267
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,260
please look at the same show.

1268
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:17,260
Anyways, Sony's really trying to catch up with the whole Nintendo fad

1269
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,260
of releasing consoles in different colors.

1270
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:25,260
Now in Asia, you will be able to pick up a red PS2 system.

1271
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,260
Also, what's kind of neat is, according to some FCC filings,

1272
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:35,260
we're going to be seeing a white PS3 coming to the U.S. as well.

1273
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,260
So, new colors, yay.

1274
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,260
Because that's why people weren't buying your PS3.

1275
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,260
It's because it wasn't white.

1276
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,260
Because everyone knows that white consoles sell better, right?

1277
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:49,260
That's why the 360 and the Wii are outselling the PS3.

1278
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,260
It's all that black hate.

1279
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,260
That's what it is.

1280
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,260
People getting down on black consoles.

1281
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:01,260
Wow. Dot, dot, dot.

1282
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,260
I am inching away from Loki slowly.

1283
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,260
Well, you know, they could also use the Saturn argument

1284
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,260
because the Japanese Saturn was white and over here it was.

1285
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,260
Yeah.

1286
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,260
Okay, that was kind of dumb.

1287
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,260
I can't get behind that argument.

1288
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,260
But they're set to come out in Asia February 4th,

1289
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:23,260
so if you really need to get your hands on a red PS2, I don't know.

1290
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,260
There's other console sites out there that will sell colored PS2 systems

1291
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,260
in almost any color of the rainbow that you want,

1292
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,260
so do you really need to wait for this shit to import it?

1293
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,260
And my God, seriously, it's the color of a console.

1294
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,260
If you don't have a PS2 already, it's like, oh, damn,

1295
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,260
I was really hoping for a red one.

1296
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,260
Now my dreams can be realized at the end of the console cycle.

1297
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:46,260
Portal Combat said a clear PS3 would be sweet.

1298
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,260
It doesn't matter how many colors of these consoles you're going to release.

1299
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,260
Okay, so the PS2 is selling lots and lots and lots of consoles.

1300
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,260
PS3, not so much, you know, but I don't know.

1301
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,260
It's just going to confuse people even more with the white console now.

1302
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,260
Yet another skew.

1303
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,260
What does it matter what it looks like as long as it's still the same piece of shit inside?

1304
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,260
This one's white, but guess what it won't do this time?

1305
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,260
Play Blu-ray movies or do something that's important.

1306
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,260
It has no lefts.

1307
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:19,260
I've never been more happy that we got our first day release than I am now.

1308
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,260
Wow.

1309
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,260
Sorry, I was looking for the clip on YouTube of the kid from Wondershosen going,

1310
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,260
that's racist, but I couldn't find it.

1311
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,260
So you'll just have to imagine it in your head.

1312
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,260
I was able to find the white people song, but if you...

1313
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,260
White people having fun.

1314
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,260
Total domination.

1315
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,260
Or global domination over everyone.

1316
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,260
Wondershosen is so fucking hilarious.

1317
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,260
Why did they stop doing that show?

1318
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,260
She still sings the white people song.

1319
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,260
I don't know, she likes the songs on it.

1320
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,260
Animal dance, animal dance.

1321
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:01,260
This is great.

1322
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:06,260
I like the one where they show the tour of the hot dog factory.

1323
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:09,260
I don't think this is the Wondershosen podcast, is it?

1324
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,260
It's not, but I couldn't resist.

1325
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:20,260
Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience.

1326
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,260
Rob, insert, you know, train wrecks.

1327
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:27,260
Alright, god damn. Alright, I'll get to it.

1328
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,260
I'll get to it.

1329
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,260
I know, seriously, we need an off-topic alarm.

1330
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:36,260
I'm looking at this picture that someone in the chat room linked.

1331
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:41,260
It was actdeft that linked it in the chat room.

1332
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:47,260
And it's from Gyakuten Saiban, which is, you know, Phoenix Wright.

1333
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:53,260
And it's two oranges with a banana sticking out of the middle.

1334
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,260
Oh yeah, dark soccer, because you're so good at getting this show back on track.

1335
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,260
I'm talking about a game.

1336
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,260
I don't see what's so funny about citrus roots.

1337
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,260
And it's our chat room that linked it, not me.

1338
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:09,260
That means we have pervs in our chat room.

1339
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,260
I like pervs.

1340
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,260
There need to be more of them in the world.

1341
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,260
Pervs are awesome.

1342
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,260
Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news.

1343
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,260
Hey, I did not derail the show.

1344
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,260
They derailed it with wonder shows and whatever.

1345
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,260
Look, Metal Gear Solid.

1346
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,260
That'll always save a day, right?

1347
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,260
Here's the thing, though.

1348
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,260
It's actually the same old shit, but all over again.

1349
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:38,260
And that is because, apparently, Playasia is taking preorders for a brand new Metal Gear Solid collection.

1350
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,260
That's right, it's the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection.

1351
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:47,260
It'll set you back $34.90, and also $4 shipping and handling.

1352
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:54,260
You will get with it Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 substance, and Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence.

1353
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,260
Woohoo!

1354
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:59,260
Or you can just wait and get it at any retail store for $29.99.

1355
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,260
Or you could just, you know, borrow your friend's copy that they're not playing anymore.

1356
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,260
It has new artwork.

1357
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,260
That's the only difference.

1358
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,260
And, of course, it all looks like the old artwork.

1359
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:15,260
Because this style never changes.

1360
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:21,260
So if you were waiting all this time to get Metal Gear Solid, now's your chance.

1361
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,260
Now's your chance to get it in a couple months.

1362
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,260
Alright, let's move on.

1363
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,260
Can I really?

1364
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,260
And are you going to bring up things that have absolutely nothing to do with video games this time?

1365
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,260
I don't know, we'll see.

1366
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:36,260
Soul Calibur 4!

1367
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,260
They're bringing back three characters.

1368
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,260
Yay, we get Maxie.

1369
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:45,260
Who is cool, but I wish that he'd have his voice actor from the Dreamcast one.

1370
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,260
Because he's actually one of my favorite voice actors.

1371
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,260
And they're bringing back Sungmina and Yunsung.

1372
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,260
So they're all back.

1373
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,260
And two new stages, which one of them is a pirate ship.

1374
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:02,260
Which, I wanted to say there was already a pirate ship in one of the earlier ones, but then it was just piratey music for Cervantes.

1375
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:06,260
And an ice cave.

1376
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:10,260
Dude, Yunsung or whatever his name is is a pirate. That's pretty awesome.

1377
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,260
So is Maxie.

1378
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,260
I like playing this and he's cool.

1379
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,260
Maxie's also a pirate.

1380
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,260
You know what else I have to say about this story, Jamie?

1381
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,260
What?

1382
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,260
Animal Dance!

1383
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,260
All the animals are doing the Animal Dance!

1384
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,260
Animal Dance!

1385
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,260
Animal Dance!

1386
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,260
Animals everywhere!

1387
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,260
Animal Dance!

1388
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,260
Animal Dance!

1389
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,260
Animal Dance!

1390
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,260
Animal Dance!

1391
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,260
Animal Dance!

1392
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,260
Animal Dance!

1393
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,260
Look! Everybody's doing the Animal Dance!

1394
01:11:50,260 --> 01:12:04,260
That's the wonders of Wonderschosen.

1395
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,260
Rob.

1396
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,260
Yes.

1397
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,260
Rob.

1398
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,260
Yes.

1399
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:12,060
You don't even get the full slew of Rob.

1400
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,020
You just get two.

1401
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,780
And Chris threw something at you for me.

1402
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,980
Can we do another story now?

1403
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,980
I'd like to apologize.

1404
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,340
In other news, Rob is random and he's red now.

1405
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,900
To everybody who's tuning into Orange Launch Radio for the first time, I'd like to apologize.

1406
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,820
Did my roommate bring us food?

1407
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,820
You're awesome.

1408
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,560
Do I have to share it?

1409
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,020
You can have two of them.

1410
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,660
I don't want one because I'm full already.

1411
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,660
I ate a whole sandwich.

1412
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,660
Rob.

1413
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,660
All right.

1414
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,660
Thank you, though.

1415
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,660
Then...

1416
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,660
Then...

1417
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,660
Okay.

1418
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:42,660
Hello.

1419
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,660
We're on the air.

1420
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,660
No, I'm just kidding.

1421
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,660
Hey.

1422
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:52,060
If you hadn't seen how off topic we were, you would not be bored.

1423
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,100
We were talking about animal dancing.

1424
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,100
Okay.

1425
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,100
Rob.

1426
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,100
Pass it over.

1427
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,100
Yes.

1428
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,100
All right.

1429
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,100
I'm...

1430
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,100
Low key, please.

1431
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,100
A video game subject or nobody's ever going to listen to the show again.

1432
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,100
All right.

1433
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,900
Well, a Final Fantasy 13 designer promises a demo for the game and promises that the

1434
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,600
game will be out in 2008.

1435
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:18,980
Which means that we'll have it sometime possibly before January 1st of 2009 unless of course

1436
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:22,660
they're going to renege on the whole thing and say, you know what, yeah, we ran into

1437
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,420
some delays.

1438
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,620
So they can tell us whatever we want and that each copy's going to come in case with gold

1439
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,460
and free women.

1440
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:34,380
But, you know.

1441
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,380
Never mind.

1442
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,380
I don't want it anymore.

1443
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,380
How about just loose women?

1444
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,020
Yeah, I definitely don't want it.

1445
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:42,020
Free Loose Women.

1446
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:53,140
That'll be with the, what was it, the Fabula Nova Crystalis collection, which has the dumbest

1447
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,300
name of the series.

1448
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,920
It's called Final Fantasy 13.

1449
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,940
Do we need to go crazier with the name?

1450
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,180
It's worked for Final Fantasy 7, it's worked for Final Fantasy 10, it's worked for Final

1451
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,920
Fantasy 10-2.

1452
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,980
The only thing is, even if this does come out in 2008, which I highly doubt a creator

1453
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:17,140
is promising it or not, it'll come out in 2008 in Japan and it'll take them nine months

1454
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:21,320
to translate it for us.

1455
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,700
What good is this going to do me?

1456
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,700
That's okay though.

1457
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,700
This is all about me.

1458
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,180
I'm sure this is all the news that Sony needs to start playing it in their commercials for

1459
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:33,380
the PS3 to get people hyped up to buy their system.

1460
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:39,500
Although, to their credit though, they did remove Haze from there now and they still

1461
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:45,860
have Metal Gear Solid, which doesn't look like it's coming out in the spring anymore,

1462
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,860
I don't know.

1463
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:52,680
Alright, let's move on so we can try and put this whole segment behind us and get out the

1464
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:58,260
last few stories here, including, speaking of the PlayStation 3, Best Buy is clearing

1465
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,180
out the 80 gigabytes.

1466
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,500
That's right, there is an internal memo going around, quote, the 80 gigabyte version of

1467
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,580
the PlayStation 3 is going closed out and won't be replaced at this time.

1468
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,820
It will come off the planogram on January 28th.

1469
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,760
The 60 gigabyte version should already be gone from stores.

1470
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,760
Only the 40 gigabyte version of PS3 will be sold in Best Buy stores at this time.

1471
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,340
This means that there currently isn't a version that is PS2 compatible.

1472
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,740
At this time, Sony hasn't made any announcements about new products.

1473
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:30,140
And I think as of this recording right now, they have sold out of the 80 gig system.

1474
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,060
It's not even on their website anymore.

1475
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,940
So are they going to, what, is Sony planning to put out a 120 gigabyte version?

1476
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:40,020
How much you want to bet that they're phasing it out and the white PS3 is going to be another

1477
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:44,100
40 gig and then they're going to make a black something or other that's, you know, another

1478
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,100
system.

1479
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,100
Or maybe they're phasing out...

1480
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,280
Does this have to do with the whole thing on a somewhat related note about the cheaper

1481
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,960
Blu-ray lasers now?

1482
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,220
Maybe it might also have to do with the new systems going to have DualShock 3 controllers

1483
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,280
in them now.

1484
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,860
Maybe they're, you know, phasing out the 80 gig systems for that.

1485
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:05,660
Also maybe they're going to stop offering MotorStorm for free, you know, I don't know.

1486
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:10,180
I mean, you know, and even Microsoft's to blame for having a ton of different skews

1487
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,180
for their products.

1488
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:16,220
But seriously, the PlayStation 3 has been very confusing with what's available.

1489
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,160
First it's the 60 and the 20.

1490
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,140
And then the 20 goes away.

1491
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,700
And then it's the 60 and the 80.

1492
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,700
And then, you know...

1493
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,660
They show absolutely no confidence in their product.

1494
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,340
And then the 60 goes away.

1495
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,900
And now it's the 80 and the 40.

1496
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,900
And then the 80's going away.

1497
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,620
And now it's the 40 and God knows what.

1498
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,620
We'll see.

1499
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,620
All right.

1500
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:39,700
Well, anyhow, we're going to bring this Segment A to a close very soon.

1501
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,180
I know it probably couldn't have come at a better time, honestly.

1502
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:48,020
But first, we're going to take a trip down memory lane and close out Part A in a dignified

1503
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,020
manner.

1504
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,020
Because that's what we need to do.

1505
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,940
And we're going to do that by paying a little bit of respect to our elders by taking a moment

1506
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,980
to acknowledge a classic game of the week.

1507
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:02,320
And it comes to us from the one and only, Dark Sakura.

1508
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,940
So what game this week, Dark Sakura?

1509
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:12,380
The game of the week is Akumajo Dracula X Chi No Rondo, which is Dracula X Rondo of Blood.

1510
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,380
And um...

1511
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,380
Nice.

1512
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:19,140
As a lot of people know, it was recently re-released for the PSP.

1513
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:24,340
But I'm not talking about the PSP one.

1514
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,220
And actually, the other clip that I liked had the better music.

1515
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,220
Oh, sorry.

1516
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,220
This one loaded first.

1517
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,220
I played this.

1518
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,220
Yeah.

1519
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,540
The other one in particular, because it was new music that was for that game.

1520
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:39,340
It was the theme Bloodlines, which was the theme of Richter Belmont, which is the character

1521
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:44,020
that they brought in this, who was also in Symphony of the Night, which came out in Japan

1522
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,060
as Nocturne in the Moonlight.

1523
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:50,740
This is the predecessor to that game, because you actually start off Symphony of the Night

1524
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:58,220
as Richter at what's supposed to be the end of this game, when he fights Dracula.

1525
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:06,460
And of course, the music I have linked is from the PC Engine Duo Disc, which was all

1526
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,460
Redbook audio.

1527
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:10,220
You can actually put it in your CD player and listen to it, although it's just the cool

1528
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,220
thing where if you put it...

1529
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,940
Because I don't know if anyone ever did this with Symphony of the Night.

1530
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:17,220
If you put it in your disc and try to listen to it, you get a warning.

1531
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,500
This is a PlayStation Black disc.

1532
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,860
If you listen to the game track, it will blow up speakers.

1533
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:30,460
I had the same thing on the Japanese one, too, on the PC Engine one, which I thought

1534
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,460
was really cool.

1535
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:37,780
But anyway, the game had little animated cut scenes.

1536
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,380
I should say poorly animated cut scenes.

1537
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:47,100
And also, the intro of it was done in German, and for old Listeners Reverse Show, I've actually

1538
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:54,420
brought in my TurboGrafx, because you can play it on the US TurboGrafx, there's no country

1539
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,420
you'd lock out.

1540
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,420
But you can play...

1541
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,420
This is classic Castlevania.

1542
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,180
That was a long time ago.

1543
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:06,860
In fact, if I do remember right, this is Super Castlevania IV, or the last traditional Castlevania

1544
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,340
games that have come out.

1545
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,620
All the rest of them have had that sort of Metroidvania format.

1546
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:16,420
I love that term, Metroidvania.

1547
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:24,740
This particular one, because of how, I guess, relatively rare it was on PC Engine, it's

1548
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,980
really hard to find it for less than 150.

1549
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
I have an original.

1550
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,980
I had burdens for a long time, because my friend had an original.

1551
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:35,660
We got ours because someone owed us 100 bucks and came back from the family game, which

1552
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:39,780
I thought was pretty freaking cool.

1553
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:47,900
It also had, and now this did have a version of it on the Super Nintendo that was not...

1554
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,020
And a lot of people said, oh, it wasn't all that great.

1555
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,500
I actually enjoyed the Super Nintendo one.

1556
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,760
Not me, I don't like it.

1557
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,780
Not compared to the TurboGrafx, or, you know what I mean, this first version, PC Engine.

1558
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:01,540
This one, the cool thing about it is that as you went through, you had different routes

1559
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,300
that your story would take.

1560
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:09,980
Like if you rescued Maria, you can play as her.

1561
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:14,380
As I understand, she was supposed to be playable in Symphony of the Night, as well as two other

1562
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,820
levels that they never completed, but on the Saturn version, you can play as her.

1563
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,320
And all of her attacks are there.

1564
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:30,580
She threw birds for her attack, and her special weapons were a dragon, a kitten, a turtle

1565
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:40,580
shell, and another type of bird that came out, which translated actually to the, I guess,

1566
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:46,300
four major gods in the Saturn version that came out later.

1567
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:53,300
But also she gets this uber cutesy ending, and it was crazy.

1568
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:59,060
The other funny thing about this is that because it had to run on the arcade card 3, if you

1569
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:05,960
didn't have an arcade card 3 in, it actually had Dracula X Stage X, which was done in really

1570
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:15,060
bad sort of rendered looking bubble figures, and it went through all this that way.

1571
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,800
Also a lot of the enemies in this game were original for this one and showed up in a lot

1572
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,820
of the later series too.

1573
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,700
You had the Pikemen, which were I think the most single annoying characters ever.

1574
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,940
They're the ones who stand on the ledge and drop a pike down on you, and they were hard

1575
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:35,180
to get past.

1576
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,820
This game right here to me is the top of the series.

1577
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:47,120
And I think that Symphony of the Night, or not Turn in the Moonlight, it expanded on

1578
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,540
what this game started.

1579
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,540
I'd agree.

1580
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,540
To a point.

1581
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,820
I think Symphony of the Night exceeded it a little bit, but we wouldn't have Symphony

1582
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,740
of the Night if it weren't for this, so you have to respect the elders.

1583
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:07,640
And of all of the series, as far as I'm aware, well these two are linked together.

1584
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:14,140
This one and Symphony of the Night are the only games to carry the actual Dracula X logo.

1585
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,460
I love this from actdeft in chat.

1586
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,860
What is a podcast?

1587
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,940
A miserable little pile of hosts.

1588
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:20,940
But enough of that.

1589
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,940
Have at you.

1590
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,940
Winner.

1591
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:33,340
And it was, there's actually several remixes that were in this one from some of the previous

1592
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:36,700
games too.

1593
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:42,860
Some of the little music clips carried over.

1594
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:49,860
And yeah, this one, if you can find an original, good luck.

1595
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:58,660
But other than that, this is probably, that's a scary little noise that thing makes.

1596
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:05,900
But I'd have to say of all of the, this is probably one of my top five games.

1597
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,900
F.R.

1598
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,900
F.R.

1599
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:13,380
Alright, well, there you have it, your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, Dracula

1600
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,620
X.

1601
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:20,100
I also think the bad guy is funny because his name is Shaft.

1602
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,100
What you talking about?

1603
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,100
Alright.

1604
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,620
He wears a bonnet in Symphony of the Night.

1605
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,640
I think now is a good time for us to take a break.

1606
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,020
So we're going to do that.

1607
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:30,500
Try to get past a little bit of the randomness we've had this segment.

1608
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,980
Although a little randomness is healthy.

1609
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:32,980
Come on.

1610
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,700
If we didn't have the randomness, we'd be just another boring old podcast.

1611
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,700
Same old thing.

1612
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,800
Same old news you can read on the blogs, right?

1613
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,020
Randomness is what makes us us.

1614
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,700
So thanks for sticking with us and the craziness.

1615
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,420
We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1616
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,820
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1617
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,820
a week.

1618
01:23:51,820 --> 01:24:18,340
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
