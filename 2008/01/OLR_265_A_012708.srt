3
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:53,824

00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:25,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fine, how are you doing, Chris?

6
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:27,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

7
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm now, I've had coffee with lots of sugar, and before that we had frozen yogurt with lots of sugar, so I'm getting ready to blow.

8
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You're happy!

9
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:47,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if I'm not mistaking, this may very well be your last appearance on Orange Launch Radio for a little while.

10
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:50,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not like ever, ever, but for a little while, right?

11
00:01:50,183 --> 00:02:01,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to desperately, desperately try to come back here because I've been in, for those of you who do not know, I've been going back and forth from L.A.

12
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,955
[SPEAKER_05]: to my home in the South Bay, Los Gatos, because my grandfather was diagnosed with...

13
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:15,818
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've been kind of being their chauffeur to whatever it is they need and stuff like that.

14
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've kind of been their little slave, which I don't mind.

15
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: But sorry to hear about the family circumstance.

16
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough, I know.

17
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:24,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard, but you know what?

18
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,466
[SPEAKER_05]: People are old and that kind of stuff happens.

19
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:32,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been going back and forth and I'm also moving to...

20
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:40,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Madison, Wisconsin, and March, if all goes according to plan, for school, and I have a girlfriend there, so, pluses.

21
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:49,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gotta be someone very special to get you to move from sunny, warm, wonderful California to, oh my fucking lord, it's cold, Wisconsin.

22
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, the accent is kind of like this, you know.

23
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

24
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you gotta get yourself one of those, that.

25
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you kids have fun.

26
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:02,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys are going to have a lot of fun together.

27
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to be trying to come back more and more.

28
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:04,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You better.

29
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:07,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, actually, we got a new addition to the family.

30
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:08,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

31
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:09,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

32
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:09,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

33
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,530
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad's girlfriend gave birth to a little girl.

34
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

35
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:14,631
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 17th.

36
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:16,292
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to come visit your little sister once in a while.

37
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:16,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

38
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:17,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

39
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:20,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's adorable and crying and driving her mother up the wall.

40
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,397
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes a whole lot, doesn't it?

41
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:23,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

42
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:29,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to games and gaming type conventions for a little bit, are you going to be going to the Chicago convention this year, Asen?

43
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:29,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

44
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:30,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going, Asen.

45
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:34,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, some of our listeners are really trying to get us to go, and I'm going to try to make it happen.

46
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Good!

47
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely will come.

48
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll have an apartment, so you guys are willing to stay.

49
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:39,412
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a pillow fight.

50
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

51
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:42,353
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

52
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,374
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

53
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: The official OLR Battle Royale pillow fight.

54
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:51,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually going to try and get a press pass to see if I can do some interviews for you guys.

55
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really cool idea, which I want to discuss with you later.

56
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those of you who are going to ASUN, I will be there.

57
00:03:55,976 --> 00:04:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be at the art table with my girlfriend Megan and a bunch of other really awesome artists that are going to show up.

58
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

59
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:05,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so look for me.

60
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll have blue hair and stuff.

61
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:08,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very easy to spot.

62
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:12,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.

63
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:17,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't introduced the one and only, let me switch mics with him so he has his normal back, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

64
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:18,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

65
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Loki?

66
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:20,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

67
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished the sandwich.

68
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:26,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry I ignored you for a little bit there, but you know, lesbians cater a little more to our demographic than you do.

69
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:26,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

70
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:28,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

71
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would we be without Loki?

72
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

73
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's a very important part of this show.

74
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You having a good week, Loki?

75
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an okay week.

76
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect World

77
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:18,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Free play, free download, and according to her, it takes everything, and this is her perspective, took everything she hated about World of Warcraft and everything she hated about Guild Wars and removed them and combined the best parts.

78
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:19,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

79
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any examples, like what types of things?

80
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

81
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:23,200
[SPEAKER_06]: She was really drunk.

82
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:24,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

83
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:28,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll know more about it when you're able to get in there.

84
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:29,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice.

85
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:34,709
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, you get certain wear classes, get like pets and like flying pets.

86
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,563
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you have to watch Torchwood.

88
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hottest show on TV.

89
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you realize that this is a Doctor Who spinoff, right?

90
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:32,799
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do.

91
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said.

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you know, it's like a Doctor Who spinoff, right?

93
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I said, one of my friend girls is like obsessed with this.

94
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh, yeah, we like Doctor Who, too.

95
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:41,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, cool.

96
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:45,148
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take Torchwood and rearrange it, it spells Doctor Who.

97
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to some more gaming weeks, I'm assuming you're all finished.

98
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:50,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

99
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: All done.

100
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:52,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

101
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to read some comments from the chat.

102
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:54,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

103
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:55,395
Africa.

104
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.orangemonstradio.com.

105
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,255
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw asks, Sky, next week is the Super Bowl.

106
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be a show by then?

107
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn right there's going to be a show during the Super Bowl.

108
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I could care less about the Super Bowl.

109
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So absolutely we'll be doing a show because you know what?

110
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some folks out there would like to have some alternative programming to the Super Bowl.

111
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:18,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

112
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,104
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

113
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:23,247
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Puppy Bowl.

114
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:24,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do have the Puppy Bowl.

115
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't they have the Kitty Bowl usually, too?

116
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:32,467
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a $25 sushi buffet at the place on that day, and I'm thinking about going.

117
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, nice.

118
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:34,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

119
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,270
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

120
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Other comments from chat.

121
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:37,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

122
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw, just heard that Black Wolf is going to do his show on Saturday next week to the Super Bowl.

123
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's Black Wolf.

124
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:43,715
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Bobby's project.

125
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:44,835
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes sports, though.

126
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby can watch it.

127
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:46,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like my roommate.

128
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure my roommate's going to have some guys over here watching the Super Bowl.

129
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:50,519
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be out here doing our nerdy show.

130
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:51,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back to games.

131
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

132
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,091
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was pretty much just burnout paradise.

133
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I played countless hours of it.

134
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:08,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's not countless because I took a look at my stats there and I actually have ten and a half hours put into it.

135
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's awesome.

136
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep finding new things in there.

137
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I found quite a bit of the hidden stuff.

138
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I have almost all the jumps done and

139
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:39,877
[SPEAKER_02]: About half the billboards and half the smashes And I'm working to get my class A license And haven't played online yet Because the servers were giving me crap earlier this week So I just kind of avoided them But I may try some online stuff a little later Huh, it's fun though

140
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to play me online?

141
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:42,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got my copy.

142
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:43,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

143
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,113
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll kill me, but that's alright.

144
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:45,914
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'll be fun.

145
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:49,396
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff you can do, like co-op, challenges and stuff.

146
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:51,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that might be fun.

147
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:55,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a Vectrex.

148
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you won the Vectrex that you were talking about last week, huh?

149
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

150
00:08:58,761 --> 00:08:59,342
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that go?

151
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:00,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It went okay.

152
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:05,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on my desk now, and people are like, oh my god, I remember that!

153
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:10,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, to be honest, it's just kind of a desk piece, you know, I don't really play much on it.

154
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I did try, you know, some of the games that came with it.

155
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:21,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek, the game, I understand it about as much as I understood it before, which is not very much.

156
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that game at all.

157
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play Frenzy, though.

158
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:27,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called Frenzy.

159
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:28,699
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Berserk, I'm sorry.

160
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Same game, though.

161
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Berserk.

162
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:32,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hyperchase Space Mines

163
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:58,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to leave it at my desk and people can come by and take a look at it and have some sort of demo loop.

164
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:03,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of those games ever had a demo loop and it also makes a really annoying buzzing sound.

165
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, crap, I can't do that.

166
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just turned it on when people wanted to take a look at it.

167
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, one of the controllers is broken so I had to fix that.

168
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can get a new controller for like $10 if I really want to.

169
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,693
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually make quite a few games.

170
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,214
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still making games for that system.

171
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:18,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

172
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:19,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.

173
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:20,935
[SPEAKER_02]: All homebrew stuff, of course.

174
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's new carts coming out

175
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,923
[SPEAKER_02]: as of last year still, so, I mean, that's kind of neat, I guess.

176
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:33,305
[SPEAKER_02]: A complete waste of money, but it's neat, you know, nonetheless.

177
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:34,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have.

178
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see, what else did I get?

179
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten it yet, but I have a copy of, God, I don't remember what it's called now.

180
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:51,793
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the bit generation titles, but that one's coming.

181
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I get to play that this week.

182
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:55,513
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, what else?

183
00:10:55,713 --> 00:11:02,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got, I'm actually planning on selling my Sega Saturns because I found an emulator that works perfectly on my computer.

184
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know you had a Sega Saturn.

185
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:05,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two.

186
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:05,916
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

187
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:06,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

188
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:07,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

189
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I bought them at a garage, or not a garage sale, at a Denios flea market because for some reason I wanted to play Panzer Dragoons Wii because I thought, oh my god, it was so awesome, I love that game.

190
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back and played it and I'm like, wow, this wasn't very good at all.

191
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:24,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that.

192
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a stall and some other stuff.

193
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's okay.

194
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But since now that I have something that will actually play them on the PC, I don't really need them anymore.

195
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this local game shop, which I've been meaning to go to for weeks now, called Fair Game.

196
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:47,927
[SPEAKER_02]: They carry all the vintage stuff, everything from the Vectrex up through PlayStation 3 stuff.

197
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully they will...

198
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Be able to, uh, I don't know, buy that.

199
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have games with it.

200
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:58,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember which games, so I have like two copies of Madden 97 for some reason.

201
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:07,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bug 2, a Knights demo, and like some other stuff, Machine Head, and I don't know.

202
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I don't know, maybe I can put it on eBay though.

203
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:12,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool.

204
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Saints Row, as usual.

205
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and, I think I mentioned it, but not during the show.

206
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,335
[SPEAKER_02]: My another 360 died.

207
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,217
[SPEAKER_02]: My another another one red ringed.

208
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:27,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I had one that was starting to freeze up on me.

209
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:34,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured, OK, I'm going to cut it off the pass and just put a new heat sink on it so that it'll work better.

210
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, put the new heat sink on it.

211
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really fix anything.

212
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:44,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I tried pulling the heat sink off again and maybe applying a little more thermal grease on spots that may have missed some.

213
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:47,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a big empty spot on there.

214
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went ahead and put some thermal grease on there.

215
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Reset it all back on there.

216
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, it three rings on me.

217
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, crap.

218
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:57,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can't fix that one.

219
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to hit it with blunt objects until it works.

220
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it won't work, and who gives a crap because I still have five.

221
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted six because my boss wants to play again.

222
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:12,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had someone else join us up when he was busy doing something else.

223
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So now someone's taking his place.

224
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But he wants to play again.

225
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

226
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, soon as you lose.

227
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You always have busy gaming weeks.

228
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You manage to play a lot.

229
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:23,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I try.

230
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we play at work.

231
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We play Saints Row.

232
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky you.

233
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could play Xbox at work.

234
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:34,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Saints Row and lots of Burnout Paradise because that game, you know, it's really crazy.

235
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this week I would have been playing some No More Heroes, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.

236
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet, but soon.

237
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,833
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know if I'm going to get around to it anytime soon either because next week is Smash Bros.,

238
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Japanese one, yeah.

239
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we'll have that.

240
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

241
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,371
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to give us your thoughts.

242
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's keep it moving.

243
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Chris.

244
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Chris, if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week, but let's hear it.

245
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:03,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, aside from playing WoW, which I seem to be doing on a regular basis now.

246
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Addict.

247
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

248
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have no room to talk whatsoever.

249
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:12,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I heard you just got a 70, so... I wouldn't say just got, but yeah.

250
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:13,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

251
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I've been kind of out of it, so...

252
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:16,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing World of Warcraft.

253
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:18,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a character up to level 24 now.

254
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock.

255
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody start somewhere.

256
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're a Draenei, huh?

257
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,458
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm actually, I don't have.

258
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just now started getting into, because Megan is starting to play, and she's got all of her friends playing.

259
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of them have, like, epics.

260
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:34,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

261
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm learning now what they're learning.

262
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm, like, hearing all this shit, like, farm it.

263
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, I'm farming.

264
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know for the longest time what that meant.

265
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,962
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all, you gotta start somewhere.

266
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:47,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I gotta, you know, because I was just a casual player.

267
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:53,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go, like, for hours on end, you know, just playing, and I'm like, shut up.

268
00:14:55,071 --> 00:15:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to look more like a noob than I already am, but it was, you know, so I just finally, you know, I'm starting to get more into it, but I don't have, like, a main.

269
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So wait, do you hoarder alliance now?

270
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:08,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.

271
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:09,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Both?

272
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a main, I just switch back and forth.

273
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:12,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Horde is better.

274
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,473
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make your main a horde.

275
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:17,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Megzi's main is a gnome, so to play with her... Oh my god!

276
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:18,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up!

277
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:33,480
[SPEAKER_05]: To play with her, I made a gnome, but the problem is that I'm like ten levels lower than her, so playing with her in that is kind of stupid, so I keep making more characters to try and play with her because she keeps making more characters and it's just not working.

278
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um...

279
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:41,230
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, aside from that, I did a lot of D&D stuff, so that makes me happy.

280
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

281
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to... Old school kind of gaming.

282
00:15:45,093 --> 00:16:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got like maybe four or five friends in LA that have always, have like, oh, we need to run a game, we need to run a game, and so I finally caved in and started making an adventure, because I don't like all the new, the pre-made ones, so I've been working on that a lot, and I freaking am annoyed at 4th edition that's coming out, but

283
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:05,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

284
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And people need to make me happy.

285
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:07,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm important.

286
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

287
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:26,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

288
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:28,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you may, Rob.

289
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,732
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, I actually took a little bit of a break from WoW.

290
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:36,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been playing some, but I went back to another type of RPG that I just missed.

291
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:43,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched it in a while, and I decided to go back and play some Oblivion because I love that game because you can just run around and do nothing.

292
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Seinfeld of video games.

293
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to ignore the main plot and just do whatever you want, you can.

294
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:50,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.

295
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you playing that this week.

296
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:52,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

297
00:16:52,945 --> 00:17:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And I decided last time I did a fighter type, so this time I went like, I just went all out mage because I'm having a lot of fun summoning creatures to do my bidding and throwing fireballs at people.

298
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:03,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

299
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:06,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I can't do damage for crap, so like if I get attacked, I'm screwed.

300
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I create an army to go after people.

301
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:09,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

302
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:10,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Oblivion.

303
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:15,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V. I never get past the towns because I'm too busy, you know,

304
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Violating the animals, punching the horses so they get pissed off.

305
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the townsfolk don't look too kindly upon that.

306
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still fun.

307
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, not a whole lot.

308
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pretty much just been that has taken up a lot of my gaming week.

309
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had this random oblivion splurge.

310
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,134
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have been playing Burnout Paradise a little bit.

311
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:42,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough to give a full review on just yet, but I do notice it's kind of like Test Drive and Burnout mixed together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

312
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:42,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

313
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:43,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little different.

314
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

315
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like the structure of the old Burnout games.

316
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how I feel about this whole open world thing.

317
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little weird, but I'm giving it a shot.

318
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:55,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't taken it online either, which I hear is the best part, so we'll wait.

319
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I do find it interesting, though, that it interacts with the camera to, like, take your picture and stuff.

320
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of strange.

321
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:02,752
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

322
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:09,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's talk a little bit about housekeeping, and then we are going to get into tonight's gaming news.

323
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:15,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight in housekeeping, just a reminder, we are now broadcasting simulcasting on Justin.TV.

324
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So a big hello to all the people who are watching us right now on Justin.TV.

325
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:19,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Justin.TV channel is...

326
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,863
[SPEAKER_03]: www.justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio

327
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:45,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But JustinTV is interesting because you can kind of see us even when the mics aren't hot, so it's kind of fun.

328
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that over at JustinTV.

329
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:53,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, next week on the show, an Orange Lounge Radio first.

330
00:18:53,318 --> 00:19:00,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, what may be, I'm not sure, I don't want to stake the claim to this, but what may be a video game podcast first, actually.

331
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the show, we are going to have...

332
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire

333
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:41,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found out she was local to us, so we sent her an email and said, Hey, this might seem a little random, but do you want to come on our little podcast and sing the song for us?

334
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, sure!

335
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:46,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's going to be here next week doing her cover of Still Alive, live here in studio.

336
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OLR first musical guest, and we're very excited.

337
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,504
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to be a guinea pig for that whole thing.

338
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:55,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool, and we're very excited.

339
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:59,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so she'll be here in studio next week, and...

340
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:01,929
[SPEAKER_03]: and as will the rest of us here.

341
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we have any other guests scheduled for the next few weeks.

342
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get the chocolate rain guy at some point?

343
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to get the chocolate rain guy.

344
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:13,351
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the YouTube celeb we're going to get in the studio and then we've got to look for people from other places.

345
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

346
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one day I want Dragon Force here in the studio.

347
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:19,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ultimate dream.

348
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:22,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

349
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll fly in from... Yeah, that's right.

350
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so complete.

351
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:29,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a

352
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,743
[SPEAKER_02]: See you at our Wayne's World right there.

353
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

354
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

355
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:33,684
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

356
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:34,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

357
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why is the chat room saying they should get the Chocolate Rain guy?

358
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:38,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

359
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,129
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell does the Chocolate Rain guy have to do with video games?

360
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:41,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

361
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Amixia sings about, you know, she does a cover of Still Alive.

362
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,492
[SPEAKER_03]: She's video game related.

363
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate Rain has nothing to do with video games.

364
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually.

365
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:49,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is funny.

366
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:51,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this, I will say this.

367
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:59,818
[SPEAKER_03]: An old friend of Orange Lounge Radio is experiencing a little bit of internet fame of his own, I guess speaking of people who have said they will come on the show.

368
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,740
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a remix of this guy from American Idol.

369
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Rinaldo LaPaz was his name.

370
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: He did this song called We Are Brothers Forever, and it was kind of one of those things you laugh.

371
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:13,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this kid Justin, who we knew from like years ago playing DDR, he did a remix of it.

372
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:16,925
My father still be here.

373
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: This has nothing to do with video games, but you can't help but admit that thing's got to be DDR inspired.

374
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:27,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he did that, and I emailed him.

375
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, when are you going to come on the show again?

376
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:30,505
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, like, famous and stuff.

377
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:31,165
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to come back.

378
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:35,667
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he would come back and talk games with us and maybe show us some more remixes.

379
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

380
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran into him in a line for a movie.

381
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:38,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

382
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:39,689
[SPEAKER_06]: A few weeks ago.

383
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:42,290
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like a couple months ago, but I don't remember what movie we were seeing.

384
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

385
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,152
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

386
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, lots of things to look forward to on Orange Lounge Radio coming up.

387
00:21:50,962 --> 00:21:52,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

388
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, please take us to video game chat, because obviously we're having problems with that tonight.

389
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:05,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, there's a big old stink this week having to do with Fox News and Mass Effect.

390
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:18,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they aired a little segment called Sex Box, and they were talking about how Mass Effect featured full digital character nudity and had explicit sex and all this stuff.

391
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know,

392
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:23,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone that's played Mass Effect knows that that's completely false.

393
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But nonetheless, though, they were on there.

394
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:37,908
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually had a, I don't know, an expert, I'd say a psychology expert or something, who was kind of pimping out her book.

395
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:46,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, also in defense, they had Jeff Knightley, who was basically from EA.

396
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it Jeff Keighley?

397
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Keighley, Knightley, whatever.

398
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Knightley is Kira Knightley.

399
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,351
[SPEAKER_03]: She's Pirates of the Caribbean.

400
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:50,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Keighley.

401
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:53,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Caribbean, Caribbean, whatever.

402
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, we pronounce stuff good.

403
00:22:57,154 --> 00:23:00,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned it how to read.

404
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned it on Orange Lounge.

405
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:12,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so all you need to know is that basically they went back and forth for about 30 seconds talking about this game.

406
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:19,064
[SPEAKER_02]: The psychologist and the host hadn't played the game, but yet they were still claiming all this stuff.

407
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:26,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, as the week progressed, I went kind of crazy.

408
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:30,974
[SPEAKER_02]: First, EA was saying they're pissed off that all this stuff was said.

409
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,976
[SPEAKER_02]: This is complete outright lies.

410
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: They want a correction from Fox to basically fess up to not having played the game and just making up lies off the cuff.

411
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:43,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

412
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:54,598
[SPEAKER_02]: of course Fox said no we're not going to do a correction but hey you can come on to one of our shows again and to which basically they said fuck off

413
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, apparently the woman, of course, the psychologist, she has a book called The Cult of Perfection, and it happened to be on Amazon.

414
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, gamers got pissed off, and they, of course, realized, hey, her book's on there.

415
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:16,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they left her a bunch of negative reviews, clearly stating that they had not read her book, but that it's inappropriate for minors.

416
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:17,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing that got me.

417
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that funny, Chris.

418
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:25,169
[SPEAKER_06]: All those negative reviews have been removed, the ones that gamers left.

419
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

420
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:48,968
[SPEAKER_02]: What's left, though, is still negative reviews.

421
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't good to begin with.

422
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

423
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:59,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually started reading some of the book, and as I'm reading it, I'm going, why was she invited to talk about video games?

424
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Her book has nothing to do.

425
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:06,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're going to bring on someone to dog video games, fucking...

426
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:13,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You know which attention whore whose initials start with J and T will be there at the drop of the hat to come talk about video games and bash them.

427
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:13,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

428
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:14,925
[SPEAKER_03]: At least call him.

429
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

430
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:19,870
[SPEAKER_02]: He was too busy chasing an ambulance, you know, so... Apparently.

431
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

432
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, you know, like I said...

433
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,614
[SPEAKER_02]: They trashed her book on Amazon, or all of her books.

434
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:28,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently she has a few books, and they all suck.

435
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:33,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Including, Ben there done that, kept the jewelry, and the fixer-upper man.

436
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:36,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is talking about how all men are fixer-uppers.

437
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's awesome.

438
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta wonder, I mean, don't get me wrong, she is pretty hot.

439
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give you that.

440
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: She is pretty hot.

441
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:47,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

442
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:48,717
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she's not.

443
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:53,659
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got a fucked up nose, and she's got that pose that looks like it's post-metapause.

444
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever, okay?

445
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she's a deranged woman.

446
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:02,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so... She clearly sounds retarded.

447
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:04,844
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, I don't know if you're going to cover this.

448
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm cutting you off.

449
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:06,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

450
00:26:07,146 --> 00:26:08,586
[SPEAKER_03]: She retracted her statement.

451
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,427
[SPEAKER_03]: She retracted... I was just getting there.

452
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:16,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the author, Cooper Lawrence, did retract her statement saying that

453
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, I, she really regrets that, seeing that, and now seeing, seeing the game's, uh, sex scenes, seeing it's kind of a joke, you know, she's seeing more explicit sexual content on Lost than, um, you know, this game, so.

454
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:37,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Or other Fox programming, such as 24, Family Guy, which had a whole thing about side boob, if I remember right.

455
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:40,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, it's my side boob.

456
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um.

457
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you see in Mass Effect is a little side boob.

458
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:45,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

459
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, not to be left out, Adam Sessler actually gave his opinion on the whole thing, and I thought he actually phrased it quite well.

460
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus one respect from me for him.

461
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,026
[SPEAKER_02]: From one nerdy white guy to another.

462
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:00,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

463
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:07,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I think he's kind of a tool, but actually, he wasn't bad.

464
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:09,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

465
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he made his point quite nicely, and

466
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,621
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

467
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair and balanced, my big fat ass.

468
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

469
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:41,456
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't even a political thing.

470
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: This has nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal.

471
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,203
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just about, that was the most piss-poorly researched thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

472
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:49,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the roundtable discussion?

473
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:50,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, oh my god.

474
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:51,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, any thoughts?

475
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:56,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know if you'd already heard about this.

476
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:57,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted this in my LJ.

477
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:00,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I posted the entire interview.

478
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:05,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like the retardedness of these people just blew my head off.

479
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:09,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like they're like saying, God, I can't remember now.

480
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:14,540
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just like, you know, I don't want my child to have to be subject to this.

481
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And like totally going off on, I don't remember what they said now.

482
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was just like.

483
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:27,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't, I just, no, literally one of them was like, I just can't believe that we as parents have to monitor everything our children play.

484
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,447
Oh, God, yeah, exactly.

485
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:37,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, I'll, I'll, I'll, I have this direct from my LJ, I'll just write, or I'll just read off kind of the part I said.

486
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: As for the Blom, Bimbo, I know being a parent is hard, and you just magically get pregnant and are forced to care for a baby that you had no responsibility in creating at all.

487
00:28:48,214 --> 00:29:16,700
[SPEAKER_02]: and there is all sorts of bad stuff coming from places like the interwebs and video games but do us all a favor and attempt to sound a little more mature when you say that simply monitoring what your child sees is a much harder job I know a lot of these adults are playing video games and stuff but you know when those adults are gone they're playing their parents' video games I'm like, why don't you fucking put the parental protection or codes and stuff on there

488
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,861
[SPEAKER_02]: to fix that.

489
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:23,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, since you're aware that they're going to be playing your games, why don't you, I don't know, solve the problem?

490
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:28,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just one of the most journalistically irresponsible things I've ever seen in my entire life.

491
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:35,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should all be ashamed of themselves for having their names attached to that piece, except for Jeff Keighley, which, you know, obviously was the only one that knew what he was talking about.

492
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,254
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one that knew anything about games, honestly.

493
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I laugh when he's like, have you played this game?

494
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:44,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, but I've watched videos on... He knew going in, he knew, well, to his credit...

495
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, he's a smart guy.

496
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:48,785
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a well-respected journalist in the industry and everything.

497
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:53,112
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably knew going into this, he's like, Fox News wants me to talk about video games?

498
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:54,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know what's going to happen.

499
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:55,135
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew.

500
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew somebody was going to come on there that didn't know their shit.

501
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: He had enough

502
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart's to have the foresight.

503
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could tell that was his first question right out the gate.

504
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:10,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then my favorite, they're all, well, they're all, you know, finding the ratings is so hard, you know, you have to look on the back of the box and it's not there.

505
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, you're wrong.

506
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:16,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the front of the box and on the back of the box, so you're an idiot.

507
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:22,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas on a movie poster, it's a tiny little thing at the very bottom of the poster.

508
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

509
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ratings... But that's okay.

510
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,936
[SPEAKER_02]: The ratings on movies are all on the back of the box.

511
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:33,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one rating is on the front of the box unless it's, of course, pimping out that it's an unrated director's cut or something like that.

512
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:40,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just disgusting and hypocritical when Fox Television runs all the stuff that's way more pornographic than Mass Effect could ever be.

513
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:44,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually kind of a shame because Mass Effect should have been a little more pornographic.

514
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, it's beside the point.

515
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:45,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

516
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:50,713
[SPEAKER_03]: But Fox TV, like, you know, you see way worse things on there.

517
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:58,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, everybody involved from Fox News with that little piece needs to come on the TV and apologize for being an asshat.

518
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I will accept nothing less.

519
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:06,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that blondie to come out and say, I, blondie, apologize to the world for being an asshat.

520
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:07,502
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.

521
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:10,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll never happen.

522
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that, Chris?

523
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:14,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start studying psychology.

524
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,386
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I want to do with my life.

525
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:19,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just love the psychologist that came on.

526
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,612
[SPEAKER_05]: She was discussing the psychologies of...

527
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,652
[SPEAKER_05]: All the, you know, children see this and they think it's real.

528
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they don't.

529
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:34,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games and any sort of entertainment, this does not count.

530
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:42,481
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if your child is going off and killing people because of video games, psychologically, that's not the video game's fault.

531
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because your child is mentally unstable.

532
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:46,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess whose fucking fault that is?

533
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:47,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fault.

534
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,486
[SPEAKER_05]: The parents' fault.

535
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It all stems back from the parents.

536
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:55,050
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they were probably going through the first stage of development and they fucked up majorly.

537
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I just love it when these people sit there and tell you, it's like, you know, video games and all this stuff, it's...

538
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:03,602
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hurting our children.

539
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:10,706
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, there are mental conditions that could be, but that's usually outside the norm.

540
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these kids on Maury Povich who are out of control and stuff, that's the parents.

541
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:31,520
[SPEAKER_05]: That's again, if it is a psychological disorder that requires medication, again, I give that back to, yeah, that's not the parent's fault that their child is like that because there's a chemical imbalance that's going on, but the parent needs to be responsible enough

542
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,046
[SPEAKER_05]: to understand that and take them to the proper doctors and explain to them the proper, you know...

543
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:43,781
[SPEAKER_05]: It all stems back to your responsibility as a parent of what you want your child to see and do.

544
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we've got to stop giving Fox News so much attention here on this program.

545
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to respond to some stuff in chat here.

546
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:51,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.orangehauntradio.com, some comments.

547
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:57,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross DLUT says, Sky, you have to understand that Fox News is struggling to get beyond its little niche of right-wing shitheads.

548
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,295
[SPEAKER_03]: They're nothing more than a bottom-run cable networks.

549
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:03,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Their ratings are probably lower than Lifetime and Spike.

550
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:04,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

551
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Binary667 says, what do you have against Blondie?

552
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some quality music.

553
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously when I say Blondie, I'm not saying Debra Harry has to come apologize.

554
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:15,423
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't do anything.

555
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: If Debra Harry has to apologize for anything, have her apologize for the Blondie Reunion album.

556
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:21,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, that's besides the point.

557
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:22,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who I'm talking about.

558
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about Debra Harry.

559
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:24,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

560
00:33:25,348 --> 00:33:30,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal Combat says, Fox News, you are not the father.

561
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:47,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly enough, if there was an argument or something like on Springer or Moripovich or something like that, it would actually probably be more intelligent than what's on Fox News right now.

562
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:55,180
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we got to get back to some happier topics, things that won't make us so damn angry.

563
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,681
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we hadn't have done this right out the gate, we'd probably be doing the FUs right about now, but we'll have to save those for later.

564
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about something happy.

565
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get some happy news here to make us forget this whole Fox debacle.

566
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:10,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez HD, that's a nice happy subject, right?

567
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:11,424
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's even better?

568
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:14,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it is very possible this game is coming out this week.

569
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially a lot of people seem to think so, are convinced.

570
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:21,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it's going to come out this month, and I think this is the last week left.

571
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:24,775
[SPEAKER_03]: There is that, and then also there was a quote from Q Entertainment.

572
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:28,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, the game is being prepped, and it's just waiting for the green light.

573
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next week?

574
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, basically, Q Entertainment is just saying, we're done.

575
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:35,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there, waiting to go.

576
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just waiting for someone at Microsoft to push the button.

577
00:34:39,164 --> 00:35:07,445
[SPEAKER_03]: that will be very happy when Rez HD I'll just, you know, I'll have that on my TV all the time and we'll never have a need to put my TV on Fox News ever again well I was reading, they had an interview with Mizuguchi about how to play it with the other controllers and stuff they said put one on your feet, put one on your back or something like that and I don't know what to do with the third one put it in a happy place put it in the spot that most suits you

578
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:08,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just leave it at that.

579
00:35:08,888 --> 00:35:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jamie?

580
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

581
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, some people are desperate.

582
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there is a contest going on in the UK.

583
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:26,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft is having some Halo fans to make videos about Master Chief in everyday situations that do not involve Halo.

584
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they win, then they will be accepted.

585
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:36,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they will get to go to a film school for a month in L.A.,

586
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,486
[SPEAKER_06]: for special lessons.

587
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:49,029
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use a video camera, you can use the game itself, animation, however you want to do it.

588
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:55,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It just has to be Master Chief in a situation apart from the Halo universe.

589
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:57,692
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for European gamers over 18.

590
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:02,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Submissions are to be in between January 31st and March 21st this year.

591
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an idea, kids.

592
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:10,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you win with this idea, you only have to, you know, credit me.

593
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:14,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Chief responding to this Fox News story.

594
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:15,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

595
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:21,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for anyone who's interested in it, it's Halo Recut is what the contest is called.

596
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:27,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at xbox.com slash en-gb slash halorecut, all one word.

597
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:29,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to check it out.

598
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope somebody we know wins it.

599
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck to all of you.

600
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:33,677
[SPEAKER_06]: If you win it, send us an email.

601
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:34,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

602
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:37,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll interview you.

603
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:47,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Another first-person shooter game that's pretty fun, Team Fortress 2 is going to be getting some unlockable weapons and new game modes pretty soon, which is pretty awesome.

604
00:36:47,891 --> 00:37:02,957
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first earned weapons, I guess, is going to be for the medic, and it's an overhealer, which apparently I believe is a tool you can use to give a temporary boost to your other player's health up to 150%.

605
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is also part of the balancing that Valve is doing.

606
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:18,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also going to be talking about some other unlockable weapons, including a healing ray and some other stuff.

607
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:26,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they were going to be introducing a new map, Gold Rush, and there's going to be another one coming out as well called Badlands.

608
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:30,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a remake, I guess, of an older map called Badlands.

609
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:43,836
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically in Gold Rush the blue team must escort a mining cart through tunnels and the cart moves faster with the more blue team members nearby but stops completely if a red player gets near.

610
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:45,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

611
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:49,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they're mixing it up and supporting the game well after it's come out.

612
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to it.

613
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:54,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always good to see a game get a lot of love and

614
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't Laugh

615
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:18,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But so when you actually point at the skeleton, it says Bunny's Skeleton.

616
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:23,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Like almost like it was built so that at one point it was going to have a multiplayer environment.

617
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:23,806
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

618
00:38:24,187 --> 00:38:25,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Like why would it need to say it's my skeleton?

619
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't it just say your skeleton or Conjured's skeleton?

620
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:31,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, they could just re-release the game with multiplayer built into it.

621
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,090
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably will.

622
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like how they do with like Twisted Metal, Black Online or something like that.

623
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:41,135
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be how they try to hold us over for Elder Scrolls V. That'd be cool.

624
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

625
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:42,815
[SPEAKER_03]: www.ihalostats.com

626
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:15,290
[SPEAKER_02]: think of how awesome I'll be in bed think about it

627
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

628
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:20,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a little disclaimer right there on the website.

629
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:25,050
[SPEAKER_03]: ihalostats.com is not affiliated with Bungie, LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

630
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is something completely fan-made.

631
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And to their credit, you know what, even if I think this is a little, I don't know, useless, it's kind of cool in that, you know, hey, somebody had a weird idea and kind of built this whole thing, and it seems to run pretty well.

632
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:44,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to them for seeing their strange idea through to completion, if that makes any sense at all.

633
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:45,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

634
00:39:47,424 --> 00:40:02,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for more gaming news, for anyone who is a fan of Condemned, Condemned 2 comes out on March 11th, according to Sega, and it's gory and violent and weird.

635
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means I'm going to go pre-order down right now, right?

636
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:07,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't.

637
00:40:08,129 --> 00:40:10,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the first one was kind of, it was just freaky.

638
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a serial killer type game, you know?

639
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:19,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I think about it, we did start Condemned, but I don't think that after a little bit of it, I was too much into it afterwards.

640
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: All you need to know about Condemned 2, and I can sell it to you in one sentence.

641
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:23,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Meat hooks.

642
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It has exploding babies.

643
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Loki?

644
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:32,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That might have done it, actually.

645
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:33,305
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

646
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:34,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Exploding babies?

647
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:36,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking at this picture of a guy with a meat hook.

648
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:39,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it a boom?

649
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:43,672
Why are they exploding?

650
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:45,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

651
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody exploded them?

652
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:47,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

653
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:48,716
[SPEAKER_03]: How old are they?

654
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:50,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're babies, I mean.

655
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:51,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris.

656
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

657
00:40:54,281 --> 00:41:03,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I just came from a household where there was just a weak old infant in my arms holding these exploding babies.

658
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:04,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

659
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't judge me.

660
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least it wasn't ticking.

661
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:06,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's...

662
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my advice, Chris.

663
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:10,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't play Condemned 2.

664
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of other video games out there for your enjoyment.

665
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:14,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you play?

666
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, Chris, I want you to go get a game.

667
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:18,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Imagine Babies.

668
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:19,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it in my backpack.

669
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:26,645
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing but happy babies, rainbows, diaper changing.

670
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:27,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

671
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:31,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the glory of having babies.

672
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:35,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first time I changed a diaper in my life and I really enjoyed it.

673
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:37,750
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different type of exploding baby.

674
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm breaking out the DS right now.

675
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not like that.

676
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:45,032
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Condemned 2, now with exploding babies.

677
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy, March 11th.

678
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:51,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's another game I'm looking forward to, far more than Condemned 2.

679
00:41:51,374 --> 00:42:04,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that would be Grand Theft Auto 4, and the announcement that it was actually coming out this spring instead of the end of this year, or possibly not this year, that's just all sorts of awesome.

680
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dated now for April 29th.

681
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:15,840
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will be coming out of course on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well as a special edition which I already have pre-ordered and I can't wait.

682
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing though, Rockstar was commenting on why it's been delayed and they said of course one of the contributing factors was that they had some technical challenges with the PlayStation 3 version.

683
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course they wouldn't go into what the challenges were.

684
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's not an issue anymore because both versions are now neck and neck in their development phases.

685
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:43,340
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just having problems getting the hookers just right in the PlayStation 3 version.

686
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:52,525
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically said it's really no surprise to anyone that the PS3 was definitely a contributing factor to the delay.

687
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go back to the last story because this is too good.

688
00:42:55,827 --> 00:43:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: In our chat room, Ekam, which is just Mike spelled backwards, says, Imagine Exploding Babies coming to a DS near you.

689
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:07,577
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Exploding Babies are in the trailer for the game.

690
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:11,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So watch the trailer for the game and you will see the Exploding Babies.

691
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, don't watch the trailer for Condemned 2, please.

692
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, this is too cute.

693
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:18,405
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually playing Imagine Babies here in studio?

694
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

695
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:20,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, get that filth out of my house.

696
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:22,969
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

697
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to play Loki.

698
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:25,441
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave it to me.

699
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:26,942
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you should be playing?

700
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:32,245
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is a wonderful game on Xbox Live called Every Extend to Extra Extreme.

701
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is pretty awesome, and it's on PSP as well.

702
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:43,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The only gripe I have with the Xbox Live one is that the game doesn't get a whole lot of variety in it in the basic modes.

703
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:47,954
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have quite the same hypnotic backgrounds that the PSP one had in the...

704
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The skins don't change that much.

705
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:56,039
[SPEAKER_03]: But to make up for that lack of variety, to Q Entertainment's credit, they have the custom tracks mode in the game.

706
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:57,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people forget about this.

707
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually play Every Extent Extra Extreme with your own custom tracks.

708
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:04,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, the problem with the mode this week is that it wasn't perfect.

709
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:11,969
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either manually put in the BPM or you can tap it out to get the beats per second or beats per minute or what have you.

710
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,751
[SPEAKER_03]: But you couldn't exactly fine-tune it.

711
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:21,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Until now, Q Entertainment has released a code that will allow you to make a fine adjustment to your custom music.

712
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And you better write this one down because it's very complicated.

713
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very complicated code to remember.

714
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:25,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here you go.

715
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:27,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the code.

716
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:31,434
[SPEAKER_03]: At the start menu, you're going to use the left and right triggers to put in this code.

717
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:31,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

718
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your pencils ready.

719
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:33,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

720
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:43,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

721
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Think you can handle that?

722
00:44:45,831 --> 00:44:46,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

723
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:46,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

724
00:44:47,553 --> 00:44:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: What was after left?

725
00:44:49,214 --> 00:44:49,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

726
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:50,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

727
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:52,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So there it is.

728
00:44:53,758 --> 00:45:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just have a Q Entertainment overload this week if you want to do this fine-tuning mode and then res HD and hell, you can play 99 Nights while you're at it if you want to play a bad Q Entertainment game.

729
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Night and Nights wasn't that bad.

730
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:26,657
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to stick to the puzzle music games.

731
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:28,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not deviate from the puzzle music games.

732
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:33,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, can you imagine if 99 Nights had some sort of musical beat thing to it?

733
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, Rez?

734
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:41,184
[SPEAKER_03]: All you had to do, yeah, seriously, to make 99 Nights cooler, all you had to do was be slashing people to techno music.

735
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would have been the coolest game ever.

736
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:45,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't want to kill people to bad techno music?

737
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

738
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:47,087
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty awesome.

739
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:48,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Something mixing Dynasty Warriors with Rez.

740
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:53,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, I would totally play that.

741
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Exploding babies in time with the music?

742
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, be fun.

743
00:45:57,534 --> 00:46:05,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of wrong, but you know, if you want to be abstract, then sure, go the space draft route, you know.

744
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,105
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do weasel stomping mode.

745
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad says, Gunpei is god.

746
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:12,909
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the few Q Entertainment games I haven't played is Gunpei.

747
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:13,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Gunpei is great.

748
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it's pretty good.

749
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says, Rob, don't forget Meteos Disney Magic.

750
00:46:17,913 --> 00:46:19,234
[SPEAKER_03]: That's worse than 99 Nights.

751
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:22,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed the original Meteos actually quite a bit.

752
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play the Disney one.

753
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play Disney Meteos?

754
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it been played before, but I thought it was cute.

755
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:34,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm a Disney freak, so look at my online screen named Disney Punk 10.

756
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:35,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

757
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

758
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:38,851
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

759
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:40,592
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some release dates?

760
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel the globe and find out what's coming soon to a retail store near you.

761
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with Europe.

762
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need release, Rob?

763
00:46:48,518 --> 00:46:49,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to answer that.

764
00:46:51,020 --> 00:47:01,347
[SPEAKER_06]: How about on the 30th we get Chess Master Live on Xbox 360 and Rez HD given a date of the 30th in the UK.

765
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,369
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is Bomberman Land on Wii.

766
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Try saying that three times fast.

767
00:47:05,854 --> 00:47:19,538
[SPEAKER_06]: FlatOutHeadOn on PSP, Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom, Yay, Lineage 2, The Camel on PC, PDC World Championship Darts 2008 on DS, which is really exciting, isn't it?

768
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:20,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

769
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:28,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords on Wii, Sims 2 Castaway Stories on PC, and Zoo Hospital on DS.

770
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoo Hospital?

771
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:30,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy!

772
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:33,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that exciting?

773
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:37,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoo Host-able.

774
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know how many people have pre-orders on Zoo Hospital.

775
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:42,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got mine in there.

776
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:43,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

777
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure I don't want to miss out on Zoo Hospital.

778
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was hoping that Chess Master Live was actually Chess Master Live, you know, like a pornographic version of it or something.

779
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of cool, but no.

780
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:02,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, the...

781
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,102
[SPEAKER_02]: US isn't that busy this week, actually.

782
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:09,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty scarce.

783
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:14,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not going to be much that you're going to be interested in unless you love Bomberman.

784
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:16,265
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, there's a couple games for you.

785
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:19,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman Land for the Wii and the PSP coming out.

00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:41,076
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stories do they have to tell?

792
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Help, I'm trapped in a knockoff game of a once popular franchise.

793
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Help, I'm lost on an island.

794
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:52,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else to note?

795
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:55,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just seeing if there was anything else that's funny.

796
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:58,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

797
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:02,324

798
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

799
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:10,011
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Zoo Hospital coming out in Europe.

800
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same game, which is a different name or something?

801
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there really that big of a demand out there in the game marketplace for Zoo Hospital?

802
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:22,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, there's a lot of freaking Pet Vet games.

803
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,984
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually one that's kind of neat.

804
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:29,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different than your usual pet the animals and they are better type game.

805
00:49:29,642 --> 00:49:32,223
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have one that's done like Phoenix Wright.

806
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,464
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pet hospital game.

807
00:49:33,924 --> 00:49:35,524
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

808
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:38,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's cute because it's a good game for kids.

809
00:49:38,786 --> 00:49:42,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game for kids, I'm sure, because how many... Objection!

810
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:43,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not sick.

811
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fake eating.

812
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:47,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, dog.

813
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:53,132
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of eight and nine-year-olds that want to be veterinarians when they grow up.

814
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:55,693
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, I can go even more obscure here.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome!

818
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

819
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:19,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I don't want to go into any more details unless there's another tycoon game because, you know, every week there's got to be a tycoon game.

820
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here's the one I was talking about.

[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be Paws and Claws Pet Resort Tycoon.

826
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have little hats and sunglasses on and shirts.

827
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cute.

[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:10,096
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to Japanese release dates because this is one of the fun parts of the show is getting to hear me horribly butcher the pronunciation of Japanese titles coming soon to Japan.

00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:55,874
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like Richard Simmons happy.

869
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:58,757
[SPEAKER_02]: You should get a t-shirt with that on the front there.

870
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:00,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, yeah.

871
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:02,881
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like the Japanese Ronald McDonald.

872
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:04,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 4chan.

873
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:05,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

874
00:54:05,263 --> 00:54:08,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That picture is waiting to be 4chan'd into something.

875
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

876
00:54:10,228 --> 00:54:11,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, chat.

877
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Look this game up if you...

878
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening on the podcast and didn't get a chance to get the link in chat.

879
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, let's go to the Sony PSP where there's a game called Patapon coming out on January 1st.

880
00:54:24,997 --> 00:54:26,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that on my PSP right now.

881
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:27,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?

882
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:27,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it good?

883
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:29,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

884
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:30,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Jesus.

885
00:54:31,382 --> 00:54:32,462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the eyeball one.

886
00:54:33,844 --> 00:54:38,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, but not leastly, Sega Rally Revo also coming out on the Sony PSP.

887
00:54:38,267 --> 00:54:40,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, I'll play it during break and then I'll tell you how it is.

888
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:41,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you should tell us.

889
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:43,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

890
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:44,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the gaming news!

891
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:53,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to move even further over to the UK, there was the drama going on regarding the release of Manhunt 2.

892
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:59,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had said that, yeah, it would be okay, there would be no harm in the game.

893
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:04,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the high court has said, nah, it's going to be harmful, so we don't want it.

894
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:05,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

895
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:37,229
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's no telling if it will be in any incarnation released.

896
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:45,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just a message to our friends over there in the UK who might be legally involved in all this.

897
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:48,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Just release the damn game because seriously, it's not going to sell anyway.

898
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,873
[SPEAKER_03]: They've all heard from us that the game sucks.

899
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:52,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just...

900
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:55,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop wasting the dollars, you know, getting the court orders.

901
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:56,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that good anymore.

902
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let them sell it.

903
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to buy it.

904
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:59,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it sucks.

905
00:55:59,511 --> 00:56:02,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good when, you know, we didn't know what the game was going to be like.

906
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:08,315
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that it's been out and we've seen the reviews and we've played it and we've kind of gotten over the, oh, wow, this was violent.

907
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:08,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

908
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:14,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if the British board wants to look at something, I mean, Condemned 2, hello, exploding babies.

909
00:56:15,518 --> 00:56:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that might necessitate a ban or something.

910
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you don't understand, though, Rob.

911
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,841
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

912
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:30,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Exploding Babies, I mean, that has nothing to do with sexual stuff, so that's also another reason why we... Oh, I'm so sorry.

913
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:34,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Exploding Babies, that's not as offensive as ripping off someone's testicles with pliers.

914
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:39,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's keep moving with the gaming news.

915
00:56:41,377 --> 00:56:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see here.

916
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:46,897
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't really a big surprise.

917
00:56:47,258 --> 00:56:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Ubisoft has confirmed that there's going to be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming in their next fiscal year, which 2008, I guess that starts in March.

918
00:56:59,039 --> 00:56:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Big whoop.

919
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we already knew this was kind of rumored to be coming out anyways.

920
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:06,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see some, you know, artwork here that they were showing off.

921
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:16,911
[SPEAKER_02]: No word, though, on when exactly it's going to be out because their fiscal year runs from basically March of this year through April of 2009.

922
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So somewhere in between there, we're going to get a new Prince of Persia game.

923
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:26,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it looks like this, you know, piece of artwork that they have because it looks like Strider.

924
00:57:26,678 --> 00:57:27,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know.

925
00:57:29,127 --> 00:57:29,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big surprise.

926
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:34,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the chat room and looking at some comments.

927
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,132
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com and leave some comments.

928
00:57:40,493 --> 00:57:45,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the last story, Ross Steel UT says, No more Manhunt 2, angry face.

929
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:50,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, Come on guys, Manhunt 2 is not a game to get locked up in the government.

930
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:56,020
[SPEAKER_03]: SonOfDad says, Manhunt 2, no plastic knife attachment for the Wiimote yet?

931
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:56,640
[SPEAKER_02]: They have those.

932
00:57:57,321 --> 00:57:57,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

933
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:06,565
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a plastic knife, but it's a plastic sword, and then they've got stuff like that, but I don't know.

934
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:07,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

935
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:11,527
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, I should maybe take a break from game politics.

936
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The story they've been running...

937
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:16,286
[SPEAKER_03]: make me want to stab random people, I guess, in response.

938
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, wait a minute.

939
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:20,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I see your displaced anger there is part of the problem.

940
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:23,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, video games making you want to stab random people.

941
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:24,330
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

942
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's just an expression.

943
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:30,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure in Japan, though, they probably have a knife attachment for, you know, the Wii Remote.

944
00:58:30,713 --> 00:58:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have attachments for all the different weapons in Ghost Squad in there, so a knife, maybe.

945
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of neat.

946
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:40,742
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

947
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:01,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have a lot of free time on their hands.

948
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, I'm Tom Brady.

949
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:50,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited to be on the show.

950
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:14,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, so no news yet on when this will be coming out for sure, but we imagine the delay is not going to be that long.

951
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine there's going to be third-party microphones and stuff like that.

952
01:00:17,053 --> 01:00:22,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's headsets already for some of the SOCOM games, which I imagine you can probably use those for Skype.

953
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why they're delaying all this stuff.

954
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:29,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm probably guessing because everything that's Sony-related seems to be delayed one time or another.

955
01:00:29,645 --> 01:00:35,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of funny because, you know, of course, all the Sony haters came out and said, here we go again, Delay Station 3.

956
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all the cool stuff.

957
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the Delay Station Portable, okay.

958
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:39,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true, that's true.

959
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:40,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

960
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quick, some comments from chat, and then we'll get to the next story Jamie's going to do for us.

961
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:50,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says in chat, yes, if you sell something with the Skype name, you have to be certified by them.

962
01:00:50,139 --> 01:00:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is, you know, part of the point is that, you know, the microphones are chatter juice.

963
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:55,082
[SPEAKER_03]: They get it, you know, Best Buy, Circuit City, whatever.

964
01:00:55,102 --> 01:00:56,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just some random mic technology.

965
01:00:56,303 --> 01:01:02,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That happens to be a USB mic, but if you're going to sell something with a Skype name on it, like the PSP is going to do, it has to be Skype certified, which makes sense.

966
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:08,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tiger Claw says pretty soon the Skype calls on OLR are going to be done by people using Skype on their PSP.

967
01:01:08,908 --> 01:01:15,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's actually going to be a bad thing at all because, hey, if the mics are certified and everything's been tested, you know it's going to work.

968
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:17,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to that day, actually.

969
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:19,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I'll be good.

970
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:20,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cry.

971
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:21,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you cry?

972
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Because... Cry tears of joy or tears of pain?

973
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:26,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Cry tears of apathy.

974
01:01:26,765 --> 01:01:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to talk on my PSP out in public looking like a complete douche.

975
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:32,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

976
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:35,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, what's up, man?

977
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:35,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally on my PSP.

978
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:37,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it is?

979
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the N-Gage all over again.

980
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:42,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to side talk on it because it has a microphone.

981
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the microphone that they're going to have plugs into the USB thing on the front.

982
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:50,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on the top of the actual system.

983
01:01:50,782 --> 01:01:51,642
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

984
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say this.

985
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,662
[SPEAKER_03]: There's JustinTVChat and there's our chat at OrangeLaunchRadio.

986
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:23,622
[SPEAKER_03]: MacMan's making smart-ass comments in both.

987
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:27,243
[SPEAKER_03]: He says in the JustinTVChat, Echo123 is for wussies.

988
01:02:27,604 --> 01:02:29,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Call in with no sure quality test.

989
01:02:29,464 --> 01:02:30,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, don't even buy a microphone.

990
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:32,345
[SPEAKER_03]: You, sir, are part of the problem.

991
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:36,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But he says in chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, Yo, I'm on my PSP.

992
01:02:36,746 --> 01:02:37,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanna pick me up?

993
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:37,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanna pick me up?

994
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:41,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just

995
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,201
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want to pick you up.

996
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:44,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do my story now?

997
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:45,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you may.

998
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's about something that's even more retarded than Skype.

999
01:02:48,123 --> 01:02:48,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

1000
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:50,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, than that microphone anyway.

1001
01:02:50,885 --> 01:02:56,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone made an eye of judgment table to make up for the fact that the camera is easily bumped into poor lighting.

1002
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:03,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So he takes this little table and builds a custom hardwood replica of the mat.

1003
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:06,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently it works just fine.

1004
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,938
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, people like this game enough to care.

1005
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:13,493
[SPEAKER_02]: has that sold any more copies?

1006
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:17,034
[SPEAKER_02]: oh no, I don't think it has what is the latest update on the Eye of Judgment numbers?

1007
01:03:17,114 --> 01:03:23,436
[SPEAKER_02]: still hasn't broke another 100,000 or even 10,000 can we count table sales as part of the million?

1008
01:03:23,456 --> 01:03:35,300
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly, if you want to, go right ahead before I mentioned it in that thread because I was egging on people in there I said I'd be surprised if it surpassed 300,000 units

1009
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:40,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But like right now, it's really starting to flatten off.

1010
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:43,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sold 4,000 units in the U.S.

1011
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,989
[SPEAKER_02]: only in the last week or so.

1012
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:49,631
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, since now we are going to add table counts.

1013
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:50,551
[SPEAKER_03]: What were we at, 160,000?

1014
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:51,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1015
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Adding the tables, we're now up to 160,001.

1016
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:59,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's how many of these tables we'll probably sell.

1017
01:03:59,498 --> 01:04:01,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just this guy that made it.

1018
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,140
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't say anything about it being retailed.

1019
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:03,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1020
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:04,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1021
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:09,591
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a comment on there that it would be retail ready if they add a cup holder.

1022
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:12,532
[SPEAKER_06]: But he just made this for himself.

1023
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is unacceptable.

1024
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:15,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Where am I going to put my drink on this table?

1025
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,093
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's pretty hardcore to do something like that.

1026
01:04:18,113 --> 01:04:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be a pretty hardcore Eye of Judgment fan.

1027
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:22,275
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy's name is Matt and he plays as Havoc.

1028
01:04:24,596 --> 01:04:25,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch out for Havoc.

1029
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:30,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just still boggled.

1030
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:31,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because like

1031
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:32,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd.

1032
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:32,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd.

1033
01:05:02,256 --> 01:05:03,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be the shit.

1034
01:05:03,176 --> 01:05:04,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's the crap.

1035
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:06,378
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

1036
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:09,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, before we get into Magic the Gathering talk, please let us see the show.

1037
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:19,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Sony's really trying to catch up with the whole Nintendo fad of releasing consoles in different colors.

1038
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:25,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in Asia, you will be able to pick up a red PS2 system.

1039
01:05:25,725 --> 01:05:27,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what's kind of neat is...

1040
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:29,249
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1041
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Dot, dot, dot.

1042
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:03,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I am inching away from Loki slowly.

1043
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:10,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, they could also use the Saturn argument, because the Japanese Saturn was white, and over here it was... Yeah.

1044
01:06:11,357 --> 01:06:13,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that was kind of dumb.

1045
01:06:14,018 --> 01:06:15,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get behind that argument.

1046
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:23,484
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're set to come out in Asia February 4th, so if you really need to get your hands on a red PS2... I don't know.

1047
01:06:23,504 --> 01:06:25,765
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other console sites out there that will sell colored...

1048
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:31,846
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2 systems in almost any color of the rainbow that you want, so do you really need to wait for this shit to import it?

1049
01:06:32,146 --> 01:06:34,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And my god, seriously, it's the color of a console.

1050
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a PS2 already, it's like, oh damn, I was really hoping for a red one.

1051
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:41,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my dreams can be realized at the end of the console cycle.

1052
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:45,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal Combat said a clear PS3 would be sweet.

1053
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:49,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how many colors of these consoles you're going to release.

1054
01:06:49,475 --> 01:06:52,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the PS2's selling lots and lots and lots of consoles.

1055
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:54,397
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3, not so much, you know, but

1056
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:55,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1057
01:06:56,015 --> 01:06:58,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to confuse people even more with the white console now.

1058
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another skew.

1059
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:04,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does it matter what it looks like as long as it's still the same piece of shit inside?

1060
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:07,777
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's white, but guess what it won't do this time?

1061
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:11,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Play Blu-ray movies or do something that's important.

1062
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:12,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It has no left.

1063
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:18,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been more happy that we got our first day release than I am now.

1064
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1065
01:07:24,591 --> 01:07:30,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was looking for the clip on YouTube of the kid from Wonder Shows and going, that's racist, but I couldn't find it.

1066
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:32,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll just have to imagine it in your head.

1067
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:39,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to find the white people song, but if you... White people having fun.

1068
01:07:39,294 --> 01:07:44,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I love... Wonder Shows is so fucking hilarious.

1069
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they stop doing that show?

1070
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:48,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelly still sings the white people song.

1071
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:52,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, she likes the songs.

1072
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Dance

1073
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:55,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Dance.

1074
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1075
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:05,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the one where they show the tour of the hot dog factory.

1076
01:08:06,464 --> 01:08:08,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is the Wonder Shows and Podcast, is it?

1077
01:08:09,505 --> 01:08:11,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, but I couldn't resist.

1078
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:12,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience!

1079
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:13,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience!

1080
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:14,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Patience!

1081
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience!

1082
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:16,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience!

1083
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:17,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience!

1084
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience!

1085
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Patience!

1086
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, insert, you know, train wrecks.

1087
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All right!

1088
01:08:23,491 --> 01:08:24,171
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.

1089
01:08:24,211 --> 01:08:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll get to it.

1090
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to it.

1091
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,714
[SPEAKER_03]: We need, like, an off-topic alarm.

1092
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, seriously.

1093
01:08:30,635 --> 01:08:32,155
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an off-topic alarm.

1094
01:08:32,996 --> 01:08:46,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at this picture that someone in the chatroom linked from, um, it was Actdeft that linked it in the chatroom, and it's from, um, Gakuten Saiban, which is, uh, you know, Phoenix Wright.

1095
01:08:47,484 --> 01:08:47,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's,

1096
01:08:48,314 --> 01:08:50,737
[SPEAKER_06]: and two oranges with a banana sticking out of the middle.

1097
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, DarkSakura, because you're so good at getting this show back on track.

1098
01:08:57,503 --> 01:08:58,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about a game.

1099
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see what's so funny about citrus roots.

1100
01:09:02,449 --> 01:09:03,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our chatroom that linked it, not me.

1101
01:09:05,872 --> 01:09:07,714
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we have pervs in our chatroom.

1102
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pervs.

1103
01:09:11,378 --> 01:09:12,639
[SPEAKER_06]: There need to be more of them in the world.

1104
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:14,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Pervs are awesome.

1105
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:17,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news.

1106
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:18,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I did not derail the show.

1107
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: They derailed it with Wonder Shows and whatever.

1108
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, Metal Gear Solid.

1109
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:25,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll always save a day, right?

1110
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

1111
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the same old shit, but all over again.

1112
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:38,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is because, apparently, PlayAsia is taking pre-orders for a brand new Metal Gear Solid collection.

1113
01:09:38,723 --> 01:09:41,504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection.

1114
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:42,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll set you back...

1115
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: 34.90 and also $4 shipping and handling.

1116
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:54,453
[SPEAKER_03]: You will get with it Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 Substance, and Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence.

1117
01:09:55,493 --> 01:09:56,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

1118
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can just wait and get it at any retail store for $29.99.

1119
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:03,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could just, you know, borrow your friend's copy that they're not playing anymore.

1120
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have new artwork.

1121
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only difference.

1122
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:10,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course it all looks like the old artwork.

1123
01:10:12,247 --> 01:10:13,768
[SPEAKER_06]: because this style never changes.

1124
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:21,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were waiting all this time to get Metal Gear Solid, now's your chance.

1125
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:23,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Now's your chance to get it in a couple months.

1126
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:27,094
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

1127
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:28,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I really?

1128
01:10:28,894 --> 01:10:31,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you going to bring up things that have absolutely nothing to do with video games this time?

1129
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:32,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1130
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:33,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1131
01:10:33,757 --> 01:10:34,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Calibur 4!

1132
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:39,079
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bringing back three characters.

1133
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:40,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1134
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: We get Maxie.

1135
01:10:41,894 --> 01:10:42,174
[SPEAKER_06]: IceCave

1136
01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, YoungSong or whatever his name is, is a pirate.

1137
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:11,040
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

1138
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:11,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So is Maxie.

1139
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:12,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I like playing with him.

1140
01:11:12,864 --> 01:11:13,305
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cool.

1141
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:14,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Maxie's also a pirate.

1142
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else I have to say about this story, Jamie?

1143
01:11:45,673 --> 01:12:04,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal Dance, Animal Dance Look, everybody's doing the Animal Dance Animal Dance, Animal Dance Animal Dance That's the wonders of Wondershowsin.

1144
01:12:05,703 --> 01:12:05,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1145
01:12:06,484 --> 01:12:06,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

1146
01:12:06,924 --> 01:12:07,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1147
01:12:07,664 --> 01:12:07,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

1148
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:10,846
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even get the full slew of Rob.

1149
01:12:12,007 --> 01:12:12,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You just get two.

1150
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:15,369
[SPEAKER_06]: and Chris threw something at you for me.

1151
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:17,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do another story now?

1152
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:19,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to apologize.

1153
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:21,911
[SPEAKER_06]: In other news, Rob is random and he's red now.

1154
01:12:22,311 --> 01:12:26,172
[SPEAKER_03]: To everybody who's tuning in to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, I'd like to apologize.

1155
01:12:26,832 --> 01:12:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Did my roommate bring us food?

1156
01:12:28,693 --> 01:12:29,493
[SPEAKER_03]: You're awesome!

1157
01:12:29,753 --> 01:12:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to share it?

1158
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:32,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have two of them.

1159
01:12:33,055 --> 01:12:34,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want one because I'm full already.

1160
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:36,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate a whole sandwich.

1161
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:36,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, though.

1162
01:12:37,156 --> 01:12:37,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Then...

1163
01:12:41,468 --> 01:12:43,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hello, we're on the air.

1164
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:48,433
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

1165
01:12:48,554 --> 01:12:51,776
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had seen how off-topic we were, you would not be bored.

1166
01:12:52,016 --> 01:12:53,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about animal dancing.

1167
01:12:53,938 --> 01:12:54,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1168
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, pass it over.

1169
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:57,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, all right.

1170
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, please, a video game subject, or nobody's ever going to listen to the show again.

1171
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:02,324
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1172
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:08,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Final Fantasy XIII designer promises a demo for the game and promises that the game will be out in 2008.

1173
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:16,992
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that we'll have it sometime possibly before January 1st of 2009.

1174
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, of course, they're going to renege on the whole thing and say, you know what, yeah, we ran into some delays.

1175
01:13:24,376 --> 01:13:25,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can tell us whatever we want.

1176
01:13:25,857 --> 01:13:29,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And each copy is going to come in case with gold and free women.

1177
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know.

1178
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:35,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind, I don't want it anymore.

1179
01:13:35,862 --> 01:13:36,923
[SPEAKER_06]: How about just loose women?

1180
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:38,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely don't want it.

1181
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:39,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Free loose women.

1182
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:55,240
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be with the Fabula Nova Crystallis Collection, which has the dumbest name of the series.

1183
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Final Fantasy XIII.

1184
01:13:56,881 --> 01:13:59,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to go crazier with the name?

1185
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worked for Final Fantasy VII.

1186
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worked for Final Fantasy X. It's worked for Final Fantasy X-2.

1187
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:15,065
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing is, even if this does come out in 2008, which I highly doubt a creator is promising it or not, it'll come out in 2008 in Japan.

1188
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, yes.

1189
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:18,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll take them nine months to translate it for us.

1190
01:14:21,226 --> 01:14:22,346
[SPEAKER_03]: What good is this going to do me?

1191
01:14:22,486 --> 01:14:23,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay, though.

1192
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:30,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure this is all the news that Sony needs to start playing it in their commercials for the PS3 to get people hyped up to buy their system.

1193
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:43,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, to their credit though, they did remove Haze from there now, and they still have Metal Gear Solid, which doesn't look like it's coming out in the spring anymore.

1194
01:14:45,951 --> 01:14:46,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1195
01:14:48,212 --> 01:15:00,137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on so we can try and put this whole segment behind us and get out the last few stories here, including speaking of the PlayStation 3, Best Buy is clearing out the 80 gigabytes.

1196
01:15:00,157 --> 01:15:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1197
01:15:01,024 --> 01:15:07,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, there is an internal memo going around, quote, the 80 gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3 is going close out and won't be replaced at this time.

1198
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:10,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come off the planogram on January 28th.

1199
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:13,393
[SPEAKER_03]: The 60 gigabyte version should already be gone from stores.

1200
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the 40 gigabyte version of PS3 will be sold in Best Buy stores at this time.

1201
01:15:17,676 --> 01:15:20,959
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that there currently isn't a version that is PS2 compatible.

1202
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:24,642
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, Sony hasn't made any announcements about new products.

1203
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:27,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as of this recording right now, they have sold out of the

1204
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1205
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're phasing out the 8 gig systems for that.

1206
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, maybe they're going to stop offering Motorstorm for free.

1207
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1208
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:10,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And even Microsoft's to blame for having a ton of different SKUs for their products.

1209
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:15,755
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, the PlayStation 3 has been very confusing with what's available.

1210
01:16:16,015 --> 01:16:17,176
[SPEAKER_02]: First it's the 60 and the 20.

1211
01:16:17,376 --> 01:16:19,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 20 goes away.

1212
01:16:20,058 --> 01:16:22,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's the 60 and the 80.

1213
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,402
[SPEAKER_06]: They show absolutely no confidence in their product.

1214
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 60 goes away.

1215
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's the 80 and the 40.

1216
01:16:28,744 --> 01:16:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 80's going away.

1217
01:16:30,225 --> 01:16:32,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's the 40 and God knows what.

1218
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:33,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1219
01:16:33,973 --> 01:16:34,213
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1220
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:03,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So what game this week, DarkSakura?

1221
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:10,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The game of the week is Akumajou Dracula X Chino Rondo, which is Dracula X Rondo of Blood.

1222
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:13,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1223
01:17:13,882 --> 01:17:21,026
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lot of people know, it was recently re-released for the PSP, but I'm not talking about PSP ones.

1224
01:17:24,308 --> 01:17:26,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, the other clip that I liked had the better music.

1225
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

1226
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,650
[SPEAKER_03]: This one loaded first.

1227
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I played this.

1228
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:29,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1229
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:58,989
[SPEAKER_06]: the other one in particular because it was new music that was for that game it was the theme Bloodlines which was the theme of Richter Belmont which is the character that they brought in this who was also in Symphony of the Night which came out in Japan as Nocturne and the Moonlight this is the predecessor to that game because you actually start off Symphony of the Night as Richter at what's supposed to be the end of this game when he fights Dracula so and of course the uh

1230
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:07,132
[SPEAKER_06]: The music I have linked is from the PC Engine Duo disc, which was all Redbook audio.

1231
01:18:07,412 --> 01:18:09,272
[SPEAKER_06]: You could actually put it in your CD player and listen to it.

1232
01:18:09,592 --> 01:18:16,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, just the cool thing, because I don't know if anyone ever did this with Symphony of the Night, if you put it in your disc and try to listen to it, you get a warning.

1233
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a PlayStation Black disc.

1234
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,856
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to the game track, it will block speakers.

1235
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:26,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the same thing on the Japanese one, too.

1236
01:18:26,316 --> 01:18:29,237
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PC Engine one.

1237
01:18:30,103 --> 01:18:32,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought was really cool.

1238
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:37,768
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, the game had little animated cutscenes.

1239
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:39,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say poorly animated cutscenes.

1240
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:44,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the intro of it was done in German.

1241
01:18:45,072 --> 01:18:51,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And for old listeners of our show, I've actually brought in my TurboGrafx.

1242
01:18:51,636 --> 01:18:53,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can play it on the US TurboGrafx.

1243
01:18:53,638 --> 01:18:54,858
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no country lockout.

1244
01:18:55,179 --> 01:18:55,779
[SPEAKER_06]: This is classic Castlevania.

1245
01:18:57,762 --> 01:18:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long time ago.

1246
01:18:59,363 --> 01:19:07,886
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if I do remember right, this is Super Castlevania 4, or the last traditional Castlevania games that have come out.

1247
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:12,688
[SPEAKER_06]: All the rest of them have had that sort of Metroidvania format.

1248
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:14,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that term, Metroidvania.

1249
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:23,692
[SPEAKER_06]: This particular one, because of how, I guess, relatively rare it was on PC Engine...

1250
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to find it for less than $150.

1251
01:19:26,486 --> 01:19:27,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have an original.

1252
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:30,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I had burdens for a long time because my friend had an original.

1253
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:34,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We got ours because someone owed us $100 and came back from Japan with the game.

1254
01:19:35,593 --> 01:19:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought was pretty freaking cool.

1255
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:47,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It also had... And now this did have a version of it on the Super Nintendo that was not...

1256
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:50,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people said, oh, it wasn't all that great.

1257
01:19:50,063 --> 01:19:51,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually enjoyed the Super Nintendo one.

1258
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:53,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me, I didn't like it.

1259
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Not compared to the TurboGrafx, or, you know what I mean, this first version, PC.

1260
01:19:57,648 --> 01:20:02,652
[SPEAKER_06]: This one, the cool thing about it is that as you went through, you had different routes that your story would take.

1261
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:06,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you rescued Maria, you can play as her.

1262
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, this...

1263
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: As I understand, she was supposed to be playable in Symphony of the Night, as well as two other levels that they never completed.

1264
01:20:16,168 --> 01:20:17,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the Saturn version, you can play as her.

1265
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of her attacks are there.

1266
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:21,672
[SPEAKER_06]: She threw birds for her attack.

1267
01:20:22,473 --> 01:20:38,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And her special weapons were a dragon, a kitten, a turtle shell, and another type of bird that came out, which translated actually to the...

1268
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:45,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess four major gods in the Saturn version that came out later.

1269
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:52,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, she gets this uber cutesy ending, and it was crazy.

1270
01:20:53,276 --> 01:21:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: The other funny thing about this is that because it had to run on the Arcade Card 3, if you didn't have an Arcade Card 3 in, it actually had Dracula X Stage X, which was done in really bad sort of rendered-looking bubble figures.

1271
01:21:10,525 --> 01:21:14,408
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, I went through all this, um, that way.

1272
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:21,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a lot of the, uh, enemies in this game were original for this one and showed up in a lot of the later series, too.

1273
01:21:21,994 --> 01:21:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we had, like, the Pikemen, which were, I think, the most single annoying characters ever.

1274
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:31,582
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones who stay on the ledge and, like, drop a, a pike down on you and they were hard to get past.

1275
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:38,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it was, this is, to me, this game right here, to me, is the top, um,

1276
01:21:45,737 --> 01:21:51,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd agree.

1277
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:52,520
[SPEAKER_03]: To a point.

1278
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Symphony of the Night exceeded it a little bit, but we wouldn't have Symphony of the Night if it weren't for this.

1279
01:21:57,182 --> 01:21:58,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to respect the elders.

1280
01:21:58,683 --> 01:22:05,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And of all of the series, as far as I'm aware, well, these two are...

1281
01:22:05,862 --> 01:22:06,462
[SPEAKER_06]: LinkTogether.

1282
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:12,125
[SPEAKER_06]: This one and Symphony of the Night are the only games to carry the actual Dracula X logo.

1283
01:22:14,206 --> 01:22:15,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this from Actdeft in chat.

1284
01:22:16,367 --> 01:22:17,628
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a podcast?

1285
01:22:17,968 --> 01:22:19,509
[SPEAKER_03]: A miserable little pile of hosts.

1286
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:20,509
[SPEAKER_03]: But enough of that.

1287
01:22:20,829 --> 01:22:21,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Have at you.

1288
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:22,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Winner.

1289
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It was... What was that?

1290
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:28,793
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually... I dropped the mic.

1291
01:22:30,894 --> 01:22:34,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Several remixes that were in this one from some of the previous games, too.

1292
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:34,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1293
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:40,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the little music clips carried over.

1294
01:22:40,307 --> 01:22:46,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, this one, if you can find an original, good luck.

1295
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

1296
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:57,575
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that... This is probably... That's a scary little noise that thing makes.

1297
01:22:58,616 --> 01:23:05,119
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd have to say of all of the... This is probably one of my top five games.

1298
01:23:06,169 --> 01:23:06,630
