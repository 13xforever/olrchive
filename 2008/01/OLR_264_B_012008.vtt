Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for Part B of our program.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
If you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Brothers delay.

00:36.000 --> 00:52.000
We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's get back into some regular gaming news. Start off with Loki.

00:56.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN and basically they gave the timeframe.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't know. I'll believe it when I see it type thing.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
If it is, they may show it at E3 or something like that because it would have to be kind of done.

01:36.000 --> 01:49.000
It's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of release dates because Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
I really hope this rumor is true, though. I love me some Duke Nukem, too.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
It would be even better if some of the expansions and the homemade stuff come out as downloadable stuff.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I hope the build editor comes with it because that would be awesome.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Wasn't there voice macros?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh, yes. Being able to make your own voice macros would be awesome.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C. mod or something? I still remember having that on CD at one point.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah. I love Duke Nukem.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Dunu is great. I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
That was awesome. You're laughing, Nathan. Did that inspire what's a modem?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
What are you, 12?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm just kidding. No. They let you...

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
All right. So, yeah. Duke Nukem. I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem Forever, dammit.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
No. No. This will all allow.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
As long as they don't screw it up. If it's just like a boring old port...

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It's going to be a boring old port. It's going to look just like Doom.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Remember how awesome Doom was when it came out? We're like, ooh, Doom. Ooh, we can play Deathmatch on Doom.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
And then something else came out and we completely forgot about Doom?

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Seriously, is anyone still playing Doom? I don't think so.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
Well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great. At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, like the day it came out.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
All right. Well, let's move on with some other gaming news, talking about Xbox Live still.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
But this time, talking about Rock Band. And Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
The last segment, we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
But now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Because unlike last year, EA Harmonics has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
They also retracted them after they announced them.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Did they?

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, but still. If Xbox.com posted it, I would think there's some type of legitimacy to that.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, they took it down because it was OMG Spoilers. That's what it was.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
But anyway, on January 22nd, an Oasis pack is coming out with the songs Don't Look Back in Anger, Live Forever, and Wonderwall.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
That would make you relive the 90s all over again, getting to play Wonderwall.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'd rather not, thank you.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
On January 29th, the Progressive pack comes out. Both packs will set you back 400 points.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive pack.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed, that's also a cover.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Smashing Pumpkins with Seva, not a cover.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s. That was like their first single ever.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
And that's all we know until February. So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
We get Foreigner. Ooh.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And Journey is Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Yes! Journey!

05:15.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm more about Boston right now, but I don't know. There's better songs! Why those?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
At least we're not getting hot-blooded.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
But it's Journey. It's awesome. I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and rock band because their music wasn't showing up.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And I was like, where's the Journey? And now it's coming out and that makes me very happy.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, I think that all three of these songs are also in rock band, I want to say. I know Jukebox Hero is.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Jukebox Hero is, yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:58.000
And I know that there's another Boston song that's in rock band. I don't think this is it. Anyway.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So, we're getting old rock.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
You know, if you play Boston backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
That is not true.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
That's from Little Nicky. Stop spreading lies on the internet.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
You're one of those, but yeah, that's my job.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
So, speaking of another, well, more music-related stuff.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the US.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
The first machine, apparently, is at In the Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

06:37.000 --> 06:46.000
According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at the start.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
You know, all the other fun stuff. No EMUs support right now.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
And also, I guess when you play the nonce upcourses, you can put your name and state in there and record all the information.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know. I'm excited that there's a new DDR, although it's not near us.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know. I already told you how I feel about DDR and I got in a little trouble for it,

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
but I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2 and I'm just kind of like,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
it's just the same thing with some new songs.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
It needs to be another Max 2. They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the ONI courses and stuff like that,

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
and that was exciting, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, and that kind of thing, and the way they teased that.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
With these DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
It's just kind of like, DDR, here we go, enjoy.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh, another DDR. Enjoy. They don't hype it up any.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
It's like, ah, no one cares anymore, so we don't either. Just throw it out.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
They need to give DDR a swift kick in the booty and put something new in it to make me want to go back to the arcades.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Irene, I know you've been a long-time DDR fan. What do you think of where the series is going?

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
I don't know. It's kind of dropped off the face of the earth. It's kind of like, I don't know, Debbie Gibson or something.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
It's just like, oh, hey, there's DDR. I mean, I'd play it if it came here just to try it out, but that was kind of,

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
I stopped playing DDR years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, the younger kids that were our age when we started.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Maybe they'll get into it.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Stop dating me and yourself.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
But Rob, I love you.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Not that. You know what I mean.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
No, I know, but I mean, I'd have to play it. I don't know. I'm not as excited.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
I was excited probably when Fourth Plus came out and Fifth Mix.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know. I just don't care anymore.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Let's see. I'm looking at our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
DJ Genai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
RosteelUT says, DDR Star Wars edition. That would work.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
No.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
See, that's partially why I think DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap, like hottest party and all this stuff.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It's just absolute shit.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
They should make a 12 player mode with peripherals.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
That'd be great. I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
No, but seriously, they could make some really elaborate cabinet that was four player, have a quad mode or something like that in the arcade.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
That would be different.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
Even Animaro gets behind Pump It Up and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Konami doesn't do anything. It's just like, oh look, it's DDR.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Even with BeatMania, it's like, what's it matter? We're going to release another one in a few months anyway.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I know. It's like they think it's some kind of self advertising franchise.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Like, we already have a fan base built in. We don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah.

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
But like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing. Excite us about it. Otherwise, why should we give a shit?

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
Alright. Like I said, just reinvent DDR. Make it competitive. I'll be all over that game again.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Just, you know, just start from scratch.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You know what DDR needs? A new producer.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Like, I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some fr- I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Because, you know, obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
That's what it needs. Some new blood.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
We are starting over, right?

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Alright, anyhow, something else that you can get your music fixed through, not DDR, but the other type.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
The orchestral. Nice, live, take in the music type thing.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Like, remember Dear Friends, the Final Fantasy concert?

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, of course, one of the other big tours that goes around is Tommy Tallarico's Video Games Live.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And Video Games Live has been going for, like, two years straight.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
They ain't stopping anytime soon. They've added 40 shows throughout the globe this year.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert. That's kind of cool.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California at the Nob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So if you want to catch that.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
And if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24th, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Dude, Jamie. Anaheim, California.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Disneyland.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Disneyland slash Video Games Live.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Let's go.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Let's do it.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'd rather go to E3.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I would like to go to E3, but we'll see.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Anyhow, so there you have it. Video Games Live. That'll be fun.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I have not been yet.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwell at all games.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
He goes, he enjoys the show.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Disney World!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, I know! It's even better!

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
God, guys. So one-track minded.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, you know what? Disneyland's fun.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Loki, you need to come to Disneyland with us sometime.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I've been to Disneyland and it's just like, ooh, yay!

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Did you go to Disneyland in the 90s, though?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Because it was kind of junky.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
That was before they started doing all the renovation.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I went there when they were building California.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So you went during the days of Suck.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, I went there when they had the rocket rods and I got to ride them before they ripped them out

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
because some idiot jumped off the rocket rods and killed themselves

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
the same way they killed themselves.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
That never made any sense to me whatsoever.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh, well, we'll get rid of the people movers because someone fell out of it and died.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Let's put something faster there instead.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That'll be better.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
The rumor is rocket riders are coming back.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
We'll see.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
The rocket rides are awesome.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I've also been hearing a rumor that the next rock in the parks they're doing is Aerosmith.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Nice.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Would it be Space Mountain again in California?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Space Mountain and California Screamin'.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Rawr! That sounds great.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Anyway, sorry. We turned it into the Disney cast for a minute.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Jamie, please take the show back on track.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Okay, so Devil May Cry 4.

13:37.000 --> 13:45.000
There is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
that was actually removed from the downloadable version

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
that was saying it would be out, and of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
and out a week later in North America and Europe.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
But is it going to happen?

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So is it true? Is it not?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Did someone just screw up?

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It makes sense.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Jinx.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Your mom.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Oh, you showed me.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
She wins, Rob. She said your mom.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Aw, damn. All right.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
What are you going to do now?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I like how Jamie said that off the mic.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm going to repeat. She goes, I like your mom.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
I do.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Just to clarify, I do like your mom.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Your mom's cool.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
My mom is cool.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
She'd make pies too.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
You guys can make me Easter cookies together.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
All right, forget it.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Anyway, let's move on.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
More game news, please.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Well, something else that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N Plus.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And it's very fucking hard.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be I think on both Xbox Live Arcade and

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
It doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon because apparently it's

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
already, I guess, passed their certification.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
So, hooray.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh, that's a pretty fun game.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon too.

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to, this

15:51.000 --> 16:00.000
is kind of funny, www.harveycartel.org, that's H-A-R-V-E-Y...

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano and...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Well, it's Cartel.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Okay, never mind.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
H-A-R-V-E-Y-C-A-R-T-E-L dot org slash meta net slash downloads dot HTML.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And you complete the full game there.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
It's pretty fun.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Lots of challenge though, so.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Yay.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
So is it going to be worth, because N right now is free, right?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I think it's going to be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
there.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
And they're going to have new levels.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
So, no, those are going to be in there and you get achievements.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Alright.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers suck during

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Christmas.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Apparently they're not that sorry.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Please don't sue us.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Not a new game, a game that was already out, but you will be able to download it for a

17:09.000 --> 17:10.500
limited time for free.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.000
I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
So you have about a three day period, roughly, to get the game.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800 for my Xbox,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
they're supposed to be able to do something for you.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Like maybe give you the points back or they won't say, will they?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Because they don't want everybody to rush them.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
but whatever.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
I, you know, I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
But it's just, it's kind of fucked up.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I'd rather have like, you know, a free month of Live or something.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It would have been a lot cheaper for them too, but.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
The demo was kind of fun.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I'll look at it.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You're right.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I'll grab it while it's free.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Why not?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
You know, it's on the hard drive.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And, quite frankly, they didn't really OS anything to begin with, I don't think.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
No.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
I think this little thing got blown way out of proportion.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
So, it's kind of like, you know what, if you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It was still kind of spotty.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.500
Like, I guess I hadn't played on Live since like New Year's or something because I had

18:18.500 --> 18:22.000
to recover my gamer tag from, I think, year 360.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And, it had trouble doing that.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked, which sucks because for

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
whatever reason, the download that like six megs is your gamer tag, it takes like a half

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
an hour.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
That is crazy.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
It's not fucking slow, but yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangelountradio.com.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Let's see, Son of Dad.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I wanted Res.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.200
Act Def seems to think that Res will be up this week.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
I hope that's true.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.200
Actually, that may be true because I think they said Res was coming out in January and

18:53.200 --> 18:55.000
there's only one more week in January, right?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
No, two more.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
No, two more.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
All right.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
So.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
We'll see.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
I thought this week was, didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
already?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't know.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
was?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
It looks stupid.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It was okay.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.900
It's pretty much, there's a game just like it, Magical Drop on the Neo Geo.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.860
It's almost just like Magical Drop but with bunnies and you can run up the sides too.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.440
That was the other little innovation is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from

19:25.440 --> 19:28.000
the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.880
It adds a new element to it but, I don't know, anyway, sorry, I got a little off track but

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
I realize I never talked about it during my game.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.920
I was going to check out Omega 5 maybe but Omega 5 is awesome.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.320
You got to check that out.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.520
That's definitely worth a look.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.500
If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron or if you like the

19:43.500 --> 19:45.640
newer ones or whatever, check it out.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
Do it.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.640
All right.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.880
So, Undertow for free.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.240
Be sure to take a look this week.

19:51.240 --> 19:56.940
Highlander game, actually I'm sort of interested in is the Highlander game that's coming out

19:56.940 --> 20:03.760
that you play as Owen McLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.660
Go fig.

20:05.660 --> 20:11.600
Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day and got a lot of people

20:11.600 --> 20:16.440
that you meet and a lot of people you kill and it's supposed to be really, really gory.

20:16.440 --> 20:26.600
But part of it is that you're using his ability to not die and to regrow and regenerate bits

20:26.600 --> 20:31.320
and pieces so you can stab yourself to kill someone behind you.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.960
That sounds actually kind of cool.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.360
Jump off buildings.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.480
One of the things mentioned on here is act as a conductor for high voltage electrical

20:42.480 --> 20:43.480
current.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.000
So, it's pretty cool.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.400
You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions and full cities and you can use zip wires

20:53.400 --> 20:55.400
and that type of thing.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.400
And did I say gory?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.300
Because it's supposed to be gory.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.480
This game sounds epic.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.300
You just know something's going to go wrong though.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.480
It's too good on paper.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.340
Well, it's PS3, 360 and PC.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.840
And it's made by Eidos.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.360
They did give us Tomb Raider.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.360
Exactly.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.360
Exactly.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.200
Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.800
The second one was the best because you could make her explode.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.800
I do agree.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
The second one was the best.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.640
You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.560
Now Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?

21:29.560 --> 21:30.560
That's what I just said.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.920
Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.920
Rob.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.920
Rob.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.920
Rob.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.920
Rob.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.600
If you like that joke, you can PayPal me some money.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Rob.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
Rob.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
Rob.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Rob.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.600
Good.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
Alright.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.600
This game sounds epic.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.080
Again, I hope it's as cool as it sounds.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
That's all I can say.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
We'll see.

21:51.080 --> 21:56.000
Anyways, it doesn't sound very cool to me.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Prototype.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Now that sounds like a cool game.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.640
It's like Grand Theft Auto and Mutants.

22:01.640 --> 22:06.280
RasteelUT in our chat room would like to point out, hey, Tomb Raider Legend and Anniversary

22:06.280 --> 22:07.280
were awesome.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.280
Sure, they were.

22:08.280 --> 22:14.840
I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, a new one, but you know, different strokes

22:14.840 --> 22:16.880
for different folks, right?

22:16.880 --> 22:19.320
You could, everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.120
Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.

22:23.120 --> 22:30.780
Spore is, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous

22:30.780 --> 22:34.120
release on the PC, so awesome.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.880
They can get to play that game, at least, whenever the hell it decides to come out.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.240
I think second quarter, hopefully no later than that.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.120
I'm excited for Spore, yes.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.400
I hope no later than second quarter, either.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.400
I will be creating the Urken Empire.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
You know what's interesting?

22:52.400 --> 22:56.600
There's a thread going on in our forums, if you go to our website, www.orensonshortradio.com,

22:56.600 --> 23:02.600
there's a thread in our forums for the most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008,

23:02.600 --> 23:08.160
and somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which the marketing

23:08.160 --> 23:11.320
probably just hasn't kicked in yet, I'm sure there'll be more later on, but that Spore

23:11.320 --> 23:14.920
was overhyped, and I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough,

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
in my opinion.

23:15.920 --> 23:22.280
Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but I mean, I don't know if our

23:22.280 --> 23:26.400
poster, everybody's welcome to their own opinion, I don't know if the poster saw what I saw

23:26.400 --> 23:28.520
at E3 and stuff, but the game looks amazing.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.680
I think it's going to be deserving of the hype.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.480
I hope so, but the problem is that now my bar is set really high for the game, so if

23:35.480 --> 23:39.560
it isn't that good, I'm going to be disappointed, which kind of sucks for EA and the people

23:39.560 --> 23:42.560
who made Spore, but I guess it's kind of cool, it's going to be a hybrid game, you know,

23:42.560 --> 23:46.240
Mac people complain they don't get enough games, so there you go, EA loves you, so there

23:46.240 --> 23:47.240
you have it.

23:47.240 --> 23:51.400
So, by the way, Loki, I find it interesting that you're doing a report on Macworld, did

23:51.400 --> 23:53.640
you keep tabs on what happened at Macworld?

23:53.640 --> 23:59.720
Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin, but has no

23:59.720 --> 24:06.880
sort of optical drive on it at all, it has one USB port, and so if you want to actually

24:06.880 --> 24:14.400
use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked, you have to buy a $99

24:14.400 --> 24:20.080
drive for it, or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck, probably,

24:20.080 --> 24:27.960
and use its optical drive, I'm sorry, but that's, oh, and $1700, awesome, good job,

24:27.960 --> 24:34.200
Steve, you really know what the consumer wants, crap for lots of money, hooray, but I'm sure

24:34.200 --> 24:38.320
all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit

24:38.320 --> 24:40.760
and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.

24:40.760 --> 24:46.140
Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen, he can send those cards and letters to loki at

24:46.140 --> 24:47.140
orangeontrader.com.

24:47.140 --> 24:50.460
I mean, it's cool that it's really thin and it has a long battery life on it, but

24:50.460 --> 24:55.680
okay, so, like, crap, that whole thing in the envelope, like, putting it in an interoffice

24:55.680 --> 24:58.960
envelope, that's kind of rad, that's like Mission Impossible right there, is what that

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
is.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.120
That's cool, okay, granted, I know it's cool and I know that they're really pushing

25:03.120 --> 25:09.400
for e-distribution stuff in the iTunes and all that kind of stuff, but as a consumer,

25:09.400 --> 25:14.100
say you want to play Spore, you can't install it because there's no optical drive, what

25:14.100 --> 25:19.800
the fuck, I mean, come on, create some really thin optical drive for it, make it a little

25:19.800 --> 25:20.800
bit thicker.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.400
Alright, I'm turning this car around, we've got to get back to the gaming news before

25:23.400 --> 25:29.600
the Apple fans bombard us with their hate mail, I love you, Apple fans.

25:29.600 --> 25:34.280
Street Fighter Online, there's some more news coming out about this, remember, they

25:34.280 --> 25:39.800
licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online,

25:39.800 --> 25:40.800
but it's mouse-controlled.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.080
Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that

25:44.080 --> 25:45.280
were going to be in an MMO.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.000
Right, no, yeah, this is a whole other thing.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.500
I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company

25:51.500 --> 25:55.560
that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse

25:55.560 --> 26:00.460
controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click

26:00.460 --> 26:04.560
to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses and certain combinations and

26:04.560 --> 26:06.320
click you do the special attacks.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.320
That's dumb.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.960
That could be very interesting, I have no idea how that's going to be.

26:10.960 --> 26:15.520
But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about

26:15.520 --> 26:16.520
this game.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.520
Like what?

26:17.520 --> 26:23.920
You really need to like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.

26:23.920 --> 26:24.920
That's pretty awesome.

26:24.920 --> 26:29.840
Little taunts with your cat, you know, you can have like ceiling cat, you know, and stuff

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
like that.

26:30.840 --> 26:36.040
Ceiling cat is watching you lose a fight, I don't know.

26:36.040 --> 26:40.200
Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltec toys.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.400
That is an actual line of toys, so.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.400
And they have the toys for this too, that you can buy.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.400
Nice.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.680
Is that your very own Chun-Li doll?

26:47.680 --> 26:48.680
Yes.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.680
Awesome.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.640
Well the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.

26:53.640 --> 26:58.800
The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.840
For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet, there's no news.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.760
But what we do have some news on is the mailbag.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.580
Every week you guys send us your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and lovely

27:09.580 --> 27:13.600
Dark Sakura rips open the mailbag, picks a few of her favorite emails and reads them

27:13.600 --> 27:15.280
right here on the air.

27:15.280 --> 27:20.000
So for you Justin TV folk that can't see Dark Sakura, she's the mysterious woman off-camera.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.660
We have our element of mystery here on the program.

27:22.660 --> 27:25.680
She's the voice for Justin TV.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.680
Okay.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.680
Alright, anyhow.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
Here it is, the mailbag.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.680
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

27:29.680 --> 27:37.240
I can't read the whole track.

27:37.240 --> 27:42.440
So uh, hello Dark Sakura, Skye, and other dude.

27:42.440 --> 27:47.280
Haha, poor other dude.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.280
That's fine, I'm other dude.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.960
Nathan, you're already getting mails.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.960
What do you think?

27:50.960 --> 27:51.960
Hey, other dude.

27:51.960 --> 27:52.960
Good job.

27:52.960 --> 27:53.960
Welcome to the show.

27:53.960 --> 27:54.960
Forget it.

27:54.960 --> 28:00.360
I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot

28:00.360 --> 28:05.440
in my human growth class stole my PSP slim which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
it.

28:06.440 --> 28:11.040
It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen and it had my podcast

28:11.040 --> 28:20.320
for OLR, one of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you

28:20.320 --> 28:24.720
to people who steal and bullying people, plus the stupid kid, his name is, I'm not gonna

28:24.720 --> 28:25.720
say his name.

28:25.720 --> 28:30.040
It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook, this kid had weed in his bag

28:30.040 --> 28:34.560
along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.560
Kids today?

28:35.560 --> 28:36.560
Jesus.

28:36.560 --> 28:42.480
I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website

28:42.480 --> 28:44.840
worthy of going to geeky things for girls and guys.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.840
It's ThinkGeek.com.

28:45.840 --> 28:46.840
Okay.

28:46.840 --> 28:52.600
Well, the background video for Potsylvania Dances and Choruses is like seen from Advent

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
Children.

28:53.600 --> 28:59.460
I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have every title made, but did you know that Konami had

28:59.460 --> 29:01.600
Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?

29:01.600 --> 29:06.600
Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the

29:06.600 --> 29:09.120
stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.

29:09.120 --> 29:15.320
I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game

29:15.320 --> 29:17.760
Boy, which sucked, by the way.

29:17.760 --> 29:23.220
I love the portable aspect of this, but StepMania has a recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution,

29:23.220 --> 29:27.920
but that's how much I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.

29:27.920 --> 29:28.920
Okay.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.720
This is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist

29:33.720 --> 29:35.520
is going downhill to the mainstream crap.

29:35.520 --> 29:40.040
Okay, only our emails would go from Cocaine in Somebody's Underwear to DDR Disney Channel.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
What the...

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
WTF?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.040
LOL.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.040
There's no punctuation.

29:44.040 --> 29:49.640
The only periods in this are used in a URL.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.020
It's like the run-on sentence that doesn't die.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.240
Maybe he wrote it on his PS...

29:53.240 --> 29:54.840
No, his PSP got stolen.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.840
I don't know.

29:55.840 --> 29:56.840
They had to have found it.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.840
They found it in the guy's underwear.

29:57.840 --> 30:02.000
They found crack in his crack.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.520
Like Hilary Duff in Fallout Boy, that I don't keep it go...

30:05.520 --> 30:07.680
Okay, I'm saying put in a song like...

30:07.680 --> 30:08.680
Okay, okay, whatever.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.680
You know what?

30:09.680 --> 30:10.680
I'm sorry.

30:10.680 --> 30:17.860
The point of this letter is to say don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.860
Thank you.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.360
Thank you for our lesson of the week.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.480
And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in Boredom and says help.

30:24.480 --> 30:30.560
Well, I would say if your PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross, because

30:30.560 --> 30:33.120
that was a good game.

30:33.120 --> 30:37.240
Orange Launch Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.240
That's not a nice thing to do for you.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.240
Or put cocaine in your underwear.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.240
Yes.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.800
Everybody knows you put it in your jacket in the inside liner.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.800
You gotta...

30:44.800 --> 30:45.800
I'm just kidding.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.920
You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
Okay.

30:50.920 --> 30:55.080
Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn

30:55.080 --> 30:56.460
how to put it in your body cavity.

30:56.460 --> 30:57.640
So there you go.

30:57.640 --> 31:03.560
Oh, and this person was called, um, as soon as kind of the email server was acting up.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.560
Punctuation Man.

31:05.560 --> 31:09.160
DS Master 25.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.240
Which is like, it sounds like an old AOL screen name.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.240
Wait, wait, wait.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.240
DS Master?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.240
Uh-huh.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.240
So the guy had his PSP...

31:15.240 --> 31:18.280
I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand,

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
the story is like completely crazy.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.320
Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.

31:22.320 --> 31:27.360
He talks about how much he misses his PSP and he's DS fan.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.360
But I'm bummed.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
Okay.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.360
Next email.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.360
Oh, okay.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.360
Okay.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.360
Okay.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.360
There it is.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
No, that's not going to be it.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.360
No, that can't be it.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.360
Whatever.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.640
Can I read the next email, Rob?

31:39.640 --> 31:40.640
Yes, you may.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.640
Okay, stop.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.640
Love you.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.640
Stop it.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.040
You're all red in the face and you look scary.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.520
This is from Recimo.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.400
Hey, guys!

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
Hi.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.840
I've emailed before regarding the PSN.

31:52.840 --> 31:56.040
I've heard Lucky say that he's waiting for the PSN cards because he doesn't like the

31:56.040 --> 31:59.040
idea of using his debit account to buy games.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.540
I personally like the option because it's more convenient since you don't buy the games.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.600
How about game sharing?

32:04.600 --> 32:10.160
Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give

32:10.160 --> 32:12.180
you a copy of Super Stardust HD.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.760
How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?

32:14.760 --> 32:18.800
It's a relatively easy process and I'd be happy to share my games with you.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.800
So add Recimo to your friends list and we'll talk.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.680
Now, basically, here's why I don't want to...

32:24.680 --> 32:28.640
I'm waiting for those cards is because I'm cheap and I just use a lot...

32:28.640 --> 32:33.480
I get a lot of free games that I turn in the GameStop and get store credit, so I buy those

32:33.480 --> 32:39.480
points cards with store credit and that's why, so I don't actually spend money on it.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.480
That's a good idea.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.480
All right.

32:41.480 --> 32:45.440
Also, I just asked my sister to buy me the Eye of Judgment for Christmas.

32:45.440 --> 32:49.200
I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the eye camera and in the process

32:49.200 --> 32:52.520
helped Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.800
Never going to happen.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
Never going to happen.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.760
I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other

32:58.760 --> 32:59.760
game in all our history.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
Great.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.760
It's still under cheese big time.

33:01.760 --> 33:07.560
We've had guests on to promote Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote...

33:07.560 --> 33:11.800
I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought the 24 of the game because

33:11.800 --> 33:14.440
you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.

33:14.440 --> 33:18.220
No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that

33:18.220 --> 33:22.840
will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a Tingle suit if you can tell a million

33:22.840 --> 33:24.760
of your friends to buy this game.

33:24.760 --> 33:28.920
It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.

33:28.920 --> 33:34.120
It's starting to flat out and in fact in Japan, they only sold a couple hundred units the

33:34.120 --> 33:39.400
other week so it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one million.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.240
DJ Genai now calls it the Brown Eye of Fudgement.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.880
Can I finish reading this email please?

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Yes, you may.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
Sorry.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.280
The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.

33:49.280 --> 33:55.640
I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.640
I can store as much as five gigs of video on the hard drive.

33:58.640 --> 34:04.520
I attached a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1000 mile rally arcade machine

34:04.520 --> 34:10.720
that I recorded with the iCamera.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.760
Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter II machine that I just bought.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.360
She loves my Pac-Man the most.

34:15.360 --> 34:19.800
Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to the show on my PSP.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.040
I made the mistake of listening to the show last week while drinking coffee and ringing

34:23.040 --> 34:24.040
up a customer.

34:24.040 --> 34:27.480
Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow cooking George Foreman grill and I laughed and spat

34:27.480 --> 34:29.360
coffee at my customer's face.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.880
Not good for business.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.640
Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't

34:34.640 --> 34:37.080
have to pay for his merchandise.

34:37.080 --> 34:42.040
Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.000
It's so strange to me the effect this show has.

34:45.000 --> 34:51.640
Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a Bart ride home from San Francisco

34:51.640 --> 34:55.200
or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.960
It's amazing.

34:56.960 --> 34:57.960
What you can achieve.

34:57.960 --> 34:58.960
Yeah, it's mostly Loki's fault.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.960
I'll give him that.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.440
Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.440
It's not nice.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
Yeah, really.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.760
Oh yeah, it's my fault.

35:06.760 --> 35:11.440
And just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting

35:11.440 --> 35:15.640
so that we can see your daughter play a video game.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.160
Or your, sorry, was it goddaughter?

35:18.160 --> 35:19.160
Yeah.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.680
Play video game.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.680
Next email.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
Dun dun dun.

35:22.680 --> 35:28.560
Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorsed DS piracy.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.560
I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.520
500 games in total.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.960
I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.240
Crack firmware on iPod games.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.640
Should you really read this on the air?

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
From Ryan.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.640
Oh, jeez.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.000
You know, here's the thing about that.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.760
I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but

35:48.760 --> 35:51.760
I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.

35:51.760 --> 35:57.040
It's just like, ooh, I could pirate all these games as the FBI is coming to Ryan's house

35:57.040 --> 35:58.040
right now.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.040
Oh, yeah.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.560
We've narrowed it down to Ryan.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
Let's find Ryan.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.560
How many Ryans are there?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.040
Oh, only a couple billion.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.040
Well, wait a minute.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.160
Ryan's not listening to this program.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.160
There's probably only one.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.480
We don't have that many listeners.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.480
Well.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.480
He emailed.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.880
He didn't say he listened to the program.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.240
He just emailed us.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.280
IP tracking.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.280
Let me see.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.280
No.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.280
But anyway, no.

36:19.280 --> 36:22.360
The only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all of the games I don't want to import,

36:22.360 --> 36:23.920
so that's why I have it.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.140
Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.

36:27.140 --> 36:31.280
My husband manages a game crazy.

36:31.280 --> 36:36.960
By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.960
That game sucks.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.600
It's not good at all.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.800
Didn't you say that last week?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.800
No, I bought Drawn to Life last week.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.720
No, I'm pretty sure you reviewed it last week and said it sucked last week.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.120
Well, it sucks.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.120
It still sucks.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.120
It still sucks.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.120
News flash.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.800
Here's your update on Drawn to Life.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.440
Loki, what is the current update on Drawn to Life?

36:57.440 --> 36:58.440
It sucks.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.440
It stinks.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.440
It stinks.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.440
Sorry, Jamie.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.440
Can I read?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.440
Yes.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.440
Please.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.440
Okay.

37:05.440 --> 37:13.400
Hey Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing, okay?

37:13.400 --> 37:16.280
It's A-M-A-Z-I dash Z-I-N-G.

37:16.280 --> 37:21.400
You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
that we all want.

37:22.400 --> 37:27.960
You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with like any, like, I feel, I don't

37:27.960 --> 37:33.360
know, I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other like publishers

37:33.360 --> 37:34.360
out there.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.360
Hey, we'll promote your stuff.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.360
And they listen to it.

37:36.360 --> 37:37.360
No, thanks.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.360
I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.360
Yeah.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.360
Sorry, Jamie.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.360
Okay.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.360
Blame him.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.360
I am.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.360
Can I read now?

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
Yes.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.360
Okay.

37:48.360 --> 37:52.000
I love how the mailbag segment always turns into how many times can we cut off Jamie with

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
a random tension?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.480
How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?

37:55.480 --> 37:56.480
All right.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
Sorry.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.480
Go ahead.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.080
Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd

38:01.080 --> 38:04.740
only listened to before my PSP, even though I live overseas.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.560
I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.600
Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stores.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.640
In one of these in mid-November, I saw the orange box for PS3 on the shelves.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.540
Not knowing the intended release date for this game at the time, I didn't know how big

38:20.540 --> 38:24.320
of an opportunity this was since I can't find that friggin' game here anymore.

38:24.320 --> 38:28.640
I wanted to know what you guys thought of that, and I had a little idea.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.160
DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem

38:32.160 --> 38:33.160
to have anything special.

38:33.160 --> 38:37.960
Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a worsted game of the week segment

38:37.960 --> 38:39.560
or something like that?

38:39.560 --> 38:40.880
Loki is special.

38:40.880 --> 38:44.200
It would give him a chance to blow off some steam lol.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.480
I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a worsted game of the week.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
That's kind of stupid.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.920
That's the worst idea of the week.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
Poor listener.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
Can I finish?

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
Yes.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
Thank you.

38:55.920 --> 39:04.800
Well, that's about it, again, an ego- Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.800
I'm sorry.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.800
You're like, can I finish?

39:06.800 --> 39:13.800
Well, that's just about it.

39:13.800 --> 39:20.200
Bob.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.200
I hate you guys.

39:22.200 --> 39:27.960
Anyway, well, that's about it, again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being- and being

39:27.960 --> 39:32.800
15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.800
Keep up the awesome work.

39:33.800 --> 39:39.600
Wow, this person writes a very freaking good email for being 15, and this is from The Flawless

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
Bolt X.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
P.S.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.480
I bought myself an eye of judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's

39:45.480 --> 39:48.840
two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.840
P.S.S.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.760
Put more crap on the PSP website and never get tired of that-

39:52.760 --> 39:53.760
No!

39:53.760 --> 39:55.860
I will never!

39:55.860 --> 39:57.800
It will stay the way it is.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.040
It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.

40:02.040 --> 40:05.440
Which I think we finally let expire.

40:05.440 --> 40:10.440
Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
D'oh.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.320
So, to keep on reading.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.480
Dear OLR crew, this is Rama from Indonesia, I think- yeah, you've written to us.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.040
Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.880
It's been a while since my last email.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.560
I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.

40:24.560 --> 40:28.880
To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments

40:28.880 --> 40:32.400
about game related content, keep getting crazy then.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.320
To Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game related content and your

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
mocking style.

40:37.320 --> 40:43.600
I love that nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.400
To Dark Sakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week as I

40:47.400 --> 40:51.800
am blind so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.

40:51.800 --> 40:55.160
Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.

40:55.160 --> 40:59.200
By the way guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.720
I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.240
Yes I love playing a recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.480
And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.120
Everyone sent us movies this week.

41:10.120 --> 41:15.200
Yeah, there's links on here.

41:15.200 --> 41:18.960
These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments

41:18.960 --> 41:21.880
and I will add more songs to play, perhaps Dragon Force.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.960
And Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok, hey I love Ragnarok.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.800
More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.600
That's kind of old school.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
That's pretty cool.

41:31.600 --> 41:36.760
Well I'll leave these active in the email box and we'll check them out.

41:36.760 --> 41:41.200
Last email, dun dun dun.

41:41.200 --> 41:45.600
Dear Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki, I am a long time listener but first time writer slash

41:45.600 --> 41:46.600
contributor.

41:46.600 --> 41:51.040
I found your show when iTunes first started offering podcasts and OLR was one of my first.

41:51.040 --> 41:54.880
Right then it was your abbreviated Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.680
I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the

41:57.680 --> 42:00.480
podcasts I was getting and yours was one of the longest.

42:00.480 --> 42:04.880
But recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors

42:04.880 --> 42:10.240
don't notice me on it all day and don't notice or call me on it and have resubscribed.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.400
Now I listen to your show every week.

42:12.400 --> 42:17.560
Anywho, for starters you'll notice that I've attached, I've included an attachment.

42:17.560 --> 42:28.680
I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare To Be Stupid as the background music for your

42:28.680 --> 42:32.520
stupid awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your

42:32.520 --> 42:34.200
dialogue on top of it.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.920
I've included an instrumental version of the song Taken from the Amish Paradise single

42:37.920 --> 42:41.840
– I ripped the file myself so I know it's legit – in case you want to use it in future

42:41.840 --> 42:42.840
segments.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
That's cool.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
Aw, that's nice of you.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
Thank you.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.200
It's still relevant.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.120
Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played

42:53.120 --> 42:54.960
during last week's A Few segment?

42:54.960 --> 42:58.680
I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite

42:58.680 --> 43:04.000
game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others, and I was wondering if you could hook

43:04.000 --> 43:06.880
me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.

43:06.880 --> 43:12.800
It's on the Advent Children soundtrack, but I'll take care of this later.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800
Stay tuned.

43:13.800 --> 43:27.760
How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?

43:27.760 --> 43:31.720
So if I may continue.

43:31.720 --> 43:35.200
Finally the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.

43:35.200 --> 43:39.880
I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney

43:39.880 --> 43:40.880
World.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.880
I'll leave it at that.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.920
Well, nice.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.960
We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.

43:47.960 --> 43:51.400
Keep up the great work, and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as

43:51.400 --> 43:52.720
I can get away with it.

43:52.720 --> 43:55.920
Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.920
Sincerely, Justin the Claw.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.920
P.S.

43:58.920 --> 44:04.960
On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
a game as addicting.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.600
When did that word become an adjective?

44:08.600 --> 44:12.320
According to Merriam-Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.480
Addictive would be the proper adjective form.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.480
You're not the only one to do this.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.480
It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.240
I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.640
I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?

44:23.640 --> 44:24.640
No offense, of course.

44:24.640 --> 44:25.640
I'm just making an observation.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.120
Yes, but it could also be an understood object.

44:28.120 --> 44:30.520
Whatever, dude.

44:30.520 --> 44:34.080
Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.

44:34.080 --> 44:39.600
I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Don't hate.

44:40.600 --> 44:46.800
I'd say the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.880
He learns something new every week here on Orange Lime's radio.

44:49.880 --> 44:53.280
And Freeze Pop emailed us.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.280
Really?

44:54.280 --> 44:56.640
Just with updates to their shows.

44:56.640 --> 44:59.760
Mike, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?

44:59.760 --> 45:00.760
No.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.320
Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of hours.

45:02.320 --> 45:05.360
The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.360
I'm so excited.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.360
That's cool.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.360
I will tell you who it is next week.

45:08.360 --> 45:09.360
No, I won't.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.240
Well, I'll tell you later.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.600
Yes, I will.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.600
In a private room.

45:14.600 --> 45:21.040
Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.

45:21.040 --> 45:25.280
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

45:25.280 --> 45:30.160
Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow

45:30.160 --> 45:31.860
up and self-destruct.

45:31.860 --> 45:32.860
So please don't do that.

45:32.860 --> 45:35.680
And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.280
Alright, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we

45:39.280 --> 45:40.280
haven't even touched.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.280
Right, Logie?

45:41.280 --> 45:42.280
Definitely.

45:42.280 --> 45:47.880
The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced was announced this week.

45:47.880 --> 45:54.780
Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version,

45:54.780 --> 45:59.480
and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network as Bionic Commando

45:59.480 --> 46:00.480
Rearmed.

46:00.480 --> 46:02.060
It looks fucking awesome.

46:02.060 --> 46:04.780
It's going to have two player co-op in the game.

46:04.780 --> 46:08.920
It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw

46:08.920 --> 46:12.400
them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.

46:12.400 --> 46:17.380
New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses, but it's basically

46:17.380 --> 46:19.680
going to follow the original game.

46:19.680 --> 46:21.040
This game looks so hot.

46:21.040 --> 46:24.640
Like I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go

46:24.640 --> 46:26.840
seek out the video for this.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Everybody has it, right?

46:27.840 --> 46:28.960
Yeah, pretty much everyone.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.500
Every big video game site has it.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.500
It looks so hot.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.080
Like, that is the way you redo an old game.

46:33.080 --> 46:35.040
I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.280
Me too, me too.

46:37.280 --> 46:41.640
But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock

46:41.640 --> 46:46.920
the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy or what.

46:46.920 --> 46:50.360
He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.

46:50.360 --> 46:51.360
That's cool.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.360
That is great.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.480
Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?

46:55.480 --> 46:57.920
As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.

46:57.920 --> 47:01.040
I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right, to be politically correct?

47:01.040 --> 47:02.720
Well, they could still be...

47:02.720 --> 47:04.320
His name is now Heiler.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.320
No.

47:05.320 --> 47:11.600
Well, no, he was... he had a different name in the US one anyway, but it was still Hitler.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.840
He looked like him.

47:12.840 --> 47:16.440
They had Master... you know, Master D trying to...

47:16.440 --> 47:17.440
Master D.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.440
Yeah.

47:18.440 --> 47:20.360
I don't know.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.360
I'm excited.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.800
I cannot wait to play this game.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.820
I love the whole idea about you can pick up somebody with your claw and throw them.

47:26.820 --> 47:29.020
That is awesome.

47:29.020 --> 47:30.020
Very awesome.

47:30.020 --> 47:31.400
Still no ability to jump, though.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.920
Why does that make you laugh?

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
I don't know.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
It's just like...

47:34.920 --> 47:38.360
I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, it's just...

47:38.360 --> 47:39.360
It's the claw.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.360
The claw.

47:40.360 --> 47:44.400
See, Justin the Claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?

47:44.400 --> 47:45.400
All right.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.400
Anyway.

47:46.400 --> 47:52.280
If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking

47:52.280 --> 47:54.400
game that kind of moves like an M.C.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.400
Escher piece.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.360
Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to

47:58.360 --> 47:59.840
be making its way to the PlayStation 3.

47:59.840 --> 48:02.960
You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.200
This was one of their kind of, like, wow-em kind of games.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.440
I don't remember if it was that or E3, but it was one of the games that people kind of

48:08.440 --> 48:10.640
went and go, oh, Sony's kind of putting out some cool stuff.

48:10.640 --> 48:11.640
It was E3.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.640
Yeah.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.640
Oh, sorry.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.760
Well, anyhow, it's going to be up, finally, on March 19th.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.680
That's going to be a PlayStation Network download on March 19th.

48:20.680 --> 48:24.800
Only the PSP version had been given a date previously, but you can finally check this

48:24.800 --> 48:28.040
out on March 19th, which, coincidentally, is the same day that you can actually check

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
out the PSP version.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.760
And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.720
If I had a PS3, I'd check it out, but since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and

48:34.720 --> 48:37.120
check it out there.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.120
Sound good, Loki?

48:38.120 --> 48:39.120
Sure.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.520
I'm crashing your party.

48:40.520 --> 48:45.000
All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.840
Very cool.

48:46.840 --> 48:50.720
Well, in other news, crap.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.720
Really?

48:51.720 --> 48:53.360
What kind of crap?

48:53.360 --> 48:58.720
No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.880
So I have to reload show roll.

49:01.880 --> 49:02.880
Oh, that's okay.

49:02.880 --> 49:03.880
We can wait.

49:03.880 --> 49:04.880
You know what?

49:04.880 --> 49:05.880
Give me a second.

49:05.880 --> 49:11.240
I just bid on a Vectrex, by the way.

49:11.240 --> 49:12.240
Cool.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.240
You're going to buy a Vectrex?

49:13.240 --> 49:14.240
Why?

49:14.240 --> 49:17.040
Because someone in Stockton is selling one, and right now the bidding is up to 50 bucks,

49:17.040 --> 49:19.320
and it comes with, like, 10 games.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.320
But what do you want it for?

49:20.320 --> 49:23.600
Just say you have to put it in my desk at work.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.680
Dark Soccer is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.

49:25.680 --> 49:26.680
I don't care.

49:26.680 --> 49:27.680
I'm going to watch it.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.680
I'll do it, too.

49:28.680 --> 49:29.680
I don't care if I win.

49:29.680 --> 49:30.680
I don't win.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.120
I'm not, like, that dead set on getting it.

49:32.120 --> 49:39.600
I bought, like I said, that bit generations game, what's it called, Dot Stream.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.600
It's up, by the way.

49:41.600 --> 49:42.800
All right.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.800
It will be.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.320
Okay.

49:47.320 --> 49:52.520
Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.280
It has 16 games on it.

49:54.280 --> 50:04.680
It will be on PS2 and PSP, and it's going to be, let's see what's on here.

50:04.680 --> 50:14.080
We have Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo

50:14.080 --> 50:20.540
Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician

50:20.540 --> 50:24.680
Lord, but they're not on there.

50:24.680 --> 50:26.560
Actually, yes.

50:26.560 --> 50:31.120
Yes, they are on there, sorry.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.120
We just can't make up our mind.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.400
There are so many SNK classics to choose from.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.440
They are all on there.

50:36.440 --> 50:37.440
Excellent.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.440
What is this for again?

50:38.440 --> 50:39.440
It's a PSP.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
PS2 and PSP.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.440
Oh, nice.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.240
That'll be fun to play on the PSP.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.640
It's nice to see them putting together nice compilations since, you know, SNK doesn't

50:46.640 --> 50:47.640
want to make any new games.

50:47.640 --> 50:48.840
They've never done a compilation before.

50:48.840 --> 50:49.840
Yeah.

50:49.840 --> 50:50.840
They don't want to make new games.

50:50.840 --> 50:55.400
I mean, what's this, like the E compilation that Metal Slug's been in?

50:55.400 --> 50:56.400
SNK compilation?

50:56.400 --> 50:57.400
Unheard of.

50:57.400 --> 50:58.400
Unheard of.

50:58.400 --> 51:06.960
Well, this isn't really a compilation, but Guitar Hero 3, they're going to be doing a

51:06.960 --> 51:14.160
little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say,

51:14.160 --> 51:20.680
on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.

51:20.680 --> 51:27.020
You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live on Guitar Hero 3 where

51:27.020 --> 51:35.520
you can possibly win a LG 50 inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and

51:35.520 --> 51:40.080
a Boom Chair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.080
A Boom Chair?

51:41.080 --> 51:44.600
Yes, Boom Chair.

51:44.600 --> 51:52.440
Also you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller face plate signed by Slash and some other

51:52.440 --> 51:57.040
crap including, I think, some points and whatnot.

51:57.040 --> 52:02.080
But yeah, so that should be cool.

52:02.080 --> 52:05.360
Actually they're saying, it looks like the event's going to go from February 1st through

52:05.360 --> 52:15.960
the 3rd, so yeah, it's 72 hours, but I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12

52:15.960 --> 52:19.920
to 4 isn't a big deal there, whatever.

52:19.920 --> 52:26.160
Oh, and it's for US and Canada only, so sorry everybody else.

52:26.160 --> 52:31.960
Sorry international people, apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.

52:31.960 --> 52:34.160
No, just kidding.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.800
There's probably laws or something, I don't know.

52:35.800 --> 52:40.160
If you want to find out more information on us, go to Xbox.com slash rock your party.

52:40.160 --> 52:43.000
We're going to rock your party.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.880
All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype

52:47.880 --> 52:50.280
line where you can call us and interact with us.

52:50.280 --> 52:54.480
You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give

52:54.480 --> 52:59.440
us a call toll free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

52:59.440 --> 53:03.940
We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.

53:03.940 --> 53:04.940
It's one we don't talk about.

53:04.940 --> 53:05.940
It's not really World of Warcraft.

53:05.940 --> 53:10.560
We don't talk about this game very much, but I believe the most popular MMO in the world,

53:10.560 --> 53:15.840
even above World of Warcraft, is a game called Lineage 2, and you know Lineage 2?

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
Have you played Lineage 2?

53:16.840 --> 53:21.200
No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2, and I'm like, hey, I've heard

53:21.200 --> 53:22.200
of that before.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.200
I have a Coke can.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.200
I do too.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.840
I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.800
I remember them giving that away or something.

53:27.800 --> 53:33.040
Well, anyway, Lineage 2 is one of the most popular MMOs anywhere, and unfortunately,

53:33.040 --> 53:37.120
there's always some tragedy that comes out of MMOs, and this tragedy comes out of Russia,

53:37.120 --> 53:40.120
where there is probably, you know, probably here in America, most people are playing Warcraft,

53:40.120 --> 53:43.160
but I suppose over in Russia, there's much more people playing Lineage 2.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.920
Not to say no one in America is playing it, but anyway.

53:45.920 --> 53:49.020
A Russian man has been charged with murder.

53:49.020 --> 53:54.400
It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.700
There were these two clans.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.880
There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.

53:58.880 --> 54:02.640
It's the Ku Klux Klan.

54:02.640 --> 54:03.640
Yes.

54:03.640 --> 54:04.640
Yeah, wow.

54:04.640 --> 54:05.640
That's all I can say about that one.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.440
There was this, I mean, that should have been the first sign that something was wrong.

54:09.440 --> 54:15.340
There was this clan, and then the Platinum Clan, they were just fighting each other consistently.

54:15.340 --> 54:22.920
The Ku Klux were mostly students, and Platinum were people over 30, and the guy who was killed

54:22.920 --> 54:29.140
here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer, and he had a clan.

54:29.140 --> 54:33.040
There were warriors in the clan, and just before New Year, there was a big old battle

54:33.040 --> 54:38.000
with the Ku Klux, and for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face to face in

54:38.000 --> 54:39.720
the real world.

54:39.720 --> 54:43.960
Sign of trouble right there, and when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten

54:43.960 --> 54:46.720
and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.

54:46.720 --> 54:51.960
Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, I think they have confused the

54:51.960 --> 54:56.400
game in reality, and after we buried him on December 31st, they continued to threaten

54:56.400 --> 54:57.400
us.

54:57.400 --> 55:01.360
The alleged murderer has not shown any regret, and has yet to justify himself.

55:01.360 --> 55:04.360
The alleged murderer, 22 years old.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
Amazing.

55:05.360 --> 55:10.760
Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?

55:10.760 --> 55:18.680
Like is this like a satire website or whatever, but I think it's real.

55:18.680 --> 55:25.120
That's kind of, wow, sad, sad, sad, sad.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.120
That was awful.

55:26.120 --> 55:29.760
No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?

55:29.760 --> 55:36.920
Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3, and apparently someone found goat's say

55:36.920 --> 55:42.080
in Zelda 3.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.720
It was ridiculous, but funny.

55:43.720 --> 55:48.980
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness

55:48.980 --> 55:51.960
or anything else we've talked about tonight, you can go ahead and just call.

55:51.960 --> 55:56.560
Right now, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.560
Let's go to the phones.

55:57.560 --> 56:00.880
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

56:00.880 --> 56:04.840
Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

56:04.840 --> 56:05.840
You there?

56:05.840 --> 56:06.840
Caller?

56:06.840 --> 56:07.840
Hola, bienvenidos a Orangelaunchradio.

56:07.840 --> 56:08.840
Hello.

56:08.840 --> 56:14.200
Okay, apparently our caller's not there.

56:14.200 --> 56:18.720
Make sure you always check your connection with Echo123.

56:18.720 --> 56:19.720
Let's try this one instead.

56:19.720 --> 56:21.720
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

56:21.720 --> 56:24.440
Hello, this is Ion671.

56:24.440 --> 56:29.240
Hello, Ion671, what's on your mind?

56:29.240 --> 56:37.600
Well, I just want to say that I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that parents

56:37.600 --> 56:44.960
don't understand games, because I'm a kid, 16, and both my parents are really into video

56:44.960 --> 56:48.640
games and anime.

56:48.640 --> 56:55.780
My dad just was saying how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.

56:55.780 --> 56:59.280
You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns

56:59.280 --> 57:02.640
and you're very lucky to have them, right?

57:02.640 --> 57:10.760
Yes, because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games

57:10.760 --> 57:13.340
and think that they are the devil's creation.

57:13.340 --> 57:17.840
What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?

57:17.840 --> 57:22.560
Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?

57:22.560 --> 57:29.240
I really don't know, I may have just been lucky.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.000
Rice Princess is asking a question here, hold on.

57:31.000 --> 57:37.320
I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were

57:37.320 --> 57:38.320
younger.

57:38.320 --> 57:47.060
Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games,

57:47.060 --> 57:58.920
but then they grow up with quotation fingers, and there are some people who see a show so

57:58.920 --> 58:04.520
they disregard it or discard it, it's late.

58:04.520 --> 58:11.400
And I would assume that in your household you sound pretty well off for 16, you sound

58:11.400 --> 58:14.920
like you're a smart kid, and obviously you're smart because you're listening to this show,

58:14.920 --> 58:19.520
but video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
turned out okay.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.960
Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?

58:22.960 --> 58:24.360
No.

58:24.360 --> 58:29.080
Then you've probably turned out a-okay, so what do you think other families can learn

58:29.080 --> 58:30.800
from yours?

58:30.800 --> 58:39.360
Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because

58:39.360 --> 58:45.000
every time they mention a game called Grand Theft Auto, so I'm wondering why parents are

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
buying it for their kids.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
That's a good question.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.680
Hey, I've got another question for you.

58:48.680 --> 58:51.280
Do your parents play the games with you?

58:51.280 --> 59:00.180
Oh yeah, well not of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually

59:00.180 --> 59:04.720
kick my ass at burnout, he is a burnout machine.

59:04.720 --> 59:08.520
That's kind of cool, like you guys have fun as a family together playing the games, right?

59:08.520 --> 59:09.520
Mm-hmm.

59:09.520 --> 59:13.400
And how's that different from card game night or board game night or whatever, you know?

59:13.400 --> 59:15.240
I don't know, it's just kind of the new way of doing things.

59:15.240 --> 59:17.120
It's just way cooler, that's what it is.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.680
It's way cooler.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.680
We're all going to come over- It's just the next generation.

59:21.680 --> 59:25.280
We're all going to come over to your house someday and have a party, okay?

59:25.280 --> 59:26.280
Because your parents sound like they'd be cool with that.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.600
Well, I wouldn't afford it, so good luck at that.

59:28.600 --> 59:33.640
All right, well hey, you know, Jamie and I are in Disney World, so don't bite your tongue,

59:33.640 --> 59:34.640
sir.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.640
We might be in your neck in the woods.

59:36.640 --> 59:37.640
Okay.

59:37.640 --> 59:38.640
One last thing?

59:38.640 --> 59:41.320
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

59:41.320 --> 59:46.200
I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all his PSP stuff.

59:46.200 --> 59:47.200
Really?

59:47.200 --> 59:51.360
And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.

59:51.360 --> 59:58.280
Okay, well I'm very sorry, so look, we disavowed all knowledge of that email and anything was

59:58.280 --> 59:59.280
ever said.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.280
Okay.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280
Why would he sue?

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.640
I mean, seriously, I mean, he's the one breaking the law.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640
It's a joke.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.840
And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.560
See, we didn't do that before, so we ought to sue you.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.560
Okay.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.840
I just said I know him.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.560
I don't say I know him personally.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560
Oh, okay.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560
Oh, snap.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
Here, I flipped that right back at you.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:25.440
Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440
You did.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.280
Rob got majorly pwned.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.840
That was indeed a zing, Rob.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.840
You got a zing.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.840
Alright, for that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840
Bye.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Okay, bye.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Alright, have a good week.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
That was a good call.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.080
That was a really good call.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.200
That was a very good call.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.240
One of our better calls.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.600
I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.960
to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.800
Invite yourself, Rob.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.280
My parents will buy beer.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.680
I hope they buy good beer.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.760
Alright, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760
Who's this?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.880
Hello, hi, hi.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880
Hello?

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880
Hello?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880
Sorry about that.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
I'm going to make a phone.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880
Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.880
You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880
What's up?

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
How's that?

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.880
Ah, much better.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880
What's on your mind?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880
Introduce yourself.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880
Yes.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
Introduce yourself.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880
Hi, I'm Rob.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880
Hey, Rob.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.880
Hi.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880
Hi, I'm Rob.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880
Hi.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880
How's Rob?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880
I'm Rob.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880
Hi, I'm Rob.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880
Yes.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880
Introduce yourself.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.940
Oh, by the way, sorry, dude.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.940
Okay, I don't know.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:47.460
I'm just hanging out and listening on the east coast, I guess.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460
What's your name?

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:53.600
Or you have an online name, or?

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.220
I have an email in the chat room.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220
Okay, cool.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.800
Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:18.400
Is there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.000
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Oh, do you mind if I...

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.720
I got a cool dad in the same room.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.720
Do you want to talk to him?

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720
Okay.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720
Hello?

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720
Hello?

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.720
Hello.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720
Hi, identify yourself.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720
Hello.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.720
Hi, who's this?

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.720
This is Okuda.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.720
Hello, Okuda!

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.720
Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.720
I mean, we're just an internet radio show.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.720
Nothing to be scared of, right?

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.720
Right, Okuda?

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.720
Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.720
Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.720
What's on your mind?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.720
I was wondering...

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720
I play World of Warcraft a lot.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.720
I was wondering...

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.720
Do you like private servers?

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.720
What's your opinion on private servers?

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.720
On crowded servers?

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.720
Private servers.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.720
Oh, private servers.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.720
I don't know much about them.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.720
I know they're out there.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.720
I've understood it's kind of a risky thing to do.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.720
Once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.720
I don't know.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.720
But private servers are kind of corny.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.720
I mean, yeah, you can do...

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.720
I wasn't there a cash file.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720
Oh, you can dump a cash file.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.720
I guess.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.720
But anyway, sorry, go ahead.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.720
No, I'm just saying you can mod it to be super strong or make all this money and stuff.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.720
But that makes the game boring to me.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.720
I don't know.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.720
You can have the new patch.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.720
You can have the new patch.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
You can have the new patch. I'm there.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.720
Only on the private servers.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720
Really?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720
I have three characters.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.720
Oh my god, you're perfect. Get away from me.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.720
Stop sitting next to me.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.720
They're all female dwarves.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.720
Oh my...

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.720
Get especially away from me.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.720
That doesn't even make sense.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.720
But private servers...

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.720
I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:23.720
You need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at two in the morning on a private server.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:31.720
So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, you can't really progress very far, I would think.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.720
I don't know. Do you have a difference of opinion?

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.720
Akuda, do you play on a private server?

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.720
Yeah.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.720
And how do you like it?

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720
Yeah, I play on a private server.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.720
Um, yeah...

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.720
Sorry, there's a huge lag.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.720
Oh, it's probably JustinTV screwing everything up. That's alright.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:57.720
Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous, hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.720
Thanks for having me.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.720
No problemo.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.720
You got to say hi.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720
I think they're handing the phone back. I'm not sure.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.720
Okay.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.720
Alright. Have a good one, you guys.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.720
Alright.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.720
Okay, thanks for having us. Have a good night.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.720
You too.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.720
Smoke another bud.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.720
That's terrible, Rob.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.720
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. They're just nervous. God, come on.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.720
No.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.720
But if they use smoke bud, they'll relax.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.720
No, we're not encouraging that, though. We would never...

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.720
No, but if you feel so inclined, it would help you relax.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.720
Alright, look, we give people shit, that's what we do.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.720
Like, we're going to give our next caller.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.720
Who's this?

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.720
It's me, Rama. What's up, everyone?

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.720
Hello, Rama.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720
What is up, Rama, speaking of giving people shit?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.720
Not much.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.720
No, that was me that called the first time, but my headset was acting really retarded.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720
Sorry about that.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.720
Yeah, echo 123 next time.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720
That was the headset. I think that was user error, Rama.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.720
What's on your mind?

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.720
Oh, not too much. I want to talk about the whole PlayStation Dusty article you told earlier.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.720
Dust Cap 3.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.720
What about it?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.720
Pretty much.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:16.720
Check this out. I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now at theconsumers.com.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.720
I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.720
As somebody who's been in a technical field for about ten years, even in the worst conditions,

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.720
I have never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty, okay?

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.720
So, obviously, this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:48.720
Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website that supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.720
It's coming from consumers.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.720
They're both in that same thing.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.720
Their blogs are also very similar looking.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.720
I actually kind of like Consumerist.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:05.720
They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.720
But anyhow, sorry, I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720
That's fine.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.720
We're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.720
Was this person smoking right in front of it, or was it just poorly ventilated?

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.720
Because I look at Loki's house, and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that,

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.720
and Dark Soccer's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that, so I don't think it's the machine.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.720
I think there's something the person is doing.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.720
That's what it is.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.720
Is the cat sleeping on it at night?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.720
He's just stuck in somewhere where he could collect dust in the basement or something.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.720
Now, the next link I posted off the Consumerist, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.720
If you read the comments, you find that the guy that complained about this is an actor,

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.720
and now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.720
And I also posted a link from PlayStation.net about it.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.720
The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720
Yeah.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720
Why?

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.720
Supposedly this guy is a pay... he was paid to do this.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.720
This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.720
PS3, you're so dirty.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720
You've been very naughty, Sony.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720
You're a naughty person.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.720
I paid him to do it.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.720
What the crap?

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:28.720
Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3...

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.720
Who paid him to... oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.720
It wasn't Sony that did it.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.720
Somebody paid him to do it.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.720
He's... okay.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.720
I'm reading this from Play3.net.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.720
End of the story? No.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.720
It only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit-part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.720
Now, it is possible that this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:55.720
These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career, or paid as part...

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.720
I know, m'lady? M'lady?

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.720
What a crappy word to use.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.720
Paid as a part of the much-cited Microsoft dirty tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720
Ah, what the hell?

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720
I don't... that seems kind of low.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.720
I mean, I don't think... you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da,

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.720
this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.720
So, I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Nathan has a question.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.720
Oh, yeah, sure, Nathan.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.720
I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.720
You're not... it's not supposed to be an act on the news.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.720
Oh, it was Fox News.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.720
That could be...

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720
Yeah, fair and balanced.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720
Well, you know what?

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.720
When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720
Even porno?

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720
Yeah, sure, porno.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.720
Oh, Skinimax.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720
I don't know. Why do people do Skinimax films?

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720
I don't know.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Well, Rama, I don't know.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.720
What do you think of this?

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.720
Who do you think did the setup?

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.720
I honestly don't know because I read all of the comments.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.720
He claims that this is legit.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:11.720
To be perfectly honest, I don't know, but I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.720
I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720
That's what I honestly think.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720
That's kind of a mental problem.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.720
It gets dusty, but we've had stuff set up for like three, four months.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.720
We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months and it's not even that dirty.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.720
It looks like it's nearly new and we don't even touch it.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720
I think he just has issues.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720
I think that's what it boils down to.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.720
Cleaning issues.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.720
Yeah, cleaning issues.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.720
Maybe he lives in a toilet.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720
Who knows?

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.720
Where it would get especially dusty.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.720
That makes a lot of sense, Rob.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720
Shut up. I hate you.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.720
You shut up, you m'lady.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720
I hate you.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.720
Children, children behave.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720
So I get for reading fast.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720
No.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.720
All right.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.720
Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.720
I will be making a trip out to the West Coast.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720
When?

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720
Yay.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.720
Looking at Fourth of July weekend.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.720
Awesome.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.720
Woohoo.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.720
Well, we will be seeing you then.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720
Oh, yeah.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.720
Oh, yeah.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Clean the book hard.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720
End all time.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720
All right.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720
All right, Rama.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:16.720
We got to let you go.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.720
We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720
One last question.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720
I'll get out of here.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720
Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.720
Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720
I will give you three guesses.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.720
It starts with a J.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.720
I love you.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.720
All right.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.720
Take care, Rama.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.720
All right.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Bye.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
Bye.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.720
I like to point out it was an empty bottle of gold schlager, too.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720
Just so you know.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.720
Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of gold schlager.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, Skype Line 1877, Game OLR.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.720
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Who's this?

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720
Hi, there.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720
This is Ross Deal UT.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720
Hello, Ross Deal UT.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.720
What is on your mind?

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Not much.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:07.320
You know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO freaks who

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.720
started fighting with each other.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.520
I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.160
I mean, it was that unreal.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.320
Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight or a clan fight or whatever?

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320
I would not want to meet in real life.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.520
Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.120
I guess, I don't know.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.320
Anyway, that reminds me of a recent post on Kotaku.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.320
Apparently, the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on Internet

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.320
cafes and stuff like that.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.320
Let me put a link on the chat.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:49.820
Basically, what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.320
cafes because China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320
Hello?

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320
Yeah, no, no, no.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320
Sorry.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.520
I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.520
Let's see.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.120
It looks like you're linking us to Kotaku who ran this report.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.540
Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:13.360
clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:19.720
of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal Internet cafes, Xinhua said.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:25.020
The crackdown netted 1407 computers while seven people were arrested and nearly 5,000

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.360
Internet accounts closed.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.680
Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.680
Wow.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.520
Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:41.920
Normally, I'm not forcing limits on Internet time, but damn, it really sounds like China

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920
has got a real problem.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.920
Well, most of Asia, really.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.000
Well, these cafes sound a little bit shady anyway.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.440
Even in the U.S., you have to register your business with the government.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.460
That's because we want taxes.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:59.120
Something similar could happen here.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.960
If the government found a business running illegally that was making all this money under

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.960
the table, they'd send the IRS after their assets.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.960
They go about it a different way.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:15.520
You wouldn't see the SWAT team going in there, but it would be a civil crime.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:21.000
Kind of similar, I don't know, but yeah, it's very interesting that it's become that ramp.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.640
Thirty computers crammed into a 40 square meter room, that's not very big.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.400
Yeah, I was about to say that.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.520
That sounds like people are really crammed in there.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.320
That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.400
I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400
That's an interesting image right there.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400
For real.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.040
That's a very interesting image.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.680
That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.680
All right, go ahead.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680
Sorry, anyway.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:56.920
There's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the Xbox 360 failures.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920
Give me a second.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920
I'll pop up another link.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.680
I think I heard about this.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.420
This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.440
is why they're paying for it, right?

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.000
Well, I'm posting the link now.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:21.920
It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.660
is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:32.400
It sort of makes me wonder the legitimacy of it.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.680
I don't know if you're reading it now.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.820
It's kind of a lengthy article.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:39.360
It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site they ran this.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.480
It looks like a story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.120
the Xbox 360 red ring of death failures.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.400
It was an interview conducted via email.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.960
That's already a big red flag.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.840
I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.040
the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.320
He was the same guy who was doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.320
Who knows?

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.880
I mean, it's funny you mention that, because Rama was just talking about that.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.400
It could just be muddling on both sides.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400
It's an attempt.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400
It's Reggie.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.080
Reggie Fils-Aime is doing it all, apparently.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.560
No, I don't know.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.360
I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.120
I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article,

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.920
because honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 red rings of death are caused because

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.740
Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.400
not really news to me.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.920
I mean, to be honest.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920
I think most of us...

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.640
That's been everybody's note about the X-Climbs for some time.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.960
So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.960
to save money?

01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.960
Not really.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:00.960
That's no surprise.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960
Does it make it right?

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.120
I mean, but I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.040
I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of trying to correct the issue, really.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.200
They made a boo-boo.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200
They're fessing up to it.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.080
I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
He's got an Instagram.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.600
Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.480
I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.480
I suppose that's true.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480
So, yeah, I don't know.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480
I'm sorry, what?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:31.440
I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but I

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.480
guess as long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.040
And there are some people who still do have working ones, but honestly, you tell me the

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.240
failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.040
It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040
I don't know.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040
I don't know.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.440
Well, the problem is with, when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.560
broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.560
They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system works.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Good point.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560
You're right.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560
You're right.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.000
People don't complain when things are working.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
You're right.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
That's a good point.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yeah.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.360
Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:15.000
We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.560
in for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:26.000
Apparently, and here's one more link, the Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
content.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:34.120
Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, with Devil May Cry 4, we feel that we've created a game

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.760
that has a huge amount of content right out of the box without the need to download extra

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760
content.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.720
I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.720
Yeah.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.880
You know what?

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.280
Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.520
You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.400
since we have some new people, thanks to Justin TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:04.440
take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.020
downloadable content.

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.600
When you are unlocking something that was already on the disc that you paid for, that

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.120
should be considered pay-to-unlock content, such as what the Stages and Beautiful Katamari

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120
write.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.120
Those are pay-to-unlock content.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.860
Whereas, when you download the Rock Band songs, that is true downloadable content.

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.160
You're not unlocking something already on the disc.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.240
I think if Capcom is taking a stand going, you know what?

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.840
This game is too complex.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.040
We can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.040
content.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040
I say applause.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040
I don't know if there's so much you can do, but I think that just, you know, hello?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.720
Yeah, go ahead.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:46.520
I think it's just that this is their game, and personally I applaud them for it, because

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.880
we do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content,

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:57.880
the Hello Horse Armor, and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.800
It's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game, and this is what it's

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800
going to be.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.480
You don't see enough of that nowadays.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.200
I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200
It's a good one.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.880
Ross Dio, we've got to let you go, because we've got to wrap up the show, but thank you

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.880
so much for calling.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.880
We'd love to hear from you.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880
Okay.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.880
Have a good one, man.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.880
Have a good one, buddy.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880
Take care.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.880
Bye-bye.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880
Bye-bye.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.480
I like how Ross Dio kind of shared all the stories that we seem to miss otherwise on

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480
tonight's program.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480
Kind of interesting.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480
It's really nice of him.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480
It was.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480
Anyway, sorry, guys.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.900
I know there were a ton of people still trying to get through, but we are just running along

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.900
on time tonight.

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.200
We want to get out of here at a decent hour, so we're going to go ahead and shut off the

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.920
Skype line for tonight.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.600
We'll take more calls next week, though, as always, so please tune in live.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.280
Meanwhile, we're going to go around and see if there are any last-minute stories.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.000
Dark Sakura, Loki, I have nothing.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Do you guys?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Nope.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Loki?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Yeah.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Yeah.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.580
Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff, one of which is this game that I just found

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.880
called Line Golfer.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:57.120
Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses almost, and it's actually pretty

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.120
fun.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:05.020
You can find it at, let's see here, this website called candystand.com, and you can check it

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.020
out there.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.020
Wait.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.020
Isn't that Lifesavers and stuff?

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.020
Isn't that their website, Candystand?

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.020
I don't know.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.020
Or am I crazy?

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.020
I don't know.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.020
I forget.

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020
Maybe.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:20.320
No, it is wrigleyscandystand.com, the hottest games online, they say.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.380
And it's pretty fun.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:27.320
You can create your own courses, and you can upload them and play all these different courses

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.080
and stuff.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.800
Let's see here.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.040
Then other stuff that's kind of funny.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:42.680
Apparently, gamegirl.com ran a top seven geek panties for girls.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.480
Oh God, I heard about this.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.640
How many does Irene own?

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.400
That's what I want to know.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.000
Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
on there or not.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.840
I don't think so.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.760
Number six would be the password protection panties.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.800
It says username and password.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800
That's kind of funny.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800
Wow.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.140
Bonus stage panties.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.380
I agree with the Halo Master in chat.

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.720
Best radio show ever.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.060
Space Invader panties would be number four.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:17.880
Number three is achievement unlocked panties.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.560
Number two, classic Nintendo panties.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.120
Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.120
I don't think so.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.120
These can't be legitimate.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.120
And then Mario panties.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.120
Mario panties.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.280
Hooray.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280
Other fun stuff.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:37.500
There's a rumor that when Smash Brothers Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that Super

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.560
Smash Brothers Brawl will be released on the virtual console as well.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
Makes sense.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.280
So we'll see.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.840
I don't really know if there's much to that.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:56.640
Apparently there's a rumor from website gameeater.com or gameeater, whatever, that Hillary Clinton

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.120
is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.120
Bullshit.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.120
No, hold on, hold on.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.760
It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her, kind

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.880
of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:17.280
Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.720
Why would you want that prostitute?

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.280
That doesn't make sense.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.240
Whatever, guys, whatever.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.280
Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.400
The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me, and after being killed

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.160
with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160
That's fucked up.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.160
That's got to be a lie.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160
That would be funny.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.520
That has some stupid kid's idea of the funny.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.520
But you know what?

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.520
Rama in chat at chat.org.trader.com sums up my thoughts perfectly.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.200
Do not want.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.280
And then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280
That's it?

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280
I found something pretty.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280
All right, what's that?

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:04.960
Eurogamer, which is one of the places that I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:12.280
of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out, and Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.840
Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chat room.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840
All right.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.480
It's very, very pretty, even though they're getting the most awful person in the world

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.440
to play them, but oh well.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.440
All right.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.840
Well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so we can wrap up this show.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.520
Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming to the show.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.520
We haven't had guests here in forever, even though you guys didn't talk much, but maybe

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.520
it's because we have a mic shortage.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520
I don't know.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.420
But I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless, and thank you for the pie.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420
That was much appreciated.

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.560
Do you have any final thoughts, Sir Nathan?

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.560
No.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.400
All right, Rice Princess, any final thoughts?

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.400
Yes.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.140
All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:56.920
My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.080
my computer can actually do.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.080
Yay.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.680
An SLI.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.240
My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.340
on Justin TV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.040
a couple weeks to work out the bumps.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.960
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:23.940
Well, someone in our chat room said the pie is true.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:24.940
The pie is true.

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:25.940
The pie is delicious.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.400
That's what it really boils down to.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.960
At the end of Orange Lawn's radio, there will be pie.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960
Wow.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.000
All right, forget it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.880
All right, thank you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading and supporting independent

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880
podcasting.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.360
We wouldn't be here without you guys because we have no big magazine supporting us or any

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.900
big gaming company, so this truly is an independent effort, and we appreciate it.

01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.720
If you like what you hear, it's free.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.520
All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.760
That's how we slowly spread the word.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.920
If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:05.960
or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Digg, whatever, or even if you do tell two

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.840
people, you can also leave a five-star review.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840
It's okay.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.720
I want to thank... We had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.360
that put those very kind reviews.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.080
Really appreciate it.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.120
Until next time, I'm Rob Roberts.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120
That's Dark Soccer.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:41.440
This is Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
