00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, January 27th, 2008, Fox News ruffles the feathers of the gaming community,

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Sega Master System games are poised to make a comeback, and is the Gizmondo about to be revived?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'm here with you every week, and also here with you every week, usually.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Usually she's punctual. It's the one and only...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm here early, Rob.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
DarkSakura, she was actually here very early tonight.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I wasn't very early, but I was on time.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
She was very punctual. She was quite punctual.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
She gets an A for her attendance tonight.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
And I brought specials.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You did. You brought specials.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And we'll go ahead and introduce specials.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
She's very special to us, actually, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
It's one of our official Orange Lounge Radio lesbians.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Give it up for Chris.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Hello, how are you?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I am fine. How are you doing, Chris?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
I've had coffee with lots of sugar, and before that we had frozen yogurt with lots of sugar.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
So I'm getting ready to blow.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You're happy!

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Now, if I'm not mistaken, this may very well be your last appearance on Orange Lounge Radio for a little while.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I mean, not like ever, ever, but for a little while, right?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm going to desperately, desperately try.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
But to come back here, because I've been in, for those of you who do not know,

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
I've been going back and forth from LA to my home in the South Bay, Los Gatos,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
because my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
And I've been kind of being their chauffeur to whatever it is they need and stuff like that.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
So I've kind of been their little slave, which I don't mind.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
But sorry to hear about the family circumstance. It's rough, I know.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
It's hard, but you know what, people are old, and that kind of stuff happens.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
So I've been going back and forth, and I'm also moving to Madison, Wisconsin in March,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
if all goes according to plan for school, and I have a girlfriend there, so pluses.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
And it's got to be someone very special to get you to move from sunny, warm, wonderful California to,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
oh my fucking lord, it's cold, Wisconsin.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
No, no, the accent is kind of like this, you know.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Awesome.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, you've got to get yourself one of those. That's all feel nice.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, you kids have fun. I know you guys are going to have a lot of fun together, living together and stuff.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But I'm going to be trying to come back more and more.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
You better.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Because I actually, we got a new addition to the family.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh. Oh, really?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
My dad's girlfriend gave birth to a little girl.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Aw.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
On the 17th.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
And you're going to visit your little sister once in a while.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
All right.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So she's adorable and crying and driving her mother up the wall.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, on a more, on a...

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
That takes a whole lot, doesn't it?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Uh-huh.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Going back to games and gaming type like conventions for a little bit,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
are you going to be going to the Chicago convention this year, Ayson?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I am. I'm going to Ayson.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
You are.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
You know, actually, some of our listeners are really trying to get us to go, and I'm going to try to make it happen.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
So...

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Good.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, I definitely will come.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, I'll have an apartment, so you guys are willing to sit.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We'll have a pillow fight. It'll be fun.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, boy.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Well, for those...

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
There you go, the official OLR battle royale pillow fight.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
That's what we need to do.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I was actually going to try and get a press pass to see if I can do some interviews for you guys.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I had a really cool idea, which I want to discuss with you later.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
But for those of you who are going to Ayson, I will be there.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
I'll be at the art table with my girlfriend, Megan, and a bunch of other really awesome artists that are going to show up.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Awesome.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah, so look for me.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, I'll have blue hair and stuff.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I'm very easy to spot.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
We haven't introduced the one and only...

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Let me switch mics for you so he has his normal back.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
The one and only tech master, Loki.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Hi.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
How you doing, Loki?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Good.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I finished the sandwich.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Sorry I ignored you for a little bit there, but, you know, lesbians cater a little more to our demographic than you do.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I know.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm just kidding.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
How...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Where would we be without Loki?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Come on.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Loki's a very important part of this show.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You having a good week, Loki?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I had an okay week.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
All right.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Let's go ahead and move on just a little bit.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
But it's tradition to let the ladies go first.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
So, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
It involved some cooking mama.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
It involved a lot of burnout because I had to watch Dan play it and crash a bunch of stuff.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
And it involved a whole crap ton of Ragnarok Online.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Of course.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
And I found another game that I'm thinking about checking out, thanks to Heather.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
What's that?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Perfect World.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Free play, free download, and according to her, it takes everything...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, and this is her perspective.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.560
Took everything she hated about World of Warcraft and everything she hated about Guild Wars

05:16.560 --> 05:19.000
and removed them and combined the best parts.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Interesting.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Do you have any examples?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Like, what types of things?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Or...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't know.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
She was really drunk.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Okay.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.160
Well, you'll know more...

05:27.160 --> 05:28.920
You'll know more about it when you're able to get in there.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
It was really nice.

05:29.920 --> 05:35.200
On top of that, certain wear classes get, like, flying pets.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.760
They look like gigantic manta rays.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.760
And you get your...

05:38.760 --> 05:41.280
You can get the nether rays in World of Warcraft, to be fair.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.040
And you get your mounts at level 40.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.040
That's not bad.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.040
What was it called again?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.040
Perfect World.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.040
Perfect World.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.040
It's a Malaysian MMO.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.040
But it's free.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
Completely free.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
Download.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
Free everything.

05:53.040 --> 06:00.600
In this world, the Erwin family is writhing because of the thought of flying rays.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.240
You're horrible.

06:02.240 --> 06:08.160
Actually, that also kind of brings me back to, was it, if you're living in Las Vegas...

06:08.160 --> 06:10.760
We can't stop here.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.760
This is backcountry.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.720
DarkSakura, anything else you'd like to share about your gaming week?

06:17.720 --> 06:21.120
It wasn't a game, but we watched Torchwood, and it was hot.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.720
I found some other friends of mine.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.360
I would have never guessed.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.600
They were talking to me, and they're like, Rob, you have to watch Torchwood.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.040
It's the hottest show on TV.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.160
You realize that this is a Doctor Who spin-off, right?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.160
No, I do.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
That's what I said.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.160
I was like, you know it's a Doctor Who spin-off, right?

06:35.160 --> 06:38.640
I said, one of my friend girls is obsessed with this series.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.640
And they're like, oh yeah.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.640
We like Doctor Who, too.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.640
I was like, oh, cool.

06:41.640 --> 06:46.920
If you take Torchwood and rearrange it, it spells Doctor Who.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.720
Before we get to some more gaming weeks, I'm assuming you're all finished.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
Yes?

06:50.720 --> 06:51.720
All done?

06:51.720 --> 06:52.720
Yes.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.000
I just want to read some comments from the chat.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
What?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Africa.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Chat.orangemunchradio.com.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Let's see.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
What was this?

07:00.000 --> 07:04.160
Oh, Tiger Claw asks, Skye, next week is the Super Bowl.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.080
Will there be a show by then?

07:07.080 --> 07:08.960
Damn right there's going to be a show during the Super Bowl.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.960
I could care less about the Super Bowl, so absolutely we'll be doing a show, because

07:13.960 --> 07:14.960
you know what?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.460
I think some folks out there would like to have some alternative programming to the Super

07:17.460 --> 07:18.460
Bowl.

07:18.460 --> 07:19.460
So you know what?

07:19.460 --> 07:23.360
We have the Puppy Bowl.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.520
Yes, we do have the Puppy Bowl, and don't they have the Kitty Bowl usually, too?

07:26.520 --> 07:31.640
They're doing it, and they're doing a $25 sushi buffet at the place on that day, and

07:31.640 --> 07:33.640
I'm thinking about going.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
Nice.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.640
Nice.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.640
Let's see.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
What else?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
Other comments from chat.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
Let's see.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.320
Tiger Claw just heard that Black Wolf is going to do a show on Saturday next week to the

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Super Bowl.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Well, that's Black Wolf.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
That's Bobby's project.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
He likes sports, though, see?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.320
Yeah, Bobby can watch it.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
Just like my roommate.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.240
I'm sure my roommate's going to have some guys over here watching the Super Bowl.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.600
We'll be out here doing our nerdy show.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
All right.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
Let's get back to games.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.120
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:54.120 --> 07:59.360
My gaming week was pretty much just Burnout Paradise.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.080
I played countless hours of it.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.320
Actually, it's not countless because I took a look at my stats there, and I actually have

08:06.320 --> 08:10.480
ten and a half hours put into it, but it's awesome.

08:10.480 --> 08:16.080
You keep finding new things in there, and actually, I found quite a bit of the hidden

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
stuff.

08:17.080 --> 08:24.880
I have almost all the jumps done, and about half the billboards and half the smashes,

08:24.880 --> 08:29.760
and I'm working to get my Class A license, and haven't played online yet, because the

08:29.760 --> 08:35.880
servers were giving me crap earlier this week, so I just kind of avoided them, but I may

08:35.880 --> 08:39.440
try some online stuff a little later.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.440
It's fun, though.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.040
Are you going to play me online?

08:42.040 --> 08:45.320
Because I got my copy, so you'll kill me, but that's all right.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
No, it'll be fun.

08:46.320 --> 08:51.960
There's a lot of stuff you can do, like co-op, challenges and stuff, so that might be fun.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.760
And then I got a Vectrex.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.440
That's right, you won the Vectrex that you were talking about last week, huh?

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
Yes.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
How did that go?

09:00.440 --> 09:01.680
It went okay.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.680
I have it on my desk now, and people are like, oh my god, I remember that!

09:06.680 --> 09:10.520
And to be honest, it's just kind of a desk piece, you know, I don't really play much

09:10.520 --> 09:11.760
on it.

09:11.760 --> 09:17.560
I did try some of the games that came with it, Star Trek, the game.

09:17.560 --> 09:22.960
I understand it about as much as I understood it before, which is not very much.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.280
I don't like that game at all.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.480
I did play Frenzy, though, I think it's called Frenzy, no, Berserk, I'm sorry.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.000
Same game, though.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.520
But that was pretty fun.

09:33.520 --> 09:40.680
And then there was this game, Hyperchase, it might not have been Hyperchase, but it

09:40.680 --> 09:43.280
was some sort of racing game, and that was kind of fun.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.760
And then they had, of course, the one that's built into it, which is Space Minds, and it

09:47.760 --> 09:49.840
was pretty cool.

09:49.840 --> 09:55.360
But the only thing is, originally I had planned on leaving it on all day long, just to leave

09:55.360 --> 09:58.940
it at my desk and people can come by and take a look at it and have some sort of demo loop,

09:58.940 --> 10:02.840
but none of those games ever had a demo loop, and it also makes a really annoying buzzing

10:02.840 --> 10:05.600
sound, so I was like, crap, I can't do that.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.020
So I just turned it on when people wanted to take a look at it.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.960
Also one of the controllers is broken, so I had to fix that.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.120
But I can get a new controller for like ten bucks if I really want to.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.440
They actually make quite a few games.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.360
People are still making games for that system.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
Really?

10:19.360 --> 10:20.360
I had no idea.

10:20.360 --> 10:26.220
All homebrew stuff, of course, but there's new carts coming out as of last year still,

10:26.220 --> 10:30.200
so that's kind of neat, I guess.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.040
A complete waste of money, but it's neat, nonetheless.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.560
It's nice to have.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.440
And then, let's see, what else did I get?

10:40.440 --> 10:46.840
I haven't gotten it yet, but I have a copy of, God, I don't remember what it's called

10:46.840 --> 10:47.840
now.

10:47.840 --> 10:52.560
It's one of the bit generation titles, but that one's coming, hopefully I get to play

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
that this week.

10:53.560 --> 11:00.160
And, what else, oh, I got, I'm actually planning on selling my Sega Saturns, because I found

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
an emulator that works perfectly on my computer.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.600
I didn't even know you had a Sega Saturn.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
I have two.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
What?

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
Yeah.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
Wow.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.240
Well, I bought them at a garage sale, not a garage sale, at a Danayo's flea market,

11:13.240 --> 11:18.160
because for some reason I wanted to play Panzer Dragoon Zui, because I thought, oh my God,

11:18.160 --> 11:21.560
it was so awesome, I love that game, and I went back and played it, and I'm like, wow,

11:21.560 --> 11:26.040
this wasn't very good at all, but I hate that.

11:26.040 --> 11:32.000
I need to get a stall and some other stuff, but yeah, it's okay, but since now that I

11:32.000 --> 11:36.640
have something that will actually play them on the PC, I don't really need them anymore,

11:36.640 --> 11:41.480
so there's this local game shop, which I've been meaning to go to for weeks now, called

11:41.480 --> 11:47.480
Fairgame, and they carry all the vintage stuff, everything from the Vectrex up through Playstation

11:47.480 --> 11:53.920
3 stuff, so hopefully they will be able to buy that.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.120
And I do have games with it, I don't remember which games, so I have like two copies of

11:57.120 --> 12:05.000
Madden 97 for some reason, like Bug 2, a Knight's Demo, and like some other stuff, Machine Head,

12:05.000 --> 12:14.480
and I don't know, but I don't know, maybe I can put it on eBay though, cool cool.

12:14.480 --> 12:21.200
And Saints Row, as usual, oh and, I think I meant, but not during the show, another

12:21.200 --> 12:27.840
360 died, another one red ringed, apparently I had one that was starting to freeze up on

12:27.840 --> 12:32.640
me, so I figured, okay, I'm going to cut it off the pass and just put a new heat sink

12:32.640 --> 12:34.440
on it so that it will work better.

12:34.440 --> 12:39.360
Well, put the new heat sink on it, didn't really fix anything, and so I tried pulling

12:39.360 --> 12:43.760
the heat sink off again and maybe applying a little more thermal grease on spots that

12:43.760 --> 12:48.200
may have missed some, and there was a big empty spot on there, so I went ahead and put

12:48.200 --> 12:53.800
some thermal grease on there, reset it all back on there, and sure enough it three rings

12:53.800 --> 12:59.520
on me, so I'm like, crap, and now I can't fix that one, so I'm going to hit it with

12:59.520 --> 13:03.880
blunt objects until it works, or it won't work and who gives a crap because I still

13:03.880 --> 13:08.600
have five, but I wanted six because my boss wants to play again and we had someone else

13:08.600 --> 13:15.440
join us up when he was busy doing something else, so now someone's taken his place, but

13:15.440 --> 13:17.440
he wants to play again.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.440
Alright.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.560
Oh well, soon you lose.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.080
You always have busy gaming weeks, you can manage to play a lot.

13:22.080 --> 13:28.600
I try, well we play at work, we play Saints Row, we play lots of Saints Row, lots of Saints

13:28.600 --> 13:34.680
Row and lots of Burnout Paradise because that game, you know, it's really crazy, I thought

13:34.680 --> 13:39.960
this week I would have been playing some No More Heroes, but I haven't gotten around

13:39.960 --> 13:40.960
to that yet.

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
Not yet, but soon.

13:41.960 --> 13:46.020
No, I don't know if I'm going to get around to it anytime soon either because next week

13:46.020 --> 13:52.080
is Smash Bros. coming out in Japan, so hopefully we'll have that soon.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.560
Hopefully, you've got to give us your thoughts.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.000
Alright, well let's keep them moving.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Let's go over to Chris.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.920
I don't know, Chris, if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.240
but let's hear it.

13:59.240 --> 14:04.200
Well, aside from playing WoW, which I seem to be doing on a regular basis now.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
Addict.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
Shut up.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
No, I have no room to talk whatsoever, seriously.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.080
Yeah, I heard you just got a 70, so.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.720
I wouldn't say just got, but yeah.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.480
Oh, okay, well you know, I've been kind of out of it, so.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
Gaming World of Warcraft.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.760
I have a character up to level 24 now.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
Rock.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.000
Hey, everybody start somewhere, but you're a Draenei, huh?

14:23.000 --> 14:29.480
No, I'm actually, I don't have, I've just now started getting into, because Megan is

14:29.480 --> 14:33.200
starting to play, and she's got all of her friends playing, and all of them have like

14:33.200 --> 14:34.200
epics.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.200
Oh, wow.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.640
And I'm learning now what they're learning, so I'm like hearing all this shit, like farm,

14:39.640 --> 14:40.920
it's like, oh, I'm farming.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.840
I didn't know for the longest time what that meant.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.040
That's, oh, you got to start something.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.040
Yeah, I got to, you know, because I was just a casual player, I don't go like for hours

14:49.040 --> 14:56.360
on end, you know, just playing, and I'm like, shut up, and I don't need to look more like

14:56.360 --> 15:03.320
a noob than I already am, but it was, you know, so I just finally, you know, I'm starting

15:03.320 --> 15:06.520
to get more into it, but I don't have like a main.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.520
So wait, do you horde or alliance now?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.520
Both.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
Both?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.240
I don't have a main, I just switch back and forth.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.240
You need to make your main a horde, for the horde.

15:14.240 --> 15:20.680
But Megzi's main is a gnome, so to play with her, shut up, to play with her, I made a gnome,

15:20.680 --> 15:26.960
but the problem is that I'm like 10 levels lower than her, so playing with her in that

15:26.960 --> 15:31.940
is kind of stupid, so I keep making more characters to try and play with her, because she keeps

15:31.940 --> 15:38.680
making more characters, and it's just not working, but yeah, aside from that, I did

15:38.680 --> 15:41.800
a lot of D&D stuff, so that makes me happy.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
Cool.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
Yeah, I have to.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.200
What's your school kind of gaming?

15:45.200 --> 15:50.720
Yeah, I've got like maybe four or five friends in LA that have always, have like, oh, we

15:50.720 --> 15:55.440
need to run a game, we need to run a game, and so I finally caved in and started making

15:55.440 --> 15:59.400
an adventure, because I don't like all the new, the pre-made ones, so I've been working

15:59.400 --> 16:05.840
on that a lot, and I freaking am annoyed at fourth edition that's coming out, but apparently

16:05.840 --> 16:10.480
everybody does that with every edition that comes out, so no room to talk.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.920
They're never going to make everybody happy, sadly.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.920
I don't like it.

16:15.920 --> 16:16.920
All right.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.040
And people need to make me happy, because I'm important.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
You are important.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.040
Thank you.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
All right.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.040
We're going to move on, though, with gaming weeks now, if I can.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.040
May I have permission?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
I hope so.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
Yes.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
All right.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
You may, Rob.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.600
My gaming week, I actually took a little bit of a break from WoW.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.200
I mean, I've been playing some, but I went back to another type of RPG that I just missed.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.560
I haven't touched it in a while, and I decided to go back and play some Oblivion, because

16:40.560 --> 16:43.560
I love that game, because you can just run around and do nothing.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.280
It's the Seinfeld of video games.

16:45.280 --> 16:50.040
I mean, if you want to ignore the main plot and just do whatever you want, you can.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.040
It's beautiful.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.440
I noticed you playing that this week.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.440
Yes.

16:53.440 --> 16:58.280
And I decided last time I did a fighter type, so this time I just went all out mage, because

16:58.280 --> 17:03.360
I'm having a lot of fun summoning creatures to do my bidding and throwing fireballs at

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
people.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
It's great.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.360
I don't know why I get attacked.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
I'm screwed.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.120
But I create an army to go after people.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
It's awesome.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.120
I love Oblivion.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.

17:12.120 --> 17:18.560
I never get past the towns, because I'm too busy violating the animals, punching the horses

17:18.560 --> 17:23.600
so they get pissed off, and apparently the townsfolk don't look too kindly upon that,

17:23.600 --> 17:25.680
but it's still fun.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.080
Otherwise, not a whole lot.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.680
There's pretty much just been that has taken up a lot of my gaming week.

17:29.680 --> 17:34.880
I just had this random Oblivion splurge, but I have been playing Burnout Paradise a little

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
bit.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.800
Not enough to give a full review on just yet, but I do notice it's kind of like Test Drive

17:39.800 --> 17:42.520
and Burnout mixed together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
It's different.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
It's a little different.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.520
I don't know.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.520
I kind of like the structure of the old Burnout games.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.240
I'm not sure how I feel about this whole open world thing.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.680
It's a little weird, but I'm giving it a shot.

17:52.680 --> 17:56.280
I haven't taken it online either, which I hear is the best part, so we'll wait.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.560
I do find it interesting, though, that it interacts with the camera to take your picture

17:59.560 --> 18:00.560
and stuff.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
That's kind of strange.

18:01.560 --> 18:07.000
All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about housekeeping, and then we are going

18:07.000 --> 18:10.520
to get into tonight's gaming news.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.520
Tonight in housekeeping, just a reminder, we are now broadcasting, simulcasting on

18:14.520 --> 18:18.680
Justin TV, so a big hello to all the people who are watching us right now on Justin TV.

18:18.680 --> 18:24.760
Our Justin TV channel is www.Justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio, and the other cool thing

18:24.760 --> 18:28.520
about Justin TV is that people can create their own highlights of the show.

18:28.520 --> 18:33.720
So some people went in and made a highlight of, I don't know, me yelling no like Darth

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
Vader last week.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
I don't know why that was so funny.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
So I made that a highlight.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.720
Okay, here's the one that got me, though.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.960
Somebody made a highlight of the pie eating during the break.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.080
But Justin TV is interesting because you can kind of see us even when the mics aren't hot,

18:45.080 --> 18:46.920
so it's kind of fun.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.920
So there's that over at Justin TV.

18:48.920 --> 18:54.800
Also, next week on the show, an Orange Lounge radio first, and actually what may be, I'm

18:54.800 --> 18:59.640
not sure, I don't want to stake the claim to this, but what may be a video game podcast

18:59.640 --> 19:01.320
first, actually.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.240
Next week on the show, we are going to have a musical guest.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.080
That's right, we're going to have a musical guest here in studio, and her name on YouTube

19:10.080 --> 19:16.440
is Amyxia is her name, and she is fairly well known, at least 28,000 people and counting

19:16.440 --> 19:19.440
know her, for her cover of Still Alive.

19:19.440 --> 19:37.400
So we found out she was local to us, so we sent her an email and said, hey, this might

19:37.400 --> 19:41.360
seem a little random, but do you want to come on our little podcast and sing the song for

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
us?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
And she said, sure.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.040
So she's going to be here next week doing her cover of Still Alive, live here in studio.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.120
It's an OLR first musical guest, and we're very excited.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.840
She's going to be a guinea pig for that whole thing.

19:53.840 --> 19:54.840
So it's cool.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.840
We're very excited.

19:55.840 --> 20:01.960
All right, so she'll be here in studio next week, as will the rest of us here.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.920
I don't know if we have any other guests scheduled for the next few weeks.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.120
Are we going to get the chocolate rain guy at some point?

20:06.120 --> 20:09.160
We're not going to get the chocolate rain guy.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
She's the YouTube celeb.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.680
We're going to get in the studio, and then we've got to look for people from other places.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.880
So there you have it.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.960
Yeah, one day I want Dragon Force here in studio.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.720
That's the ultimate dream.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.720
I will.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.720
You'll fly in from...

20:23.720 --> 20:24.720
Yeah, that's right.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
All right.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.600
That would be so complete.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.840
That's like a scene out of Wayne's World right there.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.840
For real.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.840
For real.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.840
All right.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.160
Anyhow, now why is the chat room saying they should get the chocolate rain guy?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.160
Why?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
What the hell does the chocolate rain guy have to do with video games?

20:41.160 --> 20:42.160
I mean, come on.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.560
But Amixia sings about, you know, she does a cover of Still Alive.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
She's video game related.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.520
Chocolate rain has nothing to do with video games.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.520
Actually...

20:49.520 --> 20:50.520
But it is funny.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.520
I will say this.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
I will say this.

20:52.520 --> 20:57.440
An old friend of Orange Lounge Radio is experiencing a little bit of internet fame of his own,

20:57.440 --> 21:00.320
I guess, speaking of people who have said they will come on the show.

21:00.320 --> 21:04.120
He did a remix of this guy from American Idol.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.000
Rinaldo LaPaz was his name.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.880
He did this song called We Are Brothers Forever, and it was kind of one of those things you

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
laugh.

21:09.880 --> 21:21.800
And Justin, who we knew from, like, years ago playing DDR, he did a remix of it.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.900
This has nothing to do with video games, but you can't help but admit that thing's gotta

21:24.900 --> 21:25.900
be DDR-inspired.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.760
Well, he did that, and he said, I emailed him, I'm like, dude, when are you gonna come

21:28.760 --> 21:29.760
on the show again?

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
You're, like, famous and stuff.

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
You gotta come back.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.760
He said he would come back and talk games with us and maybe show us some more remixes.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.760
Who knows?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.440
I ran into him in a line for a movie.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.440
Really?

21:39.440 --> 21:40.440
A couple months ago.

21:40.440 --> 21:44.680
No, like, a couple months ago, but I don't remember what movie we were seeing.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.680
Nice.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.800
All right, so anyhow, lots of things to look forward to on Orange Launch Radio coming up.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.840
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.800
Loki, please take us to video game chat, because obviously we're having problems with that

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
tonight.

21:57.800 --> 22:04.780
All right, well, there is a big old stink this week having to do with Fox News and Mass

22:04.780 --> 22:05.780
Effect.

22:05.780 --> 22:11.960
Apparently, they aired a little segment called Sex Box, and they were talking about how Mass

22:11.960 --> 22:18.280
Effect featured a full digital character nudity and had explicit sex and all this stuff.

22:18.280 --> 22:24.760
And, of course, anyone that's played Mass Effect knows that that's completely false.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.720
But nonetheless, though, they were on there.

22:27.720 --> 22:37.080
They actually had an expert, I'd say a psychology expert or something, who was kind of pimping

22:37.080 --> 22:38.840
out her book.

22:38.840 --> 22:45.560
And at the same time, also in defense, they had Jeff Knightley, who was basically from

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
EA.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
Isn't it Jeff Keighley?

22:47.560 --> 22:48.560
Keighley Knightley.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.560
Knightley is Kira Knightley.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
She's Pirates of the Caribbean.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.560
Jeff Keighley.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
Caribbean.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Caribbean.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
Whatever.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.000
So, Orange Lounge Radio, we pronounce stuff good.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.200
I learned it how to read.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.000
I learned it on Orange Lounge.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.440
Anyways, so, all you need to know, okay, is that basically they went back and forth for

23:09.440 --> 23:12.600
about 30 seconds talking about this game.

23:12.600 --> 23:18.460
The psychologist and, you know, the host hadn't played the game, but yet they were still claiming

23:18.460 --> 23:20.000
all this stuff.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.040
So anyways, as the week progressed, I went kind of crazy.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.360
First EA was saying, you know, they're pissed off that all this stuff was said.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.080
This is complete outright lies.

23:34.080 --> 23:40.560
They want a correction from Fox to basically fess up to not having played the game and

23:40.560 --> 23:43.520
just making up lies off the cuff.

23:43.520 --> 23:48.640
So of course Fox said, no, we're not going to do a correction, but hey, you can come

23:48.640 --> 23:50.960
on to one of our shows again.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.600
And to which, you know, basically they said fuck off.

23:55.600 --> 24:01.600
Anyways, apparently the woman, of course, the psychologist, she has a book called The

24:01.600 --> 24:04.120
Cult of Perfection and it happened to be on Amazon.

24:04.120 --> 24:08.320
Well, gamers got pissed off and they, of course, you know, realized, hey, her book's on there.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.480
And so they left her a bunch of negative reviews clearly stating that they have not read her

24:12.480 --> 24:17.360
book but that it's, you know, inappropriate for minors and that it's like, here's the

24:17.360 --> 24:20.440
thing that got me...

24:20.440 --> 24:21.440
It's not that funny, Chris.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.240
But it's the exact same thing she was doing.

24:24.240 --> 24:30.320
Yeah, it was, which is ironic, but the internet is LOL like that, I mean, seriously.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.480
But here's the thing, I don't know how many of you actually went on to Amazon and started

24:33.480 --> 24:34.480
reading the book.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.720
It's like, you know, it's a self-help book for women.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.040
It's like something they give out to young women.

24:39.040 --> 24:43.840
Here's the best part, by now when we're talking about this, all those negative reviews have

24:43.840 --> 24:47.320
been removed, the ones that gamers left.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.320
What's left, though, is still negative reviews.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.560
They weren't good to begin with, I mean, so...

24:51.560 --> 24:55.000
Well, here's the thing is that I actually started reading some of the book, and I'm

24:55.000 --> 24:59.920
thinking, as I'm reading it, I'm going, why was she invited to talk about video games?

24:59.920 --> 25:02.920
Her book has nothing to do.

25:02.920 --> 25:07.380
I mean, if you're going to bring on someone to dog video games, fucking, you know which

25:07.380 --> 25:11.400
attention whore whose initials start with J and T will be there at the drop of the hat

25:11.400 --> 25:13.960
to come talk about video games and bash them, come on.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
At least call him.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
I'm sorry.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.800
She's too busy chasing an ambulance, you know, so...

25:19.800 --> 25:20.800
Apparently.

25:20.800 --> 25:27.000
Anyways, so, you know, like I said, they trashed her book on Amazon, or all of her books, apparently

25:27.000 --> 25:32.360
she has a few books, and they all suck, including Ben-There-Done-That-Kept-The-Jewelry and The

25:32.360 --> 25:38.320
Fixer-Upper-Man, which is talking about how all men are fixer-uppers, so, yeah, she's

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
awesome.

25:39.320 --> 25:44.600
I hope, you know, I gotta wonder, I mean, don't get me wrong, she is pretty hot, okay,

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
so I'll give you that.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
She's pretty hot.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
I'm sorry.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.720
No, she's not, she's got a fucked up nose, and she's got that pose that looks like it's

25:52.720 --> 25:53.720
post-metapause.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.920
Okay, whatever, okay, well, she's a deranged woman.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.360
Anyways, so, to be fair-

26:01.360 --> 26:03.040
She clearly sounds retarded.

26:03.040 --> 26:07.200
To be fair, I don't know if you're gonna cover this, maybe I'm cutting you off, I don't care,

26:07.200 --> 26:12.320
she retracted her statement, she retracted, I was just getting there, anyways, I just

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
got served.

26:13.320 --> 26:19.440
I remember Cooper Lawrence did retract her statement, saying that, you know, she really

26:19.440 --> 26:25.640
regrets saying that, and now seeing the game's sex scenes, seeing it's kind of a joke, you

26:25.640 --> 26:32.080
know, she's seen more explicit sexual content on Lost than, you know, this game, so.

26:32.080 --> 26:36.960
Or other Fox programming, such as 24, Family Guy, which had a whole thing about side boob,

26:36.960 --> 26:38.560
if I remember right, I mean, I-

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
It's my side boob.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.340
Anyways, that's all you see in Mass Effect, is a little side boob, come on.

26:45.340 --> 26:50.200
And then, of course, not to be left out, Adam Sessler actually gave his opinion on the whole

26:50.200 --> 26:55.200
thing, and I thought he actually phrased it quite well, you know, plus one respect from

26:55.200 --> 26:58.640
me, for him, but, you know.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.560
From one nerdy white guy to another.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.560
Exactly, you know.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.560
Congrats.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.900
But, you know, because usually I think he's kind of a tool, but, you know, actually, he

27:06.900 --> 27:13.120
wasn't bad, you know, I don't know, I think he made his point quite nicely, and, you know,

27:13.120 --> 27:17.680
basically this whole thing is ridiculous, and he also dogged her book without reading

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
it, so.

27:18.680 --> 27:24.000
Okay, internets, I, I lolled at the whole, you know, bashing her book when you hadn't

27:24.000 --> 27:29.160
read it, just doing the same thing she did, however, she did apologize, people screw up,

27:29.160 --> 27:33.220
she made a mistake, I say leave her alone, you need to fight the real enemy.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.640
Who is the real enemy in this case?

27:34.640 --> 27:35.640
Fox News.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.640
Fox News.

27:36.640 --> 27:41.440
I dare and balance my big fat ass, I mean, come on, this isn't even a political thing,

27:41.440 --> 27:44.920
this is nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, this is just about,

27:44.920 --> 27:48.120
that was the most piss poorly researched thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.400
Did you see the round table discussion that came afterwards?

27:50.400 --> 27:54.320
Oh, oh, oh my God, I wanted to barf, Chris, any thoughts?

27:54.320 --> 27:58.360
You know, I don't know if you'd already heard about this, I posted this in my LJ, and, you

27:58.360 --> 28:04.640
know, I posted the entire interview, and it's just like, the retardedness of these people

28:04.640 --> 28:09.600
just blew my head off, you know, it's like they're like saying, God, I can't even remember

28:09.600 --> 28:14.040
now, you know, it's just like, you know, I don't want my child to have to be subject

28:14.040 --> 28:19.600
to this, and like totally going off on, I don't remember what they said, no, but it

28:19.600 --> 28:20.760
was just like.

28:20.760 --> 28:25.060
I just can't, I didn't know, literally one of them was like, I just can't believe that

28:25.060 --> 28:28.520
we as parents have to monitor everything our children play.

28:28.520 --> 28:34.280
Oh God, yeah, exactly, here, here, I'll, I'll, I have this direct from my LJ, I'll just

28:34.280 --> 28:39.840
write what, or I'll just read off kind of the part I said.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.840
As to the blonde bimbo, I know being a parent is hard, and you just magically get pregnant

28:43.840 --> 28:47.760
and are forced to care for a baby that you had no responsibility in creating it all,

28:47.760 --> 28:51.760
but there is all sorts, and there is all sorts of bad stuff coming from places like the interwebs

28:51.760 --> 28:55.600
and video games, but do us all a favor and attempt to sound a little more mature when

28:55.600 --> 29:00.280
you say that simply monitoring what your child sees is a much, is a much harder job.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.520
Now here's even better, Daryl, you know, you know, I know a lot of these, um, you know,

29:04.520 --> 29:07.800
adults are playing video games and stuff, but you know when those adults are gone, you

29:07.800 --> 29:11.640
know their kids are, they're playing, they're playing their parents' video games, I'm like,

29:11.640 --> 29:16.520
well then why don't you fucking put the parental, you know, protection or codes and stuff on

29:16.520 --> 29:21.200
there to fix that, I mean, since you're aware that they're going to be playing your games,

29:21.200 --> 29:23.320
why don't you, I don't know, solve the problem?

29:23.320 --> 29:27.000
It was just one of the most journalistically irresponsible things I've ever seen in my

29:27.000 --> 29:31.760
entire life, and they should all be ashamed of themselves for having their names attached

29:31.760 --> 29:34.280
to that piece, except for Jeff Keighley, which, you know, obviously was the only one that

29:34.280 --> 29:37.040
knew what he was talking about, the only one that knew anything about games, honestly.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.880
I laugh when he's like, have you played this game?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.560
Well, no, but I've watched videos on it.

29:42.560 --> 29:47.000
He knew, going in, he knew, well, to his credit, obviously he's a smart guy, you know, he's

29:47.000 --> 29:51.740
a well-respected journalist, he probably knew going into this, he's like, Fox News wants

29:51.740 --> 29:54.680
me to talk about video games, yeah, I know what's going to happen.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.880
Like he knew, he knew somebody was going to come on there that didn't know their shit,

29:57.880 --> 30:01.960
he had enough smarts to have the foresight, I mean, you could tell that was his first

30:01.960 --> 30:03.280
question right out of the gate, you know.

30:03.280 --> 30:07.760
Oh, oh, and then my favorite, Darryl, well, Darryl, you know, finding the ratings is so

30:07.760 --> 30:11.760
hard, you know, you have to look on the back of the box and it's not there, actually, no,

30:11.760 --> 30:17.600
you're wrong, it's on the front of the box, and on the back of the box, so you're an idiot.

30:17.600 --> 30:22.840
Whereas on a movie poster, it's a tiny little thing at the very bottom of the poster, I

30:22.840 --> 30:27.320
mean, you know, and the ratings, it's okay, the ratings on movies are all on the back

30:27.320 --> 30:30.800
of the box, not one rating is on the front of the box unless it's, of course, you know,

30:30.800 --> 30:33.520
pimping out that it's an unrated director's cut or something like that.

30:33.520 --> 30:38.060
I think it's just disgusting and hypocritical when Fox Television runs all the stuff that's

30:38.060 --> 30:42.400
way more pornographic than Mass Effect could ever be, which is actually kind of a shame

30:42.400 --> 30:45.200
because Mass Effect should have been a little more pornographic, but anyhow, it's beside

30:45.200 --> 30:51.480
the point, but Fox TV, like, you know, you see way worse things on there, I swear to

30:51.480 --> 30:56.440
God everybody involved from Fox News with that little piece needs to come on the TV

30:56.440 --> 31:01.360
and apologize for being an asshat, I will accept nothing less.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.520
I want that blondie to come out and say, I, blondie, apologize to the world for being

31:05.520 --> 31:09.480
an asshat, that's what I want.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
It'll never happen.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.480
When was that, Chris?

31:11.480 --> 31:15.880
Well, I mean, I'm going to start studying psychology, this is what I want to do with

31:15.880 --> 31:21.320
my life, and I just love the psychologist that came on, she was like, you know, discussing

31:21.320 --> 31:27.040
the psychologies of, you know, all the, you know, children see this and they think it's

31:27.040 --> 31:28.040
real.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.000
No, they don't.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.680
Video games and any sort of entertainment, this does not count, you know, if your child

31:36.680 --> 31:41.760
is going off and killing people because of video games, psychologically, that's not the

31:41.760 --> 31:45.880
video game's fault, it's because your child is mentally unstable, and guess whose fucking

31:45.880 --> 31:47.400
fault that is?

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
Your fault.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.800
The parent's fault.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.320
It all stems back from the parents, you know, they're probably going through the first stage

31:53.320 --> 31:57.120
of development and they fucked up majorly, so, you know, I just love it when these people

31:57.120 --> 32:03.040
sit there and tell you, it's like, you know, video games and all this stuff, it's hurting

32:03.040 --> 32:04.740
our children, they're, you know.

32:04.740 --> 32:10.220
To be fair, there are mental conditions that, you know, could be, but that's usually outside

32:10.220 --> 32:14.480
the norm, you know, a lot of these kids on Maury Povich who are out of control and stuff,

32:14.480 --> 32:15.480
that's the parents.

32:15.480 --> 32:21.360
That's again, well, if it is a psychological disorder that requires medication, again,

32:21.360 --> 32:25.720
I give that back to, yeah, that's not the parent's fault that their child is like that

32:25.720 --> 32:31.080
because there's a chemical imbalance that's going on, but the parent needs to be responsible

32:31.080 --> 32:35.800
enough to understand that and take them to the proper doctors and explain to them the

32:35.800 --> 32:42.840
proper, you know, it all stems back to your responsibility as a parent of what you want

32:42.840 --> 32:44.040
your child to see and do.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.440
Alright, we've got to stop giving Fox News so much attention here on this program, but

32:47.440 --> 32:50.120
I do want to respond to some stuff in chat here.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.600
Chat at orangehonestradio.com, some comments, rostielut says, Sky, you have to understand

32:53.600 --> 32:57.720
that Fox News is struggling to get beyond its little niche of right-wing shitheads.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.720
They're nothing more than a bottom-run cable networks.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.640
Their ratings are probably lower than Lifetime and Spike.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.040
I don't know.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.960
Let's see, binary667 says, what do you have against Blondie?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.280
That's some quality music.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.760
Obviously, when I say Blondie, I'm not saying Debra Harry has to come apologize.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.760
She didn't do anything.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.000
If Debra Harry has to apologize for anything, have her apologize for the Blondie reunion

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
album.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
But, anyway, that's besides the point.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
You know who I'm talking about.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
I'm not talking about Debra Harry.

33:24.000 --> 33:33.000
Let's see, Porto Combat says, Fox News, you are not the father.

33:33.000 --> 33:44.040
Sadly enough, if there was an argument or something like Springer or Maury Povich or

33:44.040 --> 33:47.560
something like that, it would actually probably be more intelligent than what's on Fox News

33:47.560 --> 33:48.560
right now.

33:48.560 --> 33:53.600
Alright, we've got to get back to some happier topics.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.400
Things that won't make us so damn angry.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.400
If we hadn't done this right out the gate, we'd probably be doing the FUs right about

33:59.400 --> 34:01.080
now, but we'll have to save those for later.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.840
Let's talk about something happy.

34:02.840 --> 34:07.800
Let's get some happy news here to make us forget this whole Fox debacle.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.640
Res HD, that's a nice happy subject, right?

34:10.640 --> 34:11.880
You know what's even better?

34:11.880 --> 34:15.960
Is that it is very possible this game is coming out this week, especially a lot of people

34:15.960 --> 34:17.280
seem to think so are convinced.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.240
Well, you said it's going to come out this month, and I think this is the last week left.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
There is that.

34:22.240 --> 34:26.800
And then also, there was a quote from Q Entertainment, quote, the game is being prepped and it's

34:26.800 --> 34:28.600
just waiting for the green light.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.600
Maybe next week?

34:29.600 --> 34:35.200
So, in other words, basically, Q Entertainment is just saying, we're done, it's there, waiting

34:35.200 --> 34:38.640
to go, we're just waiting for someone at Microsoft to push the button.

34:38.640 --> 34:44.160
So that will be very happy when Res HD, I'll have that on my TV all the time, and we'll

34:44.160 --> 34:46.360
never have a need to put my TV on Fox News ever again.

34:46.360 --> 34:52.460
Well, I was reading, they had an interview with Mizuguchi about how to play it with the

34:52.460 --> 34:56.440
other controllers and stuff, they said put one on your feet, put one on your back or

34:56.440 --> 35:00.000
something like that, and I don't know what to do with the third one.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.480
Put it in a happy place.

35:03.480 --> 35:08.040
Put it in the spot that most suits you.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.680
Let's just leave it at that, right, Jamie?

35:10.680 --> 35:11.800
I guess so.

35:11.800 --> 35:15.080
Man, some people are desperate.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.080
Anyway, there is a contest going on in the UK.

35:19.080 --> 35:25.360
Microsoft is having some Halo fans to make videos about Master Chief in everyday situations

35:25.360 --> 35:28.660
that do not involve Halo.

35:28.660 --> 35:35.020
And if they win, then they will be accepted, well, they will get to go to a film school

35:35.020 --> 35:42.840
for a month in LA for, I guess, special lessons, but they said you can use a video camera,

35:42.840 --> 35:51.000
you can use the game itself, animation, however you want to do it, it just has to, you know,

35:51.000 --> 35:55.320
be Master Chief in a situation apart from the Halo universe.

35:55.320 --> 36:03.200
And it's for European gamers over 18, submissions are to be in between January 31st and March

36:03.200 --> 36:05.040
21st this year.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.200
Here's an idea, kids, and if you win with this idea, you only have to, you know, credit

36:09.200 --> 36:10.840
me.

36:10.840 --> 36:15.000
Master Chief responding to this Fox News story.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Think about it.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.720
Well, for anyone who's interested in it, it's Halo Re-Cut, is what the contest is called.

36:22.720 --> 36:28.240
It's at xbox.com slash en dash gb slash Halo Re-Cut, all one word.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.240
So if you want to check it out.

36:29.240 --> 36:32.240
Well, I hope somebody we know wins it, so good luck to all of you.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.320
If you win it, send us an email.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
Yes.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.520
We'll interview you.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.480
Another first person shooter game that's pretty fun, Team Fortress 2 is going to be getting

36:42.480 --> 36:47.280
some unlockable weapons and new game modes pretty soon, which is pretty awesome.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.960
They're one of the first earned weapons, I guess, that's going to be for the medic, and

36:51.960 --> 36:58.040
it's an over-healer, which apparently I believe is a tool you can use to give a temporary

36:58.040 --> 37:05.160
boost to your other player's health up to 150%.

37:05.160 --> 37:11.000
And this is also part of the balancing that Valve is doing.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.440
They're also going to be talking about some other unlockable weapons, including a healing

37:15.440 --> 37:19.400
ray and some other stuff.

37:19.400 --> 37:24.480
Also they were going to be introducing a new map, Gold Rush, and there's going to be another

37:24.480 --> 37:31.920
one coming out as well, it's a remake, I guess, of an older map called Badlands, and basically

37:31.920 --> 37:38.100
in Gold Rush the blue team must escort a mining cart through tunnels, and the cart moves faster

37:38.100 --> 37:45.080
with the more blue team members nearby, but stops completely if a red player gets near.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.640
So that's kind of neat, I like how they're mixing it up and supporting the game well

37:48.640 --> 37:53.000
after it's come out, so looking forward to it.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.360
That's always good to see a game get a lot of lovin' after it's still out, which is yet

37:57.360 --> 38:00.680
another reason, going back to what I said earlier in the show, why I love Oblivion.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.840
They were coming out with new shit for that game for a long time, and granted they're

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
done now, but...

38:03.840 --> 38:06.560
I wish they had multiplayer in that, or at least co-op or something like that.

38:06.560 --> 38:10.200
It's almost like they built the game to have that at one point, because when you conjure

38:10.200 --> 38:15.000
things, like let's say I conjure a skeleton, my character's name is Bunny, don't laugh,

38:15.000 --> 38:19.520
but when you actually point at the skeleton it says, Bunny's Skeleton.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.440
Almost like it was built so that at one point it was going to have a multiplayer environment,

38:23.440 --> 38:24.440
you know what I mean?

38:24.440 --> 38:28.120
Like why would it need to say it's my skeleton, couldn't it just say your skeleton, or conjured

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
skeleton?

38:29.120 --> 38:31.320
Hell, they could just re-release the game with multiplayer built into it.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
They probably will.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.880
Kind of like how they do it with Twisted Metal, Black Online, or something like that.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.280
That might be how they try to hold this over for Elder Scrolls V.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.280
That'd be cool.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.280
Who knows?

38:42.280 --> 38:46.520
Well, another game that continues to get some love after it's out is Halo 3, but this isn't

38:46.520 --> 38:47.640
anything official.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.640
This is actually something that's been put together for your iPhone.

38:51.640 --> 38:58.060
It's a website called www.ihalostats.com, and it's a website that's built specifically

38:58.060 --> 39:02.320
for your iPhone that will allow you to check your Halo stats from anywhere.

39:02.320 --> 39:07.320
Why you'd want to do that, I don't really know, but hey, you have that option.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.420
It's for picking up chicks, of course.

39:09.420 --> 39:12.400
It's like, dude, look how awesome I am in Halo 3.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.880
Think of how awesome I'll be in bed.

39:14.880 --> 39:15.880
Think about it.

39:15.880 --> 39:16.880
Exactly.

39:16.880 --> 39:22.820
But there's a little disclaimer right there on the website, iHaloStats.com is not affiliated

39:22.820 --> 39:25.140
with Bungie LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:25.140 --> 39:28.980
So it is something completely fan-made, and to their credit, you know what, even if I

39:28.980 --> 39:34.600
think this is a little, I don't know, useless, it's kind of cool in that, you know, hey,

39:34.600 --> 39:38.520
somebody had a weird idea and kind of built this whole thing, and it seems to run pretty

39:38.520 --> 39:39.520
well.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.240
So, you know, props to them for seeing their strange idea through to completion, if that

39:43.240 --> 39:45.000
makes any sense at all.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.440
I don't know.

39:47.440 --> 39:55.640
Well, for more gaming news, for anyone who is a fan of Condemned, Condemned 2 comes out

39:55.640 --> 40:03.180
on March 11th, according to Sega, and it's gory and violent and weird.

40:03.180 --> 40:07.200
Which means I'm going to go put a pre-order down right now, right?

40:07.200 --> 40:08.200
I won't.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.280
Well, actually, the first one was kind of, it was just freaky, it's like a serial killer

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
type game, you know?

40:13.280 --> 40:17.360
Now that I think about it, we did start Condemned, but I don't think that after a little bit

40:17.360 --> 40:19.820
of it, I was too much into it afterwards.

40:19.820 --> 40:25.000
All you need to know about Condemned 2, and I can sell it to you in one sentence, it has

40:25.000 --> 40:30.160
exploding babies.

40:30.160 --> 40:33.740
You know what, Loki, that might have done it, actually, that's pretty awesome.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.740
Exploding babies?

40:34.740 --> 40:38.960
I'm looking at this picture of a guy with a meat hook.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
Why does it go boom?

40:40.960 --> 40:43.760
Why are they exploding?

40:43.760 --> 40:45.960
I don't know.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.640
Somebody exploded them?

40:47.640 --> 40:48.640
I don't know.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.640
How old are they?

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
Well, they're babies!

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
I mean, Chris!

40:51.640 --> 41:00.340
I'm sorry, I just came from a household where there was just a week-old infant in my arms

41:00.340 --> 41:03.440
holding just sort of exploding babies, sad me.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
Shut up!

41:04.440 --> 41:08.240
Well, at least it wasn't ticking.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.320
Here's my advice, Chris.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
Don't play Condemned 2.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.840
There's plenty of other video games out there for your enjoyment.

41:12.840 --> 41:13.840
Why don't you play?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.440
Here, Chris, I want you to go get a game.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.280
It's called Imagine Babies.

41:18.280 --> 41:21.280
I have it in my backpack.

41:21.280 --> 41:27.800
It's nothing but happy babies, rainbows, diaper changing, I don't know.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.960
It's all the glory of having babies.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.280
That's the first time I changed a diaper in my life, and I really enjoyed it.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.720
That's a different type of exploding baby.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.160
I'm breaking out the DS right now.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.880
Yeah, it's not like that.

41:41.880 --> 41:46.320
All right, Condemned 2, now with exploding babies, enjoy, March 11th.

41:46.320 --> 41:51.360
Well, there's another game I'm looking forward to, far more than Condemned 2.

41:51.360 --> 41:56.480
Of course, that would be Grand Theft Auto IV, and the announcement that it was actually

41:56.480 --> 42:02.640
coming out this spring instead of the end of this year, or possibly not this year.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.440
That's just all sorts of awesome.

42:05.440 --> 42:10.840
It's dated now for April 29th, and it will be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 3

42:10.840 --> 42:15.720
and Xbox 360, as well as a special edition, which I already have preordered, and I can't

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
wait.

42:16.720 --> 42:22.200
The other thing, though, Rockstar was commenting on why it's been delayed, and they said, of

42:22.200 --> 42:28.680
course, one of the contributing factors was that they had some technical challenges with

42:28.680 --> 42:33.360
the PlayStation 3 version, and, of course, they wouldn't go into what the challenges

42:33.360 --> 42:34.360
were.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.960
They said it's not an issue anymore because both versions are now neck and neck in their

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
development phases.

42:38.960 --> 42:44.440
We were just having problems getting the hookers just right in the PlayStation 3 version.

42:44.440 --> 42:50.560
Yeah, so they basically said it's really no surprise to anyone that the PS3 was definitely

42:50.560 --> 42:53.560
a contributing factor to the delay.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.840
I have to go back to the last story because this is too good.

42:55.840 --> 43:01.400
In our chat room, Ekum, which is just Mike spelled backwards, says, imagine exploding

43:01.400 --> 43:04.480
babies coming to a DS near you.

43:04.480 --> 43:09.300
By the way, exploding babies are in the trailer for the game, so watch the trailer for the

43:09.300 --> 43:11.720
game and you will see the exploding babies.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.960
Chris, don't watch the trailer for Gundam 2, please.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.360
Oh my god, this is too cute.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.800
You're actually playing Imagine Babies here in the studio?

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
Yeah.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.160
Get that filth out of my house.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.800
You need to blame Loki, he gave it to me.

43:25.800 --> 43:30.360
You know what you should be playing, Dark Sakura, is a wonderful game on Xbox Live called

43:30.360 --> 43:32.820
Every Extend Extra Extreme.

43:32.820 --> 43:35.320
That game is pretty awesome and it's on PSP as well.

43:35.320 --> 43:40.840
The only gripe I have with the Xbox Live one is that the game doesn't get a whole lot of

43:40.840 --> 43:43.480
variety in it in the basic modes.

43:43.480 --> 43:49.160
It doesn't have quite the same hypnotic backgrounds that the PSP one had and the skins don't change

43:49.160 --> 43:53.260
that much, but to make up for that lack of variety, to Q Entertainment's credit, they

43:53.260 --> 43:57.360
have the custom tracks mode in the game and I think a lot of people forget about this.

43:57.360 --> 44:02.240
You can actually play Every Extend Extra Extreme with your own custom tracks.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.280
The problem with the mode this week is that it wasn't perfect.

44:05.280 --> 44:10.260
You can either manually put in the BPM or you can tap it out to get the beats per second

44:10.260 --> 44:16.120
or beats per minute or what have you, but you couldn't exactly fine tune it until now.

44:16.120 --> 44:20.840
Q Entertainment has released a code that will allow you to make a fine adjustment to your

44:20.840 --> 44:21.840
custom music.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.800
You better write this one down because it's very complicated.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.580
Very complicated code to remember.

44:25.580 --> 44:26.580
Here you go.

44:26.580 --> 44:27.580
This is the code.

44:27.580 --> 44:31.560
At the start menu, you're going to use the left and right triggers to put in this code.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.560
Here it is.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.560
Get your pencils ready.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.560
Here it is.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
Left.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
Right.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Left.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
Right.

44:38.560 --> 44:39.560
Left.

44:39.560 --> 44:40.560
Right.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.560
Left.

44:41.560 --> 44:42.560
Right.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.560
Left.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.560
Right.

44:44.560 --> 44:45.560
Left.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.560
Left.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.560
Left.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.560
Ok, right.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.560
Alright, there you go.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.300
Wait, wait, wait, what was after left?

44:51.300 --> 44:52.300
Ah, right.

44:52.300 --> 44:53.300
Ok.

44:53.300 --> 44:54.300
So there it is.

44:54.300 --> 44:58.400
So you can just have a Q Entertainment overload this week if you want to do this fine tuning

44:58.400 --> 45:02.460
mode and then Res HD and hell you could play 99 Nights if you're at it if you want to play

45:02.460 --> 45:03.600
a bad Q Entertainment game.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.680
emotion It wasn't that bad.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.460
It wasn't that bad.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.560
It just wasn't that good either.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.560
It was ok.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.760
It was better than probably Kingdom Under Fire Circles.

45:13.760 --> 45:18.360
Well, here's the thing. I have Q Entertainment up on a pedestal. I mean, seriously. Luminous, every extent.

45:18.360 --> 45:22.460
Actually, you know I love my puzzle games. I have Q Entertainment up on a very high pedestal.

45:22.460 --> 45:24.360
I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi a lot.

45:24.360 --> 45:28.860
They need to stick to the puzzle music games. Do not deviate from the puzzle music games.

45:28.860 --> 45:34.660
Although, can you imagine if 99 Nights had, like, some sort of musical beat thing to it, just like, you know...

45:34.660 --> 45:35.460
Oh my god, okay.

45:35.460 --> 45:35.960
Rez?

45:35.960 --> 45:41.160
All you had to do, yeah, seriously, to make 99 Nights cooler, all you had to do was be slashing people to techno music,

45:41.160 --> 45:43.460
and that would have been the coolest game ever.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.860
Who wouldn't want to kill people to bad techno music? Come on.

45:45.860 --> 45:50.360
That would be pretty awesome, like, something mixing, like, Dynasty Warriors with, like, Rez.

45:50.360 --> 45:50.860
Hello?

45:50.860 --> 45:51.560
I'd dig a- Hey!

45:51.560 --> 45:52.460
I would totally play that.

45:52.460 --> 45:53.360
Get on the ball, people!

45:53.360 --> 45:56.860
Exploding babies in time with the music? Come on.

45:56.860 --> 45:57.460
It'd be fun.

45:57.460 --> 46:01.960
That would be kind of... wrong, but, you know, um...

46:01.960 --> 46:06.460
If you want to be abstract, then sure, go the space draft route, you know?

46:06.460 --> 46:07.960
They could do weasel stomping mode.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.360
Son of Dad says Gunpei is God.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.760
That's one of the few Q Entertainment games I haven't played is Gunpei.

46:12.760 --> 46:13.560
Gunpei is great.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.660
I've heard it's pretty good.

46:14.660 --> 46:19.360
Uh, Gerardimo says, Rob, don't forget Meteos Disney Magic. That's worse than 99 Nights.

46:19.360 --> 46:23.060
I enjoyed the original Meteos, actually, quite a bit, but...

46:23.060 --> 46:25.360
I didn't play the Disney one. Did you play Disney Meteos?

46:25.360 --> 46:29.960
Um, I've seen... I've seen it been played before, but I thought it was cute.

46:29.960 --> 46:34.960
But I'm a Disney freak, so, you know, look at my online screen name, Disney Funk 10, so...

46:34.960 --> 46:35.760
Shut up!

46:37.660 --> 46:38.460
Nerd.

46:38.460 --> 46:43.760
All right. How about some release dates? Let's travel the globe and find out what's coming soon to a retail store near you.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.660
We'll start with Europe.

46:44.660 --> 46:47.160
Do you need release, Rob?

46:47.160 --> 46:50.860
Um, I don't know how to answer that.

46:50.860 --> 47:01.060
How about on the 30th we get Chestmaster Live on Xbox 360 and ResHD given a date of the 30th in the UK.

47:01.060 --> 47:05.760
On the first is Bombermanland on Wii. Try saying that three times fast.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.760
Flat Out Head On on PSP, Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom, yay.

47:10.760 --> 47:14.460
Lineage 2, The Camel on PC.

47:14.460 --> 47:20.560
Um, PDC World Championship Darts 2008 on DS, which is really exciting, isn't it?

47:20.560 --> 47:21.660
Yeah.

47:21.660 --> 47:29.060
Puzzle Quest, Challenger of the Warlords on Wii, Sims 2 Castaway Stories on PC, and Zoo Hospital on DS.

47:29.060 --> 47:32.660
Zoo Hospital? Oh boy!

47:32.660 --> 47:35.260
Isn't that exciting?

47:35.260 --> 47:37.760
Zoo Host-able.

47:37.760 --> 47:41.860
I would like to know how many people have pre-orders on Zoo Hospital.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.860
I've got mine in there. Do you?

47:43.860 --> 47:47.660
Just making sure I don't want to miss out on Zoo Hospital.

47:47.660 --> 47:56.260
You know, I was hoping that Chestmaster Live was actually Chestmaster Live, you know, like a pornographic version of it or something.

47:56.260 --> 48:01.260
That'd be kind of cool, but no.

48:01.260 --> 48:09.660
Let's see, the US isn't, you know, that busy this week, actually. It's pretty scarce.

48:09.660 --> 48:14.460
And there's not going to be much that you're going to be interested in unless you love Bomberman.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.260
In which case, there's a couple games for you.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.760
Bomberman Land for the Wii and the PSP coming out.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.660
A little mini-game with some adventure stuff in there as well.

48:22.660 --> 48:25.560
And it's Bomberman, so there you go.

48:25.560 --> 48:29.960
Bomberman Land Touch 2 for the DS is coming out.

48:29.960 --> 48:33.960
Pursuit Force Xtreme Justice on the PSP.

48:33.960 --> 48:39.160
And The Sims Castaway Stories on the PC.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.160
What kind of stories do they have to tell?

48:42.160 --> 48:47.660
Help! I'm trapped in a knock-off game of a once-popular franchise.

48:47.660 --> 48:51.160
Help! I'm lost on an island.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.660
Anything else to note?

48:52.660 --> 48:56.060
I was just seeing if there's anything else that's funny.

48:56.060 --> 49:00.660
Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

49:00.660 --> 49:02.460
Wait, say that one more time.

49:02.460 --> 49:07.360
Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.260
So we have Zoo Hospital coming out in Europe, and we have...

49:11.260 --> 49:14.260
Is it the same game with just a different name or something?

49:14.260 --> 49:18.760
Or is there really that big of a demand out there in the game marketplace for Zoo Hospital?

49:18.760 --> 49:22.560
Dude, there's a lot of freaking Pet Vet games.

49:22.560 --> 49:29.360
There's actually one that's kind of neat. It's a little different than your usual pet-the-animals-and-they-are-better type game.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.760
They actually have one that's done like Phoenix Wright, that's a pet hospital game.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.560
That's kind of neat.

49:35.560 --> 49:38.760
I guess it's cute because it's a good game for kids.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.760
It's a good game for kids, I'm sure, because how many...

49:41.760 --> 49:46.460
Objection! You're not sick! You're faking any damn dog!

49:46.460 --> 49:50.760
There's tons of eight- and nine-year-olds that want to be veterinarians when they grow up, you know?

49:50.760 --> 49:53.760
So, I mean, I can...

49:53.760 --> 49:57.260
If you want, I can go even more obscure here. We've got...

49:57.260 --> 50:07.760
What is it? Pacific Storm Allies, AGEOD's American Civil War, 1861 through 1865.

50:07.760 --> 50:11.260
Whoo! That's awesome!

50:11.260 --> 50:12.560
And that's it.

50:12.560 --> 50:16.960
Really, I don't want to go into any more details unless there's another Tycoon game,

50:16.960 --> 50:20.360
because, you know, every week there's got to be a Tycoon game.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.360
Oh, here's the one I was talking about, Paws and Claws Pet Resort.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.360
But that's not for this week.

50:24.360 --> 50:25.560
Pet Resort?

50:25.560 --> 50:26.660
Pet Resort.

50:26.660 --> 50:27.860
Awesome.

50:27.860 --> 50:32.160
It used to be Paws and Claws Pet Resort Tycoon, so...

50:32.160 --> 50:35.160
All right, let's head over to Japanese release dates.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.560
Oh my god, this is so... You guys, seriously, look at this.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.360
How ridiculous-looking is that?

50:40.360 --> 50:42.460
You get to pamper the pets.

50:42.460 --> 50:46.560
It does look kind of cute in a really, like, excess kind of way.

50:46.560 --> 50:52.960
All the animals have little hats and sunglasses on and shirts. That's so cute.

50:52.960 --> 50:57.660
Like, really cute, as in, like, a Scholastic Weekly type cute.

50:57.660 --> 50:59.360
Highlights for children type cute.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.060
Yeah, exactly.

51:00.060 --> 51:00.960
Exactly.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.560
All right, let's go to Japanese release dates, because this is one of the fun parts of the show,

51:04.560 --> 51:10.360
is getting to hear me horribly butcher the pronunciation of Japanese titles coming soon to Japan.

51:10.360 --> 51:15.060
But we'll start with easy ones on the Xbox 360 Devil May Cry 4 on January 31st.

51:15.060 --> 51:20.760
Need for Speed Pro Street also hitting January 31st, as well as Sega Rally Revo also hitting as well.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.660
By the way, there is a Xbox 360 Plus Devil May Cry.

51:24.660 --> 51:28.760
It's a bundle pack, also comes out in Japan on the 31st of this month.

51:28.760 --> 51:31.560
Traveling over to some other systems, taking a look at the PlayStation 3.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.560
Of course, they're getting Devil May Cry 4 on that system as well.

51:34.560 --> 51:39.860
They're also getting Disgaea Hour of Darkness 3 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 on the 31st.

51:39.860 --> 51:48.260
Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, as well as Assassin's Creed makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

51:48.260 --> 51:51.660
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, not a whole lot.

51:51.660 --> 51:55.960
There's a game called Family Ski coming out from Namco Bandai on the 31st.

51:55.960 --> 51:59.660
And I believe that uses the Wii Fit Balance Board, if you have it.

51:59.660 --> 52:01.060
Oh, yes, that one. That's right.

52:01.060 --> 52:05.860
We heard about that earlier, that Namco was putting that together for use with the Wii Fit.

52:05.860 --> 52:08.360
So that's coming out this week, for those of you guys that bought Wii Fit over there.

52:08.360 --> 52:14.260
Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, because you know Need for Speed has to come out everywhere.

52:14.260 --> 52:19.760
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, another version of Need for Speed Pro Street.

52:19.760 --> 52:25.160
Also, Tales of Destiny, the Director's Cut makes its way out on the PlayStation 2.

52:25.160 --> 52:29.960
Cyanide with an X, I guess maybe that's Cyanide is coming out as well.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.760
Is that on the PS2?

52:31.760 --> 52:32.760
On the PS2.

52:32.760 --> 52:37.260
That's a pretty cool game, actually. It's like a shoot-em-up game.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.060
Bullet Hill.

52:38.060 --> 52:44.460
This game is called, also coming out on the 31st, is called Your, Memories Off, Girls Style.

52:44.460 --> 52:46.160
That's not one sentence, it's split up.

52:46.160 --> 52:51.060
It's Your, Memories Off, Girls Style comes out as well.

52:51.060 --> 52:55.360
I don't know quite what that is, but it's probably yet another game that's like, you know, I don't know.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.460
It sounds like a dating sim for some reason, but I don't know.

52:58.460 --> 53:05.360
Also coming out, Izumo II, Double Tacked comes out from GN Software on the PlayStation 2 this week.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.860
Moving to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.

53:08.860 --> 53:11.560
Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad.

53:11.560 --> 53:12.560
I'm not making that up.

53:12.560 --> 53:13.560
Loop Salad?

53:13.560 --> 53:17.160
Loop Salad comes out on the DS this week.

53:17.160 --> 53:17.960
What the fuck?

53:17.960 --> 53:21.460
Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad. I'm not even kidding, that's what it is.

53:21.460 --> 53:23.560
There's a little penguin on the cover, it looks cute.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.560
Weird looking thing.

53:25.560 --> 53:28.160
That comes out on the Nintendo DS as well as

53:28.160 --> 53:35.160
Hiromichi Onisan no Ayako Taisunavi comes out from Dorasu this week on the Nintendo DS.

53:35.160 --> 53:41.460
And I love the cover, it's this very, very happy Japanese man standing in front of a rainbow.

53:41.460 --> 53:44.160
Not that I'm sure it's insinuating anything, I'm just saying.

53:44.160 --> 53:47.560
Is that like, you know, the Japanese version of the Wiggles over there or something like that?

53:47.560 --> 53:50.260
It could be, actually, that's a very distinct thought.

53:50.260 --> 53:54.360
So I linked that in chat, because, yeah, I don't know, he's very happy.

53:54.360 --> 53:55.860
He's like Richard Simmons happy.

53:55.860 --> 53:58.760
You should get a t-shirt with that on the front there.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.060
Ah, it would be, yeah.

54:01.060 --> 54:04.460
He's like the Japanese Ronald McDonald.

54:04.460 --> 54:05.460
Yeah, I know that.

54:05.460 --> 54:10.060
That picture is waiting to be 4chan'd into something, seriously.

54:10.060 --> 54:11.460
Seriously, chat.

54:11.460 --> 54:18.060
Look this game up if you're listening on the podcast and didn't get a chance to get the link in chat.

54:18.060 --> 54:24.860
Lastly, let's go to Sony PSP, where there's a game called Patapon coming out on January 1st.

54:24.860 --> 54:27.060
I have that on my PSP right now.

54:27.060 --> 54:27.960
You like that? Is it good?

54:27.960 --> 54:30.260
Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

54:30.260 --> 54:31.360
Well, Jesus.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.560
That's the eye of all one.

54:33.560 --> 54:38.360
And lastly but not least, Sega Rally Revo also coming out on the Sony PSP.

54:38.360 --> 54:40.960
I'll tell you what, I'll play it during break, and then I'll tell you how it is.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.460
Yeah, you should tell us.

54:42.460 --> 54:45.360
Alright, let's move on. Back to the gaming news.

54:45.360 --> 54:54.860
Well, to move even further over to the UK, you know, there was the drama going on regarding the release of Manhunt 2.

54:54.860 --> 54:59.160
And they had said that, yeah, it would be okay, there would be no harm in the game.

54:59.160 --> 55:04.360
Well, the High Court has said, nah, it's gonna be harmful, so we don't want it.

55:04.360 --> 55:14.160
Actually even stating that the Video Appeals Committee misinterpreted the term of actual harm,

55:14.160 --> 55:18.460
and that they should have considered a wider realm of harm.

55:18.460 --> 55:32.260
So, it will not be released in its current incarnation, because it will not be rated by the BBFC, which is the British form of film classification.

55:32.260 --> 55:37.460
And there's no telling if it will be in any incarnation released.

55:37.460 --> 55:45.260
You know, just a message to our friends over there in the UK who might be, you know, legally involved in all this.

55:45.260 --> 55:48.760
Just release the damn game, because seriously, it's not gonna sell anyway.

55:48.760 --> 55:51.060
They've all heard from us that the game sucks.

55:51.060 --> 55:55.660
So, you know, just stop wasting the dollars, you know, getting the court order.

55:55.660 --> 55:56.760
It's not that good anymore.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.360
Just let them sell it, no one's gonna buy it. It sucks.

55:59.360 --> 56:02.560
It was good when, you know, we didn't know what the game was gonna be like,

56:02.560 --> 56:06.760
but now that it's been out, and we've seen the reviews, and we've played it, and we've kind of gotten over the,

56:06.760 --> 56:09.560
oh wow, this was violent, okay, let's move along.

56:09.560 --> 56:13.060
You know, if the British board wants to look at something, I mean, condemn 2.

56:13.060 --> 56:15.260
Hello, exploding babies?

56:15.260 --> 56:18.260
I mean, that might necessitate a ban or something.

56:18.260 --> 56:21.760
But you don't understand, though, Rob.

56:21.760 --> 56:26.060
Exploding babies, I mean, that has nothing to do with, like, sexual stuff.

56:26.060 --> 56:28.260
So, you know, that's also another reason why we...

56:28.260 --> 56:30.760
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

56:30.760 --> 56:34.960
Exploding babies, that's not as offensive as ripping off someone's testicles with pliers.

56:34.960 --> 56:38.060
What?

56:38.060 --> 56:41.160
Alright, let's keep moving with the gaming news.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.160
So, let's see here.

56:44.160 --> 56:47.160
This isn't really a big surprise.

56:47.160 --> 56:53.860
Ubisoft has confirmed that there's gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming in their next fiscal year,

56:53.860 --> 56:56.560
which, you know, 2008, I guess that starts in March.

56:56.560 --> 56:59.560
Big whoop.

56:59.560 --> 57:02.560
I mean, we already knew this was kind of rumored to be coming out anyways,

57:02.560 --> 57:07.060
and I see some, you know, artwork here that they were showing off.

57:07.060 --> 57:17.260
No word, though, on when exactly it's gonna be out, because their fiscal year runs from basically March of this year through April of 2009.

57:17.260 --> 57:21.260
So, somewhere in between there, we're gonna get a new Prince of Persia game.

57:21.260 --> 57:26.560
And hopefully it looks like this, you know, piece of artwork that they have, because it looks like Strider.

57:26.560 --> 57:31.060
But, you know, not a big surprise.

57:31.060 --> 57:32.060
Hmm.

57:32.060 --> 57:34.260
I'm going to the chat room and looking at some comments.

57:34.260 --> 57:38.260
If you want to go to chat.orangelaungeradio.com and leave some comments.

57:38.260 --> 57:43.260
Going back to the last story, RawstealUT says,

57:43.260 --> 57:46.260
No more Manhunt 2, angry face.

57:46.260 --> 57:51.260
Frisbee says, Come on, guys, Manhunt 2 is not a game to get locked up in the government.

57:51.260 --> 57:56.260
Sonofdad says, Manhunt 2, no plastic knife attachment for the Wiimote yet?

57:56.260 --> 57:57.260
They have those.

57:57.260 --> 57:58.260
Shut up.

57:58.260 --> 58:03.260
It's not a plastic knife, but it's a plastic sword, and then they've got, you know, stuff like that.

58:03.260 --> 58:05.260
But, I don't know.

58:05.260 --> 58:07.260
Let's see.

58:07.260 --> 58:11.260
GS68 says, I should maybe take a break from game politics.

58:11.260 --> 58:16.260
The story they've been running make me want to stab random people, I guess, in response.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.260
Well, see, wait a minute.

58:17.260 --> 58:20.260
Now, see, you're displaced anger there is part of the problem.

58:20.260 --> 58:23.260
You know, video games make you want to stab random people.

58:23.260 --> 58:24.260
No, I'm kidding.

58:24.260 --> 58:25.260
I know that's just a question.

58:25.260 --> 58:30.260
I'm sure in Japan, though, they probably have a knife attachment for, you know, the Wiimote.

58:30.260 --> 58:35.260
I mean, they have attachments for all the different weapons in Ghost Squad in there,

58:35.260 --> 58:37.260
so a knife maybe.

58:37.260 --> 58:39.260
That'd be kind of neat.

58:39.260 --> 58:41.260
You could pretend that the shark gun's a knife.

58:41.260 --> 58:44.260
That's just, yeah, I mean, do you really need that?

58:44.260 --> 58:45.260
I mean, come on.

58:45.260 --> 58:46.260
It's a little strange.

58:46.260 --> 58:48.260
Well, did you ever see the, did you see that story this week?

58:48.260 --> 58:52.260
Someone made a replica energy sword.

58:52.260 --> 58:53.260
No.

58:53.260 --> 58:58.260
They made, it's an actual sword, but they made it, you know, look like the energy sword from Halo 3.

58:58.260 --> 58:59.260
Interesting.

58:59.260 --> 59:01.260
Some people have a lot of free time on their hands.

59:01.260 --> 59:07.260
All right, well, let's move over to the PSP, and unfortunately, Sony needs a little more time on their hands

59:07.260 --> 59:09.260
because Skype was announced for the PSP.

59:09.260 --> 59:11.260
Remember, we talked about Skype a couple weeks ago on the show.

59:11.260 --> 59:14.260
It's going to be coming to the PSP if you own a PSP Lite, that is,

59:14.260 --> 59:18.260
because the lights have more memories on board, but they've been delayed.

59:18.260 --> 59:23.260
Skype was supposed to hit the PSP on the 24th along with some companion microphones.

59:23.260 --> 59:26.260
However, Sony had to come out with a press release that says in part,

59:26.260 --> 59:33.260
quote, it was found that the microphone did not meet the Skype specifications, in part, to obtain certification.

59:33.260 --> 59:35.260
Sorry, you still sound like a douche.

59:35.260 --> 59:37.260
That is unacceptable.

59:37.260 --> 59:39.260
If you've been listening to this show for any length of time,

59:39.260 --> 59:44.260
there's a lot of people on Skype whose microphones have probably failed a lot of types of certifications.

59:44.260 --> 59:48.260
I know that.

59:48.260 --> 59:49.260
I know what you're doing.

59:49.260 --> 59:52.260
I'm so excited to be honest with you.

59:52.260 --> 59:55.260
Yeah, it sounds like it works to me because that's how all the Skype calls sound like.

59:55.260 --> 59:56.260
I know.

59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.260
Can we have Skype certify all our listeners' microphones or something?

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.260
Just kidding.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.260
We heart the listeners and the ones that call in on Skype,

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.260
but just don't forget to call Echo 1-2-3 before you call our show.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.260
That's all we ask, okay?

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.260
Anyhow, so no news yet on when this will be coming out for sure,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.260
but we imagine the delay is not going to be that long.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.260
I could imagine there's going to be third-party microphones and stuff like that.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.260
I know there's headsets already for some of the SOCOM games,

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.260
which I imagine you could probably use those for Skype.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.260
I don't understand why they're delaying all this stuff.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.260
Oh, I'm probably guessing because everything that's Sony-related

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.260
seems to be delayed one time or another.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.260
Yeah, it's kind of funny because, of course, all the Sony haters came out and said,

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.260
here we go again, delay station 3.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.260
Like all the cool stuff.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.260
Except this is a delay station portable, okay?

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.260
That's true, that's true.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:42.260
All right, really quick, some comments from chat,

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.260
and then we'll get to the next story Jamie's going to do for us.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.260
ActDef says in chat, yes, if you sell something with the Skype name,

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.260
you have to be certified by them.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.260
So that is part of the point is that the microphones are chatted to you

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.260
as they get it, you know, Best Buy, Circuit City, whatever.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.260
It's just some random mic that happens to be a USB mic.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.260
But if you're going to sell something with the Skype name on it,

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.260
like the PSP's going to do, it has to be Skype certified, which makes sense.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.260
And Tiger Claw says pretty soon the Skype calls on OLR

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.260
are going to be done by people using Skype on their PSP.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.260
I don't think that's actually going to be a bad thing at all because, hey,

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.260
if the mics are certified and everything's been tested,

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.260
you know it's going to work.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.260
So I look forward to that day actually.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.260
I don't know about you guys, but that'll be good.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.260
I'll cry.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260
Why would you cry?

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260
Because...

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.260
Cry tears of joy or tears of pain?

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.260
Cry tears of apathy.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.260
I can't wait to talk on my PSP out in public looking like a complete douche.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.260
Exactly.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.260
Yo, what's up, man?

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.260
I'm totally on my PSP.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.260
You know what it is?

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260
It's the N-Gage all over again.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:42.260
You don't have to side talk on it because it has a microphone.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.260
Although the microphone that they're going to have is like

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.260
plugs into the USB thing on the front,

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:50.260
I think on the top of the actual system,

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.260
which doesn't make any sense to me when you think about it

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.260
because why won't they just have a headset or something they can plug in?

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260
I know.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.260
So instead you're just like, hello?

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.260
Hello?

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.260
Talking with the PSP in front of you and be like, hi.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.260
How's it going?

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.260
Yeah, totally.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.260
Or do like they have with the iPhone.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.260
Their headphones are so smart.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.260
They've got just a little tiny microphone,

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.260
but I was outside in the wind talking to my mom on it

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.260
and she heard me just fine.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.260
I've got to say this.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.260
There's Justin TV chat and there's our chat at Orange Laundry Radio.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.260
Mac Man's making smart ass comments in both.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:27.260
He says in the Justin TV chat, echo 123 is for wussies.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.260
Call in with no sure quality test.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.260
Hell, don't even buy a microphone.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260
You, sir, are part of the problem.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.260
But he says in chat at orangelaundryradio.com,

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.260
yo, I'm on my PSP.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.260
Want to pick me up?

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.260
Want to pick me up?

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260
Sorry, I just.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260
No.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260
No, I don't want to pick you up.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.260
Can I do my story now?

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260
Yes, you may.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.260
Something that's even more retarded than Skype.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.260
Uh-oh.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260
Well, then that microphone anyway.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.260
Someone made an eye of judgment table

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.260
to make up for the fact that the camera is easily bumped into poor lighting.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:03.260
So he takes this little table and builds a custom hardwood replica of the mat

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.260
and apparently it works just fine,

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.260
but I was like, people like this game enough to care?

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.260
Has that sold any more copies?

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.260
Oh, no, I don't think it has.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.260
What is the latest update on the eye of judgment numbers?

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.260
Still hasn't broke another 100,000 or even 10,000.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.260
Can we count table sales as part of the million?

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:28.260
Honestly, if you want to, go right ahead.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:32.260
Before, I mentioned it in that thread because I was egging on people in there.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:37.260
I said I'd be surprised if it surpassed 300,000 units.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.260
But right now, it's really starting to flatten off.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:47.260
I mean, it sold 4,000 units in the U.S. only in the last week or so.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.260
All right, since now we are going to add table counts,

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.260
what were we at, 160,000?

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:56.260
Adding the tables, we're now up to 160,001

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.260
because that's how many of these tables will probably sell.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.260
Well, it's just this guy that made it.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.260
It doesn't say anything about it being retailed.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.260
Oh, okay.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.260
I mean, there's a comment on there that it would be retail ready

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.260
if they add like a cup holder,

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.260
but he just made this for himself.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.260
So this is unacceptable.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.260
Where am I going to put my drink on this table?

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.260
This guy's pretty hardcore to do something like that.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.260
You've got to be a pretty hardcore Eye of Judgment fan.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.260
This guy's name is Matt, and he plays as Havok.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.260
Watch out for Havok.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.260
And I'm just still boggled.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.260
I guess if you like it enough and you want to do that,

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.260
I guess kudos to you.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.260
But from my perspective, since I don't really care for Eye of Judgment,

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.260
I'm just like, okay.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.260
I know, I'm always kind of like,

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.260
you could have built like a house for a cat or a dog.

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:53.260
But then I think about that I did actually have my place mat

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.260
that I made when I played Magic back in the day.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.260
It wasn't a table.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.260
It was a plastic mat.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:05.260
It used to be the shit, now it's the crap.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.260
All right, let's move on.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.260
Please, before we get into Magic the Gathering talk,

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.260
please look at the same show.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:17.260
Anyways, Sony's really trying to catch up with the whole Nintendo fad

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.260
of releasing consoles in different colors.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:25.260
Now in Asia, you will be able to pick up a red PS2 system.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:30.260
Also, what's kind of neat is, according to some FCC filings,

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.260
we're going to be seeing a white PS3 coming to the U.S. as well.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.260
So, new colors, yay.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.260
Because that's why people weren't buying your PS3.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.260
It's because it wasn't white.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.260
Because everyone knows that white consoles sell better, right?

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.260
That's why the 360 and the Wii are outselling the PS3.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.260
It's all that black hate.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.260
That's what it is.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.260
People getting down on black consoles.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:01.260
Wow. Dot, dot, dot.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.260
I am inching away from Loki slowly.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.260
Well, you know, they could also use the Saturn argument

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:10.260
because the Japanese Saturn was white and over here it was.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
Yeah.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.260
Okay, that was kind of dumb.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.260
I can't get behind that argument.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.260
But they're set to come out in Asia February 4th,

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:23.260
so if you really need to get your hands on a red PS2, I don't know.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.260
There's other console sites out there that will sell colored PS2 systems

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.260
in almost any color of the rainbow that you want,

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.260
so do you really need to wait for this shit to import it?

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.260
And my God, seriously, it's the color of a console.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.260
If you don't have a PS2 already, it's like, oh, damn,

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.260
I was really hoping for a red one.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:42.260
Now my dreams can be realized at the end of the console cycle.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.260
Portal Combat said a clear PS3 would be sweet.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.260
It doesn't matter how many colors of these consoles you're going to release.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.260
Okay, so the PS2 is selling lots and lots and lots of consoles.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:56.260
PS3, not so much, you know, but I don't know.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.260
It's just going to confuse people even more with the white console now.

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.260
Yet another skew.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:05.260
What does it matter what it looks like as long as it's still the same piece of shit inside?

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.260
This one's white, but guess what it won't do this time?

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.260
Play Blu-ray movies or do something that's important.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.260
It has no lefts.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:19.260
I've never been more happy that we got our first day release than I am now.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:24.260
Wow.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:28.260
Sorry, I was looking for the clip on YouTube of the kid from Wondershosen going,

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.260
that's racist, but I couldn't find it.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.260
So you'll just have to imagine it in your head.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.260
I was able to find the white people song, but if you...

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.260
White people having fun.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.260
Total domination.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.260
Or global domination over everyone.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.260
Wondershosen is so fucking hilarious.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.260
Why did they stop doing that show?

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.260
She still sings the white people song.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.260
I don't know, she likes the songs on it.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Animal dance, animal dance.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:01.260
This is great.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:06.260
I like the one where they show the tour of the hot dog factory.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.260
I don't think this is the Wondershosen podcast, is it?

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.260
It's not, but I couldn't resist.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:20.260
Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.260
Rob, insert, you know, train wrecks.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:27.260
Alright, god damn. Alright, I'll get to it.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.260
I'll get to it.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:32.260
I know, seriously, we need an off-topic alarm.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.260
I'm looking at this picture that someone in the chat room linked.

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:41.260
It was actdeft that linked it in the chat room.

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:47.260
And it's from Gyakuten Saiban, which is, you know, Phoenix Wright.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:53.260
And it's two oranges with a banana sticking out of the middle.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.260
Oh yeah, dark soccer, because you're so good at getting this show back on track.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.260
I'm talking about a game.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.260
I don't see what's so funny about citrus roots.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.260
And it's our chat room that linked it, not me.

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.260
That means we have pervs in our chat room.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.260
I like pervs.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.260
There need to be more of them in the world.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.260
Pervs are awesome.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.260
Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.260
Hey, I did not derail the show.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.260
They derailed it with wonder shows and whatever.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.260
Look, Metal Gear Solid.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.260
That'll always save a day, right?

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.260
Here's the thing, though.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.260
It's actually the same old shit, but all over again.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:38.260
And that is because, apparently, Playasia is taking preorders for a brand new Metal Gear Solid collection.

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:41.260
That's right, it's the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:47.260
It'll set you back $34.90, and also $4 shipping and handling.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:54.260
You will get with it Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 substance, and Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.260
Woohoo!

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.260
Or you can just wait and get it at any retail store for $29.99.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.260
Or you could just, you know, borrow your friend's copy that they're not playing anymore.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.260
It has new artwork.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.260
That's the only difference.

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.260
And, of course, it all looks like the old artwork.

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:15.260
Because this style never changes.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:21.260
So if you were waiting all this time to get Metal Gear Solid, now's your chance.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.260
Now's your chance to get it in a couple months.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.260
Alright, let's move on.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260
Can I really?

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.260
And are you going to bring up things that have absolutely nothing to do with video games this time?

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.260
I don't know, we'll see.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.260
Soul Calibur 4!

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.260
They're bringing back three characters.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.260
Yay, we get Maxie.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.260
Who is cool, but I wish that he'd have his voice actor from the Dreamcast one.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.260
Because he's actually one of my favorite voice actors.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.260
And they're bringing back Sungmina and Yunsung.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.260
So they're all back.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.260
And two new stages, which one of them is a pirate ship.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:02.260
Which, I wanted to say there was already a pirate ship in one of the earlier ones, but then it was just piratey music for Cervantes.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.260
And an ice cave.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:10.260
Dude, Yunsung or whatever his name is is a pirate. That's pretty awesome.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.260
So is Maxie.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.260
I like playing this and he's cool.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.260
Maxie's also a pirate.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.260
You know what else I have to say about this story, Jamie?

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.260
What?

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:22.260
All the animals are doing the Animal Dance!

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.260
Animals everywhere!

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.260
Animal Dance!

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:50.260
Look! Everybody's doing the Animal Dance!

01:11:50.260 --> 01:12:04.260
That's the wonders of Wonderschosen.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.260
Rob.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.260
Yes.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.260
Rob.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.260
Yes.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.060
You don't even get the full slew of Rob.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.020
You just get two.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.780
And Chris threw something at you for me.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.980
Can we do another story now?

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:18.980
I'd like to apologize.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:22.340
In other news, Rob is random and he's red now.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.900
To everybody who's tuning into Orange Launch Radio for the first time, I'd like to apologize.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.820
Did my roommate bring us food?

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820
You're awesome.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.560
Do I have to share it?

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.020
You can have two of them.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.660
I don't want one because I'm full already.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.660
I ate a whole sandwich.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.660
Rob.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.660
All right.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:38.660
Thank you, though.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660
Then...

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.660
Then...

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.660
Okay.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.660
Hello.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.660
We're on the air.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.660
No, I'm just kidding.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.660
Hey.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:52.060
If you hadn't seen how off topic we were, you would not be bored.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.100
We were talking about animal dancing.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100
Okay.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100
Rob.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100
Pass it over.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.100
Yes.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.100
All right.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.100
I'm...

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.100
Low key, please.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.100
A video game subject or nobody's ever going to listen to the show again.

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.100
All right.

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.900
Well, a Final Fantasy 13 designer promises a demo for the game and promises that the

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.600
game will be out in 2008.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:18.980
Which means that we'll have it sometime possibly before January 1st of 2009 unless of course

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.660
they're going to renege on the whole thing and say, you know what, yeah, we ran into

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.420
some delays.

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.620
So they can tell us whatever we want and that each copy's going to come in case with gold

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.460
and free women.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.380
But, you know.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.380
Never mind.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.380
I don't want it anymore.

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.380
How about just loose women?

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.020
Yeah, I definitely don't want it.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.020
Free Loose Women.

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:53.140
That'll be with the, what was it, the Fabula Nova Crystalis collection, which has the dumbest

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.300
name of the series.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.920
It's called Final Fantasy 13.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.940
Do we need to go crazier with the name?

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.180
It's worked for Final Fantasy 7, it's worked for Final Fantasy 10, it's worked for Final

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.920
Fantasy 10-2.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.980
The only thing is, even if this does come out in 2008, which I highly doubt a creator

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:17.140
is promising it or not, it'll come out in 2008 in Japan and it'll take them nine months

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.320
to translate it for us.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.700
What good is this going to do me?

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.700
That's okay though.

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700
This is all about me.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.180
I'm sure this is all the news that Sony needs to start playing it in their commercials for

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:33.380
the PS3 to get people hyped up to buy their system.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:39.500
Although, to their credit though, they did remove Haze from there now and they still

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:45.860
have Metal Gear Solid, which doesn't look like it's coming out in the spring anymore,

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.860
I don't know.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:52.680
Alright, let's move on so we can try and put this whole segment behind us and get out the

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.260
last few stories here, including, speaking of the PlayStation 3, Best Buy is clearing

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.180
out the 80 gigabytes.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.500
That's right, there is an internal memo going around, quote, the 80 gigabyte version of

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.580
the PlayStation 3 is going closed out and won't be replaced at this time.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.820
It will come off the planogram on January 28th.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.760
The 60 gigabyte version should already be gone from stores.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.760
Only the 40 gigabyte version of PS3 will be sold in Best Buy stores at this time.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.340
This means that there currently isn't a version that is PS2 compatible.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:24.740
At this time, Sony hasn't made any announcements about new products.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:30.140
And I think as of this recording right now, they have sold out of the 80 gig system.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.060
It's not even on their website anymore.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.940
So are they going to, what, is Sony planning to put out a 120 gigabyte version?

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.020
How much you want to bet that they're phasing it out and the white PS3 is going to be another

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:44.100
40 gig and then they're going to make a black something or other that's, you know, another

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.100
system.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.100
Or maybe they're phasing out...

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.280
Does this have to do with the whole thing on a somewhat related note about the cheaper

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.960
Blu-ray lasers now?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.220
Maybe it might also have to do with the new systems going to have DualShock 3 controllers

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.280
in them now.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.860
Maybe they're, you know, phasing out the 80 gig systems for that.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:05.660
Also maybe they're going to stop offering MotorStorm for free, you know, I don't know.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:10.180
I mean, you know, and even Microsoft's to blame for having a ton of different skews

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.180
for their products.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:16.220
But seriously, the PlayStation 3 has been very confusing with what's available.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.160
First it's the 60 and the 20.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.140
And then the 20 goes away.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.700
And then it's the 60 and the 80.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:23.700
And then, you know...

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.660
They show absolutely no confidence in their product.

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.340
And then the 60 goes away.

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.900
And now it's the 80 and the 40.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:29.900
And then the 80's going away.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.620
And now it's the 40 and God knows what.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620
We'll see.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.620
All right.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:39.700
Well, anyhow, we're going to bring this Segment A to a close very soon.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.180
I know it probably couldn't have come at a better time, honestly.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:48.020
But first, we're going to take a trip down memory lane and close out Part A in a dignified

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.020
manner.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.020
Because that's what we need to do.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.940
And we're going to do that by paying a little bit of respect to our elders by taking a moment

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.980
to acknowledge a classic game of the week.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:02.320
And it comes to us from the one and only, Dark Sakura.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.940
So what game this week, Dark Sakura?

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:12.380
The game of the week is Akumajo Dracula X Chi No Rondo, which is Dracula X Rondo of Blood.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.380
And um...

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.380
Nice.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.140
As a lot of people know, it was recently re-released for the PSP.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:24.340
But I'm not talking about the PSP one.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.220
And actually, the other clip that I liked had the better music.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.220
Oh, sorry.

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220
This one loaded first.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.220
I played this.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.220
Yeah.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.540
The other one in particular, because it was new music that was for that game.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:39.340
It was the theme Bloodlines, which was the theme of Richter Belmont, which is the character

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.020
that they brought in this, who was also in Symphony of the Night, which came out in Japan

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.060
as Nocturne in the Moonlight.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:50.740
This is the predecessor to that game, because you actually start off Symphony of the Night

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:58.220
as Richter at what's supposed to be the end of this game, when he fights Dracula.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:06.460
And of course, the music I have linked is from the PC Engine Duo Disc, which was all

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:07.460
Redbook audio.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:10.220
You can actually put it in your CD player and listen to it, although it's just the cool

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.220
thing where if you put it...

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.940
Because I don't know if anyone ever did this with Symphony of the Night.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.220
If you put it in your disc and try to listen to it, you get a warning.

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:20.500
This is a PlayStation Black disc.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.860
If you listen to the game track, it will blow up speakers.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:30.460
I had the same thing on the Japanese one, too, on the PC Engine one, which I thought

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.460
was really cool.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:37.780
But anyway, the game had little animated cut scenes.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.380
I should say poorly animated cut scenes.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:47.100
And also, the intro of it was done in German, and for old Listeners Reverse Show, I've actually

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:54.420
brought in my TurboGrafx, because you can play it on the US TurboGrafx, there's no country

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.420
you'd lock out.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.420
But you can play...

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.420
This is classic Castlevania.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.180
That was a long time ago.

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:06.860
In fact, if I do remember right, this is Super Castlevania IV, or the last traditional Castlevania

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.340
games that have come out.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.620
All the rest of them have had that sort of Metroidvania format.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:16.420
I love that term, Metroidvania.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:24.740
This particular one, because of how, I guess, relatively rare it was on PC Engine, it's

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.980
really hard to find it for less than 150.

01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980
I have an original.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.980
I had burdens for a long time, because my friend had an original.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:35.660
We got ours because someone owed us 100 bucks and came back from the family game, which

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.780
I thought was pretty freaking cool.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:47.900
It also had, and now this did have a version of it on the Super Nintendo that was not...

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.020
And a lot of people said, oh, it wasn't all that great.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.500
I actually enjoyed the Super Nintendo one.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.760
Not me, I don't like it.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.780
Not compared to the TurboGrafx, or, you know what I mean, this first version, PC Engine.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:01.540
This one, the cool thing about it is that as you went through, you had different routes

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.300
that your story would take.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:09.980
Like if you rescued Maria, you can play as her.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.380
As I understand, she was supposed to be playable in Symphony of the Night, as well as two other

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.820
levels that they never completed, but on the Saturn version, you can play as her.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.320
And all of her attacks are there.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:30.580
She threw birds for her attack, and her special weapons were a dragon, a kitten, a turtle

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:40.580
shell, and another type of bird that came out, which translated actually to the, I guess,

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:46.300
four major gods in the Saturn version that came out later.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:53.300
But also she gets this uber cutesy ending, and it was crazy.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:59.060
The other funny thing about this is that because it had to run on the arcade card 3, if you

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:05.960
didn't have an arcade card 3 in, it actually had Dracula X Stage X, which was done in really

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:15.060
bad sort of rendered looking bubble figures, and it went through all this that way.

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.800
Also a lot of the enemies in this game were original for this one and showed up in a lot

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.820
of the later series too.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.700
You had the Pikemen, which were I think the most single annoying characters ever.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.940
They're the ones who stand on the ledge and drop a pike down on you, and they were hard

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:35.180
to get past.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:40.820
This game right here to me is the top of the series.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:47.120
And I think that Symphony of the Night, or not Turn in the Moonlight, it expanded on

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.540
what this game started.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.540
I'd agree.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.540
To a point.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.820
I think Symphony of the Night exceeded it a little bit, but we wouldn't have Symphony

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.740
of the Night if it weren't for this, so you have to respect the elders.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:07.640
And of all of the series, as far as I'm aware, well these two are linked together.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:14.140
This one and Symphony of the Night are the only games to carry the actual Dracula X logo.

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.460
I love this from actdeft in chat.

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.860
What is a podcast?

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.940
A miserable little pile of hosts.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:20.940
But enough of that.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:21.940
Have at you.

01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:22.940
Winner.

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:33.340
And it was, there's actually several remixes that were in this one from some of the previous

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.700
games too.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.860
Some of the little music clips carried over.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:49.860
And yeah, this one, if you can find an original, good luck.

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:58.660
But other than that, this is probably, that's a scary little noise that thing makes.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:05.900
But I'd have to say of all of the, this is probably one of my top five games.

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.900
F.R.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:07.900
F.R.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:13.380
Alright, well, there you have it, your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, Dracula

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.620
X.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:20.100
I also think the bad guy is funny because his name is Shaft.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.100
What you talking about?

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.100
Alright.

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:24.620
He wears a bonnet in Symphony of the Night.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.640
I think now is a good time for us to take a break.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.020
So we're going to do that.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.500
Try to get past a little bit of the randomness we've had this segment.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.980
Although a little randomness is healthy.

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.980
Come on.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.700
If we didn't have the randomness, we'd be just another boring old podcast.

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:36.700
Same old thing.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.800
Same old news you can read on the blogs, right?

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.020
Randomness is what makes us us.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.700
So thanks for sticking with us and the craziness.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.420
We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.820

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:51.820
