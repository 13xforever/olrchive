WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.200
Tonight, January 6th, 2008, we'll lose the bound of another Xbox 360 model, Rock Band

00:20.200 --> 00:24.480
gets new songs from the magazine and later this month you can call our show from your

00:24.480 --> 00:32.360
PSP.

00:32.360 --> 00:36.160
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
Radio.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.880
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:41.880 --> 00:43.400
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.960
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura,

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
Jamie Summers.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
Hi.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
And how are you Miss Summers?

00:50.960 --> 00:51.960
I'm recovering.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
Recovering?

00:52.960 --> 00:53.960
That's right, you've been kind of sick.

00:53.960 --> 00:59.240
I remember last week on our year-end show you were sinacy and sniffly, but you seem

00:59.240 --> 01:01.460
a little better this week.

01:01.460 --> 01:05.540
It took me practically the whole week to get over my sinus infection and drinking to excess

01:05.540 --> 01:11.280
on New Year's Eve did not help, nor did, you know, singing for on Rock Band, nor did that

01:11.280 --> 01:12.280
help.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.840
Yeah, you look like you have about 80% HP this week.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.840
Yeah.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.160
Last week you were in the red, definitely.

01:19.160 --> 01:26.320
Wednesday I got to work and I was just in hell, so I called in on Thursday and Friday

01:26.320 --> 01:32.280
and tried to get to the doctor and apparently all the medical facilities lost power because

01:32.280 --> 01:34.280
of our crazy Alabama-esque storms.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.600
Oh yeah, we'll be talking about that in a moment, our non-gaming bit.

01:38.600 --> 01:45.640
So I ended up having to talk to the advice nurse and sent out the husband to get the

01:45.640 --> 01:50.680
drugs and I'm functional today.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.600
Let me cast cure on you.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.560
I'm on the last day, I'm on the very last of my antibiotics today.

01:56.560 --> 02:01.420
All right, well hopefully that'll work and you'll be backed up to 100% health next week.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.360
Maybe you'll even gain a level.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
Hurray!

02:04.360 --> 02:08.240
Joining us as well, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.240
Hello.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.240
How are you, Loki?

02:10.240 --> 02:11.240
I'm good.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
Yeah?

02:12.240 --> 02:13.240
And how are you?

02:13.240 --> 02:14.240
Are you at 100% HP this week?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.960
I'm reading in gadget right now.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.960
Are you?

02:17.960 --> 02:21.640
Well, I'm just catching up on the Sony thing.

02:21.640 --> 02:26.120
That's right, because as we are taping live, we do subject ourselves to a live taping every

02:26.120 --> 02:30.320
week and right now, this very moment as we were taping on this Sunday night, Consumer

02:30.320 --> 02:33.720
Electronics Show is just starting to get underway.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.640
And it's actually kind of funny because I was considering a last minute getaway because

02:38.640 --> 02:43.400
I'm still on vacation from the day job until Wednesday, so William and I were considering

02:43.400 --> 02:47.120
doing another last minute getaway and we were going to go to Disneyland, but then we're

02:47.120 --> 02:50.880
like, we probably shouldn't do that because the crazy storms are on the way and we actually

02:50.880 --> 02:52.680
thought about going to Vegas.

02:52.680 --> 02:57.440
And so I was looking at hotels in Vegas, I'm like, I cannot, why are all the hotel rooms

02:57.440 --> 02:59.280
doubling as of Monday night?

02:59.280 --> 03:02.620
Like we were looking at rooms like Excalibur and Circus Circus and like some of the not

03:02.620 --> 03:04.360
so high end places, right?

03:04.360 --> 03:09.400
And like these places were shooting up to like, you know, twice as much on Monday night

03:09.400 --> 03:11.800
and I couldn't figure out what it was and it finally dawned on me today.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.560
I was like, oh, we couldn't go because Consumer Electronics Show is starting.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
And then I was kind of pissed.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.520
I was like, why the fuck didn't I go to Consumer Electronics Show?

03:20.520 --> 03:24.320
I had this time off of work, I totally could have gone if I had planned better.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.480
They don't announce too much at CES.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.500
It's not a lot of gaming stuff, but you know, I happen to be a little bit of a tech nerd

03:31.500 --> 03:35.120
in addition to a gaming nerd, as I'm sure a lot of our fans are.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.040
There's a little bit of tech nerdiness that goes with the gaming nerdiness, right?

03:38.040 --> 03:39.360
Am I right?

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
Yeah.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
So it would be fun to go.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.160
And even William was like, I want to go to that sometime because you know him.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.920
He likes to look at the big TVs and all that stuff and you know, he's the only PlayStation

03:49.920 --> 03:51.480
3 supporter I know of in the world.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.520
Yeah, I support the PlayStation 3.

03:53.520 --> 03:57.120
You know what, I'll be supporting their online services as soon as they come out with those

03:57.120 --> 04:04.080
prepaid cards for their online content because I don't want to set up account and deduct

04:04.080 --> 04:06.280
money with my credit card.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.760
I'd rather use my hundreds of dollars of GameStop credit to buy cards that can translate

04:11.760 --> 04:12.760
to that.

04:12.760 --> 04:16.240
Well, Sony should seriously consider hiring my boyfriend as their major Nelson or something

04:16.240 --> 04:20.400
like that because he'll seriously tell people, you know, with me sitting right there and

04:20.400 --> 04:25.000
you know, I've been fairly critical of Sony, although I like to think I'm fair, but he'll

04:25.000 --> 04:29.280
sit there and tell me, oh no, you want a PlayStation 3 because it has MotorStorm.

04:29.280 --> 04:33.800
You want to get a PlayStation 3 because it has four chips in it and it's like having

04:33.800 --> 04:35.280
four brains.

04:35.280 --> 04:40.120
I'm like, but when you don't have any games to play on those four brains, what's the point?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.880
And we argue about this all the time.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.880
I don't know.

04:44.880 --> 04:49.160
Anyhow, let's, so we'll be talking about Consumer Electronics Show on throughout the night,

04:49.160 --> 04:51.120
but first let's start off a little bit.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.560
Actually I want to talk about this too.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.880
Those storms have been nuts, have been like absolutely crazy.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.720
Now I guess Loki and I are probably spoiled though because we've lived in California our

05:00.720 --> 05:04.000
entire lives and I'll tell you what, for those of you guys who don't live in California,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.800
we are freaking spoiled here when it comes to storms and things like that.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.800
No shit, Sherlock.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.520
And when this, I mean it was like a freaking hurricane coming in or something.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
No it wasn't.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.800
I know, but that's how everybody was calling it, like it was a hurricane, it was horrible.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
We just had these storms.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
It was more like a tropical storm.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.880
But it damn near had us not do a show tonight because my internet was down for the longest

05:23.880 --> 05:27.000
time and I was afraid that we weren't going to be able to do a show tonight because we

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
had no internet.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
This giant tree fell just up the street and knocked out a bunch of power.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.120
A bunch of homes in the block are still without power.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.840
A bunch of the traffic lights were out.

05:35.840 --> 05:43.340
It's like, I don't see why at least Sacramento isn't better prepared for heavy rain because

05:43.340 --> 05:52.640
every winter is the rainy season and a couple of years ago I remember when it wasn't as

05:52.640 --> 05:55.780
windy but it rained as badly.

05:55.780 --> 06:02.000
This is the first time that I've lived in this state that I can safely say that the

06:02.000 --> 06:08.640
weather has woken me up from a deep sleep and that hasn't happened since I lived in

06:08.640 --> 06:14.740
Alabama and actually that happened during the type 2 hurricane so yeah.

06:14.740 --> 06:18.480
You know I wasn't here the night the big storm hit.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.200
I was at Williams that night and then I came back yesterday and one of our trash cans is

06:24.200 --> 06:25.600
gone missing.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
No idea where it is.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
Have to call the city.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.160
I don't know if it flew up the street or where the hell it is.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
It's completely gone.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
It's in Oz.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.160
Apparently.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.760
But it's like...

06:33.760 --> 06:34.760
Linda is using it.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.080
Where the fuck am I going to put my trash?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.080
Call the city.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.080
Thankfully I haven't been here.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.560
My roommate, my poor roommate, they went on vacation in Mendocino, this big family vacation.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.640
They spent the whole time up there without power.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.120
They played Yahtzee by Candlelight.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.280
That's how they spent their time.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.480
I've done that before.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
What a vacation though.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.700
Actually I played D&D by Candlelight.

06:53.700 --> 06:58.640
But it's one of those things where once you get the house you can't get your money back.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.320
So they just had to kind of grin and bear it.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
Anyway, sorry.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
It has nothing to do with games.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.800
Well, except for the fact that when there's an outage, you know, no games for you.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Well, I talked to Extafur.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
Huh?

07:07.800 --> 07:11.640
I talked to Extafur for a little bit and he said his power was out but that he had his

07:11.640 --> 07:13.440
iPhone so everything was good.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.440
No.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.760
Well, thank God.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.120
He'd called me earlier this week and said, is your power out?

07:18.120 --> 07:23.280
And I'm sitting there with my laptop in my lap and my PC sitting there like chugging

07:23.280 --> 07:26.400
out power from, you know, the wall.

07:26.400 --> 07:31.040
Just like blasting air as I'm like running stress tests and stuff and I'm like, no, my

07:31.040 --> 07:32.520
power hasn't been out.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.240
Well, our power flickered for a little bit.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.320
And I was like, well, that's okay because I'm freaking sick.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.240
I'll just sleep through it.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.360
That was my whole thing.

07:43.360 --> 07:49.960
But I needed to go to the doctor really badly because I had been coughing rather heavily

07:49.960 --> 07:55.880
and I'm sure that a lot of our long time listeners remember when I had the plague.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.880
Basically I had started off as a sinus infection, went into bronchitis, went into pneumonia.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.960
I was sick for three months.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.960
And so my whole thing is I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.720
And so I needed to go.

08:07.720 --> 08:12.440
But thankfully the advice nurse gave me good advice.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.880
But I was just thinking about how many people at the medical facilities, you know, like

08:16.880 --> 08:21.880
people with injuries and Dan's point was, he's like, well, I'd rather you be sick for

08:21.880 --> 08:25.560
another couple of weeks than be in the hospital.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.440
And I was like, I know how to drive in this weather.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.640
He's like, yeah, you do, but no one else does.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
That's true.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.160
When it rains in California, everybody forgets how to drive.

08:33.160 --> 08:36.760
My drive tire is almost bald, so he wouldn't drive me either.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
Only when it rains.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
All right.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.920
We're turning into the Weather Channel podcast.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.280
Sorry, guys, but it's definitely been a topic on our minds this week.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.240
And you know, it has impacted our gaming weeks, I'm sure.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.520
I know it impacted mine, but I'll let Jamie start off with how was your gaming week as

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
we always do.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.160
I tried to play my DS and my eyes hurt too badly from my sinus pressure.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.340
So I basically played a lot of Ragnarok.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.800
And I tried to play pinball and got dizzy.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.240
So I didn't play any more pinball.

09:05.240 --> 09:13.160
But we Dan did break out Assassin's Creed on actually on a near morning.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.280
His buddy Eric broke it out.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.360
So I actually got to see quite a bit more of that in person.

09:19.360 --> 09:26.280
And it's pretty, but I heard quite a bit of cursing coming from the other room on Thursday

09:26.280 --> 09:28.560
when Will came over to play.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.840
And of course, there was lots of rock band.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
Lots and lots of rock band.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.600
And I got my Ninja Pass.

09:34.600 --> 09:41.520
The Ninja Pass is this lovely device that uses a micro SD card to load Game Boy DS games.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.480
Oh, okay, I've heard of this.

09:44.480 --> 09:53.680
And so, of course, we cannot on the air condone piracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but

09:53.680 --> 09:55.320
I have the Lindon too.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.240
And I have the Tingle game.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.060
I haven't loaded them yet, but I have them.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.280
I'm okay with doing that to imports.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.920
I think if ethically I'm okay with pirating the imports, because it's kind of one of those

10:06.920 --> 10:09.480
things where it's like, well, if you're not going to release it here, which I know some

10:09.480 --> 10:12.480
people are going to yell at me going, it's still wrong, fine, that's fine.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.680
But my own philosophy is if you're not going to release it here, then I'm going to get

10:15.680 --> 10:19.400
it one way or another, because I'm not paying those insane markup fees.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.620
I mean, it is insane to import a game.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.160
But games that are released here domestically, I don't really pirate.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.400
I buy most of my games.

10:26.400 --> 10:32.720
Well, there's a few games that I got that looked interesting.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.400
I'll have to put in my jump drive and get the names of them, because a few of them I

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
don't remember.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.800
But I think it'll be a pretty good investment.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.960
I mean, they were like 40 bucks a piece, and my friend ordered them in bulk.

10:45.960 --> 10:51.440
So both my husband and I have one, and I'm looking forward to using the hell out of it

10:51.440 --> 10:55.520
as soon as I can get the reader to work.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.000
All right, well, have fun with that.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Let us know how it goes.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.580
Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:01.580 --> 11:03.640
My gaming week was pretty good.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.840
Actually, I don't know, you guys always call me the tech master Loki and stuff, but I guess

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
I kind of earned my title.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.680
I brought my 360 back from death.

11:12.680 --> 11:19.280
So that's right, my three-ring 360 is working again, because I'm super awesome like that.

11:19.280 --> 11:23.920
And it just involved taking the whole thing apart and replacing what they call the X-clamp,

11:23.920 --> 11:26.760
which is something that holds the heat sink in place.

11:26.760 --> 11:32.960
And once I did that, it worked fine, so it's pretty awesome.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.320
So now that makes the console count six.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.140
I now own six 360s, which is ridiculous.

11:40.140 --> 11:44.760
So you brought back the red rings of death from the brink of death completely on your

11:44.760 --> 11:47.320
own, and what technique did you use to do it?

11:47.320 --> 11:56.040
It's basically if you search for X-clamp replacement, it literally takes about $6 in parts to do

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
it.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.360
It's just some screws and a couple washers, and that's about it.

12:00.360 --> 12:05.720
And what you do is because the way they built the clamp, which was genius to begin with,

12:05.720 --> 12:11.040
is it all focuses, it looks like kind of an X with all the points bent down.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.980
And so the middle is closest to the board, and they have a little plastic spacer on there.

12:15.980 --> 12:22.240
So what happens is all the tension from the heat sink actually pushes up in the middle

12:22.240 --> 12:27.920
of the chip, causing it over the time to basically warp the motherboard and possibly ruin some

12:27.920 --> 12:29.180
of the solder joints.

12:29.180 --> 12:34.320
So what you're basically doing is replacing the clamp with four screws with washer spacers

12:34.320 --> 12:40.200
in there, and that way it kind of equals that tension across the entire board so that it's

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
not bending.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.560
Plus, there was also a nice little foil piece on there, I guess a protective foil layer

12:45.560 --> 12:49.000
on my heat sink, which probably wasn't too good either.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.340
But once I replaced everything, it works fine now.

12:52.340 --> 12:55.500
Let me read some comments from chat, because this is too good, and I have yet to introduce

12:55.500 --> 12:59.640
the always present fourth guest on our show, the chat room over at chat.orangelaungereer.com,

12:59.640 --> 13:01.960
which is much more full tonight than it was last week.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.840
So welcome back everybody, after the holidays, I was just going to say, somebody who hasn't

13:05.840 --> 13:11.000
learned how to change their nickname yet, but this is great, recruit number 6763 says,

13:11.000 --> 13:16.600
and three rings later, Jesus 360 rose again, in regards to Loki's 360.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.960
Frisbee says, Towley brings Xboxes back to life, referring to the towel trick.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
Well, you don't really need to do that, actually.

13:22.960 --> 13:28.720
It's kind of weird, because what you're supposed to do after you do that replacement of the

13:28.720 --> 13:32.920
setup, you're supposed to turn it on without fans, and it's supposed to overheat.

13:32.920 --> 13:38.640
Now I did that, basically turn it on, and wait for the three lights to turn the two

13:38.640 --> 13:42.040
lights, but it did it almost instantly, and then I left it on there for about two minutes.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.560
The thing is, though, is it didn't really heat up at all.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.680
Like I mean, I felt the top, I felt the heat sink, felt the bottom, and I would think,

13:47.680 --> 13:51.420
okay, this thing's going to be on fire, but it didn't even feel that different at all.

13:51.420 --> 13:55.640
And poor Akuta, I'm reading this chat, Akuta in chat says, Ugh, I got the red ring of death

13:55.640 --> 13:59.160
this week, the day I got my 360.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.160
That sucks.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.080
It sucks to be you, my friend, I'm sorry to hear it.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.560
You know, it happened to me three days after I bought mine, so it's not too much different.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.400
And honestly, if I hadn't opened my system, I probably would have just sent it in to get

14:10.400 --> 14:13.280
replaced, but I did open my system.

14:13.280 --> 14:18.200
Sakura Max says, Loki, you should just work at the 360 repair center.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.120
Would you consider repairing somebody else's, like a legit system?

14:21.120 --> 14:25.920
If they've actually, you know, I would say if they can't send it back into Microsoft,

14:25.920 --> 14:31.800
then sure, I would do it, because it only took like six bucks with parts, but you know,

14:31.800 --> 14:35.160
it's not guaranteed to work all the time, but from what I read on there, because they

14:35.160 --> 14:40.880
have a thread with all the success stories, about 90% of them get repaired that way.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
Wow.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
That's amazing.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.020
You know, I figured for six bucks, and it's broken anyways, I mean the worst that'll happen

14:46.020 --> 14:51.040
is I waste six dollars and the 360's not replaced, but it works, so great.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.480
Anyways, beyond all that, I actually played a few games this week.

14:55.480 --> 15:00.080
I borrowed my wife's copy of Planet Puzzle League, because I bought it for her.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.840
Actually, that game's pretty fun.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.920
It reminds me a lot of Luminous, actually, a little bit, because they've got, you know,

15:05.920 --> 15:09.680
kind of good music, it goes with the whole thing, you know, background's kind of flashing

15:09.680 --> 15:11.720
and stuff, but it's a really fun puzzle game.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.680
Do you ever play Pokemon Puzzle League?

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
No.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
Same game?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
Same thing.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
Yeah.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
Well, whatever, that's all right.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.680
It's still fun.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
No, it's still fun.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.200
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

15:22.200 --> 15:26.120
I played Crysis, because I finally finished my computer, and that's fun.

15:26.120 --> 15:31.680
I mean, if you played Far Cry Instincts, it's basically the same damn thing, except now,

15:31.680 --> 15:36.320
you know, instead of being like some vampire, not vampire, like a werewolf type thing, you

15:36.320 --> 15:40.660
have this wonderful suit that can, you know, do amazing stuff, and it's very pretty.

15:40.660 --> 15:44.520
My favorite aspect of the entire game is all the wildlife running around, so like, I'll

15:44.520 --> 15:48.360
be fighting off, you know, some Koreans and stuff in the game, and then all of a sudden

15:48.360 --> 15:53.720
I'll see this like, a flock of birds run by, and immediately I turn fire on them, you know,

15:53.720 --> 15:57.520
or I pick up a chicken and huck it up into the air and then fire it.

15:57.520 --> 16:02.520
Or my other favorite is, there was this turtle that I found, ran the beach when you first

16:02.520 --> 16:06.720
land in the beginning of the game, and I wanted to put it back out into the sea, and fortunately

16:06.720 --> 16:12.400
I switched to strength mode, and I threw the turtle, and the impact of the water killed

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
it.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.760
I also punched it too, because I was trying to pick it up, and I'm like, I don't know

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
how to pick stuff up.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.760
This game sounds rad.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.760
It's awesome.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.440
You can like, see seagulls like, flying around, literally just fire them all in the air, that's

16:25.440 --> 16:30.680
the best part of the game, just all the like, crap that you can do that's in it.

16:30.680 --> 16:35.160
I want to point out this other comment in chat that's pretty good, one of your most

16:35.160 --> 16:41.600
vocal critics here in chat, Rasteel UT, who's always condemning you to hell for being such

16:41.600 --> 16:45.960
an advocate of modding and all that stuff, has this funny thing to say, he says, if Loki

16:45.960 --> 16:50.120
would actually apply himself and do repairs on systems, instead of dedicating himself

16:50.120 --> 16:52.440
to game theft, the world would be a better place.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.400
Well, it's better now, because that one system that I repaired was my modded system, so now

16:56.400 --> 17:01.680
he can send those cards and love letters to Loki at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.200
That system will never see live ever again.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.300
But my other one, that's a different story.

17:06.300 --> 17:10.160
It is interesting though, I mean, for being such a, you know, I get the sense you don't

17:10.160 --> 17:12.200
do this stuff to steal.

17:12.200 --> 17:16.680
You do this because you like the challenge of modding systems and making them look cool.

17:16.680 --> 17:20.740
I mean, that's kind of always why I've kind of turned the eye to it, is that I always

17:20.740 --> 17:23.040
think you were more kind of in it for the challenge.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.560
I mean, you do own six Xbox 360s, that's way more than an average person would own.

17:27.560 --> 17:32.600
Yeah, I don't really want to own that many, but that's alright.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.400
GS68 says, banned until 999 AD.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
Ah, whatever.

17:36.400 --> 17:41.880
Oh darn, if one of my 360s gets banned off live, gee, what will I ever do?

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
Alright.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
Anyway.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.880
Anything else for Gaming Weekly?

17:45.880 --> 17:49.960
That's it, but before we move on, I wanted to give you guys your Christmas gifts, since

17:49.960 --> 17:51.920
I didn't have them last week.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.920
Presents!

17:52.920 --> 17:53.920
Yay!

17:53.920 --> 17:56.200
Okay, so, first off...

17:56.200 --> 17:58.640
I don't like it when he sighs before giving his gift.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.960
No, no, no, it's not entirely bad.

18:01.960 --> 18:06.280
I'm sorry, but one of you does get a gag gift.

18:06.280 --> 18:12.480
So for Rob, I have Final Fantasy XII Remnant Wings, because you've actually played through

18:12.480 --> 18:13.480
Final Fantasy XII.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.680
I haven't played through the whole game, but enough of it, I know what's going on.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
Sweet.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.800
And Jamie, I apologize ahead of time.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
Don't kill me.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.280
No, I'm going to love this.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
What did Jamie get?

18:24.280 --> 18:31.280
But you have a copy of Imagine Babies.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.680
That's awesome.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.120
The last one they have there.

18:35.120 --> 18:42.200
Jamie got a copy of Imagine Babies, with a Z.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.160
Take care of up to six babies.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.240
Read the back for us, how did they advertise this game?

18:48.240 --> 18:53.000
Buy the babies good food, furniture, cute baby outfits, and toys.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Customize your house through mini-games.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.120
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

19:00.120 --> 19:04.800
It's like, I think everybody in iPod listening land, or however you're listening to this

19:04.800 --> 19:08.640
on PSP, whatever, is hearing the dot, dot, dot through their speakers right now.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
No, that's too good.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.800
It actually looks kind of cute.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.800
She's coming around.

19:13.800 --> 19:19.440
No, as long as they're virtual babies, I don't mind.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.440
There you go.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.040
You should raise some babies, and then tell the hubby, here's your baby.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.160
That would be great.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.160
See, there you go.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.160
Practical use for it.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.160
Yay.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.200
I think there's a part in the game where you can shake the baby, so I know.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.040
All right.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.120
They're actually kind of cute, though.

19:36.120 --> 19:40.560
The chat room is irritated, there's no operator 11 tonight, because they wanted to see Jamie's

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
reaction.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.040
Sorry guys, operator 11 is screwy.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.960
I was staring at it blankly.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.020
You could hear the dot, dot, dot through the microphone.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.020
You could.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.020
Thank you for the thoughtful gift.

19:49.020 --> 19:54.960
I was hoping, well, I was kind of trying to get some stuff to play this week, like, was

19:54.960 --> 20:03.000
it that, I don't even remember how it's, like, Pot to Pawn or something like that, that one

20:03.000 --> 20:05.080
weird one that looks like Loco Roco.

20:05.080 --> 20:12.720
And then I was hopefully going to have a copy of Nights to play for a special after show,

20:12.720 --> 20:16.960
but seeing as operator 11 is down, that doesn't work.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.960
Dope.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.080
Mac Man says, hey honey, I'm pregnant with digital babies.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.760
That's okay.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.080
All right.

20:24.080 --> 20:32.320
I could go into detail about, you know, the physical problems that come with being knocked

20:32.320 --> 20:33.320
up.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.320
Let's not.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.320
But I'm not going to.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.640
Considering the majority of listeners of our program are young men, I don't know if they

20:37.640 --> 20:40.720
want to hear it.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.960
Although maybe they should, I don't know.

20:42.960 --> 20:48.280
Those that are involved should think twice before asking their significant other to carry

20:48.280 --> 20:54.840
a 32 pound, 32 pounds of extra weight plus the hormone influx and having your stomach

20:54.840 --> 20:58.160
shoved up behind your lungs.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.320
You make it sound so sexy.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.640
Does someone have a chainsaw outside?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.480
That's the best thing ever.

21:03.480 --> 21:09.160
Yeah, I know you guys can't hear this over the thing, but somebody is out there with

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
a.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.160
Someone's out there with a chainsaw.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.240
Either a chainsaw or like a weed whacker or something, probably trying to clean up debris

21:15.240 --> 21:16.240
from the storm.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.240
I think it's a chainsaw.

21:17.240 --> 21:22.800
Like, you know, those yard work at night is maybe there were repair crews over on the

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
crossroad.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.440
Oh, my gosh.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.440
It's crazy around here.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.440
All right.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.440
My gaming week.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.720
We're never going to get to the gaming news.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.600
You know, what's funny is that a lot of people say I play too much.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
Wow.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
Well, guess what?

21:34.600 --> 21:37.300
My Internet was down for 24 hours thanks to the storm.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.300
So no.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.300
Wow.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.300
For me, QQ.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.300
I was so sad.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.560
So I did have to play other games and I spent some time playing Mario Galaxy, which I love

21:44.560 --> 21:46.480
more and more every time I play it.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.880
It's just amazing.

21:47.880 --> 21:52.720
And I love its little bits of retro-ness they have in it in regards to some of the music

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
and things.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.920
And I raved about it last week.

21:54.920 --> 21:55.920
I don't need to say much more.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.200
But I do love me some Mario Galaxy.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.000
I also played some more of Rock Band.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.060
I played till my arm literally hurt and felt like it was going to fall off.

22:04.060 --> 22:05.120
So that was a lot of fun.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.640
And then just played through a variety of various Xbox Live arcade games I needed to

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
catch up on.

22:09.640 --> 22:14.680
And I made use of my HD DVD player this week because I bought Stardust on HD DVD a couple

22:14.680 --> 22:16.520
weeks ago and I never got around to watching it.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.120
So I put it in the HD player and was watching that.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.520
And that's pretty much how I spent my time with the outage.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.360
So there it was.

22:23.360 --> 22:28.560
And GS68 says, thank you storms for keeping sky off the warcrack.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.900
Frisbee says chainsaw guy from Resident Evil 4 is outside and is coming to get us.

22:32.900 --> 22:33.900
I hope not.

22:33.900 --> 22:34.900
That would suck.

22:34.900 --> 22:35.900
That's a really gruesome ending.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.260
I don't know if you've ever had your head chopped off by a chainsaw guy.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.600
That sucks.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
It totally sucks.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.600
You know it happens to me all the time.

22:43.600 --> 22:50.360
And RusteelUT, who just seems to be a critic in general, he's critical of Loki's stance

22:50.360 --> 22:55.240
on things, he's critical of my WoW playing, he says, oh god, no WoW for one whole day.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.520
How could sky exist without his second job?

22:57.520 --> 22:59.560
But I can do no wrong.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.560
Actually you ass.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.560
Wow.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.280
I love taunting the listeners.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.600
No, I respect the opinion.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.440
But WoW is my third job.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.120
OLR is my second job.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.160
And then my day job is my first job.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.760
So WoW is my third job.

23:12.760 --> 23:17.200
So if you're going to taunt me, get it right.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.200
Jamie's chowing down on the whole wheat cookies William made for the New Year's party.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
They're humpy.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
They're good.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
They're really good.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.980
They help, they restore 10 HP when you eat them too.

23:26.980 --> 23:27.980
So eat a lot.

23:27.980 --> 23:31.100
They're also full of fiber.

23:31.100 --> 23:34.680
Our work's trying to get a dev kit for 360.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.680
What for?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.680
I don't know.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.680
Just to have?

23:37.680 --> 23:38.680
X to go.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.680
I hope.

23:39.680 --> 23:40.680
Dev kit.

23:40.680 --> 23:46.200
Also, I want to point out, I know OP11's down tonight, but we have some new decorations

23:46.200 --> 23:48.360
in the studio I guess you'll see next week.

23:48.360 --> 23:54.960
I was in this strip mall that had a lot of little stores in it that had imported things.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.720
I got a big Kingdom Hearts wall scroll that's now up on the wall that's pretty awesome.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.280
I got to say, that's a really great artwork.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.760
I don't know where that artwork comes from, but it's great.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.880
And a Final Fantasy XIII poster, if you can believe it, which is totally a bootleg I think.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.680
I think somebody just took Sony's official release picture and made a poster out of it,

24:10.680 --> 24:12.200
but it looks great nonetheless.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.720
So some new decorations to look forward to when the cam comes back.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.800
Meanwhile, we'll get into some housekeeping tonight.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.080
Just some things I wanted to say really quickly.

24:21.080 --> 24:26.140
Orange Launch Radio's rotation of music is going to be changing this week, which is going

24:26.140 --> 24:30.280
to cause some downtime either Monday or Tuesday during the day, but not a lot of people are

24:30.280 --> 24:33.880
listening during the day anyway, so I imagine people probably aren't even going to notice,

24:33.880 --> 24:36.960
but I just wanted to get that out there, that the station will be down for a little bit

24:36.960 --> 24:40.840
on Monday or Tuesday while the new songs go into rotation.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.280
And that's really it.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.960
Otherwise, welcome to our first show of 2008.

24:45.960 --> 24:46.960
Hurray.

24:46.960 --> 24:53.560
And you hate to interrupt, but literally right now Bill Gates is doing his CES keynote, so...

24:53.560 --> 24:56.040
Well, let's get into some news.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.000
Has he revealed anything yet, or...?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.560
No, it says, okay ladies and gentlemen, the keynote will begin in five minutes.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.760
Please take your seats.

25:02.760 --> 25:07.120
So we'll take a peek during the break and see if there's anything to report on in part

25:07.120 --> 25:11.920
B. But meanwhile, I believe there's some rumors about what might be being talked about tonight,

25:11.920 --> 25:12.920
yes?

25:12.920 --> 25:13.920
Yes.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.880
One of the rumors is that there's going to be yet another Xbox 360 SKU coming out.

25:17.880 --> 25:23.220
However, from what I remember, the SKU is actually supposed to be from another company,

25:23.220 --> 25:25.600
like Toshiba or something like that.

25:25.600 --> 25:31.280
But anyways, it's being dubbed the Xbox 360 Ultimate, and it's actually funny because

25:31.280 --> 25:37.560
this was reported in Stuff Magazine, because they're known for tech news, I guess.

25:37.560 --> 25:43.440
It'll be hitting stores, apparently, by this autumn, and will feature, of course, 1080p

25:43.440 --> 25:51.200
HDMI output, built-in Wi-Fi, high-def audio output, cooler 65nm hardware architecture,

25:51.200 --> 25:53.080
and a near-silent fan.

25:53.080 --> 26:00.520
On top of that, it's going to have an IPTV service, and a 320GB hard drive, and a built-in

26:00.520 --> 26:02.440
HD DVD drive.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.040
And it's all bullshit.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.800
I wouldn't be surprised.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.600
Part of me sounds like it's a bit much, I think.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
The system would be too expensive.

26:11.600 --> 26:17.320
But, at the same time, why would Stuff Magazine run something like that, then, if they didn't

26:17.320 --> 26:18.880
know that it was coming out?

26:18.880 --> 26:25.140
I don't know, it sounds stupid to me, but if it's not being dubbed the Xbox something

26:25.140 --> 26:32.400
or other, if it's just, you know, Toshiba's HD DVD player that also plays Xbox 360 games,

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
that kind of thing.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.300
Oddly enough, that makes a little more sense to me.

26:36.300 --> 26:42.300
And I always thought devices like the Panasonic Q were pretty awesome, and I never understood

26:42.300 --> 26:43.400
why they didn't come out here.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.840
Like, remember the Panasonic Q?

26:44.840 --> 26:48.320
There was a DVD player that came out in Japan that played GameCube games, as well.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.680
Well, there was a time, I don't know if they ever came out with them, but they were talking

26:51.680 --> 26:56.480
about TVs that were integrated with the original Xbox hardware, so that they could actually,

26:56.480 --> 27:01.560
you know, it would be like a built-in DVD player into your TV, but it also plays Xbox,

27:01.560 --> 27:02.560
you know, Xbox games.

27:02.560 --> 27:07.840
Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's a lot of TVs that have DVD technology built

27:07.840 --> 27:08.840
into them.

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
Exactly, something like that.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.160
You just put the DVD right in the TV and it plays.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.160
Why not?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.160
That seems like a logical next step.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.200
I'm kind of surprised no gaming company has really done that.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.920
I mean, it would seem logical to me.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.920
I don't know.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.920
I don't know.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.280
Well, we'll see.

27:22.280 --> 27:27.960
Perhaps that could be something that is revealed tonight during Bill Gates' last CES speech,

27:27.960 --> 27:31.720
if I'm not mistaken, right, because he's stepping down or whatever.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.240
I shouldn't say stepping down, but stepping aside for a little while, so he won't be doing

27:35.240 --> 27:36.240
the keynotes anymore.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.400
It's like, yes, I'm too rich to be doing this shit.

27:39.400 --> 27:44.000
Well, anyhow, Sony has revealed some of their plans, and one of the big announcements that's

27:44.000 --> 27:48.200
going to impact gamers is in regards to the slim PSP.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.760
We're going to be getting Skype in late January.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.400
Of course, Skype is a program that listeners of our show, I hope, would know very well.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.640
After all, we were one of the first Internet programs anywhere years ago to actually have

28:00.640 --> 28:07.900
a Skype line, and users have been calling us since like 2003 or 2004 on our Skype line.

28:07.900 --> 28:12.360
At Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype, and now folks are going to be able

28:12.360 --> 28:15.920
to call from their PSP when this new firmware is released at the end of January, but the

28:15.920 --> 28:22.080
only catch is it's only available on the PSP Slims so far.

28:22.080 --> 28:26.460
But now, Loki, you say that through your controversial hack-and-crack method, you think that this

28:26.460 --> 28:28.080
could work on the PSP fatties.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.560
I think so.

28:31.560 --> 28:38.480
Right now, they have a lot of the firmware stuff that's locked in for the slim PSP, but

28:38.480 --> 28:44.100
some of the custom firmwares have enabled you to do other things, obviously, that might

28:44.100 --> 28:47.520
be locked out, except for, of course, video out, obviously, you can't do that on a normal

28:47.520 --> 28:53.680
PSP, but I wouldn't be surprised if you see something that will allow this to happen.

28:53.680 --> 28:58.240
I can't install this anyways on mine until custom one comes out anyways.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.740
That's pretty cool, and I've got to say Skype out and Skype in will be a part of this as

29:02.740 --> 29:06.460
well, and of course Skype out and Skype in are the things that let you use Skype as a

29:06.460 --> 29:07.560
normal telephone.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.120
We use Skype in here on the show.

29:09.120 --> 29:13.900
That's how you can call 1-888 at your game OLR, and we use an 800 number forwarder that

29:13.900 --> 29:16.480
forwards to our Skype line.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.340
Very technical, but it works.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.720
It does cost extra, though.

29:19.720 --> 29:20.720
Yes, it does.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.480
That's not something that's free, but I know somebody that uses Skype as their home phone

29:25.480 --> 29:28.620
and they love it.

29:28.620 --> 29:33.800
This is just another kind of cool thing for the PSP that's kind of breathing more life

29:33.800 --> 29:34.800
into it.

29:34.800 --> 29:39.840
I think a lot of people kind of wrote off the PSP when the games weren't so strong,

29:39.840 --> 29:45.880
but I think this kind of cements PSP as the handheld device.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.000
Notice how I don't call it a handheld gaming system.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.960
The DS is supreme, I think, in that category, but the PSP is one hell of a portable device.

29:53.960 --> 30:01.920
Now that it does pictures, movies, internet radio, now it does Skype, web surfing.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.440
This is like a computer in your pocket now.

30:04.440 --> 30:08.040
That's pretty awesome, the PSP that it's turning into.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.880
And it has Castlevania, which is odd, but does your iPhone have Castlevania?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
No, but my DS does.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
Oh, snap.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.160
All right, well that's all I have to say.

30:17.160 --> 30:23.040
I'd still prefer that if it was going to be initially a handheld gaming system, it remain

30:23.040 --> 30:24.040
a gaming system.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.600
They don't need all that extra crap.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
But I will say this.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.680
I mean, I think to some extent, I think that's what the N-Gage was trying to do, too, and

30:30.680 --> 30:33.360
remember how much shit the N-Gage got?

30:33.360 --> 30:38.080
Because I think at least PSP is still kind of like, I don't know.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.660
The way the PSP has done it, they still have kind of focused on games first and everything

30:41.660 --> 30:42.660
else is secondary.

30:42.660 --> 30:43.660
But I don't know.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.240
They've just done it so much better than Nokia did.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.880
The N-Gage was a piece of shit.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.080
It really was.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.080
I don't know.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.080
I can't explain that one.

30:50.080 --> 31:00.120
I think that the N-Gage could have been better had they gone for, first of all, cartridge

31:00.120 --> 31:05.160
bases of those stupid little chip things, something that could actually store enough

31:05.160 --> 31:09.520
media to make it look worth playing because I tried playing stuff on that and it was just

31:09.520 --> 31:10.520
awful.

31:10.520 --> 31:18.680
You know, at least the PSP doesn't, you know, it put a lot of focus into the gaming aspect.

31:18.680 --> 31:25.320
It was initially meant to be a gaming system and it has the right kind of media to support

31:25.320 --> 31:27.720
the types of games they want to do.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.720
Basically it's like this.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.300
When I played Castlevania on the PSP, you know, Rondo of Blood, I went, cool!

31:32.300 --> 31:33.360
This is cool!

31:33.360 --> 31:37.000
When I played Civilization on the N-Gage, a part of me died inside.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
It was that bad.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.560
I mean, it was like one of my favorite games of all time has been raped by a taco.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
I mean, literally.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.560
How about something better?

31:45.560 --> 31:48.480
Let me say one thing real quick before we get back into the news because Tiger Claw

31:48.480 --> 31:49.920
is mentioning something.

31:49.920 --> 31:55.580
I just realized, OLR is competing against American Gladiators tonight because tonight

31:55.580 --> 32:00.320
is the return of American Gladiators on NBC.

32:00.320 --> 32:08.720
This is all I have to say, TiVo, VCR, DVR, whatever, that's why you got it.

32:08.720 --> 32:13.600
Does anyone actually remember the old American Gladiators?

32:13.600 --> 32:14.760
Fuck yeah, I do.

32:14.760 --> 32:18.560
If you remember that, you remember how often they replayed that show.

32:18.560 --> 32:25.200
So that shit was replayed more than Cops, okay, and you know how much Cops is on TV.

32:25.200 --> 32:29.040
So just fucking wait, it'll rerun that shit to death.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.040
Exactly.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.040
Or if you're going to run away and go watch American Gladiators, at least download our

32:33.040 --> 32:35.280
podcast and listen to it later, I guess.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.000
I guess we can let that slide by.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.680
All right, sorry, back to the news.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
Can I talk?

32:40.680 --> 32:41.680
You may.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.440
Thank you, sir.

32:44.440 --> 32:51.020
For anyone who remembers Target Terror, it's coming out on the Wii as a Zapper game, and

32:51.020 --> 32:57.760
it looks awful, but it looks great at the same time, because it was one of those full

32:57.760 --> 33:00.680
motion capture type of games.

33:00.680 --> 33:07.460
I love Revolution X, so I'm actually sort of thinking about getting this just for the

33:07.460 --> 33:09.560
cheese ball factor.

33:09.560 --> 33:17.040
I love cheese ball games, so I think that's going to be kind of fun, but you have machine

33:17.040 --> 33:23.040
guns and grenade launchers and orbital space lasers and minigames and all kinds of fun

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
stuff.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.040
Looks like fun.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.040
Yeah.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.040
Is it true...

33:28.040 --> 33:30.240
Loki, weren't you saying something before the show, though, that they're going to charge

33:30.240 --> 33:33.640
like the full retail price for this, 40 bucks or something?

33:33.640 --> 33:34.840
Yeah, it's 40 bucks.

33:34.840 --> 33:35.840
That's crap tacky.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.000
I don't know about that.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.400
It's not worth 40 bucks.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.740
I'm sure it'll be in the bargain bin before too long.

33:40.740 --> 33:41.740
Just give it time, man.

33:41.740 --> 33:46.080
If it sucks, they'll drop the price quick.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.560
We shall see.

33:48.560 --> 33:54.280
Another fun news, if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine, or even if

33:54.280 --> 34:00.160
you don't, next month, the February issue, we'll have three exclusive rock band songs

34:00.160 --> 34:01.160
for download.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.640
Another thing that you should know about the official Xbox magazine discs, say for example

34:05.640 --> 34:10.460
you download that content on one friend's account, you can also take it to your friend

34:10.460 --> 34:13.320
and your other friend and so on and so forth.

34:13.320 --> 34:19.880
Since there's no real way to lock a DVD to a certain 360.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.760
So just share.

34:21.760 --> 34:26.480
Anyways, three songs are going to be with that.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.480
One of which is from Freezeprop.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.000
That would be Sprode.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.240
Not Super Sprode, but Sprode.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.480
Bang Camaro's Rock Rebellion and Count Zero's Shake.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.480
Wait, so we don't think the Sprode thing is a typo?

34:40.480 --> 34:43.280
Because they don't have a song called just Sprode unless it's something new.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.560
It might be something new or maybe a rock version of Super Sprode.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.480
Oh, that would make sense.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.040
Maybe like a cover of their own song or something.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.000
If I remember, Super Sprode wasn't too rocky.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.480
Well Super Sprode is fucking rad so I hope it is that song in some type of reincarnation

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
because I love that song.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.600
That was a great song in amplitude.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.880
But yeah, definitely check it out.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.180
I stopped subscribing to this magazine, but I'll have to pick one up.

35:08.180 --> 35:10.480
So you're going to buy one so I don't have to?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.480
Yeah.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.480
Sweet!

35:12.480 --> 35:15.480
So this is that whole DVD sharing thing he just said and I was just making sure about

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
that.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.960
Alright, well speaking of Rock Band, EA has not ruled out that Rock Band will be coming

35:20.960 --> 35:22.520
out on the Wii.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.960
You might notice that the Wii is that one system that's sorely missing Rock Band right

35:25.960 --> 35:26.960
now.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.320
It does have Guitar Hero 3, but no Rock Band.

35:30.320 --> 35:35.320
Harmonix themselves has said that the Wii has, quote, an enormous potential for music

35:35.320 --> 35:36.560
games.

35:36.560 --> 35:43.800
GamePro actually went out and got a quote from EA talking about that there's going to

35:43.800 --> 35:47.360
be Rock Band on the Wii eventually.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.040
I'm sorry, scratch that.

35:50.040 --> 35:55.160
They did not make an official comment on Rock Band on the Wii, but most of us can kind of

35:55.160 --> 35:59.840
figure it's got to be coming eventually, especially when you consider the fact that EA likes to

35:59.840 --> 36:01.520
port things to all hell.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
Really?

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
Yeah.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.760
You got the truth.

36:04.760 --> 36:09.880
I think their only limitation right now is just putting the instruments on the Wii and

36:09.880 --> 36:13.460
figuring out something maybe fun to do with them, although I think they're just going

36:13.460 --> 36:19.080
to do what they did with like, or not them in particular, but Activision did with Guitar

36:19.080 --> 36:25.200
Hero 3 and just, you know, have it hijack the Wi-Fi from, you know, the remote, but

36:25.200 --> 36:27.760
I don't know.

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
That's not a bad idea.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.280
So in other words, they're not saying no, they're just saying not now.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.800
Although they can also do all wired controllers because they have USB ports on there.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
No, why not?

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
I don't know.

36:36.800 --> 36:40.720
Well, we'll see what happens, but in the meantime, the Wii fans are Rock Band-less.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.720
Sorry.

36:41.720 --> 36:50.840
Well, a Guitar Hero fan, though, actually put together a Kill Bill guitar, I think it's

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
pretty cool.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.640
I'll put a link to the picture up in the chat room.

36:55.640 --> 37:03.360
But it was basically inspired by, I guess, the, an Evil Dead guitar that someone did

37:03.360 --> 37:04.360
too.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.360
So that's pretty cool.

37:05.360 --> 37:11.920
And it's really not all that hard because all you need to, like for example, a dance

37:11.920 --> 37:19.640
friend, Will, got a Sex Pistols one for a penny, so you can find the faceplates or you

37:19.640 --> 37:24.400
can make them yourself because they're not that, you know, difficult and just if you've

37:24.400 --> 37:26.960
got any artistic ability, customize it yourself.

37:26.960 --> 37:34.120
But I'll put a picture of the image in the chat, of the link in chat.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.360
That does seem pretty cool, that little Kill Bill guitar.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.240
I don't know, I kind of want one of those.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.800
I do want to back up for just a minute because there's some comments in our chat room at

37:41.800 --> 37:45.240
chat.orangelandrater.com in regards to the Rock Band on the Wii.

37:45.240 --> 37:50.000
And I think RawsteelUT stops being critical for a moment to bring up a good point.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.880
There's the fact that the Rock Band download content is impossible on the Wii.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.040
And that's one of the biggest money makers for Rock Band.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.040
So far, yeah.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.760
Yeah, so that is a good point, is that the Wii doesn't really support anything like

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
that so far.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.000
Although, aren't they supposed to be getting Guitar Hero 3 content next year?

38:05.000 --> 38:11.600
Yeah, once, whenever they figure out, you know, how to actually do it.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.680
Well, now's the time to figure that out.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.800
That's big money they're missing out on right there.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.120
Yeah, I'll say.

38:18.120 --> 38:23.200
Anyways, some other stuff you can look forward to at least this week, coming out in the United

38:23.200 --> 38:24.200
States.

38:24.200 --> 38:29.280
A few releases, actually there's some decent stuff coming out, including, let's see, starting

38:29.280 --> 38:34.920
things off, Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom, that'll be coming out in the 360.

38:34.920 --> 38:39.880
Although it looks like this time they kind of went more of the Dynasty Warriors route.

38:39.880 --> 38:44.960
Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is coming to the Wii and Playstation 2.

38:44.960 --> 38:49.080
So if you're into that hoverboard racing stuff, you can play that.

38:49.080 --> 38:58.040
NFL Tour on the Playstation 3 and 360, a good $40 football game, kind of arcade style.

38:58.040 --> 39:03.760
Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law on Playstation 2 Wii and the PSP, if you happen to be a fan

39:03.760 --> 39:08.000
of the show and like the Phoenix Wright games, you'll definitely like that one.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.440
Jackass the Game on DS, if it's anything like the PSP version, you'll definitely like that

39:13.440 --> 39:14.720
one.

39:14.720 --> 39:20.340
World Championship Paintball for Playstation 2, that is crap.

39:20.340 --> 39:24.520
Sea Monster is a prehistoric adventure on the DS, also crap.

39:24.520 --> 39:28.880
And then one of the weirdest things to come out in a while, and doesn't look very good

39:28.880 --> 39:39.100
either, Dance Dance Revolution, Disney Channel Edition on Playstation 2, oh god.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.240
And I believe that's it for this week.

39:41.240 --> 39:48.120
You know you want to dance to high school musical songs, Loki.

39:48.120 --> 39:52.760
Well coming out over in Japan, finally taking a break from not having any games come out

39:52.760 --> 39:56.120
because of the holidays, to getting some stuff come out, or I should say if you're an Xbox

39:56.120 --> 39:58.760
360 fan, price reductions.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.760
But that's never a bad thing, some price reductions for Armored Core 4 and Table Tennis take place

40:02.760 --> 40:06.320
this week, as well as the release of the Xbox 360 Messenger kit.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.340
We got that here a little while ago with the integrated MSM Messenger.

40:10.340 --> 40:14.120
Not that it's been doing folks a lot of good this week with Xbox Live going up and down,

40:14.120 --> 40:18.120
however assuming that those problems are being fixed very soon, the Messenger kit will be

40:18.120 --> 40:21.980
doing Japanese MSM fans a lot of good.

40:21.980 --> 40:29.880
Also getting a price reduction on the Playstation 3, Armored Core 4's port on Playstation 3.

40:29.880 --> 40:34.780
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, a new game from Marvelous Entertainment called Kaitikyoshi

40:34.780 --> 40:45.280
Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle Wii, which looks to be some type of anime based game

40:45.280 --> 40:49.100
that I think is some type of fighter, it looks kind of like a 3D fighter, I'm sure it's based

40:49.100 --> 40:55.360
on, is there an anime called Hitman, that's probably what it is, I'm not sure, whatever

40:55.360 --> 40:57.340
it is, there you have it.

40:57.340 --> 41:02.680
Also coming out on some other systems, the Nintendo DS is getting a game called Chishiki-O

41:02.680 --> 41:10.300
Series Train Master, which is another train sim game, apparently those train sim games

41:10.300 --> 41:14.420
are very popular overseas, I haven't seen a train sim game very popular over here since

41:14.420 --> 41:18.160
Railroad Tycoon or A-Train, but I guess they're still popular over there.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.760
Well there was the big Densha de Go!

41:20.760 --> 41:23.000
series that was out for a long time too.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.840
I wonder why they're not as popular here.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.120
There's a train simulator that even had a big controller for it too.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.400
My dad used to buy those games all the time back when we had a Commodore 64, he bought

41:31.400 --> 41:35.440
like every train, because he was a conductor before he retired, that's what he did, so

41:35.440 --> 41:36.440
he loved that stuff.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.240
I just thought it was interesting.

41:38.240 --> 41:41.240
Anyhow, that's really it for Japanese releases this week.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.280
Alright, what about UK releases?

41:44.280 --> 41:47.960
Well, Loki, wait your turn.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.240
There's really not a whole lot to talk about.

41:50.240 --> 41:56.920
The ninth has Omega 5 on Xbox Live Arcade, Sam & Max 202, Moai Better Blues, that's a

41:56.920 --> 42:02.600
cool name, and then that's coming out on the tenth, and the eleventh is PDC World Darts

42:02.600 --> 42:09.600
Championship 2008, exciting, but not really.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.600
Now you can go.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.880
Sam & Max is going to be awesome in Season 2.

42:13.880 --> 42:21.320
Anyways, as you mentioned, Omega 5 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week, Hudson's kind

42:21.320 --> 42:26.800
of side-scroller shooter game, looks a little bit like R-Type or something like that.

42:26.800 --> 42:33.720
Definitely going to be awesome, that's only going to cost you 800 Microsoft points, and

42:33.720 --> 42:37.040
no word if there's going to be anything else coming out this week as well, I know last

42:37.040 --> 42:42.320
week there was only one item, just Metal Gear, or Metal Slug 3, so I guess maybe this is

42:42.320 --> 42:43.880
the only release this week as well.

42:43.880 --> 42:56.560
Microsoft, I want rez, really badly, I want rez, rez, I want rez, no rez for you, now

42:56.560 --> 42:57.560
!!

42:57.560 --> 43:02.280
Alright, so maybe I won't get rez, but there will be some other games on the Virtual Console

43:02.280 --> 43:07.720
in the United States of America, Monday's games have been leaked, it appears, the day

43:07.720 --> 43:13.580
before, and a real good one coming for the Nintendo this week, Star Tropics is coming

43:13.580 --> 43:18.080
to Virtual Console, that was a pretty rad game, that was one of the last really big

43:18.080 --> 43:24.520
RPGs, no word yet though if buying it on the Virtual Console will give you that letter

43:24.520 --> 43:28.240
that you have to dip in the water in order to get the secret code, otherwise the thought

43:28.240 --> 43:30.980
just occurred to me, a lot of people are going to be screwed when they try to play that game

43:30.980 --> 43:31.980
on Virtual Console.

43:31.980 --> 43:37.480
I think that there will be some sort of compensation made for it, like maybe they'll have to go

43:37.480 --> 43:42.000
on Nintendo's site and do some sort of bizarro thing.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.720
Or it will be in the digital manual that comes with the game.

43:44.720 --> 43:48.160
Oh, there you go, maybe the digital manual in the game will have it.

43:48.160 --> 43:52.080
No, there is a scene in this game where you'll need this code, but there's going to be tons

43:52.080 --> 43:53.880
of people that don't even think to look there, I bet.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
I know.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.880
That's going to be interesting.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
I didn't figure it out.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.880
They're going to be on Game Facts.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.960
I bought the game used and I was like, I don't know what the fucking code is, I don't have

44:00.960 --> 44:05.080
the, we have to dip the manual in the water to reveal the code, I'm like, I don't have

44:05.080 --> 44:06.080
the manual.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.480
Isn't the code 747 and why do I remember that?

44:08.480 --> 44:12.680
It's 747, because I remember it because it was like a plane, yeah.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.320
Oh my god, you know you've played too many games when?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
No.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.160
I don't need no stinkin' letter.

44:19.160 --> 44:23.080
There's a ton of games though that have those little weird quirks built in, like the, what

44:23.080 --> 44:30.040
was it, the X-Men game where you had to press reset to reset the machine or something?

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
That's right.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.080
On Genesis.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.080
So weird.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.080
I know.

44:35.080 --> 44:38.800
Nothing will ever be as cool though as in regards to like quirky fucking things in games

44:38.800 --> 44:44.480
as Metal Gear Solid was a psycho mantis who read your memory card and would go, oh I see

44:44.480 --> 44:45.920
you're a Castlevania fan.

44:45.920 --> 44:52.200
And it had, it had Xenogears on there, which hadn't, which wasn't released at the time.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.280
Creepy creepy.

44:53.280 --> 45:06.080
And then, it also, though in Final Fantasy VII, had a reference to Xenogears on it too.

45:06.080 --> 45:11.360
Well, also coming out on the Virtual Console this week for the Neo Geo, King of Fighters

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
94.

45:12.360 --> 45:15.780
Now, I don't follow the King of Fighters, they're all the same to me, it's one big giant

45:15.780 --> 45:16.780
fucking blur.

45:16.780 --> 45:17.780
King of Fighters 94.

45:17.780 --> 45:18.840
Is 94 a good one?

45:18.840 --> 45:22.640
I have that on the Neo Geo CD.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.640
It's a good one.

45:23.640 --> 45:29.440
KOF 94 was, if I do remember, the first one that was out in the series.

45:29.440 --> 45:35.660
And I played tons and tons and tons of that game because they had it at the arcade at

45:35.660 --> 45:43.240
my college where I learned the joy of playing with Yuri's butt attack.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Interesting.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.840
I might have to check it out.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.480
You know, I have no Neo Geo games on Virtual Console yet.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.480
Do you?

45:50.480 --> 45:51.480
Oh, that's sad.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.000
My thing is almost filled up.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
That's the sad part.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.120
My screen is almost, like, you know how you can only go to, like, four screens on the

45:57.120 --> 45:58.120
Wii?

45:58.120 --> 46:00.920
I seriously only have room for a handful of games left because I have so many of those

46:00.920 --> 46:04.400
stupid Virtual Console games I keep paying money for.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
You know what, Rob?

46:05.400 --> 46:10.240
Oh, that was another thing, but I'll bring the game up later because it's related to

46:10.240 --> 46:15.520
another part of the show, but we broke out Virtual Console stuff at my house too.

46:15.520 --> 46:16.520
Oh, nice.

46:16.520 --> 46:23.680
But I was going to tell you, one of these days, though, that I can, when we start doing

46:23.680 --> 46:31.120
the whatever video cast again, I'll try to bring one of my old systems up for something

46:31.120 --> 46:34.680
classic, if you want, and I'll bring the Neo Geo CD.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.600
Well, I'll tell you what we're thinking.

46:36.600 --> 46:40.800
I'll think aloud here because Operator 11, unfortunately, it seems like it's running

46:40.800 --> 46:42.040
on autopilot right now.

46:42.040 --> 46:46.100
I don't know what the heck's going on with them, but none of the shows are saving or

46:46.100 --> 46:47.960
whatever, which is part of the reason we're not using them.

46:47.960 --> 46:52.000
So we're thinking about defecting to another service called Ustream TV, which has no limits

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
on their shows.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.840
I just have to make sure it's kosher for us to broadcast video game images, but I don't

46:56.840 --> 46:58.080
know why it wouldn't be.

46:58.080 --> 47:01.480
But sometimes there's copyright issues that come into play with that, but usually as long

47:01.480 --> 47:08.560
as we're, if we're doing any type of commentary with it or whatever, you know, it's fair use,

47:08.560 --> 47:10.720
but I don't know, we'll see.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.320
Anyhow, back to the Virtual Console story, Star Tropics King Fighters 94, no third game

47:15.320 --> 47:19.440
mentioned yet, I guess we'll find out tomorrow, but remember, not every week have they always

47:19.440 --> 47:22.840
done three games, so it is possible, it's just a two game week.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
So we shall see.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.240
Well, it looks like they're having something similar to that in the UK.

47:27.240 --> 47:35.620
The big release right now is Harvest Moon, coming out on Virtual Console, and I do recall

47:35.620 --> 47:40.280
seeing, although I can't find the link on here now, but I did also recall seeing Donkey

47:40.280 --> 47:42.600
Kong Country 3.

47:42.600 --> 47:48.080
But apparently the link to it is gone from where I read it.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.560
Might have been two different weeks or something.

47:50.560 --> 47:57.600
Possibly, but Harvest Moon's been the big thing, so you can play that over in the UK.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.080
Milk all the cows you want.

47:59.080 --> 48:04.040
Yep, carry some chickens and make, you know, friends with your neighbors.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.040
There you have it.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.040
Speaking of milking things, you know what's kind of crazy?

48:08.040 --> 48:12.940
I saw that they're doing a third Lost in Blue game.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.200
When did the second one ever come out?

48:14.200 --> 48:16.400
Like, I remember they were making one.

48:16.400 --> 48:19.160
I think I actually played it for a few seconds at the show.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.680
Oh, shit, I don't remember when it came out, I think it was like October-ish.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.640
Is that game like really a cult hit or something?

48:24.640 --> 48:26.680
I guess, I don't know, I thought the first one sucked.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.440
I did not like the first game either.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.440
I don't know.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.440
Strange.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.440
Whatever.

48:31.440 --> 48:36.320
Anyways, so apparently Microsoft is a little bit sorry for the fact that Xbox Live has

48:36.320 --> 48:42.680
been having issues this last few weeks here, and to apologize for that, they're going

48:42.680 --> 48:49.140
to be offering all Xbox Live members around the world one free Xbox Live arcade game.

48:49.140 --> 48:53.960
No word on which game it is, or if we're going to get a choice or what.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.800
Hopefully it's not something I already own.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.600
I've heard rumblings, and you can take this as like a friend of a friend thing, which

49:00.600 --> 49:05.740
holds little to no weight, but from what I hear, it's a game that nobody has yet.

49:05.740 --> 49:10.960
One of the future releases is going to be free in light of this, and it's not something

49:10.960 --> 49:14.000
like Yaris.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.920
My mind instantly went to, great, we're going to get the Doritos game for free.

49:17.920 --> 49:21.240
No, it's something people actually want, apparently.

49:21.240 --> 49:26.180
Yeah, because I'd be sad when Carcassonne was free for everybody, most people were happy

49:26.180 --> 49:28.100
about that because hardly anyone bought it.

49:28.100 --> 49:33.880
I bought it previously, so I didn't get anything out of that deal, so I hope it's something

49:33.880 --> 49:40.080
new like, you know, Rez, coming out next week, for free, would be nice, would be very nice.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.320
I don't think anybody would complain if Rez was the game.

49:42.320 --> 49:47.900
But yeah, if it's going to be like, like Ross Deal says, it's probably going to be Robotron,

49:47.900 --> 49:51.560
or Frogger or something, I think everybody will just be like, wah, and then of course,

49:51.560 --> 49:59.880
half the chat room is going, Yaris 2, Yaris 2, anyhow, I really don't know, but I do want

49:59.880 --> 50:02.500
to say this, I want to take the opportunity to say this, I don't know if you saw it on

50:02.500 --> 50:09.080
our forums, but somebody actually made a YouTube of Yaris set to the music of Dragon Force,

50:09.080 --> 50:13.800
as inspired by our show, so I think that might come up in the mailbag later, so I won't blow

50:13.800 --> 50:18.000
all the details on that just yet, on how you can access that, but I saw that on our forums,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.440
it was kind of cool.

50:20.440 --> 50:26.320
Meanwhile, I will mention this about the Xbox Live outages, some people are pissed about

50:26.320 --> 50:32.360
this, they're so pissed, they're filing a lawsuit, that's right, when there's a problem

50:32.360 --> 50:35.840
that a major company is having, leave it to the parasites to jump on and file a class

50:35.840 --> 50:42.040
action lawsuit, three folks out of Texas have filed a class action lawsuit against the company,

50:42.040 --> 50:48.340
what they call breach of contract, the lawsuit goes on to whine about, quote, many plaintiffs

50:48.340 --> 50:55.640
being kicked offline, blah, blah, blah, and to some extent, I understand these guys where

50:55.640 --> 51:01.760
they're pissed off, because Xbox costs $50 a year, so when you're paying for it, especially

51:01.760 --> 51:05.960
during the time of year when most people are going to use it, it ought to be working.

51:05.960 --> 51:10.960
However, Microsoft, to give them credit, I think has always been a company very good

51:10.960 --> 51:15.800
about apologizing when they fuck up, you know what I mean, hence they're going to give out

51:15.800 --> 51:20.380
the free game, they've been very forthright in saying, we made a mistake, we're not happy

51:20.380 --> 51:25.160
about it, you can tell if you read Major Nelson's blog or his Twitter, he is livid about what's

51:25.160 --> 51:29.980
going on, and he's working overtime to try and fix it, it's not like they're sitting

51:29.980 --> 51:33.720
on their big duff, not trying to do anything about it, so I kind of give them a little

51:33.720 --> 51:35.520
bit of credit, and I forgive them.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.040
They don't guarantee that they're always going to be up either.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.040
Exactly.

51:39.040 --> 51:43.640
Should I sue them because they run maintenance on their server sometimes, and it's not, you

51:43.640 --> 51:47.940
know, during a time I want to play, I mean it's not really fair, it's just these drunken

51:47.940 --> 51:51.600
people are just trying to get money from whatever, they're all Microsoft, they've got money to

51:51.600 --> 51:54.240
spend, let's see if we can get some of it.

51:54.240 --> 51:58.680
Well, you know the thing about a class action lawsuit is that it's supposed to represent

51:58.680 --> 52:00.280
all users, right?

52:00.280 --> 52:04.760
So allow me to say, you do not represent me, I do not wish to participate in this lawsuit.

52:04.760 --> 52:08.720
I don't give a shit if they didn't give me anything to compensate me for their live service

52:08.720 --> 52:11.220
being down, big deal, it's down for a couple of weeks.

52:11.220 --> 52:14.720
You know what, if they really wanted to, they can give me like two weeks free or something

52:14.720 --> 52:16.600
like that, it's a big deal.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.040
I'd have been fine with that.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.960
Just defer, you know, that's...

52:19.960 --> 52:24.480
That's what the cable company does when your service is out, you call, complain, they give

52:24.480 --> 52:27.280
you a credit for the time your service was out.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.520
And a lot of things do that.

52:29.520 --> 52:32.120
I'm trying to think of what else, there's something that very commonly gives like the

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
free...

52:33.120 --> 52:36.480
I think Warcraft's done that before, they give free days or free week if something goes

52:36.480 --> 52:37.480
on.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.480
I know other games have done this too.

52:38.480 --> 52:41.840
I'm sure Xbox Live would not be opposed to doing something like that.

52:41.840 --> 52:45.120
I mean, seriously, are they actually going to try to sue them for what?

52:45.120 --> 52:48.800
Like let's just say if they cut out a whole month, that's like $5.

52:48.800 --> 52:53.960
Oh my God, you're out $5, poor baby.

52:53.960 --> 52:58.160
I'm sure in that user license agreement thingy that you have to...

52:58.160 --> 53:01.180
You know how like every time you sign up for something, you have to read the user license

53:01.180 --> 53:03.680
agreement and most people just click okay.

53:03.680 --> 53:08.300
I could not believe that somewhere in there is not some type of clause that says, we do

53:08.300 --> 53:12.840
not guarantee it's going to be up 100% of the time, the service may be down intermittently,

53:12.840 --> 53:13.840
you can't hold us...

53:13.840 --> 53:14.840
You know, there's got to...

53:14.840 --> 53:17.640
The lawyers had to have thought something like this might happen, you know, and put

53:17.640 --> 53:18.640
that in there in advance.

53:18.640 --> 53:19.640
It's stupid.

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
It's $5.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.600
It's not like you're paying, you know, $50 a month or something like that.

53:24.600 --> 53:28.600
It's $5, seriously.

53:28.600 --> 53:34.040
It's going to cost more in like lawyer fees than you would be getting from, you know,

53:34.040 --> 53:36.040
this $5.

53:36.040 --> 53:40.120
Frisbee says in chat, terms of service covers it all.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.640
There it is.

53:42.640 --> 53:46.760
So yeah, so we'll see what happens with this class action lawsuit.

53:46.760 --> 53:52.920
We'll keep you guys posted, that is, if anything actually comes of this, but we shall see.

53:52.920 --> 53:53.920
So...

53:53.920 --> 54:01.640
Well, for anyone who remembers the Tickle Me Elmo craze or how Beanie Babies went, we

54:01.640 --> 54:06.580
are having a repeat with a plushie weighted companion cube.

54:06.580 --> 54:11.800
This makes me laugh, especially since they've said on Valve's site that they were going

54:11.800 --> 54:14.360
to be making more of them.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.280
So stupid.

54:17.280 --> 54:23.760
Someone paid $365 for a plushie weighted companion cube and opened on eBay.

54:23.760 --> 54:26.400
And to that I say, fucking stupid!

54:26.400 --> 54:27.480
You want to hear something fucking stupid?

54:27.480 --> 54:33.180
What about that retard that paid $9,000 for that Xbox 360 that, or not Xbox 360, Guitar

54:33.180 --> 54:38.040
Hero 3 that some father was giving away because his son smoked pot.

54:38.040 --> 54:41.480
You're an idiot if you buy Guitar Hero for $9,000.

54:41.480 --> 54:46.320
You know how much weed that whole family is going to be able to buy for $9,000, sucka?

54:46.320 --> 54:50.480
Do you really, I mean, you do realize that the guy could have been making it all up,

54:50.480 --> 54:54.880
and do you realize you paid $9,000 for something that's really easy to find?

54:54.880 --> 54:55.880
You idiot!

54:55.880 --> 55:00.800
I have a $5 bill, guess what, I took it away from my unborn son because he smoked pot in

55:00.800 --> 55:01.960
the future.

55:01.960 --> 55:07.120
I want $9,000.

55:07.120 --> 55:08.320
And on top of that...

55:08.320 --> 55:09.720
You know what's sad?

55:09.720 --> 55:14.680
If we signed some piece of OLR memorabilia, like if we took a ferret and signed it or

55:14.680 --> 55:19.200
something and tried to put it on eBay, we'd be lucky to get $1.99 for it.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.600
I think that we should do something gimmicky like that.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.960
You want to do something gimmicky?

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
Let's do something gimmicky.

55:23.960 --> 55:29.040
I'll tell you what, I'm going to sign my weighted companion cube and we'll put that up on eBay.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.040
A paper one.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.040
Yes, we'll make a weighted...

55:31.040 --> 55:33.240
There's a paper weighted companion cube online.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.240
Fair enough.

55:34.240 --> 55:37.480
We will make a weighted companion cube out of paper and sign it and make up some story

55:37.480 --> 55:41.960
about how we stole it from a baby in the crib or something and see how much money we get

55:41.960 --> 55:42.960
it from it.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.960
Okay.

55:43.960 --> 55:47.320
We traded a dingo, a baby, for the weighted companion cube.

55:47.320 --> 55:50.840
The dingo ate my companion cube!

55:50.840 --> 55:52.560
That'd be a hungry dingo.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.560
You bastard.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.560
Portal 2.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.560
The dingo ate my companion cube.

55:55.560 --> 55:56.560
That's so stupid, though.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.560
Oh my god.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.560
I see...

55:58.560 --> 56:04.440
Now, I wanted one fairly bad and Dan was actually going to get me one for Christmas, but you

56:04.440 --> 56:07.640
know, how long did it take them to sell out?

56:07.640 --> 56:08.640
Four hours?

56:08.640 --> 56:10.720
Drunami brings up an excellent point.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.580
Don't we have an orange bat somewhere still from back in the day?

56:14.580 --> 56:16.280
It's in the vault.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.280
We might have to get that.

56:17.280 --> 56:21.200
We might have to pull that out of the vault because we have a blank one, don't we?

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
No.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.200
I thought we did.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.200
We could do a new one.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.200
We need to get a black...

56:25.200 --> 56:30.160
I had to save the original orange bat, though, because it was the one that was signed at...

56:30.160 --> 56:31.160
What tournament was that?

56:31.160 --> 56:32.160
Now, here's what we're going to do.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.160
March Madness.

56:33.160 --> 56:34.160
Fine, we'll get a new one.

56:34.160 --> 56:37.840
We're going to get an orange bat, sign it, beat something with it, and that'll be our

56:37.840 --> 56:39.280
story and then we'll sell it.

56:39.280 --> 56:44.760
And then if we put Portal in the search details on eBay, it'll sell.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.760
Exactly.

56:45.760 --> 56:48.400
We'll say we wrote...

56:48.400 --> 56:51.320
We'll just write Portal on the bat.

56:51.320 --> 56:55.240
And if it makes enough money, then we'll come visit you.

56:55.240 --> 56:59.120
If it makes enough money.

56:59.120 --> 57:05.320
We should have one with a reserve up there that's like, um, buy an Orange Lounge Radio

57:05.320 --> 57:06.320
visit.

57:06.320 --> 57:09.920
Where you have to pay for us to come out and feed us.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.160
I don't know about that.

57:11.160 --> 57:13.640
Again, we'd be lucky to get $1.99.

57:13.640 --> 57:16.040
Anyway, let's move on.

57:16.040 --> 57:22.160
Anyways, so Ubisoft has announced Far Cry 2 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

57:22.160 --> 57:26.960
Of course, the new Far Cry game not being in the tropics, it's actually going to be

57:26.960 --> 57:31.560
in the African Savannah, Africa!

57:31.560 --> 57:36.600
And you will be able to, you know, destroy stuff and it'll be awesome.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.640
But um, I don't know.

57:38.640 --> 57:40.000
I can't wait to play it.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.040
So um, hopefully it'll come out around the same time as the PC version, which is due

57:45.040 --> 57:47.480
out this spring.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.760
But um, no word though if that's actually going to happen yet.

57:49.760 --> 57:54.000
They just said it's going to ship sometime in Ubisoft's 08-09 fiscal year.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.200
So that could be anytime between now and forever.

57:57.200 --> 58:01.540
Our chat room, seriously, sorry, not to discount your story, but our chat room, fucking geniuses.

58:01.540 --> 58:02.540
They're brilliant.

58:02.540 --> 58:03.540
Okay, here it is.

58:03.540 --> 58:08.080
They say we're going to sell this as the Orange Companion Bat, and we're going to beat Jamie's

58:08.080 --> 58:13.400
copy of Imagine Babies with it, and now it's the beaten companion bat.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.400
That's great.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.400
Chat room winner.

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
It'll happen.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.400
It'll happen.

58:17.400 --> 58:18.400
Watch.

58:18.400 --> 58:24.000
So, man, I love our chat room.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.600
Well, speaking of people who are infinitely awesome, that would be Hideo Kojima.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.960
Aha, how's that?

58:31.960 --> 58:32.960
Nice transition.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.160
I know, I'm awesome tonight.

58:34.160 --> 58:36.200
Somebody I would let beat me with an orange bat.

58:36.200 --> 58:40.320
I wouldn't let him beat me with an orange bat.

58:40.320 --> 58:46.400
But he was basically quoted saying that he thinks that there should be more realistic

58:46.400 --> 58:53.560
violence in a game so that you can see the consequences of your actions.

58:53.560 --> 58:59.900
He's quoted saying, I don't think there are many games that tackle violence head on.

58:59.900 --> 59:05.640
When you hit someone or inflict pain, faces get disfigured, for example, and I want to

59:05.640 --> 59:08.360
make games that show that sort of thing.

59:08.360 --> 59:11.480
If you don't see the pain, you can't understand what you've done, and you'll pass through

59:11.480 --> 59:15.380
battles without taking responsibility for your actions.

59:15.380 --> 59:16.480
I don't want to ignore that.

59:16.480 --> 59:21.600
I want players to think, even if it's just a little, about what violence and war are.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.160
No pain, no game.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.120
There you go.

59:25.120 --> 59:30.640
But I actually do think that that's a, you know, if they can do it in a freaking racing

59:30.640 --> 59:36.040
game, why can't they do it in, you know, Metal Gear or anything like that?

59:36.040 --> 59:42.320
I think that that's actually pretty smart, you know, because, you know, especially I

59:42.320 --> 59:47.600
was noticing, you know, with the, I guess, parents and people who are saying, oh, violent

59:47.600 --> 59:51.440
video games, blah, blah, blah, you know, desensitizing the violence and everything.

59:51.440 --> 59:55.520
Well, if they're so desensitizing, then why not put that sort of consequence in a game,

59:55.520 --> 59:58.080
you know, see how it, what happens.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.960
I think that's actually pretty smart.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.840
In Soviet Russia, games shoot you.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:08.960
I think that is a very good idea.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.760
That's so, so dumb.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.760
I know, it's horrible.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.240
Look, the show's free, folks, you know.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.640
Can you believe the Writers Guild's on strike right now?

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.320
Rob's on the cutting edge of comedy right now.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.080
Shut up and read the next story.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:38.600
Well, perhaps Yakko Smirnoff is not really the, anyways, that may not be your kind of

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:47.040
thing, but hopefully this is, and I hope to God that they don't fuck this up, because

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.880
they could easily fuck this up.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.920
Apparently, though, there is a placeholder for Iron Chef on the Wii, according to GameStop,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.720
and it's supposedly coming out in June sometime.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.800
I just hope it's not Iron Chef America, because that show fucking sucks.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.480
Oh, hell no, it has to be Cheeseball, original Iron Chef.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.880
Then that would be awesome.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.600
And it needs to have Chairman Kaga.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.960
No, this game needs to have us one of the Iron Chefs, Cooking Mama.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.560
That would be winnin' awesome.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.140
That would be.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.600
Mama will have to fix your pathetic performance.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.200
It would be great.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.120
Come on, Iron Chef meets Cooking Mama.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.600
It's destined to happen.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.160
Anyhow, I guess this was destined to happen at some point, too.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.560
I'm just surprised it took so long for some website to run a story with the headline,

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.640
Kid Wees on a Wii.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.680
You, sir, are on the cutting edge of comedy.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.360
That's right, speaking of being on the cutting edge of comedy, this little four-year-old

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:58.840
named Ellis Ensley in Fleetwood in the UK, him and his six-year-old brother were fighting

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.440
over their brand new Nintendo Wii.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.640
And by the way, the dad had spent forever trying to get the Nintendo Wii, you know,

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640
camping outside and all that.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.240
Well, I don't know if he camped outside, but he was, you know, one of those parents.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.480
He worked three jobs.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.440
He sold his wife to slavery.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.720
He had to walk through glass and two miles in the snow and the river just to get to school

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720
and buy this Wii.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720
And molten hot lava.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.420
That's right.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.840
And they got this Wii, and when the four-year-old and the six-year-old started fighting over

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.680
it, did the kid cry?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680
No.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.240
Did he go to his room and pout?

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240
No.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.360
What did he do?

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360
He peed on it.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.880
He broke out his Wii and weed on the Wii.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.240
That's right, he weed on the Wii and reporters everywhere rejoice that they can finally use

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.760
that in a headline.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.600
I'm just surprised it took so damn long, honestly.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.800
Well, his kids are fucking misbehaved anyways if they're pissing on stuff in their house.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.340
And let alone the geniuses that are pissing on stuff that's connected to the wall with

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.040
electricity running through it.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040
I only wish...

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.320
He's four years old, therefore not very smart.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.960
I only wish that he had gotten electrocuted.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.280
Still, you need to teach kid a lesson, rub his nose in it.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.000
Kid wheezes on Wii?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.480
Wii kills kid.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Awesome.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.480
That's bad.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.960
He's four!

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960
But still.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
Hey!

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
Still.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Survival of the fittest.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
Smartest.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:25.560
Hey, when I was four, I knew it was not okay to piss on the electric fence, okay?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.120
Yes, when I was four, I was told not to eat the yellow snow, so you know, a lot of us,

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120
you know...

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.600
It doesn't snow here, Rob.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.080
It does up the hill a little bit, where we would sometimes travel to.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080
Okay, fine.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080
All right.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.080
Anyhow.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.280
Son of Dad in chat says, did they both pee on the Wii?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.600
Don't cross the streams.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.500
Anyhow.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:02.500
Okay, well, that's it for this week's episode of The Classic Game of the Week, and I hope

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500
you enjoyed it.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.500
If you did, please like and subscribe, and I'll see you in the next one.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Bye.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.500
Bye.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Bye.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500
Bye.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Bye.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:25.880
So, Dark Soccer and Linus, what game have you selected as the Classic Game of the Week

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
this week?

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:45.320
Well, I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week, and I've been selected as the

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.320
Classic Game of the Week.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:05:03.000
I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:12.680
I've been selected as the Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:30.040
You can combine two of the four different weapons to make different unique weapons.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:38.640
It actually spawned a sequel, which was Gunstar Superheroes.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.520
We have flies in the building.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.840
Yes, while the storms are going on, the flies are like,

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.640
Ooh, it's warm in the studio.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.880
But Gunstar Superheroes came out on Game Boy Advance,

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.160
which was a pretty cool little game.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:01.160
And then a couple of years ago, Sega put out a Sega Ages collection,

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.360
which was called the Treasure Box, which had Gunstar Heroes,

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.840
Dynamite Headdy, and Alien Soldier in the collection.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.320
It's a really cool game, and I think one of Treasure's best.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.440
For everyone always bitching that Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week is too obscure and

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.640
hard to find, here's one that you can download on the Wii Virtual Console very easily.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.880
That was when we were playing yesterday on Virtual Console.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.480
We had it in, and I was like, Hey, that sounds familiar.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.200
And Dan was like, It's because it's Gunstar Heroes, duh.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200
And I'm like, Oh yeah.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200
And so he was playing the hell out of that.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
So Gunstar Heroes is one of the best games ever.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:43.160
All right, so there it is, your Classic Game of the Week at Gunstar Heroes.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160
And it's Treasure.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.160
By Treasure.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.720
I'm sure at some point before this segment is retired, every Treasure game will have

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.720
come up at one point.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720
Maybe not.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.720
There's a few I'm not too big on.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.720
All right, just about.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.440
All right, anyhow, that's it for part A. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break,

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.680
but we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.200
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200
a week.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:36.760
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
