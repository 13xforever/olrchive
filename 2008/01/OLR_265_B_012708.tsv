15436	19139	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19820	26225	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, our last show for January, because it is January the 27th of 2008.
28527	29989	Let's get right back into the gaming news.
30069	31610	If you missed Part A, you missed a lot.
31690	33371	You missed a lot of randomness, that's for sure.
34092	40858	But now we're going to get into some Nintendo news, because we had a substantial lack of Nintendo in Part A, so let's kick it off with some Nintendo news, Loki.
41698	44459	One of the new things we learned this week about Smash Bros.
44519	60226	Brawl is that it will have classic game demos included with it, including demos for The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Bros., as well as Star Fox 64.
63054	70403	Why the fuck don't they have demos on the Virtual Console if they're all available on Brawl?
70904	76231	Come on, if it's that easy to make demos for this stuff, then why isn't it available for the other stuff?
77210	79092	Is it just me, or is this maybe a workaround?
79112	83896	Because they realize that tons and tons of Wii owners are going to be buying this game.
83956	87919	This is a, you know, AAA title of the highest kind for the Nintendo Wii.
87939	95565	I think it's cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, but, I mean, seriously, though, if it's easy to implement, why aren't they doing, like, time demos on some of these, you know...
96869	97869	Nintendo games and stuff.
98429	99590	Here's the weird thing.
99710	100450	Don't get me wrong.
100570	101550	I love the idea.
101670	102450	I think it's great.
102770	105751	It gives this game even more value than it had already.
105811	108291	I mean, God, we all knew this was going to be a powerhouse game anyway.
108611	113652	But the only thing that makes me kind of go like, are there really that many people who haven't played these games?
114512	115093	I don't think so.
115133	118493	Am I just spoiled because I'm older so I kind of grew up with 8-bit Nintendo and stuff?
118853	122154	But are there a lot of people who have never played The Legend of Zelda?
122788	124889	Who have never played original Mario Brothers?
124909	127810	There may be some people, though.
128471	133253	Obviously, we grew up in the 80s and stuff, but there's a lot of people that have never played the original games.
133333	134994	All right, Chris is raising her hand.
135214	135754	I guess that's true.
137134	137475	That's right.
137515	144278	You said during the break, though, you were denied video games when you were a child, so you didn't really have a lot of exposure to this.
144518	151501	No, my parents refused to buy me anything that had to do with video games until I was finally in high school, and I got my Pokemon games back.
152421	153562	My mom used to play with me.
154582	155623	Well, your mom was awesome.
155643	157324	My parents were retarded.
157364	161306	Just the different, well, I mean, obviously, you pretty much have two different extremes right here.
161346	165648	You have, you know, the no video games in this house whatsoever, and then the family that plays together.
165668	167489	I mean, you literally have the two things in the spectrum here.
167509	172512	Well, family I use loosely because it was me, my mom, and my brothers, you know, we weren't the typical family unit.
172912	173833	Right, well, you know.
173913	181597	Well, it was just, it really was, my brothers ran outside and played in the neighborhood, and my mom was usually in my room playing my Nintendo.
182361	185144	So I had to, I didn't get to play my Nintendo as much as my mother played it.
185325	188769	They also mentioned that there are other demos that are hidden in there.
189129	192533	My question is, why aren't there full games, kind of like Animal Crossing had?
192874	194936	Because now there's the virtual console.
195036	195317	So?
196959	199542	Because a virtual console is a money-making machine.
199602	200323	It's free money.
201381	205363	I shouldn't say free money, but very, very low-cost money.
205403	211725	Because, you know, obviously somebody is having to make those manuals and those kinds of things, you know, and QA the game and make sure it works in the emulator and all that stuff.
211745	214607	But that, all things considered, is extremely low-cost.
214627	216888	They should have a demo for Mother 3 on there.
216908	217888	That would be hilarious.
218368	219789	Actually, that would be kind of rad.
219849	221429	I would kind of hope they would do something like that.
221469	223630	Like, give us a game that has only been seen in Japan.
223690	223990	I don't know.
224110	225071	No, just a demo for it.
225151	226631	You'll never see the full game over here.
226651	227092	Just a demo.
227112	228392	Mother 3 came out in Europe.
228512	229012	That's evil.
229353	229913	Oh, that's true.
229933	230173	Hmm.
231249	231449	True.
231869	233130	Ross Steel, UT, has a thought.
233210	238973	He says in chat.orangesalmsradio.com, he says, Loki, Nintendo doesn't have many new games, so they have to sell this stuff.
240094	241214	Well, that's cool.
241294	247878	I don't mind them selling this stuff, but for some of these obscure games that are on Virtual Console, I'd like to be able to try them out before I spend $5 on them.
249477	251458	And of course there's other people that are piping up.
251478	254260	Brad from PodCulture says, I've never played a Zelda game.
254440	258102	And Actdeft says younger people maybe haven't played the games.
258242	260083	And all very good points.
260203	263925	Again, I guess maybe my perspective is spoiled because I really grew up on this shit.
264525	269908	Some people were also primarily PC gamers or had like an Apple IIe or something.
270408	274850	I had a friend who never had a Nintendo, but she was the world's biggest Doom player that I knew.
276211	276891	Well, that's cool.
277092	277512	That's cool.
278240	279842	Alright, I guess you guys make a good point.
280323	282105	I can admit when you guys make good points.
282386	286030	But, I mean, like I said in the beginning, this was never a bad thing.
286050	288093	It was just kind of, wow, that's interesting.
289174	292278	So I guess all you guys that never got to play these games will finally get your chance.
292298	296384	And if you like it, you can send Nintendo five bucks and get the full version.
297429	302230	Who knows, though, if there will be any Sega Master System games included in Smash Bros.
302290	302590	Brawl.
303250	307351	Not likely, since the only Sega character in the game that we know of is Sonic.
307771	312413	But we did get news this week that Sega Master System games will be coming to the Virtual Console.
312433	312873	That's right.
313373	315793	A whole resurgence of the Sega Master System.
316133	321975	You know, the Sega Master System never really caught on here in America quite in the same way that Nintendo did.
321995	323455	It was always kind of the cultish thing.
324475	325416	I'll tell you where it caught on.
325916	326336	Brazil.
327503	330085	That's true, and they still, you know, Genesis and all that stuff.
330125	333448	I remember reporting on the Genesis handheld that's still big in Brazil.
333468	338913	Dan was showing me a video file of Castle of Illusion for Master System, which looks oddly like DuckTales.
339894	344237	Well, no matter where you live, Sega Master System games, you are going to be able to get very soon.
344718	345238	It's really funny.
345318	348361	I actually, where Sega popped in my mind, when I was like...
349170	350510	I don't even know how old I was.
350630	352591	But my uncle, I had to go stay over at his house.
352611	354131	And he's like, oh, and don't worry.
354671	359253	It's like, at my house, I've got a lot of cool stuff like Sega and Sonic.
360053	361733	I had no idea what the fuck that was.
362593	367735	And then he showed it to me, and I just, my mind blew up because I didn't know, like, what to do with it.
367835	368475	It was crazy.
368535	373316	There was this little blue thing running in circles trying to get these little dancing ring things.
374056	376097	And my perspective on that was, Satan!
378354	379877	And here you are on this program now.
379937	381319	And here I am years later.
381419	382180	Life is funny.
382521	383803	It is pretty funny.
383863	385286	Life is funny.
385326	390554	That reminded me of that because he was so excited to tell me about that when my mom forbid me to play video games.
392498	393619	What is this, Satan?
414446	423372	A lot of early speculation that since the Game Gear pretty much ran off the same hardware as the Master System, it's only a matter of time before Game Gear follows on the Virtual Console.
423733	424833	That is actually true.
424893	426895	They were the same, pretty much.
427615	434540	Which is why a lot of the games that did come out on Game Gear had Master System releases in other countries.
435961	438443	And for the record, I have Fantasy Zone on Master System.
439406	440306	Well, look for those.
440346	442647	If you don't have Fantasy Zone, maybe you ought to check it out.
442687	444347	Look for those to come to Japan in February.
444487	447448	I'm sure other regions will only be a little ways behind me.
447468	449109	It's not like we're talking about the MSX here.
449929	461252	MSX is something the American and European audiences really don't know much about because all the games on the console were all in Japanese, so we're probably never going to see that, unfortunately.
461292	463272	That's the system they gave us.
464473	465353	Guardian Legend.
465693	468074	Well, Guardic and Metal Gear, the old school Metal Gear.
468374	468614	Anyhow.
469309	472890	and the actual good sequel instead of the one we got over here.
473670	474270	Snake's Revenge.
474870	477631	But anyhow, what other virtual console news do we have tonight?
478631	490934	Well, this one makes me relatively happy is that Super Street Fighter 2 is going to be on the virtual console in the UK over on the PAL systems.
492534	495795	It's going to be 800 Wii Points, which is £5.60 or a €7...
500866	510617	Ryu, Ken, Gael, Blanca, Zangief, Chun-Li, Honda, Dhalsim, Wu And the new challengers, yes.
511798	513360	Cammy, with her butt.
513380	515562	She had camo legs, you couldn't see them.
523666	525670	Isn't that game out here in the U.S., Virtual Console?
525710	526773	I think it came out last week.
527193	527454	Did it?
527815	528075	Cool.
528135	529037	Well, then there you go, Jamie.
529057	531763	If you're that excited, you can go grab it in the U.S., too, it sounds like.
532044	533808	But I have the original...
534443	535523	Oh, well then, la-di-da.
535963	538064	I'm waiting for the Xbox One, to be honest.
538104	540664	Like, why would I go buy this old one when there's going to be the new HD one?
540684	543025	That's going to be sexy.
543405	546526	When I moved out here, this is how big of a nerd I was.
547126	554067	I shipped out a whole bunch of my stuff, but in my luggage I brought my Super Nintendo and all my games with it.
554087	561509	And the first game that I had on the Super Nintendo that was mine was one that my boyfriend at the time bought me, which was Super Street Fighter II.
561949	562209	Awesome.
562600	564882	and I still have the box everything.
564942	565983	That's like my game.
566503	568365	And to this day that remains a pretty great port.
569045	569946	Oh yeah, it was really good.
570907	576231	Street Fighter Alpha 2 had loading in a cartridge and I thought that was hilarious.
576731	583917	I had Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo for the computer but the thing I remember about it on the PC is it had like remixed music and it was also the Redbook audio.
583957	585158	You could put it in any CD player.
585178	585678	It was kind of cool.
587219	588000	Random tidbit.
588720	589361	So, moving on.
590522	590622	Um,
591883	595867	Anyways, there's some other good news coming from Japan about the Wii.
595947	598790	They've surpassed 5 million units sold.
600152	610363	Of course, the Wii is the number one selling system in the world, but at least the new generation of systems, it is the number one.
610403	613546	Of course, not in the U.S., but not for long.
614016	618258	Anyways, right now they have sold, at least as of January 20th, 5,019,337 units.
618278	621379	Which is not bad, seeing as it's been out for 14 months already.
621399	623860	In the US, their sales were 7.38 million as of the end of 2007.
623900	625080	So, doing pretty good.
625100	625260	Nice.
638891	640337	Not unsurprising, but nice.
640778	644573	I mean, we all knew we were selling like crazy, no matter where you are, so there you have it.
645103	645443	Super Smash Bros.
645663	645844	Brawl
671964	675386	So some clips are already hitting YouTube, so pretty awesome.
676527	681770	So it's only a matter of time before we find out all the secrets that the Smash Bros.
681830	683331	Dojo has yet to reveal.
683851	690656	And I did look at some of the YouTube clips, and I have to admit, the game looks a lot like Super Smash Bros.
690716	696279	Melee, which isn't to be surprised, but it definitely feels like it has that next level to it, you know what I mean?
696943	698964	It definitely feels like the game is taken to the next level.
721375	726559	I can't wait to play that level that's the old school Mario level that scrolls automatically while you're in it.
726799	727299	That's awesome.
727359	732963	The thing about this game that I think is going to make it winner, and I realize fanboys everywhere are peeing their pants over it.
732983	734985	I think it's the same reason why WarioWare.
735447	736187	It's variety.
736628	737388	It is variety.
737568	740569	This game sounds like, it's just like, really, they have thought of everything.
740709	741209	Variety.
741430	742570	And that's value.
742990	743270	It is.
743470	743971	It really is.
744311	746632	You really feel like you're getting your money's worth, I think.
747032	753595	But then again, you obviously have to withhold judgment until the game actually comes out, but certainly the hype, they're doing a wonderful job.
755476	757156	Well, we'll see, right?
757897	758577	We will soon see.
759261	770865	Well, for our friends who are fortunate enough to have a Wii right now, it's been said that Okami Wii will be out in the UK, actually, by the summer.
771265	777907	We're getting our version over here on 25th March, but there's not a specific date stated for the UK.
778227	779427	But it will be coming out!
781368	782048	That's pretty cool.
783749	785709	I'm glad to see it's making its way out, finally.
787510	787670	Um...
788890	815389	and there's you know I just real quick I want to say about Okami real quick I actually kind of missed it in the PS2 because when it came out I was too busy with ooh Xbox you know I was like too busy with all that as I think a lot of the late gen games from the PS2 were kind of like that so I'm kind of looking forward to being able to give this a real shot on the Wii and it looks like it's gonna be a lot of fun so I'm glad to hear it's on its way I'd like to see what they've done for controls on it me too
816812	821153	From what I hear, it's not really changed that much from the PS2 version.
821413	822033	What, no waggle?
822733	825954	Well, they're going to have waggle in there, but it's pretty much a straight port.
825994	827334	Don't expect anything additional to it.
827394	827994	All right, all right.
828355	830715	I did hear there's widescreen support, though, which is pretty awesome.
831735	832115	I'm sold.
833876	844458	There's a new, I guess, handheld MP4 player capable of running old-school Nintendo emulators, and it's powered by the sun using solar power.
845469	853551	It can also play MP3s, store e-books, and records audio, and of course displays images, all for $123.32.
853591	864933	The cool part, though, is it also has a USB port to connect to other portable devices to share the solar energy it has collected, so you can power your other devices with it.
865393	871234	But it's kind of funny, though, because the whole thing looks very similar to the original Game Boy Advance.
872375	874095	So, I don't know.
874528	878651	One of those things that you probably only see in Korea or something like that.
878931	881233	If nothing else, though, it makes for a great headline, you know.
881373	882894	Console powered by sun.
883934	887417	Yeah, it's... But then how do I play late at night?
888457	889178	That's the bummer.
889398	890519	What was it, that one game?
890539	893721	Remember... I have to go outside to play a game?
893901	894842	This makes no sense.
894862	898604	There was that one game that came out on the Game Boy Advance, and I know I can't remember the title.
898644	899285	Oh, Boktai!
899505	900105	Yeah, Boktai.
900525	904348	But the problem with the original Game Boy Advance is when you play it out in the sun, you can't see it.
904855	911376	because it's very... It's not backlit, and it made it hard to see, so... Not a good plan, unfortunately.
912076	913377	Yeah, I was not a big Boktai fan.
913717	918377	The one that came out after that, which I can't... Oh, it was kind of like a sequel, but it was on the DS.
920298	926699	Damn it, I can't... But, like, they kind of took the sun part out of it, but it was still an element of the game, but you could just hit a button to charge it.
927219	928819	Yeah, it was something that Hideo Kojima did.
928879	929599	It was like a sequel.
929639	930380	It was on the DS.
930420	931260	I can't remember the name.
931300	932860	I'm sure someone in chat will...
933493	934514	Guitar Hero on Tour
959745	966652	and of course some news that spilled earlier this week from a French website that Guitar Hero On Tour was on the way to Nintendo DS eventually.
967112	968733	So who knows what this game could be.
969094	970915	Probably a spin-off game.
970976	974038	I would imagine there's not going to be a little guitar controller you actually plug in.
974118	975199	Actually, I think there will be.
975460	975840	Really?
975900	976701	That's going to be weird.
976781	978823	Because here's how they're going to probably do it.
978963	982766	They're going to have an attachment that plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot and there you go.
982786	984348	You can have your additional buttons like that.
984848	991709	I was going to assume maybe it was a tapping game, kind of like Elite Beat Agents, where you have the guitar on the lower screen or something, and you can tap the beats or something.
991729	992269	Does that make sense?
992769	996750	I guess it makes sense, but I think that they're actually going to have it where you can play the guitar.
997050	1004031	The only thing I would think about that, though, is if they did have it where you play the guitar like that, there's no real easy way to see the screen and play the guitar.
1004051	1012573	Well, actually, no, I take that back, because you can hold it in your hand so that you look at the top screen and use your hand, I guess...
1013581	1015942	Yeah, your left hand could hit all the keys and stuff.
1016022	1016482	It could work.
1017382	1018762	It's a weird idea, but it could work.
1019002	1019403	It could.
1019443	1022623	But if it does come out, it'll be probably selling quite a bit.
1022944	1028185	Yeah, and regardless, we all know this is just a way to further milk a franchise that, you know, is prime.
1028225	1029165	It's not quite dead yet.
1029325	1030686	The hot thing right now, right?
1031166	1031546	I don't know.
1031706	1033526	Jamie, I know you play a lot of games on the DS.
1033566	1035347	Is Guitar Hero something you'd want to play on the DS?
1035867	1038988	I'd try it out, but otherwise, probably not.
1039388	1040668	It would be a nice diversion from Cooking Mama.
1040688	1041209	I have Rock Band.
1041969	1042809	True, true.
1044207	1064161	by the way oh I totally forgot to say this during my gaming week but how could I forget like Thursday you know what I did I ran home I powered on the Xbox I put in Guitar Hero 3 and I downloaded me some Journey and it was awesome I just wanted to get that out there we were listening to the demo on that oh it was so hot
1064881	1065181	DarkSakura
1090478	1091358	There were some.
1091458	1095019	One of them is not going to be read because, honestly, it's worth it.
1095139	1095659	It's worthless.
1096539	1097099	Oh, snap.
1097759	1104261	Because, clearly, if said person had been listening to the entirety of the thing, they wouldn't have taken it completely out of context.
1104921	1117023	So, therefore, addressing Lucky Nuts, which just instantly indicates the quality of the person listening to this, fuck you.
1118964	1119704	And I mean that with
1120658	1122419	None of the respect that you intended as well.
1123399	1124760	I didn't even see this email.
1124780	1126001	I'm going to have to check it out.
1126041	1129963	What was the comment about how I said I would be interested in physics if not for the math?
1130303	1134925	You can be interested in a topic and not actually care to do anything with it.
1136346	1137106	Fucking moron.
1138087	1140128	Was it tongue-in-cheek or what?
1140208	1140728	I don't think so.
1141228	1141609	Interesting.
1141709	1142269	Alright, whatever.
1143280	1149466	Anyway, DidYouLoseASock wrote in and sent a link to StarTropic's Wii decoder.
1150067	1156754	It was on YouTube because we are broadcasting on those 22 seconds by linking in the chat room.
1157715	1162580	Apparently this is how it's supposed to work in StarTropic, so... Do we have more music?
1164522	1166143	No, that's the end of that music.
1166524	1166604	Oh.
1167122	1167362	Sorry.
1167662	1170343	But I did watch the video earlier this week.
1170383	1171884	I can kind of describe it for our listeners.
1172464	1173304	It's pretty rad.
1173965	1178806	Inside the manual, you know how when you download games on Virtual Console, you have the manual?
1179146	1184789	Well, what's cool is that they actually included a little hyperlink where it says in the story, you said you got a letter.
1185029	1191051	And when you click on a letter, it actually brings up the original letter, the text, and then there's this little animation of...
1191531	1191911	SilverChaos
1217226	1222188	Last week, as of when I'm writing this, you all were talking about the Dusty PS3 with Ranma.
1222248	1223469	Sorry if I spelled it wrong.
1223969	1226731	Yeah, you did, but I won't point it out.
1227191	1230093	And he brought up the fact that it might have been a setup.
1230133	1237557	You were all discussing who might have done it, mentioning Microsoft's and Nintendo's possibilities, but you missed the most obvious answer, and I'm surprised no one in chat mentioned this.
1237897	1238778	The makers of Dusty Cap 3.
1239813	1245896	If you people thought that dust is this big problem, they would rush out and purchase one to protect their beloved PS3s.
1245956	1246656	Thanks for reading this.
1247096	1248717	In need of a new screen name, Silver Chaos.
1250438	1251198	I like your screen name.
1251218	1252118	I think it's kind of cool.
1253959	1254339	All righty.
1258001	1260522	Lucky Nuts is clearly not all that lucky.
1264144	1266345	The hate is spewing out of the mailbag this week.
1266445	1266665	Oof.
1267345	1267725	Drama.
1267945	1268686	They can hate on me.
1268726	1269306	I can hate back.
1270578	1272861	I am a PMSing female, goddammit!
1273963	1275585	Do we have a happy email we can read?
1275985	1276205	Yes.
1277687	1281332	Robert M., our good buddy, went to Video Games Live.
1282353	1283134	So I'm going to read this.
1283971	1286472	Well, I paid to see video games live at Fox Theater in St.
1286512	1288512	Louis and enjoyed the experience.
1288552	1292213	Just a few minor FUs presented as wishes, such as it is.
1292753	1301296	One, wish the mid-balcony seats were high enough to obscure the top part of the video screen behind the lighting structure, had I known that I would have paid more for the lower-level seating.
1302056	1306937	Two, wish I had been in these lower-level seating at least to get better connections with other DS players.
1307397	1310998	My attempts to start four-player Pac-Man vs. matches ended in connection failures.
1311639	1313219	Fun to connect with that many gamers, though.
1314054	1317977	3.
1314154	1317977	I almost wish the Zelda section had featured more music than the iconic overworld theme.
1318457	1321840	Something more along the lines of their medley of music from the Sonic games.
1323021	1324442	And finally, one major F you.
1324562	1325703	Well, absolutely not really.
1326503	1327904	Ending the show with one winged angel.
1329845	1331667	Enjoyable experience overall.
1331707	1333088	Part of me wishes it had been longer.
1333228	1335850	You know, the three hours at Ran plus pre-show and intermission.
1336110	1337051	He also sent another email.
1339532	1340213	Oh, just about...
1340620	1342942	To add one more, because we couldn't get the chat room for some reason.
1343282	1347705	ObviousFE to Square Enix for not allowing use of their video in the show.
1348946	1349686	Yeah, that makes sense.
1350907	1351667	Last email.
1351928	1352368	You know why?
1352968	1355530	I think it's because they have something to do.
1355930	1359352	Don't quote me on this, but I think they have something to do with the competing show, Play.
1359913	1361994	Because Play is a derivative of Dear Friends.
1362114	1363435	It's put on by the same production company.
1363695	1364896	So, something to think about.
1365657	1367758	And GS68 says he went to Play in San Jose.
1367778	1367858	Okay.
1368083	1369784	Spice Girls Spice Girls Spice Girls Spice Girls
1391718	1392199	Alright, anyhow.
1392399	1399907	So anyway, he says he went to play in San Jose GS68 and says there were so many people in PictoChat that people were actually using Room B. Wow.
1399927	1401009	You don't see that that often.
1401029	1401389	Anyway, sorry.
1401689	1407656	Well, I remember doing PictoChat at E3 a couple years ago and realized that one of the people I was talking to was Melody.
1409719	1411020	We were in the Nintendogs line.
1411321	1412061	That's great.
1412362	1412542	Yeah.
1413431	1436988	um anyway this last one um says hi OLR it's officially a year I've been listening to your show you rock and keep up the good work I listen to OLR on my iPod to keep my sanity while I do homework and then when I run out of recent episodes to listen to I tune into your radio station and listen to the music great job on everything and you have taught me important lessons after the ban I feel like I'm less immature now is DDR dead
1437648	1443049	I don't seem to see much DDR action anymore, and when I used to play DDR, I'd get people to stop and watch me play.
1443409	1447170	Now people really don't care if someone's AAA-ing Mac songs.
1447691	1453172	Also, how do I deal with a kid at school who thinks I'm a nerd, yet he devoted all of his time and money to do World of Warcraft?
1454152	1456973	Can I use the fact he plays World of Warcraft against him?
1458446	1459006	Thank you, Chris.
1460107	1461348	She said yes.
1461628	1468313	And was it a mistake using my $100 Dell gift card towards buying a widescreen computer monitor instead of buying an Xbox 360 with it?
1468653	1469794	Too many questions, I know.
1469934	1471074	This is from Sakura Max.
1474037	1476498	Can I say this about DDR is dead?
1476538	1478680	We kind of got into this in a previous episode.
1478960	1480481	Let me try to phrase this best I can.
1481122	1482903	No, DDR is not dead.
1483846	1492657	But DDR has evolved, and it hasn't evolved in the way I think most of us hardcore fans that grew up with DDR wanted it to.
1492998	1494039	It didn't evolve for us.
1494580	1497423	It evolved to where the money's at, which you can't blame them for doing.
1497463	1498545	That's what they want to do.
1498565	1501028	But when you look at the mixes, Disney Channel...
1501812	1504574	Plugin to your TV, My First DDR.
1504594	1511019	DDR is kind of geared towards 12-year-old girls and their slumber parties, which, again, that's where the money's at.
1511479	1524009	It's disappointing because you would think that there's two distinctly different audiences, the 12-year-old girls and the anime convention-going people that helped foster DDR in the first place.
1524029	1525070	You would think we would get...
1525670	1527370	A new mix that caters to us a little bit.
1527390	1529211	And I suppose you could say Supernova 2 is that.
1529631	1531751	But is it really anything new?
1532731	1532911	No.
1533151	1539213	I mean, I always kind of said they needed to let the people responsible for the Xbox versions of DDR develop the next arcade mix.
1539973	1544794	Because the last time we ever saw any true innovation out of DDR was all done on the Xbox versions.
1544874	1546974	Good and bad, but at least it was innovation.
1547714	1548954	That's all I'm really going to say about DDR.
1549815	1550775	Can I finish reading the email?
1550895	1551455	Sorry, yes you may.
1552314	1556716	Well, I'm going to give my, well, you know, with inflation, I guess it's $5 worth.
1565219	1565439	Okay.
1566660	1567520	I made Chris laugh.
1567560	1568181	That was great.
1569561	1572562	Remember when we threw you into the fire and pretended that we were going to kill you?
1572882	1574163	I thought somebody was going to be reading an email.
1574183	1575163	Yeah, okay, fine.
1575183	1576324	Okay.
1576344	1576544	Okay.
1577220	1579520	Yes, you can use the fact that that guy plays World of Warcraft against him.
1580201	1586482	And I actually, if I had an option of getting a monitor or an Xbox 360 right now, I'd get a monitor.
1586502	1588382	But then again, I already have an Xbox 360.
1589942	1597483	So, and he signs this, kid who likes Toho music on OLR station MMOs and Crysis.
1597503	1599464	And there's a PS on here that is addressed to Loki.
1600404	1603324	Loki, if you haven't yet, go on Crymod.com.
1603985	1606285	It has a bunch of Crysis mods and maps.
1606738	1609379	Download the... I guess Physis?
1610780	1613882	It's P-H-Y-S-I-S 3 map.
1614402	1618964	It has random contractions that showcase the physics engines of Crysis.
1620025	1620525	I'll try that.
1620585	1626308	Actually, I finally got my second graphics card in and running in SLI.
1626868	1630890	It's tough because I... Overclocking one graphics card is easy.
1631230	1634892	Overclocking two graphics cards is not easy because you actually have to flash them.
1635573	1635833	So...
1636721	1639984	I've been playing around with that a little bit, trying to get it stable.
1641525	1648731	Benchmarks now, I got 17,000 something in 3 Mark 06, which is supposedly pretty good.
1650212	1653836	But I have to try Crysis yet with my cards in SLI.
1654116	1657218	He offers another description for that particular mod.
1657238	1661282	It says you get to play bowling with a barrel with Korean soldiers as pins.
1662225	1663169	I've seen videos of that.
1663209	1663651	It's funny.
1663952	1666943	Drop weights on a wedge to make a truck go flying and much more.
1666963	1668649	And that's the last email.
1669875	1671356	I really want Harmonix to do a dance game.
1671376	1672357	I really want them to make a dance game.
1700396	1703778	that would use a similar DDR mat to what we've already bought.
1704778	1716203	That would make me very happy for Harmonix to develop something like that, because honestly, I think Harmonix gets American audiences in a way Konami just never did, or when they did, they were never noticed.
1716784	1724187	Because I think the Xbox versions of DDR were great, but even then, it didn't ever take DDR to the next, next level.
1724827	1727789	And I don't know, I think Harmonix would just kind of start from scratch.
1727829	1728489	I mean, they would have to.
1729147	1731268	and I think DDR has needed that for a while.
1731308	1733809	I think there needs to be a DDR mix that starts from scratch.
1734309	1746975	You know, say Konami will sue all you want, but if Konami, or I'm sorry, if Harmonix was able to innovate Guitar Freaks in a way that the game feels completely different, I'm sure the same can be done for a dance game.
1747675	1753057	So, I don't know if we have any people from Harmonix that listen to this program, but if we do, please be a known.
1753078	1754438	I would like you to make a dance game for me.
1754618	1754898	Please?
1756379	1758660	Or I would like, you know, I wouldn't mind if Konami would
1759971	1764515	but if Konami is going to make a new one, they need to start over from scratch.
1764575	1765376	We are starting over.
1765456	1765716	Mean it.
1766176	1767978	Throw out all your old code and start again.
1768638	1769059	I'm serious.
1770740	1770940	Sorry.
1771841	1772802	We can get back to gaming news now.
1774223	1774543	Can we?
1775184	1775724	Yes, sorry.
1776024	1776264	Okay.
1780208	1786893	Well, this is a weird bit of news, but apparently the Gizmondo is coming back.
1787834	1788074	What?
1788094	1788174	What?
1789071	1802714	Yes, apparently they had a Gizmondo teaser site stating that the legend is reborn and exciting physic worlds and some other stuff.
1803274	1816157	But apparently it will be back according to, at least in some form, Plex technical director Ian Murphy and says that the product has been recovered from liquidators
1816698	1819199	and PlexTech is bringing it back to the market.
1823282	1823582	Okay.
1824002	1829725	But now some folks are asking in chat, wasn't this then retracted a little later?
1829785	1831326	Was this story ended up being retracted?
1831346	1832786	It might have been.
1832827	1833187	I don't know.
1833507	1835468	I'm not sure if it's been retracted or not.
1835688	1838610	At least this article doesn't really say that.
1839290	1844192	But he basically said that the device's second coming is happening as soon as May 2008.
1846701	1846941	Hmm.
1847342	1849284	But, uh, I don't know.
1849464	1853269	To be honest, if it was retracted, great, because I don't think it was too good to begin with.
1854771	1855051	Alright.
1855495	1859038	Well, this is not being retracted, and actually, I think this is kind of cool.
1859218	1862181	I did not realize this franchise was set to make a comeback.
1862541	1863682	It's a game called Populous.
1863702	1864843	I don't know if you guys ever played this.
1865123	1865644	I remember that.
1865844	1868206	Yeah, it was on Super Nintendo, but it was more of a computer game.
1868246	1870027	I think it's more best remembered as a computer game.
1870368	1875412	Well, it's going to have a resurgence on the DS, and Electronic Arts is bringing Populous out for the DS.
1875712	1876693	But here's what's really cool.
1876853	1881717	One thing about Populous was that basically the game had, I would call it, different skins.
1882077	1883899	There were many different skins the game had.
1884299	1893866	and you would build these cities that were human cities or Martian cities or it was more like, I shouldn't say human cities, it was like a medieval city or a, you know, new age city or what have you.
1893886	1894786	But this is really cool.
1894826	1898809	In the DS version of Populous, a new type of skin is going to be added.
1899289	1901191	It's a Nintendo civilization.
1901231	1901611	That's right.
1901931	1905193	The small cities start off as a little game and watch system.
1905574	1906975	Then they grow into NESs.
1907615	1907795	What?
1907835	1907935	What?
1935458	1937619	What does that even mean, the retraction was retracted?
1937919	1939040	The first retraction was a mistake.
1939080	1940221	Make up your goddamn mind.
1940401	1942222	No, the first retraction was a mistake.
1942422	1943343	It is actually coming.
1944263	1945104	Scary enough.
1945924	1954649	DM ends in chat and trying to make kind of a joke about OLR, is that you can evolve your crappy guys on a show to a Sunday show, like there should be an OLR skin.
1955410	1961874	Actually, I think that's kind of a cool idea, not so much what you're suggesting, but a version of Populous where you can make your own skins.
1961894	1962634	That would be kind of fun.
1962654	1964195	A little silly, but fun.
1967718	1969799	I am definitely looking forward to Populous DS.
1970179	1973000	That'll be a good chance to revisit a series I haven't played in a long time.
1973520	1975200	Well, I'm glad you'll have that opportunity.
1976300	1981681	For people who like games on their iPod, Pole Position is coming out to iPod.
1984142	1986482	So Namco is releasing Pole Position Remix.
1986963	1988063	It's available through iTunes.
1988843	1991704	And you drive with the iPod wheel.
1992944	1993144	So...
1995109	2001090	I hope that it comes out okay, but they're actually saying that it's the worst of all iPod games that are available now.
2001310	2001650	Don't!
2002090	2004211	But another reviewer said that it's the best one out.
2005111	2005851	It's five bucks.
2006531	2010532	If you've got five bucks, you know, and don't have to spend it on kitty litter, give it a try.
2011732	2013293	Worse or better?
2013713	2018054	You know, it makes sense, though, a driving game with the iPod wheel.
2018174	2022335	I mean, it is kind of a logical step, so I would think it would be okay.
2022375	2024595	But then again, pole position's a little bit
2025663	2026263	I don't know, old?
2028245	2034409	I mean, Pole Position is definitely one of those games that was way cooler when you were playing it at Chuck E. Cheese when you were six, right?
2034769	2038431	Like, you go back and play it now, you're like... I had a Pole Position cabinet in my house for a long time.
2039232	2040332	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
2040352	2044335	But we put the MAME in it, and we had actually... Dan found an identical one.
2044355	2046076	That's right, you had a stand-up cabinet for Pole Position.
2046096	2046596	We had a stand-up cabinet.
2046797	2049758	I remember Chuck E. Cheese, they had the sit-in-the-thing Pole Position.
2049778	2050319	Oh, those were great!
2050399	2052941	Those were awesome, but, like, it was better when you were six.
2053161	2054081	Remember Hard Drivin'?
2054361	2055142	That sucked.
2055162	2055242	Yeah.
2056438	2059861	Hard Drivin' was good because I worked at a Namco arcade when I was out of high school.
2060542	2064365	And one day I was there and we had no customers and I had been up all night and I took a nap in one.
2065166	2066407	They were dark.
2066888	2070051	There was a game that was on the PC that was very similar to Hard Drivin' and it was called Stunts.
2070531	2074495	And you made your own stunt tracks but the graphics were pretty much the same as Hard Drivin'.
2075596	2077658	It was great though because if you made a bunch of little 45 degree ramps...
2080492	2090819	Yeah, it was similar to that, but if you made a bunch of 45 degree ramps and just drove on it really fast, your car would get up to like 500 miles an hour and it would fly into the air like a tornado.
2091220	2091920	It was awesome.
2092380	2096924	If you think about it, games like Burnout, you can trace their roots back to hard driving.
2098124	2102367	I remember playing Test Drive 3 on the PC with the really crappy graphics.
2102788	2104949	Hey, screw you, I had Test Drive on the Commodore 64.
2106130	2110133	Well, this might as well have been on the Commodore 64 because the graphics were crap, but
2110529	2111069	It was fun.
2111109	2112991	I used to drive and run over chickens in that.
2113311	2116413	Hey, when I was eight, Test Drive had like the best graphics ever.
2116433	2117594	What are you talking about?
2121057	2139911	Well, this game may not be as good of an idea as, say, you know, Pole Position on the iPod, but there is a fan-made, and I don't even know where this came from, because I think it was a joke at one time, or they had a demo for it a while back,
2140339	2145023	But it's Charles Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaten.
2145583	2151068	It's a fan-made game made with RPG Maker.
2151828	2167921	And it basically tells an epic story of post-cyberpocalypse Neo-New York in the wake of the great b-ball purge of 2041 that threatens to own the entirety of your existence for some time.
2168582	2171704	and well they actually have a bunch of weird stuff in there.
2171824	2172384	It's cool though.
2172424	2174145	It's basically an RPG.
2174405	2177847	You have like your basketball moves you do and little mini games and stuff.
2178047	2180949	It is free to download and free is the magic word of course.
2181710	2183571	Free is a good price for this story.
2184251	2189734	And if you're interested there's I'm sure you can find it out there.
2189754	2191875	There are a bunch of different links and stuff hosting it.
2192636	2197438	The website that actually has the info is from a gaming forum.
2197479	2198159	It looks like a
2198895	2202139	GamingW.net and just check their forums.
2202339	2206484	They've got the full game from Tales of Games Studios.
2207225	2209508	Presents Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaten.
2210148	2210429	Wow.
2211949	2212989	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2241556	2247038	To put that in perspective, and a lot of sites have been putting it this way, that's half the size of Australia.
2248038	2250599	Because Australia's population is like 20 million.
2250639	2255741	Now granted, you have to think about like Australia is like mostly desert in the middle, in the outback.
2256481	2258222	Most of the people kind of live on the coast, but whatever.
2258282	2259762	It's still a pretty staggering number there.
2260443	2261603	Chris, I know you missed that.
2261623	2264384	10 million subscribers in World of Warcraft announced this week.
2265364	2266945	That's a lot.
2268005	2268605	Not surprising.
2269566	2270506	And they all live in China.
2272458	2273059	Which is amazing.
2273159	2274220	Actually, no, that's no joke.
2274320	2276942	Actually, there are 5.5 million of those.
2277042	2278763	Over half of those subscribers are in Asia.
2278823	2281886	So not just China, but the Asian region.
2282226	2285649	2.5 here in North America and 2 million subscribers in Europe.
2285709	2286610	That's pretty impressive.
2286770	2289332	Yeah, well, some of those people from North America are kind of... Wait, I'm sorry, Chris.
2289352	2289853	And a mic, what?
2290073	2290774	Oh, you got... Oh, never mind.
2290794	2291414	I didn't see... I got a mic.
2291434	2292015	I didn't see you stole one.
2292335	2292815	Yeah, I stole it.
2293276	2296899	Some of those people in America are not that bright.
2297439	2297640	Like...
2299208	2300629	I surf the forums.
2300689	2304092	I'm not active on the forums because I just can't deal with it.
2304332	2307755	Oh yeah, World of Warcraft forums, home of some serious lulz.
2308175	2309056	Serious lulz.
2309256	2314781	Best one today, server crash was deliberate hack by horde.
2318725	2320847	Oh no, it was the horde crashed by server.
2320967	2322548	And the funny thing is, this wasn't a joke.
2322668	2324670	This chick, or it could be a guy, I don't know.
2325760	2328744	This person actually... Wait, is it a blood elf female?
2328984	2329164	Yes.
2329284	2329665	It's a guy.
2330085	2330346	Okay.
2330866	2332268	This person... It's a level 7, too.
2333250	2338096	This person actually, like, was damn serious, and everyone was, like, going, Oh, lols, broke the internet.
2338156	2338957	Or is it the horde?
2339217	2339558	Insert...
2341244	2343506	I haven't never seen it so, like, plainly put, but that is a very good point.
2343526	2343946	Alright, um, let's
2371592	2375195	Let's move on from the internet lulls to something a little more newsworthy.
2377137	2390568	Well, it says for PlayStation 2 release in March, Ratchet & Clank Size Matters will be coming from PSP to the PS2.
2392109	2400136	And also mentioned is... Oh, I'm trying to... I thought there was another game mentioned in this.
2402526	2403266	Is it not loading?
2405027	2409650	Well, given that it's completely crashed my browser before.
2409670	2415813	The Silent Hill Origins is the other game.
2416174	2417254	Well, yeah, Silent Hill Origins.
2417434	2418335	We had already talked about that.
2419616	2421477	It wasn't particularly mentioned here.
2423218	2427380	But basically, Ratchet & Clank, Size Matters, was officially announced on Sony's site.
2428101	2441504	So basically, both these games that everybody kind of knew was coming, but nobody wanted to announce, finally they're like, oh yeah, since the entire internet found out, the horde ruined it for everybody, these games are coming up.
2443364	2445224	Surprise, I'm sure you're shocked.
2445604	2449425	I don't know about you, Jamie, but I'm actually excited about Silent Hill Zero on the PlayStation 2.
2449465	2450445	Well, hell yeah.
2450465	2453606	Because Silent Hill wasn't really a game I wanted to play on the PSP, you know what I mean?
2454645	2457347	I was actually thinking of getting a light just so I could hook it up to the TV.
2457547	2458908	Because Silent Hill is a scary game.
2459108	2460549	A little screen is not that scary.
2460710	2461430	I like scary.
2461670	2462471	I like scary too.
2462491	2463812	I don't.
2463832	2464912	Alright.
2465072	2467174	I like the kind of scary that fucks with your head.
2468615	2474339	Well, if Silent Hill isn't your cup of tea, then maybe some old Sega arcade games are.
2474919	2479262	Apparently, the Naomi BIOS has been cracked and now will be... Finally?
2480042	2481103	Yeah, finally.
2481163	2483745	That means Planet Harrier.
2484661	2500309	Now that means that this brand new emulator, well actually it's an emulator for the Dreamcast, will be able to run wonderful games such as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Ferrari F-355 Challenge, and Ikaruga.
2501009	2502690	Also known as The Good Stuff.
2502930	2503830	Planet Harrier.
2503910	2506792	Yes, so the Naomi games are going to be coming soon.
2506812	2509673	Awesome.
2509953	2511914	More news as soon as we get some.
2513055	2513355	Nice.
2514676	2518478	Well, I want to go back to World of Warcraft for a minute, but not to talk about some internet lulls.
2518518	2522079	I actually want to talk about something kind of a little bit sad.
2522559	2524620	It has to do with a Virginia Tech student.
2524640	2528982	This is not related to the tragedy that happened last year, but it was just another unfortunate tragedy.
2529742	2535925	There was a student there, a 21-year-old senior named Daniel Kim, who actually killed himself in a Target parking lot in Virginia.
2536485	2539566	And, of course, what was the first thing that was blamed in the death?
2540266	2540646	Gaming.
2541127	2541707	Video games.
2541787	2542687	It was the horde!
2542847	2543308	Individuals...
2544858	2545659	Not okay.
2546400	2550045	Individuals were automatically making assumptions about his death.
2563342	2563902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2591061	2592282	Thank you for watching!
2608378	2608938	The whole thing.
2609018	2613420	But it makes me angry that people always jump to these conclusions.
2613460	2618582	And of course, you know, you say Virginia Tech, you think about that horrible, horrible tragedy that happened there last year.
2618862	2622603	And who is the very first guy to come out and start blaming video games?
2623983	2624924	Lord Voldemort.
2625124	2627605	And if you've listened to this show enough, you know who I'm referencing.
2628945	2630966	Lord Voldemort comes right out and blames the video games.
2631026	2631526	Turns out,
2632102	2635183	Guy never played, he didn't own a single video game thing.
2635483	2641846	He just, there were mental problems that went beyond, you know, anything entertainment based.
2641886	2644447	So it just, it pisses me off that people jump to conclusions.
2644467	2646288	It's okay, he's a lawyer, he can say whatever he wants.
2646428	2647509	Oh, well, you know what?
2647709	2648529	No repercussions.
2648649	2653451	No, there is repercussions because there's angry people like us get on the internet and yell at them.
2654211	2655392	I know, serious stuff, right?
2656151	2662115	Regardless, this kind of stuff makes me very angsty when I hear people jumping to conclusions about the video games made me do it or whatever.
2663016	2665398	So what better time for us to bring on the FUs of the week?
2682469	2684971	My FU of the week goes to my fingerprint.
2686511	2700537	Because it's been catching a lot more lately, and I'm going to have to go to the doctor next week, and it's also starting in my index finger now, so it's looking like I'm going to have to have surgery on my hand.
2701598	2703478	But maybe I'll get disability and not have to go to work.
2704639	2704839	No.
2706060	2709361	The thing is that if I had that much time off of work, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.
2710462	2714003	And if I couldn't use my hand, I really wouldn't know what to do.
2714743	2715944	I would be so bored.
2716987	2719648	And I haven't been able to draw anything in like three weeks.
2720148	2721168	It's been really a pain in the butt.
2722508	2726209	Whatever you do, don't let the evil get into your hand, otherwise you're going to have to chop it off with a chainsaw.
2726489	2726969	That's right.
2727249	2728549	But then I can have a shotgun hand.
2729730	2730470	That is the plus.
2732250	2732610	Wow.
2732970	2734851	I can replace it with a machine gun hand.
2734951	2740612	You know, I thought the Wonder Shows and stuff was bad, but you guys are... This is not Boomstick!
2740692	2742012	You guys are taking it to a whole new level.
2743412	2746413	Some folks in chat are giving you the finger, but only so you can type.
2747781	2748201	Thank you.
2748221	2749462	All right.
2749502	2750442	Moving on, Loki.
2751342	2753923	F you to another one of my 360s crapping out.
2754283	2767548	Luckily, though, I found out there is another way to fix it, which involves heating up the motherboard with either a heat gun or, in this case, since I don't own a heat gun, a blow dryer until it gets really hot and then hopefully fixes everything.
2767568	2773050	That's about as effective as, I don't know, throwing your console at a wall and hopefully fixing it that way.
2773110	2775611	But I'm going to give it a shot because, hey, what's the worst that can happen?
2775651	2776271	It's already broken.
2778137	2778457	Wow.
2779757	2780377	All right.
2780658	2781618	I'm knocking on wood.
2783718	2784138	My turn?
2784598	2785359	Yes.
2785459	2791460	My FU of the week goes to this A&W float, which I saw at the grocery store.
2791500	2793100	And, like, who doesn't like root beer floats, right?
2793260	2793680	I do.
2794060	2794941	I love root beer floats.
2794981	2795381	Exactly.
2795421	2796421	But have you tried this?
2796741	2796981	No.
2797101	2797721	It's shit.
2797801	2798461	I think there's a little bit.
2798481	2799061	Yeah, it's just like cream.
2799081	2799882	You want to try some of this?
2799902	2800822	No, it's just like.
2800842	2801242	Here, try it.
2801362	2801862	Try it on there.
2802382	2802502	It's.
2804403	2804903	I don't like it.
2805543	2806423	Here is just.
2806563	2806703	Ooh.
2807668	2808248	Thanks for watching!
2825140	2830762	Well, F you to A&W for this thing that is no substitute for the real thing.
2831122	2832623	And F you to you guys for disagreeing with me.
2832663	2837045	And how hard is it seriously to make Rupir float?
2837065	2837845	I mean, come on.
2837945	2840106	Well, I do... No, they should have.
2840226	2843727	The concept of it all being in one bottle is... You know what?
2844027	2844908	I wonder if this would work.
2845188	2848489	Rupir with the vanilla Dippin' Dots dropped in there.
2849711	2855773	I can say at the store they not only have the A&W float, but they have Sunkissed floats too, but I don't think I'll be trying those.
2855974	2858314	Well, like orange cream soda is actually really good.
2860815	2861836	Saint Delight floats?
2862076	2863437	No, Saint Delight would be nasty.
2863997	2864857	No, that wouldn't work.
2866098	2866358	All right.
2866678	2868379	Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you want to give out?
2869379	2871160	Yeah, an FU to my dad's girlfriend.
2873120	2876862	The woman's driving me absolutely fucking nuts because she's...
2877594	2882997	Well, you know, I've been saying on air all night, she's a new mom, and she's hormonal, and I get that.
2883638	2888381	You know, but keep the baby away from things that are going to kill her!
2889141	2899507	Like, for instance, Baby 101, for those of you who do not have children, I would assume that all of you are intelligent to know that blankets are a potential hazard.
2900268	2907232	Like, you put the baby in baby blankets, but you keep it so that they're not, you know, in the way of the face.
2907794	2908474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2932324	2933765	She's driving me nuts!
2933905	2937649	You know, just the, like, I get, you're a new mom, I get that.
2937789	2938970	Everyone makes mistakes.
2939350	2942053	But you're making, like, 101 mistakes.
2942153	2942813	You should have learned.
2942833	2943554	You've met your quota.
2943694	2945476	You've met your quota of mistakes, right?
2945956	2951481	Yeah, no, it's like, you're allowed to make mistakes, but you're not allowed to make mistakes that are this big.
2951501	2955564	This is, like, stuff you should have learned when you learned you were pregnant.
2956145	2957346	You know?
2957546	2959528	Baby wipes, they're supposed to be cold and fucking cold.
2960740	2962201	I hope things get better.
2962421	2964343	Sorry to hear about the discomfort there.
2965264	2965645	Anything else?
2965925	2967747	No, I'm good.
2968187	2970830	Well, F you to you for leaving us.
2971571	2972031	Sorry.
2972111	2972652	I'm just kidding.
2972672	2973252	You know I love you.
2973793	2974694	I can't say F you to you.
2975735	2975995	All right.
2976645	2977926	Well, you would, but it would be kinky.
2978666	2978926	Hot.
2979046	2989171	All right, we just have a couple more gaming stories, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
2989211	2991192	But first, some more gaming news.
2991232	2991672	Yes, Jamie?
2991972	2993213	Choo, choo, choo.
2995194	2996194	I couldn't pass that up.
2996735	3002057	There's a rumor that Space Channel 5 is coming to Wii and other systems.
3002177	3005179	I mean, we're getting Knights and Samba D'Amico, so...
3007168	3014910	There was a mention saying that there was going to be Space Channel 5.0 that was reported on Japanese news site The Magic Box.
3016091	3021612	Sega denied it on IGN, but it could happen because they've done this before.
3023813	3032896	And it was even stated by Mizuguchi that he'd be interested in bringing it as a downloadable game like a Res HD is.
3034856	3036877	That'd be cool if they made a new game
3038191	3044196	It's from what I heard when they were licensing some of the old Michael Jackson music.
3044396	3044936	I think so.
3045717	3049180	Well, I know that in the second Space Channel 5, the dances were in there.
3050501	3052903	In one of the dance battle ones.
3053283	3053884	Good stuff.
3054824	3057787	Well, I got some last minute stories here real quick.
3058367	3061670	And then after that, we'll be taking some calls on the Skype line.
3062611	3065893	First, of course, who doesn't like a good drinking game?
3065973	3066674	Well, apparently...
3067733	3088387	Sexy Video Game Land's blog has come up with a few different drinking games, one of which is familiar solid, and it requires a bunch of different concoctions to make up, including, I guess, American beer, bottle of Russian vodka, six-pack of Red Bull, and some other stuff.
3088507	3092570	Oh, coarse salt, lemon-lime juice, and... Yeah.
3092950	3093271	Anyways...
3094483	3096104	Real quickly, I'll just go over some of these.
3096344	3098224	When you trigger alert, drink Red Bull.
3100225	3108168	When an enemy shows inappropriate sexual attraction to Snake, you take a vodka shot.
3109289	3110189	And let's see here.
3110669	3118512	Whenever your commander reminds you via the codec that you're on a stealth slash sneaking mission, that's when you take a beer shot.
3119512	3124358	and that's kind of complicated and they have a big long list of stuff that you do so you probably can get pretty wasted from that.
3125499	3134990	Other drinking games that they had available though, one was for Final Fantasy X2 or X2, my mistake.
3136331	3138434	Anyways, this one's a lot simpler.
3140171	3142833	Basically four different things to take a shot to.
3142973	3145315	Every time you see YRP, you take a shot.
3145756	3150860	Every time you see a clumsy-framed Yuna fanservice upskirt, take a shot.
3151360	3160648	And whenever you notice or re-notice LeBlanc's impossible simultaneous side and underboob dress setup, take a shot.
3160768	3164051	What's the idea, to get drunk in like five seconds?
3164551	3164991	I don't know.
3165352	3169215	And whenever Brother's antics become completely insufferable, take a shot.
3171750	3172190	All right.
3172250	3173971	I'd like to see the OLR drinking game.
3174011	3174892	I bet it's hilarious.
3175752	3177133	I'm sure they've got one.
3178694	3180695	Some other stuff real quick, of course.
3181515	3182696	The Skyplane's open, by the way.
3182716	3184577	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3184657	3185997	Use name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
3186798	3193401	There's some screenshots showing a car in No More Heroes, and apparently it has a New Jersey plate on it.
3193421	3195682	So people are thinking, hey, Santa destroys in New Jersey.
3195702	3197343	Yeah.
3198738	3212009	One cool thing, if you haven't played it yet, I was playing a little bit during break, Patapon, the demo is available in the US, and one of the cool things about playing the demo is it will unlock an exclusive weapon when you buy the full game.
3213990	3214951	If you buy the full game, I guess.
3215131	3226020	By the way, when I said the whole OLR drinking game, SSJ100Matt and Actdeft, like in unison, said, OLR drinking game, every time Loki says anyway, you take a shot.
3228274	3228654	Love it!
3229014	3230395	Alright, let's go to the phones real quick.
3230615	3232877	I'll let Loki finish the stories in a little bit, but we want to hear from you guys.
3233977	3234958	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3234978	3235318	Who's this?
3236679	3237319	GS68.
3237739	3238640	Hello, GS68.
3238660	3239320	What's on your mind, buddy?
3240801	3246064	Well, I've been playing Super Metroid lately, and several weeks ago I decided to try Metroid Prime 3.
3250346	3251727	You were playing Metroid Prime 3, uh-huh.
3253368	3257630	Yeah, and I found it pretty disorienting, and
3260013	3264578	and at some point I got stuck and I started going around in circles and getting dizzy and that's when I just realized that
3266388	3271871	I'm not for first-person games, and I'm not a big fan of 3D games.
3294563	3305592	So to take Metroid to a 3D space is tough because you really have to, you know, when you've played 2D games for a long time to then suddenly have to conceptualize things in 3D takes some getting used to.
3306133	3306693	It really does.
3306713	3308715	And I think a lot of people don't give some of us enough credit.
3309055	3311577	I partially blame it for why I suck so bad at Halo.
3311617	3314540	I'm always getting lost just because I'm, I don't know.
3314620	3315261	I don't know what it is.
3315321	3316882	I like to think I'm not stupid or anything.
3316902	3317482	I don't think I am.
3317783	3321246	I just am not used to gaming in a 3D space for a long time.
3321466	3321646	Yeah.
3322731	3332974	Actually, I just started playing Super Metroid over the summer, and I think it's more with me and first-person shooters.
3333034	3339316	I mean, on paper, first-person shooter on the Wii sounds really cool, but when I try it, I get dizzy.
3340257	3341157	You know, maybe you're just...
3342088	3343809	You might have a little bit of the motion sickness, too.
3343829	3346950	You've got to make sure you look away once in a while and all that stuff.
3346990	3357155	I mean, certainly, I know DarkSakura has talked about that she doesn't like to play a whole lot of first-person shooters because she, on a big old TV, can make you feel a little nauseous, right?
3358416	3359196	Yeah.
3360057	3369661	Mostly, it's probably, I'm assuming, and Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm assuming it's kind of a lot of the same triggers that make people motion sick in cars come into play in video games.
3370082	3370682	I think so.
3371004	3375906	because it's like, it's like, you know, like that whole thing where like if you're sitting in the back of a car around a windy road.
3375966	3376727	Anyway, go ahead.
3377167	3377427	Sorry.
3378127	3387672	Yeah, there was like this cutscene in Final Fantasy 7 where Cloud says never to read while in a car or truck, which I thought was interesting.
3388982	3397365	Well, it's interesting you bring up Final Fantasy VII because remember that was a big shock when it came out because it was like, OMG, it's taking a 2D game and putting it in a 3D space.
3397625	3398445	But it was kind of different.
3398886	3404127	Final Fantasy VII still felt pretty 2D to me, just with a 3D twist to it.
3404368	3406228	It was like two and a half dimensions, if that makes sense.
3407209	3413011	I think the point is, overall, I guess I'm just more into side scores and first-person shooters.
3413931	3414931	And I think that's okay.
3414971	3416712	I think people are into whatever they're into, so...
3417125	3418726	There's no particular type of game you have to like.
3419167	3422289	All right, GS68, any other final thoughts for our listeners before we keep moving on?
3423250	3423470	No.
3423890	3424130	All right.
3424391	3431516	Well, thank you for your input tonight, and I hope Metroid Prime 3 is a great game once you can kind of get used to the first-person-ness, so I hope the sickness doesn't bog you down.
3432337	3432977	Give it another go.
3432997	3433958	I think you'll find this a lot of fun.
3433998	3434298	Good luck.
3435039	3437741	I'll try sometime in the future.
3438021	3438442	Please do.
3439082	3440643	Take care.
3440683	3441304	Here's the weird thing.
3441344	3445207	Even though I'm not a big fan of the first-person games, I freaking love Oblivion.
3445985	3447546	Love it.
3447746	3448566	I don't have a problem with it.
3448606	3449807	It's all about punching the animals.
3450027	3450487	I guess so.
3450927	3451948	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3451968	3452348	Who's this?
3453768	3454248	Yeah, what's up?
3454288	3455749	This is RossDLUT.
3455929	3457690	Hello, RossDLUT, my friend.
3457770	3458510	What is on your mind?
3459931	3460571	A few things.
3460591	3470475	First off, you're talking about the whole idea of conceptualizing 3D games when you've been used to 2D games just now.
3471375	3472636	I think what's helped is
3473447	3478409	You have environments that are more detailed to where you can associate landmarks.
3478449	3480469	If you remember the old 3D games, like in the early PS1,
3494929	3496630	You know, all the walls look the same.
3496670	3501991	I mean, it made Doom damn near impossible for me, because everything, you know, one wall was the same as the other, you know what I mean?
3502111	3503912	I think you've got a damn good point here.
3503952	3510474	That's one thing that always kind of frustrated me about the Mega Man Legends games, especially the early ones, is that, you know, everything kind of looked the same, so it was very hard.
3510494	3512275	Well, there were only two Mega Man Legends games.
3512575	3515336	Yeah, but... But yeah, I know what you mean.
3516036	3522818	You can't do a 3D game and have everything look the same, because you're just going to get horribly lost, and it doesn't matter...
3524167	3530099	but then again the same thing happens with a lot of 2D games the original Metroid was a pain in the ass because all you had was the
3531638	3536262	The Black Background, and the different colors of the floors, so it took me a little while.
3536322	3544868	You know what, you bring up a damn good point, because it's not like in the real world I have a problem conceptualizing 3D space.
3544928	3546269	I don't think many of us do.
3546950	3548571	You know, maybe there's a condition out there, I don't know.
3548851	3552154	But most people don't have a problem conceptualizing 3D space in the real world.
3552394	3554876	And I think you're right, a lot of that is landmarks, right?
3554976	3556177	How do we give directions out?
3556217	3559619	We say, okay, go straight down the street, and when you see the McDonald's, turn right.
3559799	3560120	You know?
3561122	3561863	Exactly.
3561883	3564926	You need those recognizable landmarks.
3564946	3566487	Yeah, you need a McDonald's.
3566607	3567548	For lack of a better term, yeah.
3580768	3587212	maps, instant maps, one-button maps, a little mini-map in the corner, a way to conceptualize the 3D and 2D very quickly.
3587712	3590894	That's one reason I way prefer Kingdom Hearts 2 to Kingdom Hearts 1 is the mini-map.
3590974	3591414	Seriously.
3592374	3593535	It's a huge... Yeah, I hear you.
3593895	3596757	A lot of the games have the mini-maps.
3598078	3603320	Even the really late ones, like Call of Duty 4 has a mini-map when you pause.
3604181	3605902	So there are a lot of aids today.
3608563	3609684	So there is that, you know.
3610456	3613238	Like I said, 3D is a lot easier today than it used to be.
3614358	3615799	Well, what else did you want to say, RustyLUT?
3615819	3618420	Because we're trying to move through a lot of calls tonight.
3618480	3622823	I want to go back to the whole idiots on Mass Effect thing.
3623423	3623703	Ah, yes.
3623723	3629806	You know, we've been seeing for the better part of a decade and a half idiots attacking video games.
3629847	3632968	And I'm going to call them idiots because, you know, ignorant means you don't know better.
3633008	3634289	Stupid means you don't want to learn.
3636710	3637070	It's true.
3637090	3637431	But...
3638989	3641270	Drew, your words have not been spoken on this show tonight.
3641350	3641711	Go ahead.
3642511	3644272	Thank you, thank you.
3645312	3652956	The thing is, I always wonder what sort of impact they really have, aside from the whole soundbite culture.
3652976	3659860	Because when you look at it, in that time when the anti-gaming attacks have been so intense...
3660802	3664183	The industry has just grown and blossomed enormously.
3664223	3666803	We just had this epic year last year.
3666823	3667763	What was it?
3667783	3671444	$18 billion for the industry last year?
3672724	3679485	So you have to really wonder how important these Jack Thompson, how many people they actually reach out to.
3679705	3686687	I think what we lose sight of is that the United States is a country of 300 million people.
3687567	3688067	There's...
3688777	3693479	A ton of cable networks, literally, a ton of cable networks and satellite and everything else.
3694239	3695680	There's so many options out there.
3695700	3696100	You know what?
3696160	3697560	I think you're kind of right, Ross.
3697600	3703663	I think one thing we kind of don't consider about this Fox News piece is that they were probably preaching to the choir in a sense.
3703723	3711585	Like a lot of the people that watch Fox News were probably already the crowd that bans their children from playing video games altogether and all this stuff.
3713306	3714927	But it doesn't excuse the ignorance.
3715467	3720069	Oh, nothing excuses the ignorance.
3720309	3725251	I think originally these guys were probably preaching to the choir, but at the same time it doesn't give them the right to lie.
3726752	3741378	Of course, and I'm angry about the lie, but at the same time, compared to other times in history, other media's attacks, video games have had a pretty damn light.
3742088	3744454	and I've gone through it pretty damn quickly in comparison.
3744474	3748964	It took the movie industry 40 years to get over the Hays Code, for example.
3749890	3752932	and the comic book industry only recently got out of the shadow of the comic book.
3752952	3754493	Video games have had it very light.
3754733	3757175	Ross Dill, UT, we've got to wrap up but I've got to say this.
3757215	3766041	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens especially as this Hollywood writer's strike continues where video games are going to become... You watch this happen.
3766061	3772725	The longer this strike goes on, the more of these writers are going to start writing for video games and we're going to have very Hollywood-ish type of video games.
3773126	3774226	It's going to be very interesting.
3774387	3775647	We're already seeing that happen.
3775667	3777809	We're already seeing video games
3778109	3783893	taking audience from television, which is part of why you see all this anti-gaming stuff on TV.
3783973	3786595	They're trying to get rid of that market.
3786655	3787936	Anyway, I know you're tired.
3787956	3788917	I'm sorry.
3789417	3790578	There was another story about this this week.
3790898	3796362	You know how they say that video game plots are always so thin they never make good movies.
3796382	3798964	I think you're going to start seeing a lot more games.
3798984	3801066	They don't make good movies because the directors suck.
3801466	3802707	That's true a lot of the time, too.
3804122	3805163	Uwe Ball anyone?
3805183	3831618	Silent Hill some of them were passable some of them were even Mortal Kombat was passable passable I liked the first Mortal Kombat I liked the first Resident Evil but then you look into shit those were good movies you look at shit like Blood Rain and you're just like this is why I get better okay one sex scene we're not gonna be alright Rusty or UT I'm so sorry we gotta let you go but have a good one buddy it's always good to hear from you bye bye you do the same bye bye
3832372	3832733	Actdeft from chat
3849331	3850852	Actually, three things on mine.
3851773	3854575	The first one is the DVR is dead thing.
3855516	3867984	I agree with you on the Konami should definitely hire or commission harmonics on the whole renewal of DVR.
3868885	3873388	They're having so much success with Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
3874404	3876766	Actdeft, you're from Mexico, right?
3876786	3877927	If I remember right?
3903129	3903349	Yes.
3904230	3905210	Here's one question.
3905390	3908192	I hear that Pump It Up has a huge fan base in Mexico.
3908252	3909093	Is that true in your neck?
3909153	3911994	Now, obviously, Mexico is a very big place, but is that true in your neck of the woods?
3913936	3920399	Actually, Pump It Up is more popular on the center of the country, more on the south side.
3920740	3921120	Gotcha.
3921880	3924642	On the north, DVR has more popularity.
3925442	3925643	I see.
3925663	3931506	Do you think that might just be because a lot of American culture kind of seeps through because the closer you get to the border and everything?
3931586	3932847	Do you think that might be a part of it or just
3933407	3933847	Coincidence.
3934588	3934908	Yeah.
3936129	3937870	Yeah, that's most part of it.
3937930	3938090	Yeah.
3938690	3946435	Because I was thinking, yeah, and somebody brought it up in chat too, ColorSakura said it in chat, and I was thinking of this too, that the World Pump Festival was happening in Mexico City.
3946475	3951337	But yeah, Mexico City is much further south in Mexico than, you know, other places.
3951437	3952778	So, anyhow.
3953439	3953639	Yeah.
3954919	3962224	Also, I wanted to comment on what you said a week ago about Video Games Live.
3962244	3962704	Mm-hmm.
3963243	3967350	That it's coming to Mexico and it's coming to Mexicali, that's my hometown.
3967770	3968211	Awesome.
3968331	3969854	I'm pretty damn excited.
3970194	3971436	That has got to be awesome.
3971456	3972278	It's not going to be easy.
3973639	3975260	I bet it's not every day.
3975340	3982845	Unfortunately, a lot of big tours and things don't always think to go to Mexico or other countries.
3983126	3987549	We hear a lot from Footy Monster, who's in Argentina, and not a lot of stuff comes to his neck of the woods either.
3987889	3991551	I bet that's got to be pretty awesome to see something like this actually kind of recognized.
3991571	3994814	Like, hey, let's go to some places a little bit outside the North.
3994834	3996094	Let's go somewhere besides L.A.
3996135	3996815	and New York, right?
3997936	3998276	Pretty cool.
3998737	4007329	Yeah, it's pretty exciting because here in my town doesn't happen anything like this huge, like, video game slide, though.
4008018	4013122	Maybe for some people, it would be like, oh, video games, oh yeah, whatever.
4014082	4022608	But for me, it's a great experience that's going to happen, going to the bullring that's going to be happening.
4024569	4032715	And hearing all the music I know and recognize from old video games, and also with my friends that also are video game fans,
4033536	4036237	Actdeft, let me ask you just one last question, then we've got to wrap up.
4036757	4041038	Do you think it will succeed in a non-traditional place like Mexicali?
4041278	4043979	Do you think the show has the potential to do very well there?
4044699	4054982	We have a pretty big community of gamers, and also people who like anime, otakus, and pretty much geeks.
4056582	4063044	Well, I... It would be a success, though not as great as in the big city.
4063976	4066899	Another thing I wanted to add before ending the call.
4066979	4068220	It's the Fox News thing.
4089662	4092845	Just a little opinion on my part.
4093105	4101973	It should be not us attacking them also or ignore them.
4102153	4107057	We should acknowledge their opinions and maybe make a debate.
4107438	4113583	Like the PAX Expo tried to do last year with Jack Thompson, a debate.
4115535	4130079	Very interesting perspective that maybe instead of getting on the offensive, like things that you see on Amazon.com, everybody attacking this lady who said this, maybe the video game community can kind of look at how can we stop this from happening in the future?
4130119	4133259	If this is what people really think, how can we educate them otherwise?
4134000	4135360	It's a very interesting way of looking at it.
4135660	4137120	It's a very interesting way of looking at it.
4137200	4138081	I appreciate your opinion.
4138401	4139241	Actdeft, we're out of time.
4139261	4141001	I've got to let you go, but thanks so much for your call.
4142062	4142402	You too.
4142622	4142862	All right.
4142902	4143222	Bye-bye.
4144577	4145677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4171567	4183891	But if they have an agenda, like, you know, trying to be sensationalists and stuff like that, and really rile up people about video games, they're just gonna do these stories anyway, since, obviously, they don't really care about apologizing about it.
4183971	4184171	True.
4184611	4191973	I'm surprised we don't see more crazy shit on there, like, you know, Grand Theft Auto literally reaches out at the TV and murders your children and stuff like that.
4192453	4193994	I mean... The Horde is after your children?
4194054	4195934	Yes, the Horde is after your children.
4196694	4198475	It is a satanic cult.
4199164	4204646	Cultivated by a video game, it has 10 million followers, and it will destroy the Christian race.
4208327	4211207	I don't know how we can go from that into another call, but we're going to try.
4211227	4212528	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4212568	4213108	Who's this?
4214648	4215308	Hey, what's up, everyone?
4215348	4215849	It's Ranma.
4216649	4221170	You've been listening to that, because sometimes I pick up calls and don't acknowledge for a little bit, just to get them on the line.
4221190	4223171	You've been listening to that for 30 seconds.
4223491	4225811	I don't know how you held the laughter in, so we couldn't hear you.
4227572	4227992	All right.
4228962	4229943	Ramma, what's on your mind?
4231305	4237732	Well, there was a couple things I wanted to discuss, but I'm putting that aside because I'm very pissed off right now.
4237972	4238292	Why is that?
4238312	4239233	I have one thing to say.
4239273	4240575	Can I please say it?
4241055	4241356	Okay.
4244038	4247342	People, shut the fuck up about DDR.
4247843	4247963	It's
4248604	4249025	Done.
4249486	4255696	God forbid Konami ignores its other franchises to please you drooling fanboys.
4255756	4257559	I wouldn't say they're really ignoring their franchise.
4257579	4260764	They're still releasing more than two games a year for the damn thing.
4260804	4262186	I mean, I wouldn't say it's dead.
4262226	4263108	Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
4264259	4268422	I mean, be thankful you're getting something, you know?
4268482	4269963	It's all the people who play DDR.
4270003	4272025	It's all their fault because they're not the ones playing it.
4272045	4273606	Konami's releasing plenty of games.
4273686	4275367	It's just you guys, you all suck.
4275407	4275787	That's why.
4276028	4278069	Ranma, I agree and I disagree.
4278289	4281291	I agree to a point that at some point you have to let DDR go.
4281492	4282512	You just have to let it go.
4282692	4283973	It's past its prime, whatever.
4284354	4289257	But at the same part, it sucks because without DDR, I would never have met Jamie.
4289677	4290678	I would have never met Matt.
4291018	4291799	I would have never met you.
4292338	4293078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4313409	4318191	Chris was talking about a fundraiser going on on DeviantArt to help one of the artists in need.
4318231	4320913	And I was talking about that's a really great example of community.
4321433	4326536	And I bet if something like that happened in the DDR world, the DDR community would have done something similar.
4326897	4329358	Listen, Thomas Howard, he's hungry.
4329438	4331439	Every community has done something like that.
4333507	4348434	Some conventions, when they have the auctions for artwork and stuff like that, they will say a portion of this will go to this charitable organization, which is pretty cool.
4348474	4349554	We've heard all sides of this.
4349874	4352276	Let's not continue to indulge the DDR discussion.
4352316	4353256	What else did you want to say, Ranma?
4354662	4361744	Okay, I do know a few episodes back it was talking about the Wii and the Wii Remote, and it's something I thought about.
4362064	4364145	Let me ask all of you guys this, and girls.
4365045	4374848	If the Wii came loaded with the Wii Remote and a classic controller, would the console still be considered a gimmick system?
4379070	4379170	Um...
4381806	4382747	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4404278	4405539	DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4430503	4431284	I agree on that.
4431524	4433565	I do see how Nintendo wanted to get away from that.
4433686	4434306	That was cool.
4434486	4437428	I played some of the Wii games on launch, and it was cool.
4437888	4439469	I played Dragon Ball Z, Budokai 2.
4440030	4440971	I couldn't get into it.
4441271	4444133	I was like, I need a regular controller in order to play the game.
4445293	4447515	At first, everyone was like, oh, this is so cool, this is so great.
4447675	4450917	Now, developers are like saying, this ain't a joke, you know?
4451097	4452178	Let's go on to other things.
4454259	4464362	I think a very realistic possibility in the future, Ranma, is that when the Wii start coming out in other colors, and again, this is all speculation, why not throw in a matching classic controller of another color?
4464462	4466523	The Wii is an established thing now.
4467743	4469884	The waggling and the motions, it's established now.
4470184	4471525	Developers will buy into it.
4471765	4475866	I think it's okay to start putting in classic controllers and kind of see what can happen with a good mix.
4477199	4478020	That'll definitely work.
4478060	4482882	I mean, like, you got, like, a game where one person uses a controller to, like, drive a car.
4482922	4487445	Some other person can use the remote, the control, like, the little guns or the lasers.
4487465	4488226	That'd be pretty cool.
4488246	4489606	Yeah, lots of ideas.
4490167	4499052	And, of course, I think back to that YouTube that came out a little while ago with the whole reverse thing where the guy had the whole conceptualized space thing, but he was, like, wearing the sensor bar on his head.
4499092	4500032	That thing was amazing.
4500052	4500773	I don't know if you saw it.
4502274	4504015	I'm sure someone in chat has a link to the YouTube.
4504055	4504736	It's freaking amazing.
4505036	4507198	Ranma, really quickly, any last thoughts and we've got to let you go.
4508479	4509600	I'm tired of 3D games.
4509680	4511501	I want more 2D games and 3D environments.
4511661	4513403	That's it.
4513583	4515785	Real quickly, how do you feel about the Bionic Commando remake?
4515845	4518086	Because that seems to be exactly the kind of thing you're talking about.
4520088	4520748	I'll buy that for $20.
4520828	4521109	All right.
4521129	4521589	You do that.
4521669	4522410	All right.
4523350	4524992	Thanks so much for your call, Ranma.
4525032	4525352	Take care.
4525372	4526033	No problem.
4526053	4526213	Bye-bye.
4526233	4526493	All right.
4527285	4532528	Seriously, like, I had the biggest nerdgasm when I saw that Bionic Commando thing last week.
4533088	4533769	If I can even say that.
4534029	4537551	All right, any other... Any other... Yes, I fangasmed all over myself.
4538611	4539572	All right, real quick.
4539652	4540232	I got another call.
4540272	4541393	This is the last one, I promise.
4541993	4543074	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4543094	4543434	Who's this?
4546676	4547076	Hello.
4547396	4547997	Hi, who's this?
4549157	4550318	This is Let's Have Tea.
4551158	4552479	Hello, Let's Have Tea.
4552639	4553420	Welcome to the show.
4553740	4555161	Real quick, because we're trying to wrap up.
4555201	4555821	What did you want to say?
4558462	4566767	I know you didn't really want any more comments on the whole DDR thing, but there are communities out there working together using DDR for charities.
4568909	4580076	I know there's an organization in Indiana that they've been doing annual charities for seven years now, using DDR as a...
4583169	4584890	away to raise money.
4585471	4591115	And this year, they raised just over $2,800 a weekend for a children's hospital.
4591655	4592316	That's awesome.
4592336	4593917	Do you happen to have a website link or anything?
4596599	4600062	The community for that is over at NDDDR.com.
4600442	4600702	Nice.
4601803	4603504	And it's called the DDR-a-thon.
4604165	4604465	All right.
4604585	4605085	Very cool.
4605466	4609048	Let's have T. We've got to let you go because I swore we were going to wrap up, but thank you so much for sharing that with us.
4609128	4609789	Have a good one, okay?
4611230	4611450	Yep.
4611810	4612111	All right.
4612391	4612531	Bye.
4613941	4641689	I love that nickname too I forgot to compliment him when he was on the line but Let's Have Tea is like one of my favorite nicknames of anybody in chat alright I promised we could wrap up we're gonna do a couple quick last minute stories but I did want to say this real quick because he's talking about charity and I think it's really interesting this has kind of become a fad lately I don't know if that's the right word to use because that has kind of a negative context with it but I've noticed it seems like I've seen a lot of these 48 hour gaming sessions for charity lately like you know I want to say
4642139	4647282	Somebody sent me an email, I think it was one of our listeners, that they were going to play through the Banjo-Kazooie games in one weekend.
4647562	4653225	And of course we saw the Mario-a-thon, the Sonic-a-thon, the Zelda-a-thon.
4653745	4660769	And it's a very interesting trend right now that people are doing these marathons for different charities.
4660809	4661409	I think it's cool.
4661769	4662990	I think it's a great example of...
4664767	4665748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4694038	4720660	To kind of go back to some of the stuff we talked about earlier, there is a rumor, I guess now, apparently a tipster who tipped off QJNet about the phasing out of the 20 gig PS3s is also saying that now he has information about the phase out of the 80 gig PS3s for GameStop and EB.
4720980	4723362	Apparently they're also phasing them out as well.
4723860	4753615	and he says I went ahead and looked in our back office inventory screen and found that only SKU listed as active for the PS3 console was the 40 gig system the 2060 and 80 SKUs were deleted so that's kind of interesting and of course Sony has come out and said no comment regarding the phased out rumors most likely though if we're hearing that a lot of these retailers are phasing out that something's going to happen so not a big surprise there
4754082	4759685	Someone else apparently found another hack into the Wii to run their own code.
4759785	4769950	Apparently there's an exploit using a game save for Zelda Twilight Princess where you can crash it and run a code using a buffer overflow.
4770630	4771151	It's kind of neat.
4772551	4773052	Interesting.
4773872	4778855	And then the Surfer Girl, of course, she's had a lot of rumors that have come true here.
4779335	4783537	Some of our newest ones include Slalom, I guess, a rare
4784484	4787525	and Dead Rising 2 and Lost Planet 2 not too far behind.
4787545	4791706	The PSP will also be getting a follow-up title coming in the form of another Syphon Filter game.
4810772	4814753	and we'll have the story tied into a PS3 version as well, also set for 2009.
4815213	4819155	And finally, there is some stuff coming from EA.
4819755	4828497	Apparently they are rumored to be working on another Wing Commander title, an actual Wing Commander title, not some crappy Xbox Live Arcade game.
4828838	4840101	However, there is also another Xbox Live Arcade game coming from Rare, and that game is Mr. Pants, which I don't know if you've played Mr. Pants, but it's a weird game.
4841201	4842141	Mr. Pants.
4844242	4845642	What is a game called Mr. Pants?
4845722	4847423	I don't remember, but it looked weird.
4847883	4849503	All right.
4849543	4852524	We're way over for time tonight, so we definitely have to wrap things up.
4853644	4855105	Any other last minute stories quickly, though?
4855125	4855705	I just want to make sure.
4856305	4856425	No.
4856825	4857125	All right.
4857645	4861166	Then let's go ahead and wrap it up with our final thoughts.
4862327	4863427	Loki, your final thought tonight.
4864271	4865573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4879894	4881675	as long as I drink it in moderation.
4882055	4883915	I wouldn't live off vitamin water, but it's good stuff.
4884315	4894338	And lastly, but certainly not leastly, thank you so much, Chris, for coming over tonight and lending your moral support and your shining face to our show and a very good bonus segment all thanks to you tonight.
4894398	4897258	So, Chris, any final thoughts from you?
4898419	4900019	The Horde is after your server.
4902512	4904854	And please call in once in a while and let us know you're doing okay.
4904914	4905614	Oh, I plan to.
4905754	4906155	You better.
4906595	4908796	And you're still going to be our roving reporter in Wisconsin.
4908836	4911198	We'll find something gaming-related up there for you to cover.
4911538	4912099	Okay.
4912239	4915381	Actually, I've got something that I want to plug later, but I'll do that later.
4915401	4916081	Do you want to plug it now?
4917315	4917815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4946601	4947602	I'm losing my memory already.
4970712	4971513	It just wouldn't happen.
4971593	4972254	We wouldn't be here.
4972294	4973255	We wouldn't be able to do this.
4973415	4974295	And we do it for free.
4974356	4977358	We do it because we love getting to hang out with y'all on a Sunday night.
4977478	4981262	And even for those guys that can't make it live, we love the feedback and the stuff we get.
4981922	4984184	You guys are awesome, and thank you so much for your support of us.
4984705	4987547	If you like what we do, all we ask, help spread the word.
4987808	4989529	Tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.
4990070	4993393	Post a positive review on iTunes, which, by the way, we got a couple of those this week.
4993433	4997056	I'd like to really thank those new entries on iTunes this week, some really nice reviews.
4998237	4999678	or wherever you think would be best.
4999718	5001058	I know not everyone uses iTunes.
5001098	5001838	So, you know, whatever.
5002199	5004659	Dig, Yahoo, Podcast, whatever.
5005080	5005640	I think it's great.
5006400	5008101	Thank you guys so much as always.
5008581	5014103	And until next week when we will be joined with our first ever musical guest, which is going to be all kinds of interesting.
5014143	5014543	Can't wait.
5015323	5017704	We'll see you then here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5017964	5018444	I'm Rob.
