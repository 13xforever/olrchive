15300	19600	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19600	24700	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, our last show for January,
24700	28000	because it is January the 27th of 2008.
28000	31700	Let's get right back into the gaming news. If you missed Part A, you missed a lot.
31700	33700	You missed a lot of randomness, that's for sure.
33700	39000	But now we're going to get into some Nintendo news, because we had a substantial lack of Nintendo in Part A.
39000	41300	So let's kick it off with some Nintendo news, Loki.
41300	45000	One of the new things we learned this week about Smash Bros. Brawl
45000	49100	is that it will have classic game demos included with it,
49100	61300	including demos for The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Bros., as well as Star Fox 64.
61300	64600	That's pretty cool and all.
64600	70600	My question is, why the fuck don't they have demos on the Virtual Console if they're all available on Brawl?
70600	76400	Come on, if it's that easy to make demos for this stuff, then why isn't it available for the other stuff?
76400	79100	Is it just me, or is this maybe a workaround?
79100	83900	Because they realize that tons and tons of Wii owners are going to be buying this game.
83900	87600	This is a AAA title of the highest kind for the Nintendo Wii.
87600	92400	I think it's cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, but seriously though, if it's easy to implement,
92400	98000	why aren't they doing timed demos on some of these Nintendo games and stuff?
98000	102600	Here's the weird thing. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea, I think it's great.
102600	105800	It gives this game even more value than it had already.
105800	108400	God, we all knew this was going to be a powerhouse game anyway.
108400	113800	But the only thing that makes me go, are there really that many people who haven't played these games?
113800	115100	I don't think so.
115100	118600	Am I just spoiled because I'm older, so I kind of grew up with 8-bit Nintendo and stuff?
118600	122300	But are there a lot of people who have never played The Legend of Zelda?
122300	124800	Who have never played original Mario Bros.?
124800	130100	There may be some people though, obviously we grew up in the 80s and stuff,
130100	133200	but there's a lot of people that have never played the original games.
133200	135800	Alright, Chris is raising her hand, I guess that's true.
135800	137200	I was denied video games when I was five.
137200	142600	That's right, you said during the break though, you were denied video games when you were a child,
142600	144400	so you didn't really have a lot of exposure to this.
144400	147600	No, my parents refused to buy me anything that had to do with the video game
147600	152400	until I was finally in high school and I got my Pokemon games.
152400	154600	My mom used to play with me.
154600	157400	Well, your mom was awesome, my parents were retarded.
157400	161400	Just the different, well I mean obviously, you pretty much have two different extremes right here.
161400	165600	You have the no video games in this house whatsoever, and then the family that plays together.
165600	167600	I mean you literally have the two games in the spectrum here.
167600	170600	Well, the family I used loosely because it was me, my mom, and my brothers,
170600	172600	you know, we weren't the typical family unit.
172600	173800	Right, well, you know.
173800	179200	Well, it was just, it really was, my brothers ran outside and played the neighborhood
179200	181600	and my mom was usually in my room playing my Nintendo.
181600	185200	So I had to, I didn't get to play my Nintendo as much as my mother played it.
185200	188800	They also mentioned that there are other demos that are hidden in there.
188800	192800	My question is why aren't there full games kind of like Animal Crossing had?
192800	194800	Because now there's the virtual console.
194800	196800	So?
196800	201800	Because a virtual console is a money making machine, it's free money, essentially.
201800	205300	I shouldn't say free money, but very, very low cost money.
205300	208800	Because, you know, obviously somebody is having to make those manuals and those kinds of things,
208800	211800	you know, and QA the game and make sure it works in the emulator and all that stuff,
211800	214800	but that, all things considered, is extremely low cost.
214800	217800	They should have a demo for Mother 3 on there, that would be hilarious.
217800	219800	Actually, that would be kind of rad.
219800	221800	I would kind of hope they would do something like that.
221800	223800	Like give us a game that has only been seen in Japan, I don't know.
223800	226800	No, just a demo for it. You'll never see the full game over here, just the demo.
226800	228800	Mother 3 came out in Europe.
228800	231800	That's evil. Oh, that's true. True.
231800	234800	RasteelUT has a thought. He says in chat.orangelsrader.com,
234800	239800	he says, Loki, Nintendo doesn't have many new games, so they have to sell this stuff.
239800	242800	Well, that's cool. I don't mind them selling this stuff,
242800	245800	but like for some of these obscure games on a virtual console,
245800	248800	I like to be able to try them out before I spend $5 on them.
248800	250800	And, of course, there's other people that are piping up.
250800	253800	You know, Brad from Pod Culture says, I've never played a Zelda game.
253800	257800	And, you know, I guess, you know, and Act F says younger people maybe haven't played the games.
257800	259800	And all very good points.
259800	263800	Again, I guess maybe my perspective is spoiled because I really grew up on this shit.
263800	268800	Some people were also primarily PC gamers or had like an Apple II or something.
268800	271800	You know, I had a friend who never had a Nintendo,
271800	274800	but she was the world's biggest Doom player that I knew.
274800	277800	Well, that's cool. That's cool.
277800	279800	All right, I guess you guys make a good point.
279800	281800	I can admit when you guys make good points.
281800	285800	But, I mean, like I said in the beginning, this was never a bad thing.
285800	288800	It was just kind of, wow, that's interesting.
288800	291800	So I guess all you guys that never got to play these games will finally get your chance.
291800	296800	And if you like it, you can send Nintendo $5 and get the full version.
296800	302800	Who knows, though, if there will be any Sega Master System games included in Smash Bros. Brawl.
302800	307800	Not likely since the only Sega character in the game that we know of is Sonic.
307800	311800	But we did get news this week that Sega Master System games will be coming to the Virtual Console.
311800	312800	That's right.
312800	315800	A whole resurgence of the Sega Master System.
315800	321800	You know, the Sega Master System never really caught on here in America quite in the same way that Nintendo did.
321800	323800	It was always kind of the cultish thing.
323800	326800	I'll tell you where it caught on. Brazil.
326800	327800	That's true.
327800	329800	And they still, you know, Genesis and all that stuff.
329800	332800	I remember reporting on the Genesis handheld that's still big in Brazil.
332800	338800	Dan was showing me a video file of Castle of Illusion for Master System, which looks oddly like DuckTales.
338800	343800	Well, no matter where you live, Sega Master System games you are going to be able to get very soon.
343800	344800	It's really funny.
344800	346800	I actually, Sega popped in my mind.
346800	351800	When I was like, I don't even know how old I was, but my uncle, I had to go stay over at his house.
351800	353800	He's like, oh, and don't worry.
353800	359800	It's like at my house I've got a lot of cool stuff like Sega and Sonic.
359800	361800	I had no idea what the fuck that was.
361800	367800	And then he showed it to me and my mind blew up because I didn't know what to do with it.
367800	368800	It was crazy.
368800	373800	There was this little blue thing running in circles trying to get these little dancing ring things.
373800	377800	And my perspective on that was, Satan!
377800	379800	And here you are on this program now.
379800	380800	And here I am years later.
380800	381800	Life is funny.
381800	383800	It is pretty funny.
383800	384800	Life is funny.
384800	391800	That reminded me of that because he was so excited to tell me about that when my mom forbid me to play video games.
391800	393800	What is this, Satan?
393800	397800	Well, Japan will be the first country to get to indulge in the Sega Master System games.
397800	402800	But it's almost a certainty that other countries will be soon to follow.
402800	405800	Fist of the North Star will be the first game to come out for 600 points.
405800	407800	And then, Jamie, you'll like this.
407800	410800	Fantasy Zone will be coming out for 500 points, the original Master System version.
410800	411800	That would be pretty cool.
411800	412800	I have it.
412800	419800	A lot of early speculation that since the Game Gear pretty much ran off the same hardware as the Master System,
419800	422800	it's only a matter of time before Game Gear follows on the Virtual Console.
422800	424800	That is actually true.
424800	426800	They were the same pretty much.
426800	434800	Which is why a lot of the games that did come out on Game Gear had Master System releases in other countries.
434800	438800	And for the record, I have Fantasy Zone on Master System.
438800	439800	Well, look for those.
439800	441800	If you don't have Fantasy Zone, maybe you ought to check it out.
441800	443800	Look for those to come to Japan in February.
443800	446800	I'm sure other regions will only be a little ways behind.
446800	448800	I mean, it's not like we're talking about the MSX here.
448800	455800	You know, MSX is something the American and European audiences really don't know much about,
455800	458800	because all the games on the console were all in Japanese.
458800	460800	So we're probably never going to see that, unfortunately.
460800	461800	But that's the system.
461800	464800	They gave us Guardian Legend.
464800	467800	Well, Guardic and Metal Gear, the old-school Metal Gear.
467800	468800	Anyhow.
468800	470800	And the actual good sequel.
470800	472800	Instead of the one we got over here.
472800	474800	Snake's Revenge.
474800	477800	But anyhow, what other Virtual Console news do we have tonight?
477800	481800	Well, this one makes me relatively happy,
481800	487800	is that Super Street Fighter II is going to be on the Virtual Console in the UK.
487800	490800	Over on the PAL systems.
490800	498800	It's going to be 800 Wii points, which is £5.60 or €7.
498800	506800	And it's Ryu Ken, Gael Blanca, Zangief, Chun-Li, Honda, Dhalsim, Wu.
506800	508800	Most importantly, Kami.
508800	510800	And the new challengers, yes.
510800	513800	Kami, with her butt.
513800	515800	Unfortunately, it wasn't Kylie Minogue at that time.
515800	518800	But, you know, playing this can make you reminisce about Kylie Minogue.
518800	522800	She had camo legs so you couldn't see them.
522800	525800	Isn't that game out here in the US, Virtual Console?
525800	526800	I think it came out last week.
526800	527800	Did it? Cool.
527800	528800	Well, then there you go, Jamie.
528800	531800	If you're that excited, you can go grab it in the US, too, it sounds like.
531800	533800	But I have the original.
533800	535800	Oh, well then, la-di-da.
535800	537800	I'm waiting for the Xbox One, to be honest.
537800	540800	Like, why would I go buy this old one when there's going to be the new HD one?
540800	541800	That's going to be sexy.
541800	546800	When I moved out here, this is how big of a nerd I was.
546800	548800	I shipped out a whole bunch of my stuff.
548800	553800	But in my luggage, I brought my Super Nintendo and all my games with it.
553800	556800	And the first game that I had on the Super Nintendo that was mine
556800	561800	was one that my boyfriend at the time bought me, which was Super Street Fighter II.
561800	562800	Awesome.
562800	564800	And I still have the box, everything.
564800	565800	That's like my game.
565800	568800	And to this day, that remains a pretty great port.
568800	569800	Oh yeah, it was really good.
569800	574800	You know, Street Fighter Alpha 2 had loading in a cartridge.
574800	575800	And I thought that was hilarious.
575800	578800	I had Super Street Fighter II Turbo for the computer.
578800	581800	But the thing I remember about it on the PC is it had like remixed music.
581800	583800	And it was also the Red Book Audio.
583800	584800	You could put it in any CD player.
584800	585800	It was kind of cool.
585800	587800	Random tidbit.
587800	589800	So, moving on.
589800	595800	Anyways, there's some other good news coming from Japan about the Wii.
595800	598800	They've surpassed five million units sold.
598800	603800	Of course, you know, the Wii is the number one selling system in the world.
603800	609800	But, at least, well, the new generation of systems, it is the number one.
609800	613800	Of course, not in the U.S., but, you know, not for long.
613800	622800	Anyways, right now, they have sold, at least as of January 20th, five million, 19,337 units.
622800	627800	Which is not bad, seeing that it's been out for 14 months already.
627800	633800	In the U.S., their sales were 7.38 million as of the end of 2007.
633800	636800	So, doing pretty good.
636800	638800	Nice.
638800	640800	Not unsurprising, but nice.
640800	643800	I mean, we all knew Wiis were selling like crazy, no matter where you are.
643800	645800	So, there you have it.
645800	648800	One other thing that's only sure to sell more Wiis, more and more,
648800	653800	is the release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which, of course, we were talking about a little earlier.
653800	656800	Well, the demo kiosks are on their way to Japan.
656800	659800	In fact, if you look on YouTube, it's already there.
659800	667800	It was reported earlier this week that 30 shops throughout Japan were going to be getting kiosks with Super Smash Brothers Brawl on January 26th.
667800	670800	And, of course, that was yesterday.
670800	673800	So, some clips are already hitting YouTube.
673800	675800	So, pretty awesome.
675800	682800	So, it's only a matter of time before we find out all the secrets that the Smash Brothers dojo has yet to reveal.
682800	690800	And I did look at some of the YouTube clips, and I have to admit, the game looks a lot like Super Smash Brothers Melee,
690800	695800	which isn't to be surprised, but it definitely feels like it has that next level to it.
695800	696800	You know what I mean?
696800	698800	It definitely feels like the game is taken to the next level.
698800	706800	Actually, I've been kind of seeing the Subspace Emissary, or whatever it's called.
706800	709800	That looks really cool, as far as a side-scrolling thing.
709800	713800	And I think Nintendo should make a game, not necessarily like Brawl,
713800	718800	but just a side-scrolling, kind of a beat-em-up type of game with Nintendo characters.
718800	720800	I think that would be really awesome.
720800	726800	I can't wait to play that level that's the old-school Mario level that scrolls automatically while you're in it.
726800	727800	That's awesome.
727800	729800	The thing about this game that I think is going to make it a winner,
729800	732800	and I realize fanboys everywhere are peeing their pants over it.
732800	734800	I think it's the same reason why WarioWare.
734800	735800	It's variety.
735800	736800	Yeah.
736800	737800	It is variety.
737800	740800	The game sounds like, really, they have thought of everything.
740800	741800	Variety.
741800	742800	And that's value.
742800	743800	It is.
743800	744800	It really is.
744800	746800	You really feel like you're getting your money's worth, I think.
746800	750800	But then again, obviously, you have to withhold judgment until the game actually comes out.
750800	754800	But certainly the hype, they're doing a wonderful job.
754800	757800	Well, we'll see, right?
757800	758800	We will soon see.
758800	764800	Well, for our friends who are fortunate enough to have a Wii right now,
764800	770800	it's been said that Okami Wii will be out in the UK, actually, by the summer.
770800	774800	We're getting our version over here on 25th March.
774800	777800	But there's not a specific date stated for the UK.
777800	780800	But it will be coming out.
780800	783800	That's pretty cool.
783800	787800	I'm glad to see it's making its way out, finally.
787800	791800	And there's, you know, just real quick, I want to say about Okami real quick.
791800	797800	I actually kind of missed it in the PS2, because when it came out, I was too busy with,
797800	800800	ooh, Xbox, you know, I was too busy with all that,
800800	805800	as I think a lot of the late-gen games from the PS2 were kind of like that.
805800	809800	So I'm kind of looking forward to being able to give this a real shot on the Wii,
809800	810800	and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.
810800	811800	So I'm glad to hear it's on its way.
811800	814800	I'd like to see what they've done for controls on it.
814800	815800	Me too.
815800	820800	From what I hear, it's not really changed that much from the PS2 version.
820800	821800	What, no Waggle?
821800	825800	Well, they're going to have Waggle in there, but it's pretty much a straight port.
825800	826800	Don't expect anything additional to it.
826800	827800	Alright, alright.
827800	830800	I did hear there's widescreen support, though, which is pretty awesome.
830800	832800	I'm sold.
832800	840800	There's a new handheld MP4 player capable of running old-school Nintendo emulators,
840800	844800	and it's powered by the sun, using solar power.
844800	852800	It can also play MP3s, store ebooks, and records audio, and of course displays images,
852800	855800	all for $123.32.
855800	859800	The cool part, though, is it also has a USB port to connect to other portable devices
859800	864800	to share the solar energy it has collected, so you can power your other devices with it.
864800	871800	But it's kind of funny, though, because the whole thing looks very similar to the original Game Boy Advance.
871800	878800	So, I don't know, one of those things that you probably only see in Korea or something like that.
878800	880800	If nothing else, though, it makes for a great headline, you know?
880800	883800	Console powered by sun!
883800	887800	But then how do I play late at night?
887800	888800	That's the bummer.
888800	891800	What was it, that one game member?
891800	893800	I have to go outside to play a game?
893800	894800	This makes no sense.
894800	898800	There was that one game that came out on the Game Boy Advance, and I know, I can't remember the title.
898800	899800	A Boktai!
899800	902800	But the problem with the original Game Boy Advance is when you play it out in the sun,
902800	907800	you can't see it, because it's not backlit, and it made it hard to see.
907800	911800	So, not a good plan, unfortunately.
911800	912800	Yeah, I was not a big Boktai fan.
912800	915800	The one that came out after that, which I can't...
915800	919800	Oh, it was kind of like a sequel, but it was on the DS.
919800	922800	Damn it, I can't remember, but they kind of took the sun part out of it,
922800	926800	but it was still an element of the game, but you could just hit a button to charge it.
926800	928800	Yeah, it was something that Hideo Kojima did.
928800	929800	It was like a sequel.
929800	930800	It was on the DS.
930800	931800	I can't remember the name.
931800	933800	I'm sure someone in chat will save me.
933800	935800	Solar Knights, was that it?
935800	936800	Probably.
936800	941800	Anyhow, another game making its way, another port.
941800	946800	Nintendo DS is getting a version of Guitar Hero.
946800	951800	That's right, you're going to soon be able to play Guitar Hero on the go on the DS,
951800	953800	but it might not be what you think.
953800	959800	Activision has filed a trademark for a game called Guitar Hero on Tour,
959800	963800	and of course some news that spilled earlier this week from a French website
963800	966800	that Guitar Hero on Tour was on the way to Nintendo DS eventually,
966800	968800	so who knows what this game could be.
968800	970800	Probably a spin-off game.
970800	973800	I would imagine there's not going to be a little guitar controller you actually plug in.
973800	974800	Actually, I think there will be.
974800	976800	Really? That's going to be weird.
976800	978800	Because here's how they're going to probably do it.
978800	981800	They're going to have an attachment that plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot,
981800	984800	and there you go, you can have your additional buttons like that.
984800	986800	I was going to assume maybe it was a tapping game,
986800	988800	kind of like Elite Beat Agents,
988800	990800	but you have the guitar on the lower screen or something,
990800	992800	you can tap the beats or something, does that make sense?
992800	996800	I guess it makes sense, but I think that they're actually going to have it where you play the guitar.
996800	1000800	The only thing I would think about, though, is if they did have it where you play the guitar like that,
1000800	1003800	there's no real easy way to see the screen and play the guitar.
1003800	1005800	Well, actually, no, I take that back,
1005800	1009800	because you can hold it in your hand so that you look at the top screen
1009800	1015800	and use your left hand to hit all the keys and stuff.
1015800	1016800	It could work.
1016800	1018800	It's a weird idea, but it could work.
1018800	1022800	But if it does come out, it'll be probably selling quite a bit.
1022800	1027800	Yeah, and regardless, we all know this is just a way to further milk a franchise that is prime.
1027800	1028800	It's not quite dead yet.
1028800	1030800	The hot thing right now, right?
1030800	1032800	Jamie, I know you play a lot of games on the DS.
1032800	1035800	Is Guitar Hero something you'd want to play on the DS?
1035800	1038800	I'd try it out, but otherwise, probably not.
1038800	1040800	It would be a nice diversion for a quick moment.
1040800	1041800	I have Rock Band.
1041800	1043800	True, true.
1043800	1046800	By the way, oh, I totally forgot to say this during my gaming week,
1046800	1050800	but how could I forget, like, Thursday, you know what I did?
1050800	1057800	I ran home, I powered on the Xbox, I put in Guitar Hero 3, and I downloaded me some Journey.
1057800	1059800	And it was awesome.
1059800	1060800	I just wanted to get that out there.
1060800	1062800	We were listening to the demo on that.
1062800	1064800	Oh, it was so hot.
1064800	1065800	I downloaded it, I didn't care.
1065800	1066800	I just wanted Journey.
1066800	1068800	Journey in Guitar Hero makes me happy.
1068800	1070800	Anyhow, you know what else makes me happy?
1070800	1072800	It's hearing from you guys, our listeners.
1072800	1075800	Every week, you guys send us e-mails at mailbag at orangelandrady.com,
1075800	1078800	and we pull a few of our favorites to read here on air.
1078800	1080800	Remember, if you want to be included in this segment,
1080800	1082800	mailbag at orangelandrady.com.
1082800	1085800	So Dark Sakura is going to reach in the mailbag and pull out a few e-mails,
1085800	1090800	of which I understand there weren't a whole lot this week, but some.
1090800	1091800	There were some.
1091800	1095800	One of them is not going to be read because, honestly, it's worthless.
1095800	1097800	Oh, snap.
1097800	1102800	Because clearly if said person had been listening to the entirety of the thing,
1102800	1104800	they wouldn't have taken it completely out of context.
1104800	1110800	So therefore, addressing lucky nuts,
1110800	1115800	which just instantly indicates the quality of the person listening to this,
1115800	1118800	fuck you.
1118800	1122800	And I mean that with none of the respect that you intended as well.
1122800	1124800	I didn't even see this e-mail.
1124800	1125800	I'm going to have to check it out.
1125800	1128800	What was the comment about how I said I would be interested in physics
1128800	1129800	if not for the math?
1129800	1135800	You can be interested in a topic and not actually care to do anything with it.
1135800	1137800	Fucking moron.
1137800	1139800	Was it tongue-in-cheek or what?
1139800	1140800	I don't think so.
1140800	1141800	Interesting.
1141800	1142800	All right, whatever.
1142800	1149800	Anyway, DidYouLoseASock wrote in and sent a link to StarTropics Wii decoder.
1149800	1155800	It was on YouTube because we are broadcasting, I don't know, it's 22 seconds,
1155800	1157800	but I'll link it in the chatroom.
1157800	1161800	Apparently this is how it's supposed to work in StarTropics.
1161800	1163800	Do we have more music?
1163800	1165800	No, that's the end of that music.
1165800	1166800	Oh.
1166800	1167800	Sorry.
1167800	1169800	But I did watch the video earlier this week.
1169800	1171800	I can kind of describe it for our listeners.
1171800	1173800	It's pretty rad.
1173800	1177800	Inside the manual, you know how when you download games on Virtual Console,
1177800	1178800	you have the manual?
1178800	1181800	Well, what's cool is that they actually included a little hyperlink
1181800	1184800	where it says in the story, you got a letter,
1184800	1187800	and when you click on a letter, it actually brings up the original letter,
1187800	1192800	the text, and then there's this little animation of the letter being dipped in water
1192800	1195800	and then it says code, frequency 747.
1195800	1196800	So they did include it.
1196800	1198800	We were kind of wondering how are they going to get the letter in there,
1198800	1199800	and it is in there.
1199800	1201800	You just have to dig through the manual a little bit, but the code is there.
1201800	1204800	Sorry if I spoiled the code for anyone playing the game.
1204800	1205800	It's pretty neat.
1205800	1206800	That is pretty cool.
1206800	1208800	I think that's very intelligently done, I should say.
1208800	1210800	It was a cute way to get around it.
1210800	1213800	I'll check out the video in just a sec.
1213800	1216800	Also, we have an e-mail from Silver Chaos.
1216800	1219800	Last week, as of when I'm writing this,
1219800	1221800	you all were talking about the dusty PS3 with Ranma.
1221800	1223800	Sorry if I felt it wrong.
1223800	1226800	Yeah, you did, but I won't point it out.
1226800	1229800	And he brought up the fact that it might have been a setup.
1229800	1231800	You were all discussing who might have done it,
1231800	1233800	mentioning Microsoft and Nintendo as possibilities,
1233800	1235800	but you missed the most obvious answer,
1235800	1237800	and I'm surprised no one in chat mentioned this,
1237800	1239800	the makers of Dustcat 3.
1239800	1241800	If you people thought that Dust is this big problem,
1241800	1245800	they would rush out and purchase one to protect their beloved PS3s.
1245800	1249800	Thanks for reading this in need of a new screen name, Silver Chaos.
1249800	1250800	I like your screen name.
1250800	1253800	I think it's kind of cool.
1253800	1254800	All righty.
1254800	1257800	Is this supposed to be Lucky Nuts?
1257800	1260800	Lucky Nuts is clearly not all that lucky.
1260800	1266800	The hate is spewing out of the mailbag this week.
1266800	1267800	Ranma.
1267800	1269800	They can hate on me. I can hate back.
1269800	1270800	All right.
1270800	1273800	I am a PMSing female, goddammit.
1273800	1275800	Do we have a happy email we can read?
1275800	1276800	Yes.
1276800	1277800	Okay.
1277800	1281800	Robert M., our good buddy, went to Video Games Live,
1281800	1283800	so I'm going to read this.
1283800	1286800	Well, I paid to see Video Games Live at Fox Theater in St. Louis
1286800	1288800	and enjoyed the experience.
1288800	1292800	A few minor FUs presented as wishes, such as it is.
1292800	1296800	One, wish the mid-balcony seats weren't high enough to obscure the top part
1296800	1298800	of the video screen behind the lighting structure,
1298800	1301800	had I known that I would have paid more for the lower-level seating.
1301800	1304800	Two, wish I had been in these lower-level seating at least
1304800	1307800	to get better connections with other DS players.
1307800	1309800	My attempts to start four-player Pac-Man versus matches
1309800	1311800	ended in connection failures.
1311800	1313800	Fun to connect with that many gamers, though.
1313800	1316800	Three, I almost wish the Zelda section had featured more music
1316800	1318800	than the iconic overworld theme,
1318800	1322800	something more along the lines of their medley of music from the Sonic games.
1322800	1325800	And finally, one major FU, well, absolutely not really,
1325800	1329800	ending the show with one-winged angel.
1329800	1332800	Enjoyable experience overall, part of me wish it had been longer,
1332800	1335800	you know, than the three hours it ran, plus pre-show and intermission.
1335800	1338800	He also sent another email.
1338800	1341800	Oh, just about to add one more,
1341800	1343800	because he couldn't go to the chat room for some reason.
1343800	1348800	He sent me to Square Enix for not allowing use of their video in the show.
1348800	1350800	Yeah, that makes sense.
1350800	1351800	Last email.
1351800	1352800	You know why?
1352800	1355800	I think it's because they have something to do.
1355800	1356800	Don't quote me on this,
1356800	1359800	but I think they have something to do with the competing show, Play,
1359800	1361800	because Play is a derivative of Dear Friends.
1361800	1363800	It's put on by the same production company.
1363800	1365800	So, something to think about.
1365800	1367800	And GS68 says he went to play in San Jose,
1367800	1369800	which I had no idea it was even going to be in San Jose
1369800	1370800	or I might have gone.
1370800	1372800	That's like two hours away.
1372800	1373800	Yeah.
1373800	1375800	For a good concert, I'll drive that.
1375800	1376800	You know what I mean?
1376800	1377800	Oh, yeah.
1377800	1380800	I drive that far just to see one person.
1380800	1383800	Hey, I drove to the San Jose HP Pavilion,
1383800	1385800	or whatever it's called, to see the Spice Girls.
1385800	1389800	Worth every dollar of gas it took me.
1389800	1390800	Yeah.
1390800	1391800	Alright, anyhow.
1391800	1393800	So, anyway, he says he went to play in San Jose GS68
1393800	1395800	and says there were so many people in PictoChat
1395800	1398800	that people were actually using Room B.
1398800	1399800	Wow.
1399800	1400800	You don't see that.
1400800	1401800	Anyway, sorry.
1401800	1404800	Well, I remember doing PictoChat at E3 a couple years ago
1404800	1406800	and realized that one of the people I was talking to
1406800	1408800	was Melody.
1408800	1410800	We were in the Nintendogs line.
1410800	1411800	That's great.
1411800	1412800	Yeah.
1412800	1414800	Anyway, this last one says,
1414800	1415800	Hi, OLR.
1415800	1418800	It's officially a year I've been listening to your show.
1418800	1420800	You rock and keep up the good work.
1420800	1422800	I listen to OLR on my iPod to keep my sanity
1422800	1423800	while I do homework.
1423800	1426800	And then when I run out of recent episodes to listen to,
1426800	1428800	I tune into your radio station and listen to the music.
1428800	1429800	Great job on everything.
1429800	1431800	And you have taught me important lessons.
1431800	1433800	After the band, I feel like I'm less immature.
1433800	1436800	Now, is DDR dead?
1436800	1439800	I don't seem to see much DDR action anymore.
1439800	1440800	And when I used to play DDR,
1440800	1442800	I'd get people to stop and watch me play.
1442800	1444800	Now, people really don't care
1444800	1446800	if someone's triple A-ing Mac songs.
1446800	1448800	Also, how do I deal with a kid at school
1448800	1449800	who thinks I'm a nerd,
1449800	1451800	yet he devoted all of his time and money
1451800	1453800	to do World of Warcraft?
1453800	1456800	Can I use the fact he plays World of Warcraft against him
1456800	1457800	and was...
1457800	1458800	Thank you, Chris.
1458800	1459800	Can you hear me?
1459800	1460800	She said yes.
1460800	1463800	And was it a mistake using my $100 Dell gift card
1463800	1465800	towards buying a widescreen computer monitor
1465800	1467800	instead of buying an Xbox 360 with it?
1467800	1469800	Too many questions, I know.
1469800	1470800	This is from Sakura Max.
1470800	1471800	I like her.
1473800	1475800	Can I say this about DDR is dead?
1475800	1478800	We kind of got into this in a previous episode.
1478800	1480800	Let me try to phrase this best I can.
1480800	1482800	No, DDR is not dead.
1482800	1485800	But DDR has evolved,
1485800	1488800	and it hasn't evolved in the way I think
1488800	1491800	most of us hardcore fans that grew up with DDR
1491800	1492800	wanted it to.
1492800	1493800	It didn't evolve for us.
1493800	1495800	It evolved to where the money's at,
1495800	1496800	which you can't blame them for doing.
1496800	1497800	That's what they want to do.
1497800	1499800	But when you look at the mixes,
1499800	1502800	Disney Channel, plug into your TV,
1502800	1504800	my first DDR.
1504800	1507800	DDR is kind of geared towards 12-year-old girls
1507800	1508800	and their slumber parties,
1508800	1510800	which, again, that's where the money's at.
1510800	1512800	It's disappointing because you would think
1512800	1515800	that there's two distinctly different audiences,
1515800	1519800	the 12-year-old girls and the anime convention-going people
1519800	1523800	that kind of helped foster DDR in the first place.
1523800	1525800	You would think we would get a new mix
1525800	1526800	that caters to us a little bit,
1526800	1528800	and I suppose you could say Supernova 2 is that,
1528800	1531800	but is it really anything new?
1531800	1532800	No.
1532800	1534800	I always kind of said they needed to let the people
1534800	1536800	responsible for the Xbox versions of DDR
1536800	1538800	develop the next arcade mix
1538800	1541800	because the last time we ever saw any true innovation
1541800	1543800	out of DDR was all done on the Xbox versions,
1543800	1546800	good and bad, but at least it was innovation.
1546800	1548800	That's all I'm really going to say about DDR.
1548800	1549800	Can I finish reading the e-mail?
1549800	1550800	Sorry, yes, you may.
1550800	1553800	Well, I'm going to give my...
1553800	1554800	Well, you know, with inflation,
1554800	1556800	I guess it's $5 worth.
1556800	1557800	Um...
1557800	1563800	Are you really that incredibly amusing?
1563800	1565800	Okay.
1565800	1566800	I made Chris laugh.
1566800	1568800	That was great.
1568800	1570800	Remember when we threw you into the fire
1570800	1572800	and pretended that we were going to kill you?
1572800	1573800	I thought somebody was going to be reading an e-mail.
1573800	1575800	Oh, yeah, okay, fine.
1575800	1576800	Okay.
1576800	1577800	Yes, you can use the fact
1577800	1579800	that that guy plays World of Warcraft against him,
1579800	1581800	and I actually...
1581800	1583800	If I had an option of getting a monitor
1583800	1585800	or an Xbox 360 right now, I'd get a monitor,
1585800	1589800	but then again, I already have an Xbox 360.
1589800	1590800	So, um...
1590800	1593800	And he assigns this kid who likes Toho music
1593800	1596800	on OLR station MMOs and Crysis,
1596800	1599800	and there's a PS on here that is addressed to Loki.
1599800	1603800	Loki, if you haven't yet, go on crymod.com.
1603800	1606800	It has a bunch of Crysis mods and maps.
1606800	1607800	Download the...
1607800	1609800	I guess Physis?
1609800	1613800	It's P-H-Y-S-I-S 3 map.
1613800	1615800	It has random contractions
1615800	1619800	that showcase the physics engines of Crysis.
1619800	1620800	I'll try that.
1620800	1623800	Actually, I finally got my second graphics card in
1623800	1625800	and running in SLI,
1625800	1630800	and it's tough because overclocking one graphics card's easy.
1630800	1632800	Overclocking two graphics cards is not easy
1632800	1634800	because you actually have to flash them.
1634800	1637800	So, I've been playing around with that a little bit,
1637800	1639800	trying to get it stable,
1639800	1641800	and benchmarks now.
1641800	1646800	I got 17,000-something in 3 Mark 06,
1646800	1649800	which is supposedly pretty good,
1649800	1653800	but I have to try Crysis yet with my cards in SLI.
1653800	1656800	He offers another description for that particular mod.
1656800	1657800	It says,
1657800	1661800	You get to play bowling with a barrel with Korean soldiers as pins.
1661800	1663800	I've seen videos of that. It's funny.
1663800	1666800	Drop weights on a wedge to make a truck go flying, and much more.
1666800	1668800	And that's the last email.
1668800	1670800	I'll have to try it.
1670800	1672800	Let me say a comment here from chat real quick
1672800	1674800	regarding the whole DDR thing we were talking about a minute ago.
1674800	1676800	RossdielUT says,
1676800	1677800	in chat.orangetownstrator.com,
1677800	1680800	Rob, there's clearly not as much money for DDR
1680800	1683800	as there is for SingStar, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band.
1683800	1685800	And you know, I hate to say it,
1685800	1688800	because I do love Konami and all that stuff,
1688800	1691800	and they really did start a revolution, no pun intended.
1691800	1693800	But the more I think about it,
1693800	1696800	the more I really want Harmonix to do a dance game.
1696800	1699800	Like, I really want them to make a dance game
1699800	1703800	that would use a similar DDR mat to what we've already bought.
1703800	1707800	That would make me very happy for Harmonix to develop something like that,
1707800	1711800	because honestly, I think Harmonix gets American audiences
1711800	1714800	in a way Konami just never did,
1714800	1716800	or when they did, they were never noticed.
1716800	1718800	Because I think the Xbox versions of DDR were great,
1718800	1724800	but even then, it didn't ever take DDR to the next, next level.
1724800	1727800	And I don't know, I think Harmonix would just kind of start from scratch.
1727800	1728800	I mean, they would have to.
1728800	1730800	And I think DDR has needed that for a while.
1730800	1733800	I think there needs to be a DDR mix that starts from scratch.
1733800	1735800	You know, say Konami will sue all you want,
1735800	1742800	but if Harmonix was able to innovate guitar freaks
1742800	1744800	in a way that the game feels completely different,
1744800	1746800	I'm sure the same can be done for a dance game.
1746800	1750800	So, I don't know if we have any people from Harmonix that listen to this program,
1750800	1752800	but if we do, please be a known.
1752800	1755800	I would like you to make a dance game for me, please?
1755800	1759800	Or I would like, you know, I wouldn't mind if Konami would reinvent,
1759800	1762800	but if Konami is going to make a new one, they need to start over from scratch.
1762800	1765800	Throw out all the old code, we are starting over, mean it.
1765800	1767800	Throw out all your old code and start again.
1767800	1769800	I'm serious.
1769800	1771800	Anyhow, sorry.
1771800	1773800	We can get back to gaming news now.
1773800	1774800	Can we?
1774800	1775800	Yes, sorry.
1775800	1779800	Okay.
1779800	1787800	Well, this is a weird bit of news, but apparently the Gizmondo is coming back.
1787800	1788800	What?
1788800	1795800	Yes, apparently they had a Gizmondo teaser site stating that the legend is reborn
1795800	1802800	and exciting physic worlds and some other stuff,
1802800	1808800	but apparently it will be back according to, at least in some form,
1808800	1811800	Plextech technical director, Ian Murphy,
1811800	1815800	insists that the product has been recovered from liquidators
1815800	1822800	and Plextech is bringing it back to the market.
1822800	1823800	Okay.
1823800	1829800	Now, some folks are asking in chat, wasn't this then retracted a little later?
1829800	1831800	Was this story ended up being retracted?
1831800	1833800	It might have been, I don't know.
1833800	1835800	I'm not sure if it's been retracted or not.
1835800	1838800	At least this article didn't really say that,
1838800	1846800	but he basically said that the device's second coming is happening as soon as May 2008.
1846800	1848800	But, I don't know.
1848800	1850800	To be honest, if it was retracted, great,
1850800	1853800	because I don't think it was too good to begin with.
1853800	1854800	All right.
1854800	1858800	Well, this is not being retracted, and actually I think this is kind of cool.
1858800	1861800	I did not realize this franchise was set to make a comeback.
1861800	1863800	It's a game called Populous.
1863800	1864800	I don't know if you guys ever played this.
1864800	1865800	I remember that.
1865800	1867800	Yeah, it was on Super Nintendo, but it was more of a computer game.
1867800	1869800	I think it's more best remembered as a computer game.
1869800	1872800	Well, it's going to have a resurgence on the DS,
1872800	1874800	and Electronic Arts is bringing Populous out for the DS.
1874800	1876800	But here's what's really cool.
1876800	1879800	One thing about Populous was that basically the game had,
1879800	1881800	I would call it different skins.
1881800	1883800	There were many different skins the game had,
1883800	1887800	and you would build these cities that were human cities or Martian cities,
1887800	1889800	or it was more like, I shouldn't say human cities.
1889800	1893800	It was like a medieval city or a new age city or what have you.
1893800	1896800	But this is really cool, and the DS version of Populous,
1896800	1898800	a new type of skin is going to be added.
1898800	1900800	It's a Nintendo civilization.
1900800	1901800	That's right.
1901800	1904800	The small cities start off as a little Game & Watch system.
1904800	1906800	Then they grow into NESs.
1906800	1908800	Then they grow into Game Boys,
1908800	1912800	which grow into Super Nintendos and DSs and so on,
1912800	1916800	until the Supreme Nintendo Wii won.
1916800	1917800	However, I would like to point out,
1917800	1921800	I noticed a distinct lack of Virtual Boy in the civilization.
1921800	1922800	What's up with that?
1922800	1924800	Are you just trying to pretend it never existed?
1924800	1925800	Maybe.
1925800	1928800	I was going to say that as far as the Gizmondo story,
1928800	1931800	the story was retracted at one time,
1931800	1934800	then the retraction was retracted, so it is coming.
1934800	1935800	What?
1935800	1937800	What does that even mean, the retraction was retracted?
1937800	1938800	The first retraction was a mistake.
1938800	1940800	Make up your goddamn mind.
1940800	1942800	No, the first retraction was a mistake.
1942800	1943800	It is actually coming.
1943800	1945800	Scary enough.
1945800	1950800	DM ends in chat and trying to make a joke about OLRs
1950800	1953800	that you can evolve your crappy guys on a show to a Sunday show,
1953800	1954800	like there should be an OLR skin.
1954800	1956800	Actually, I think that's kind of a cool idea,
1956800	1958800	not so much what you're suggesting,
1958800	1961800	but a version of Populous where you can make your own skins.
1961800	1962800	That would be kind of fun.
1962800	1966800	A little silly, but fun.
1966800	1969800	I am definitely looking forward to Populous DS.
1969800	1972800	That will be a good chance to revisit a series I haven't played in a long time.
1972800	1975800	Well, I'm glad you'll have that opportunity.
1975800	1979800	For people who like games on their iPod,
1979800	1983800	Pole Position is coming out to iPod.
1983800	1986800	So Namco is releasing Pole Position Remix.
1986800	1988800	It's available through iTunes.
1988800	1992800	And you drive with the iPod wheel.
1992800	1997800	So I hope that it comes out okay,
1997800	2000800	but they're actually saying that it's the worst of all iPod games that are available now.
2000800	2001800	Don't.
2001800	2004800	But another reviewer said that it's the best one out.
2004800	2006800	It's five bucks.
2006800	2008800	If you've got five bucks, you know,
2008800	2011800	and don't have to spend it on kitty litter, give it a try.
2011800	2013800	Or worse, or better.
2013800	2015800	You know, it makes sense though,
2015800	2017800	a driving game with the iPod wheel.
2017800	2020800	I mean, it is kind of a logical step,
2020800	2022800	so I would think it would be okay.
2022800	2025800	But then again, Pole Position is a little bit,
2025800	2027800	I don't know, old?
2027800	2030800	Pole Position is definitely one of those games
2030800	2034800	that was way cooler when you were playing it at Chuck E. Cheese when you were six, right?
2034800	2036800	Like, you go back and play it now, you're like...
2036800	2038800	I had a Pole Position cabinet in my house for a long time.
2038800	2040800	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
2040800	2043800	It had a name in it, and we had, actually, Dan found an identical one.
2043800	2045800	That's right, you had a stand-up cabinet for Pole Position.
2045800	2046800	We had a stand-up cabinet.
2046800	2049800	I remember Chuck E. Cheese, they had the sit in the thing Pole Position.
2049800	2050800	Oh, those were great!
2050800	2052800	Those were awesome, but like, it was better when you were six.
2052800	2054800	Remember Hard Drivin'?
2054800	2055800	That sucked.
2055800	2056800	Hard Drivin', no.
2056800	2058800	Hard Drivin' was good because I worked at a Namco arcade
2058800	2060800	when I was out of high school,
2060800	2062800	and one day I was there and we had no customers
2062800	2064800	and I'd been up all night and I took a nap and won.
2064800	2065800	There was a...
2065800	2066800	They were dark.
2066800	2068800	There was a game that was on the PC that was very similar to Hard Drivin'.
2068800	2071800	It was called Stunts, and you made your own stunt tracks,
2071800	2074800	but the graphics were pretty much the same as Hard Drivin'.
2074800	2077800	It was great, though, because if you made a bunch of little 45-degree ramps...
2077800	2079800	There was stunt drivin', too.
2079800	2083800	Yeah, it was similar to that, but if you made a bunch of 45-degree ramps
2083800	2088800	and just drove on it really fast, your car would get up to like 500 miles an hour
2088800	2090800	and it would fly into the air like a tornado.
2090800	2091800	It was awesome.
2091800	2094800	If you think about it, games like Burnout,
2094800	2097800	you can trace their roots back to Hard Drivin'.
2097800	2101800	I remember playing Test Drive 3 on the PC with the really crappy graphics.
2101800	2105800	Hey, screw you, I had Test Drive on the Commodore 64.
2105800	2107800	Well, this might as well have been on the Commodore 64
2107800	2110800	because the graphics were crap, but it was fun.
2110800	2112800	I used to drive and run over chickens in that.
2112800	2115800	Hey, when I was eight, Test Drive had like the best graphics ever.
2115800	2117800	What are you talking about?
2117800	2124800	Well, this game may not be as good of an idea
2124800	2129800	as, say, you know, Pole Position on the iPod,
2129800	2134800	but there is a fan made, and I don't even know where this came from
2134800	2136800	because I think it was a joke at one time,
2136800	2139800	or they had a demo for it a while back,
2139800	2144800	but it's Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.
2144800	2150800	It's a fan made game made with RPG Maker,
2150800	2157800	and it basically tells an epic story of post-Cyberpocalypse,
2157800	2162800	Neo-New York, in the wake of the great b-ball purge of 2041
2162800	2167800	that threatens to own the entirety of your existence for some time.
2167800	2171800	Well, they actually have a bunch of weird stuff in there.
2171800	2172800	It's cool, though.
2172800	2175800	It's basically an RPG, and you have like your basketball moves you do
2175800	2177800	and little mini games and stuff.
2177800	2180800	It is free to download, and free is the magic word, of course.
2180800	2183800	Free is a good price for this story,
2183800	2187800	and if you're interested, there's...
2187800	2189800	I'm sure you can find it out there.
2189800	2191800	There are a bunch of different links and stuff hosting it.
2191800	2196800	The website that actually has the info is from a gaming forum.
2196800	2201800	It looks like gamingw.net, and just check their forums.
2201800	2206800	They've got the full game from Tales of Games Studios.
2206800	2209800	It presents Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.
2209800	2210800	Wow.
2211800	2213800	Okay, well if you want to play a real RPG,
2213800	2216800	might I suggest World of Warcraft?
2216800	2219800	Obviously, there's going to be people who want to argue with me on that point,
2219800	2221800	but you can argue this.
2221800	2223800	There's definitely a shitload of people playing World of Warcraft.
2223800	2225800	You want to know how much is a shitload?
2225800	2226800	It's 10 million.
2226800	2228800	That's right, it's been announced this week
2228800	2231800	that World of Warcraft now has 10 million subscribers.
2231800	2235800	Now, they're counting people who are still in their free trials and stuff,
2235800	2239800	but whatever, there's 10 million people playing World of Warcraft right now.
2239800	2243800	To put that in perspective, and a lot of sites have been putting it this way,
2243800	2246800	that's half the size of Australia,
2246800	2249800	because Australia's population is like 20 million.
2249800	2253800	Now, granted, you have to think about Australia is mostly desert in the middle,
2253800	2255800	in the outback.
2255800	2257800	Most of the people kind of live on the coast, but whatever.
2257800	2259800	It's still a pretty staggering number there.
2259800	2260800	Chris, I know you missed that.
2260800	2264800	10 million subscribers in World of Warcraft announced this week.
2264800	2266800	That's a lot.
2266800	2268800	That's not surprising.
2268800	2272800	And they all live in China, which is amazing.
2272800	2273800	Actually, no, that's no joke.
2273800	2276800	Actually, there are 5.5 million of those.
2276800	2278800	Over half of those subscribers are in Asia.
2278800	2280800	So not just China, but the Asian region.
2280800	2285800	2.5 here in North America and 2 million subscribers in Europe.
2285800	2286800	That's pretty impressive.
2286800	2288800	Yeah, well, some of those people from North America are kind of-
2288800	2289800	Wait, I'm sorry, Chris. And a mic? What?
2289800	2291800	Oh, never mind. I didn't see you.
2291800	2292800	I didn't see you. Stole one.
2292800	2293800	Yeah, I stole it.
2293800	2296800	Some of those people in America are not that bright.
2296800	2299800	Like, I surf the forums.
2299800	2303800	I'm not active on the forums because I just can't deal with it.
2303800	2307800	Oh, yeah. World of Warcraft forums, home of some serious lulz.
2307800	2308800	Yeah.
2308800	2309800	Serious lulz.
2309800	2310800	Best one today.
2310800	2318800	Server crash was deliberate hack by horde.
2318800	2320800	Oh, noes. The horde crashed by server.
2320800	2322800	And the funny thing is this wasn't a joke.
2322800	2325800	This chick at- or it could be a guy. I don't know.
2325800	2326800	This person actually-
2326800	2328800	Wait, is it a blood elf female?
2328800	2329800	Yes.
2329800	2330800	It's a guy.
2330800	2332800	Okay. This person- it's a level 7, too.
2332800	2336800	This person actually, like, was damn serious and everyone was, like, going,
2336800	2340800	oh, lulz broke the internet. What is it? The horde insert-
2340800	2344800	kills you and your internet. That's right. Your internet is under attack.
2344800	2348800	You know, so everyone- this person's, like, sitting there defending himself.
2348800	2349800	It's, like, no, no, no, I'm serious.
2349800	2352800	And, you know, they've got a reason for it, but it's just, like,
2352800	2356800	the horde is not after your fucking server.
2356800	2359800	ColorOfSakura says in chat.orensonsradio.com,
2359800	2363800	WoWForums is like the Gaia of gaming forums.
2363800	2364800	Oh, God, I know.
2364800	2368800	I have never seen it so, like, plainly put, but that is a very good point.
2368800	2374800	Alright, let's move on from the internet lulz to something a little more newsworthy.
2374800	2378800	Well, for-
2378800	2384800	It says for PlayStation 2 release in March, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters
2384800	2390800	will be coming from PSP to the PS2.
2390800	2396800	And also mentioned is-
2396800	2401800	Well, I'm trying to- I thought there was another game mentioned in this.
2401800	2404800	Is it not loading?
2404800	2409800	Well, given that it's, you know, completely crashed my browser before.
2409800	2412800	Don't-
2412800	2415800	Well, Silent Hill Origins is the other game.
2415800	2418800	Well, yeah, Silent Hill Origins. Well, we had already talked about that.
2418800	2422800	It wasn't particularly mentioned here.
2422800	2427800	But basically Ratchet and Clank Size Matters was officially announced on Sony's site.
2427800	2432800	So what basically- both these games that, like, everybody kinda knew was coming,
2432800	2435800	but like nobody wanted to announce, finally they're like,
2435800	2439800	oh yeah, since the entire internet found out, you know, the horde ruined it for everybody,
2439800	2442800	these games are coming up.
2442800	2444800	Surprise, I'm sure you're shocked.
2444800	2449800	I don't know about you, Jamie, but I'm actually excited about Silent Hill Zero on the PlayStation 2.
2449800	2450800	Well, hell yeah.
2450800	2453800	Because, like, Silent Hill wasn't really a game I wanted to play on the PSP, you know what I mean?
2453800	2454800	Yeah.
2454800	2457800	Like, I was actually thinking of getting a light just so I could hook it up to the TV.
2457800	2460800	Because Silent Hill's a scary game, you know, the little screen's not that scary.
2460800	2461800	I like scary.
2461800	2462800	I like scary too.
2462800	2468800	I like the kind of scary that fucks with your head.
2468800	2473800	Well, if Silent Hill isn't your cup of tea, then maybe some old Sega arcade games are.
2473800	2478800	Apparently the Niomi BIOS has been cracked and now will be...
2478800	2479800	Finally?
2479800	2480800	Yeah, finally.
2480800	2483800	Ah, that means Planet Harrier.
2483800	2490800	Now that means that this brand new emulator, well actually it's an emulator for the Dreamcast,
2490800	2499800	will be able to run wonderful games such as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Ferrari, F355 Challenge, and Ikaruga.
2499800	2500800	Planet Harrier.
2500800	2502800	Also known as the good stuff.
2502800	2503800	Planet Harrier.
2503800	2508800	Yes, so the Niomi games are going to be coming soon.
2508800	2509800	Awesome.
2509800	2512800	More news as soon as we get some.
2512800	2513800	Nice.
2513800	2517800	Well, I want to go back to World of Warcraft for a minute, but not to talk about some internet
2517800	2518800	lols.
2518800	2521800	I actually want to talk about something kind of a little bit sad.
2521800	2523800	It has to do with a Virginia Tech student.
2523800	2527800	This is not related to the tragedy that happened last year, but it was just another unfortunate
2527800	2528800	tragedy.
2528800	2533800	There was a student there, a 21 year old senior named Daniel Kim who actually killed himself
2533800	2535800	in a target parking lot in Virginia.
2535800	2539800	And of course, what was the first thing that was blamed in the death?
2539800	2540800	Gaming.
2540800	2541800	Video games.
2541800	2542800	It was the Horde!
2542800	2543800	Individuals...
2543800	2545800	Not okay.
2545800	2549800	Individuals were automatically making assumptions about his death.
2549800	2554800	But this writer here at Filefront.com who ran this article did a little research and
2554800	2560800	found out that actually one of the things that this person really liked and enjoyed
2560800	2562800	in life was World of Warcraft.
2562800	2566800	He developed a lot of friendships in the game over the past couple years.
2566800	2571800	In fact, the only warning signs that he was thinking of doing this were coming from World
2571800	2573800	of Warcraft.
2573800	2577800	The players that played with him in World of Warcraft were sending emails to university
2577800	2582800	telling them about warning signs, but little action was taken by the university because
2582800	2583800	of the warning signs.
2583800	2585800	And unfortunately, it came to this.
2585800	2592800	So, next time you want to bash video games, think about the community and the friendships
2592800	2594800	that people build throughout the video game community.
2594800	2595800	You know what I mean?
2595800	2599800	Well, how else is the university going to take an email that says the Horde is going
2599800	2603800	to kill Billy or whatever his name is?
2603800	2605800	I'm sorry, Loki, I can't laugh at that.
2605800	2608800	It's just very unfortunate, the whole thing.
2608800	2612800	But it makes me angry that people always jump to these conclusions.
2612800	2616800	And of course, you know, you save Virginia Tech, you think about that horrible, horrible
2616800	2618800	tragedy that happened there last year.
2618800	2623800	And who is the very first guy to come out and start blaming video games?
2623800	2624800	Lord Voldemort.
2624800	2628800	And if you've listened to this show enough, you know who I'm referencing.
2628800	2630800	Lord Voldemort comes right out and blames the video games.
2630800	2635800	Turns out, guy never played, he didn't own a single video game thing.
2635800	2641800	There were mental problems that went beyond anything entertainment based.
2641800	2644800	So it just, it pisses me off that people jump to these conclusions.
2644800	2646800	Okay, he's a lawyer, he can say whatever he wants.
2646800	2647800	Oh, well, you know what?
2647800	2648800	No repercussions.
2648800	2652800	No, there is repercussions because there's angry people like us that get on the internet
2652800	2653800	and yell at them.
2653800	2655800	I know, serious stuff, right?
2655800	2659800	Regardless, this kind of stuff makes me very angsty when I hear people jumping to conclusions
2659800	2662800	about the video games made me do it or whatever.
2662800	2665800	So what better time for us to bring on the FUs of the week?
2665800	2691800	My FU of the week goes to my finger because it's been catching a lot more lately and I'm
2691800	2696800	going to have to go to the doctor next week and it's also starting in my index finger
2696800	2697800	now.
2697800	2701800	So it's looking like I'm going to have to have surgery on my hand.
2701800	2705800	But maybe I'll get disability and not have to go to work.
2705800	2709800	The thing is if I had that much time off of work, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.
2709800	2714800	And if I couldn't use my hand, I really wouldn't know what to do.
2714800	2716800	I would be so bored.
2716800	2719800	And that, and I haven't been able to draw anything in like three weeks.
2719800	2721800	It's been really a pain in the butt.
2721800	2723800	So whatever you do, don't let the evil get into your hand.
2723800	2725800	Otherwise you're going to have to chop it off with a chainsaw.
2725800	2726800	That's right.
2726800	2729800	But then I can have a shotgun hand.
2729800	2731800	That is the plus.
2731800	2732800	Wow.
2732800	2734800	I can replace it with a machine gun hand.
2734800	2737800	You know, I thought the Wonder shows and stuff was bad, but you guys are...
2737800	2739800	This is not Boomstick.
2739800	2742800	You guys are taking it to a whole new level.
2742800	2746800	Some folks in chat are giving you the finger, but only so you can type.
2746800	2747800	Thank you.
2747800	2748800	All right.
2748800	2750800	Moving on, Loki.
2750800	2753800	Effie to another one of my 360s crapping out.
2753800	2756800	Luckily, though, I found out there is another way to fix it,
2756800	2760800	which involves heating up the motherboard with either a heat gun,
2760800	2763800	or in this case, since I don't own a heat gun, a blow dryer,
2763800	2766800	until it gets really hot and then hopefully fixes everything.
2766800	2769800	That's about as effective as, I don't know,
2769800	2772800	throwing your console at a wall and hopefully fixing it that way.
2772800	2775800	But I'm going to give it a shot because, hey, what's the worst that can happen?
2775800	2777800	It's already broken.
2777800	2779800	Wow.
2779800	2780800	All right.
2780800	2783800	I'm knocking on wood.
2783800	2784800	My turn?
2784800	2785800	Yes.
2785800	2791800	My FU of the week goes to this A&W float, which I saw at the grocery store.
2791800	2792800	Who doesn't like root beer floats, right?
2792800	2793800	I do.
2793800	2794800	I love root beer floats.
2794800	2795800	Exactly.
2795800	2796800	But have you tried this?
2796800	2797800	No.
2797800	2798800	It's shit.
2798800	2799800	I think there's a little bit.
2799800	2800800	You want to try some of this?
2800800	2801800	No.
2801800	2802800	Here, try it.
2802800	2803800	Try it on there.
2803800	2806800	I don't like it.
2806800	2807800	That's not bad.
2807800	2810800	The first taste to me was good and the second one to me was blah.
2810800	2811800	FU to all y'all.
2811800	2812800	You don't know what you're talking about.
2812800	2813800	It's too sweet.
2813800	2814800	It is a little sweet.
2814800	2818800	It's missing that nice contrast between root beer and ice cream.
2818800	2823800	It's like what happens when you put too much ice cream and root beer together and it melts
2823800	2825800	and it's flat.
2825800	2830800	FU to A&W for this thing that is no substitute for the real thing.
2830800	2832800	And FU to you guys for disagreeing with me.
2832800	2836800	How hard is it seriously to make a root beer float?
2836800	2837800	I mean, come on.
2837800	2838800	Well, I do.
2838800	2839800	No, they should have.
2839800	2842800	The concept of it all being in one bottle is interesting.
2842800	2843800	You know what?
2843800	2844800	I wonder if this would work.
2844800	2848800	Root beer with the vanilla Dippin' Dots dropped in there.
2848800	2852800	I can say at the store they not only have the A&W float, but they have Sunkist floats
2852800	2853800	too.
2853800	2854800	But I don't think I'll be trying those.
2854800	2855800	I don't think I'll be trying those.
2855800	2856800	Well, like orange cream soda is actually really good.
2856800	2857800	Those are bad.
2857800	2860800	I feel like a creamsicle.
2860800	2861800	Sane Delight floats?
2861800	2863800	No, Sane Delight would be nasty.
2863800	2865800	No, that wouldn't work.
2865800	2866800	All right.
2866800	2868800	Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you want to give out?
2868800	2872800	Yeah, I'd FU to my dad's girlfriend.
2872800	2878800	The woman's driving me absolutely fucking nuts because she's, well, you know, I've been
2878800	2883800	saying on air all night, she's a new mom and she's hormonal and I get that.
2883800	2888800	But keep the baby away from things that are going to kill her.
2888800	2891800	Like, for instance, baby 101.
2891800	2895800	For those of you who do not have children, I would assume that all of you are intelligent
2895800	2899800	to know that blankets are a potential hazard.
2899800	2905800	Like, you put the baby in baby blankets, but you keep it so that they're not, you know,
2905800	2907800	in the way of the face.
2907800	2908800	What does she do?
2908800	2912800	She puts the baby on their bed and puts a comforter over it.
2912800	2913800	Like a down comforter.
2913800	2917800	No, she's not going to roll over and like suffocate herself.
2917800	2921800	It's just like, give me the child and get away.
2921800	2924800	But it's not mine, so I have to like hold my tongue.
2924800	2926800	It's a learning experience for everyone.
2926800	2928800	She's going to kill her, I swear to God.
2928800	2931800	I'm not going to have a sister when I get back.
2931800	2933800	She's driving me nuts.
2933800	2937800	You know, just like I get, you're a new mom, I get that.
2937800	2938800	Everyone makes mistakes.
2938800	2941800	But you're making like 101 mistakes.
2941800	2942800	You should have learned.
2942800	2943800	You've met your quota.
2943800	2945800	You've met your quota of mistakes, right?
2945800	2947800	Yeah, no, it's like you're allowed to make mistakes,
2947800	2950800	but you're not allowed to make mistakes that are this big.
2950800	2955800	This is like stuff you should have learned when you learned you were pregnant.
2955800	2956800	You know?
2956800	2959800	And those baby wipes, they're supposed to be cold as fuck.
2959800	2961800	Well, I hope things get better.
2961800	2964800	Sorry to hear about the discomfort there.
2964800	2966800	Anything else?
2966800	2967800	No, I'm good.
2967800	2970800	Well, FU to you for leaving us.
2970800	2971800	I'm sorry.
2971800	2972800	I'm just kidding.
2972800	2973800	You know I love you.
2973800	2974800	I can't say FU to you.
2974800	2975800	All right.
2975800	2977800	Well, you would, but it would be kinky.
2977800	2978800	Hot.
2978800	2980800	All right, we just have a couple more gaming stories,
2980800	2983800	and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your phone calls
2983800	2988800	at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
2988800	2990800	But first, some more gaming news.
2990800	2991800	Yes, Jamie?
2991800	2994800	Choo, choo, choo.
2994800	2996800	I couldn't pass that up.
2996800	3001800	There's a rumor that Space Channel 5 is coming to Wii and other systems.
3001800	3004800	I mean, we're getting Nights in Samba de Amigo,
3004800	3011800	so there was a mention saying that there was going to be Space Channel 5.0
3011800	3015800	that was reported on Japanese news site The Magic Box.
3015800	3019800	Sega denied it on IGN, but you know what?
3019800	3023800	It could happen because they've done this before.
3023800	3028800	And it was even stated by Mizuguchi that he'd be interested in bringing it
3028800	3034800	as a downloadable game like a Res HD is.
3034800	3037800	That would be cool if they made a new game.
3037800	3043800	From what I heard, were they licensing some of the old Michael Jackson music?
3043800	3047800	I think so, because I know that in the second Space Channel 5,
3047800	3052800	the dances were in there in one of the dance battle ones.
3052800	3054800	Good stuff.
3054800	3057800	Well, I've got some last minute stories here real quick,
3057800	3061800	and then after that we'll be taking some calls on the Skype line.
3061800	3065800	First, of course, who doesn't like a good drinking game?
3065800	3069800	Well, apparently Sexy Video Game Land's blog
3069800	3071800	has come up with a few different drinking games,
3071800	3074800	one of which is for Metal Gear Solid,
3074800	3078800	and it requires a bunch of different concoctions to make up,
3078800	3083800	including, I guess, American beer, a bottle of Russian vodka,
3083800	3087800	a six-pack of Red Bull, and some other stuff.
3087800	3092800	Oh, coarse salt, lemon lime juice, and yeah.
3092800	3095800	Anyways, real quickly I'll just go over some of these.
3095800	3099800	When you trigger alert, drink Red Bull.
3099800	3104800	When an enemy shows inappropriate sexual attraction to Snake,
3104800	3108800	you take a vodka shot.
3108800	3112800	And let's see here, whenever your commander reminds you via the codec
3112800	3116800	that you're on a stealth slash sneaking mission,
3116800	3119800	that's when you take a beer shot.
3119800	3120800	That's kind of complicated,
3120800	3122800	and they have a big long list of stuff that you do,
3122800	3124800	so you probably can get pretty wasted from that.
3124800	3128800	Other drinking games that they had available, though.
3128800	3135800	One was for Final Fantasy X2, or X2, my mistake.
3135800	3139800	Anyways, this one's a lot simpler.
3139800	3142800	Basically, four different things to take a shot to.
3142800	3145800	Every time you see YRP, you take a shot.
3145800	3150800	Every time you see a clumsy-framed Yuna fanservice upskirt, take a shot.
3150800	3156800	And whenever you notice, or re-notice LeBlanc's impossible simultaneous
3156800	3160800	side and under-boob dress setup, take a shot.
3160800	3164800	What's the idea, to get drunk in like five seconds?
3164800	3165800	I don't know.
3165800	3171800	Whenever a brother's antics become completely insufferable, take a shot.
3171800	3175800	I'd like to see the OLR drinking game, I bet it's hilarious.
3175800	3178800	I'm sure they've got one.
3178800	3181800	Some other stuff real quick, of course.
3181800	3182800	The Skype line's open, by the way.
3182800	3186800	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
3186800	3191800	There's some screenshots showing a car in No More Heroes,
3191800	3193800	and apparently it has a New Jersey played on it,
3193800	3198800	and you're thinking, hey, Santa Destroy's in New Jersey.
3198800	3200800	One cool thing, if you haven't played it yet,
3200800	3202800	I was playing a little bit during break, Potapon,
3202800	3204800	the demo is available in the US,
3204800	3207800	and one of the cool things about playing the demo
3207800	3212800	is it will unlock an exclusive weapon when you buy the full game.
3212800	3214800	If you buy the full game, I guess.
3214800	3219800	By the way, when I said the whole OLR drinking game,
3219800	3223800	SSA-100-MAT and act deaf like in unison said, OLR drinking game,
3223800	3227800	every time Loki says, anyway, you take a shot.
3227800	3228800	Love it.
3228800	3230800	All right, let's go to the phones real quick.
3230800	3231800	I'll let Loki finish the stories in a little bit,
3231800	3233800	but we want to hear from you guys.
3233800	3234800	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3234800	3236800	Who's this?
3236800	3237800	GS68.
3237800	3238800	Hello, GS68.
3238800	3240800	What's on your mind, buddy?
3240800	3242800	Well, I've been playing Super Metroid lately,
3242800	3247800	and several weeks ago I decided to try Metroid Prime 3.
3247800	3249800	Oh, crap, I can't solve.
3249800	3252800	You were playing Metroid Prime 3, uh-huh.
3252800	3256800	Yeah, and, like, I found it pretty disorienting,
3256800	3260800	and at some point I got stuck,
3260800	3262800	and I started going around in circles and getting dizzy,
3262800	3268800	and that's when I just realized that I'm not for first-person games,
3268800	3271800	and I'm not a big fan of 3D games.
3271800	3275800	I will admit, GS68, that's a lot of the problems I've had with 3D games.
3275800	3279800	It was very hard for me to move from the old-school two-dimensional
3279800	3281800	Super Nintendo games to, you know,
3281800	3283800	when we got into PlayStation and PlayStation 2,
3283800	3286800	and now, you know, where we're at with Wii and everything else,
3286800	3289800	it was very hard to kind of make that transition into the first-person games.
3289800	3290800	I'm kind of the same way.
3290800	3293800	I always conceptualized Metroid in a 2D space,
3293800	3296800	so to take Metroid to a 3D space is tough,
3296800	3298800	because you really have to, you know,
3298800	3301800	when you've played 2D games for a long time,
3301800	3303800	to then suddenly have to conceptualize things in 3D
3303800	3305800	takes some getting used to.
3305800	3308800	It really does, and I think a lot of people don't give some of us enough credit.
3308800	3310800	I partially blame it for why I suck so bad at Halo.
3310800	3313800	I'm always getting lost, just because I don't know.
3313800	3314800	I don't know what it is.
3314800	3316800	I'd like to think I'm not stupid or anything.
3316800	3317800	I don't think I am.
3317800	3320800	I just am not used to gaming in a 3D space for a long time.
3320800	3325800	Well, actually, I just started playing Super Metroid over summer,
3325800	3332800	and I think it's more with me and first-person shooters.
3332800	3336800	I mean, on caper, I mean, the first-person shooter on the Wii sounds really cool,
3336800	3339800	but when I try it, I get dizzy.
3339800	3341800	You know, maybe you're just...
3341800	3343800	You might have a little bit of the motion sickness, too.
3343800	3346800	You've got to make sure you look away once in a while and all that stuff.
3346800	3347800	I mean, certainly.
3347800	3351800	I know Dark Sakura's talked about that she doesn't like to play a whole lot of first-person shooters,
3351800	3357800	because she, you know, on a big old TV can make you feel a little nauseous, right?
3357800	3358800	Yeah.
3358800	3363800	So mostly it's probably, I'm assuming, and Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,
3363800	3367800	I'm assuming it's kind of a lot of the same triggers that make people motion sick in cars
3367800	3369800	come into play in video games.
3369800	3370800	I think so.
3370800	3375800	Because it's like, you know, that whole thing where like if you're sitting in the back of a car around a whiny road...
3375800	3376800	Anyway, go ahead.
3376800	3377800	Sorry.
3377800	3385800	Yeah, there was like this cutscene in Final Fantasy VII where Cloud says never to read while at a car or truck,
3385800	3388800	which I thought was interesting.
3388800	3392800	Well, it's interesting you bring up Final Fantasy VII, because remember that was a big shock when it came out,
3392800	3396800	because it was like, OMG, it's taking a 2D game and putting it in 3D space.
3396800	3397800	But it was kind of different.
3397800	3403800	Like Final Fantasy VII still felt pretty 2D to me, just with a 3D twist to it.
3403800	3406800	It was like two and a half dimensions, if that makes sense.
3406800	3413800	I think the point is like, overall, I guess I'm just more into side scores and first-person shooters.
3413800	3414800	And I think that's okay.
3414800	3416800	I think people are into whatever they're into.
3416800	3418800	So there's no particular type of game you have to like.
3418800	3422800	All right, GS68, any other final thoughts for our listeners before we keep moving on?
3422800	3423800	Um, no.
3423800	3424800	All right.
3424800	3425800	Well, thank you for your input tonight.
3425800	3426800	And I hope...
3426800	3429800	Metroid Prime 3 is a great game once you can kind of get used to the first-person-ness.
3429800	3431800	So I hope the sickness doesn't bog you down.
3431800	3432800	Give it another go.
3432800	3433800	I think you'll find this a lot of fun.
3433800	3434800	Good luck.
3434800	3435800	Forgive it.
3435800	3437800	I'll try sometime in the future.
3437800	3438800	Please do.
3438800	3439800	Take care.
3439800	3440800	You know, even...
3440800	3441800	Here's the weird thing.
3441800	3444800	I'm not a big fan of the first-person games.
3444800	3445800	Like, I frickin' love Oblivion.
3445800	3446800	Love it.
3446800	3447800	It's...
3447800	3448800	I don't know.
3448800	3449800	Like, I don't have a problem with it.
3449800	3450800	It's all about punching the animals.
3450800	3451800	I guess so.
3451800	3452800	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3452800	3453800	Who's this?
3453800	3454800	Yeah, what's up?
3454800	3455800	This is RossdielUT.
3455800	3456800	Hello, RossdielUT, my friend.
3456800	3457800	Hi.
3457800	3458800	What is on your mind?
3458800	3459800	Well, a few things.
3459800	3466800	First off, you're talking about the whole idea of conceptualizing 3D games when you've
3466800	3470800	been used to the 2D games just now.
3470800	3479800	I think what's helped with the PS2 and the PS3, maybe late in the PS1 and the 64, but
3479800	3487800	especially in the PS2 and PS3, you have environments that are more detailed to where you can associate
3487800	3489800	landmarks.
3489800	3496800	If you remember the old 3D games, like in the early PS1, all the walls looked the same.
3496800	3501800	It made Doom damn near impossible for me, because one wall looked the same as the other.
3501800	3503800	I think you've got a damn good point here.
3503800	3506800	That's one thing that always kind of frustrated me about the Mega Man Legends games, especially
3506800	3510800	the early ones, is that everything kind of looked the same, so it was very hard.
3510800	3512800	Well, there were only two Mega Man Legends games.
3512800	3513800	Yeah.
3513800	3515800	But yeah, I know what you mean.
3515800	3520800	You can't do a 3D game and have everything look the same, because you're just going to
3520800	3523800	get horribly lost, and it doesn't matter what system.
3523800	3526800	But then again, the same thing happens with a lot of 2D games.
3526800	3532800	The original Metroid was a pain in the ass, because all you had was the black background
3532800	3536800	and the different colors of the floor, so it took me a little while.
3536800	3538800	Super Metroid had the landmarks.
3538800	3542800	Yeah, you bring up a damn good point, because it's not like in the real world I have a problem
3542800	3544800	conceptualizing 3D space.
3544800	3546800	I don't think many of us do.
3546800	3547800	Maybe there's a condition out there.
3547800	3548800	I don't know.
3548800	3552800	But most people don't have a problem conceptualizing 3D space in the real world, and I think you're
3552800	3553800	right.
3553800	3554800	A lot of that is landmarks.
3554800	3555800	Right?
3555800	3556800	How do we give directions out?
3556800	3559800	We say, okay, go straight down the street, and when you see the McDonald's, turn right.
3559800	3560800	You know?
3560800	3561800	Landmarks are huge.
3561800	3562800	Exactly.
3562800	3563800	I think you got a damn good point.
3563800	3564800	You need those recognizable landmarks.
3564800	3566800	Yeah, you need a McDonald's.
3566800	3568800	You know, here's the other thing.
3568800	3569800	For lack of a better term, yeah.
3569800	3573800	Let me say this, though, Ross Studio T, because I think here's the other big change I think
3573800	3577800	that came later on in the PlayStation 2 and so on games that you didn't see a whole lot
3577800	3579800	of in PlayStation 1 games.
3579800	3580800	Maps.
3580800	3581800	Maps.
3581800	3582800	Maps.
3582800	3583800	One button maps.
3583800	3584800	A little mini map in the corner.
3584800	3587840	A way to conceptualize the 3D and 2D very quickly.
3587840	3591800	That's one reason I way prefer Kingdom Hearts 2 to Kingdom Hearts 1 is the mini map.
3591800	3592800	Seriously.
3592800	3593800	It's a huge improvement for me.
3593800	3594800	Yeah, I hear you.
3594800	3598200	A lot of the games have the mini maps.
3598200	3604360	Even the really late ones like Call of Duty 4 has a mini map when you pause.
3604360	3608800	There are a lot of aids today.
3608800	3609800	There is that.
3609800	3613800	Like I said, 3D is a lot easier today than it used to be.
3613800	3614800	Right.
3614800	3615800	Well, what else did you want to say, Ross Studio T?
3615800	3617800	Because we're trying to move through a lot of calls tonight.
3617800	3622800	I want to go back to the whole idiots on mass effect thing.
3622800	3623800	Ah, yes.
3623800	3629400	You know, we've been seeing for the better part of a decade and a half idiots attacking
3629400	3630400	video games.
3630400	3633300	And I'm going to call them idiots because, you know, ignorant means you don't know better.
3633300	3636800	Stupid means you don't want to learn.
3636800	3637800	It's true.
3637800	3641400	True words have not been spoken on this show tonight.
3641400	3642400	Go ahead.
3642400	3643400	Thank you.
3643400	3644400	Thank you.
3644400	3652040	The thing is, I always wonder what sort of impact they really have aside from the whole
3652040	3653040	soundbite culture.
3653040	3660820	Because when you look at it in that time when the anti-gaming attacks have been so intense,
3660820	3664240	the industry has just grown and blossomed enormously.
3664240	3669040	We just had this epic year last year, what was it, 18 billion dollars for the industry
3669040	3671080	last year?
3671080	3678100	You know, so you have to really wonder how important these Jack Thomsons, how many people
3678100	3679660	they actually reach out to.
3679660	3686240	I think what we lose sight of is that the United States is a country of 300 million
3686240	3688040	people.
3688040	3692860	There's a ton of cable networks, literally a ton of cable networks and satellite and
3692860	3695760	everything else, you know, there's so many options out there.
3695760	3699120	You know what, I think you're kind of right, Rosco, I think one thing we kind of don't
3699120	3703100	consider about this Fox News piece is that they were probably preaching to the choir
3703100	3704100	in a sense.
3704100	3708360	Like a lot of the people that watch Fox News were probably already the crowd that bans
3708360	3713480	their children from playing video games all together and all this stuff, you know, but
3713480	3715540	it doesn't excuse the ignorance.
3715540	3720180	And that's the thing, I think, in this day and age, I know you're with me there, but
3720180	3724040	I think originally these guys were probably preaching to the choir, but at the same time
3724040	3725600	it doesn't give them the right to lie.
3725600	3736840	Of course, and I'm angry about the lie, but at the same time, compared to other times
3736840	3742260	in history, other media's attacks, video games have had a pretty damn light and have
3742260	3745520	gone through it pretty damn quickly in comparison.
3745520	3750000	It took the movie industry 40 years to get over the Hays Code, for example.
3750000	3753160	And the comic book industry only recently got out of the shadow of the comic school.
3753160	3754600	Video games have had a very light.
3754600	3757880	Rosco, you two, we've got to wrap up, but I've got to say this, it's going to be very
3757880	3763200	interesting to see what happens, especially as this Hollywood writer's strike continues,
3763200	3766820	where video games are going to become, you watch this happen, the longer this strike
3766820	3769920	goes on, the more these writers are going to start writing for video games.
3769920	3773160	And we're going to have very Hollywood-ish type of video games.
3773160	3774160	It's going to be very interesting.
3774160	3775760	Well, we're already seeing that happen.
3775760	3781400	We're already seeing video games taking audience from television, which is part of why you
3781400	3783720	see all this anti-gaming stuff on TV.
3783720	3784720	True, but you know how...
3784720	3786720	They're trying to get rid of that market.
3786720	3787720	Anyway, I know you're tied.
3787720	3788720	I'm sorry.
3788720	3790960	I know, really quick, but there was another story about this this week.
3790960	3796160	You know how they say that video game plots are always so thin they never make good movies.
3796160	3797160	You know, that...
3797160	3798960	I think you're going to start seeing a lot more games with them.
3798960	3801600	Well, they don't make good movies because the directors suck.
3801600	3804040	That's true a lot of the time, too.
3804040	3805040	Uwe Boll, anyone?
3805040	3808280	Silent Hill, some of them were passable.
3808280	3809280	Some of them were...
3809280	3810280	Even Mortal Kombat was passable.
3810280	3811280	Passable.
3811280	3814360	I liked the first Mortal Kombat.
3814360	3816360	I liked the first Resident Evil.
3816360	3817360	But then you look into shit.
3817360	3818360	Those are good movies.
3818360	3822360	You look at shit like BloodRayne, and you're just like, this is why we get about that.
3822360	3823360	Okay.
3823360	3824360	One sexy...
3824360	3825360	All right, all right.
3825360	3826360	You want to get to the next column.
3826360	3827360	All right.
3827360	3828360	Rustiel Ute, I'm so sorry.
3828360	3829360	We've got to let you go.
3829360	3830360	But have a good one, buddy.
3830360	3831360	It's always good to hear from you.
3831360	3832360	Bye-bye.
3832360	3833360	You do the same.
3833360	3834360	Bye-bye.
3834360	3835360	Hello.
3835720	3836720	Anyone at the line?
3836720	3837720	Oh, hi.
3837720	3838720	Two- elders.
3838720	3839720	Hi, everyone.
3839720	3840720	Sorry to interrupt you.
3840720	3841720	The phone is ringing off the hook tonight.
3841720	3842720	I literally click the hang up button and another call drops in.
3842720	3843720	It's crazy.
3843720	3844720	It's an orange launch radio.
3844720	3845720	Who's this?
3845720	3846720	This is Act Def from chat.
3846720	3847720	Hello, Act Def from chat.
3847720	3848720	What is on your mind?
3848720	3851800	Actually, three things online.
3851800	3855420	The first one is the DDR is dead thing.
3855420	3860300	I agree with you on the Konami.
3860300	3869580	definitely hire or commission harmonics on the whole renewal of DVR. They are having
3869580	3876360	so much success with Guitar Hero and Rock Band that maybe they should work together
3876360	3878320	and make a better new game.
3878320	3881980	I don't know how feasible that arrangement is, but it would certainly be a fanboy's dream
3881980	3887360	to see something like that happen. With the way complex corporate relationships and money
3887360	3892060	and everything works, I don't know how feasible it is, but it certainly is a fun thing to
3892060	3893060	dream about, right?
3893060	3899660	True. So it would be nice to see them work together.
3899660	3903340	Now Act Deaf, you're from Mexico, right, if I remember right?
3903340	3904340	Yes.
3904340	3908660	Here's one question. I hear that Pump It Up has a huge fan base in Mexico. Is that true
3908660	3911740	in your neck? Now obviously Mexico is a very big place, but is that true in your neck of
3911740	3914260	the woods?
3914260	3921900	Actually Pump It Up is more popular on the center of the country, more on the south side.
3921900	3924620	On the north, DVR has more popularity.
3924620	3929860	I see. Do you think that might just be because a lot of American culture seeps through because
3929860	3932620	the closer you get to the border and everything, do you think that might be a part of it or
3932620	3933820	just coincidence?
3933820	3938820	Yeah. Yeah, that's most a part of it.
3938820	3941780	Because I was thinking, yeah, and somebody brought it up in chat too, Color Sakura said
3941780	3945620	it in chat, and I was thinking of this too, that the World Pump Festival was happening
3945620	3950540	in Mexico City. But yeah, Mexico City is much further south in Mexico than, you know, other
3950540	3951540	places.
3951540	3952540	Anyhow.
3952540	3963380	Yeah. Also, I wanted to comment on a news you said a week ago about Video Games Live,
3963380	3967180	that it's coming to Mexico and it's coming to Mexicali, that's my hometown.
3967180	3968180	Awesome.
3968180	3970360	I'm pretty damn excited.
3970360	3971360	That has got to be awesome.
3971360	3973380	It's not going to be.
3973380	3979420	I bet it's not every day. You know, unfortunately, a lot of big tours and things don't always
3979420	3984540	think to go to Mexico or other countries. Like, you know, we hear a lot from Footy Monster
3984540	3988060	who's in Argentina and not a lot of stuff comes to his neck of the woods either. I bet
3988060	3991620	that's got to be pretty awesome to see something like this, like actually kind of recognize
3991620	3995380	like, hey, let's go to some places a little bit outside the north. Let's go somewhere
3995380	3998060	besides L.A. and New York, right?
3998060	3999060	Pretty cool.
3999060	4005100	Yeah. It's pretty exciting because here in my town, it doesn't happen anything like this
4005100	4010740	huge, like Video Games Live, though maybe for some people it will be like, oh, video
4010740	4017260	games. Oh, yeah. Like, whatever. But for me, it's like a great experience that is going
4017260	4026220	to happen, like going to the ballroom that's going to be happening and hearing all the
4026220	4031780	music I know and recognize from old video games and also with my friends that also are
4031780	4032780	video game fans.
4032780	4037420	Act F, let me ask you just one last question and then we've got to wrap up. Do you think
4037420	4042820	it will succeed in a non-traditional place like Mexicali? Do you think this show has
4042820	4044740	potential to do very well there?
4044740	4053660	We have a pretty big community of gamers and also people who like anime, otakus and pretty
4053660	4064940	much geeks. It would be a success, though not as great as in a big city.
4064940	4068700	Well, you know, I know you've been saying in chat that I should go. It is a bit of a
4068700	4073300	long drive to Mexicali. I know it's towards the north end of Mexico, so it's not unreasonable.
4073300	4077100	Who knows? If I get my passport renewed, anything is possible. Who knows? I've never been to
4077100	4079660	Mexico either. This will give me a great excuse. Who knows?
4079660	4083140	Yeah. Another thing I wanted to add before...
4083140	4084140	Really quick, yeah.
4084140	4093140	...ending the call. It's the Fox News thing. Just a little opinion on that, on my part.
4093140	4105300	It should be not us attacking them also or ignore them. We should acknowledge their opinions
4105300	4115740	and maybe make a debate. The PAX Expo tried to do last year with Jack Thompson a debate.
4115740	4121940	Very interesting perspective that maybe instead of getting on the offensive, like things that
4121940	4126320	you see on Amazon.com, everybody attacking this lady who said this, maybe the video game
4126320	4130260	community can kind of look at how can we stop this from happening in the future? If this
4130260	4133140	is what people really think, how can we educate them otherwise?
4133140	4134140	Yes.
4134140	4136900	That's a very interesting way of looking at it. That's a very interesting way of looking
4136900	4140280	at it. I appreciate your opinion. Act F, we're out of time. I got to let you go, but thanks
4140280	4141280	so much for your call.
4141280	4142280	You too.
4142280	4143280	All right. Bye-bye.
4143280	4144280	I don't want to be the better person.
4144280	4148420	What did you say, Chris? I think that's worth saying to the mic. What?
4148420	4150060	I don't want to be the better person.
4150060	4153540	You're right. Sometimes you don't want to be the better person. You're right. But you
4153540	4157900	know what? I think he makes a damn good point is that maybe instead of going on the offensive,
4157900	4161380	we should take a look at how can we stop this shit from happening again? How can we educate
4161380	4164580	these people. But then again, there's another part of me that says you can lead a horse
4164580	4165720	to water, but you can't make a drink.
4165720	4170600	Exactly. You can give them all the education. They can be the most educated people about
4170600	4176580	video games. But if they have an agenda, like trying to be sensationalists and stuff like
4176580	4180900	that, and really rile up people about video games, they're just going to do these stories.
4180900	4185060	Anyway, since obviously they don't really care about apologizing about it, I'm surprised
4185060	4189280	we don't see more crazy shit on there like, you know, Grand Theft Auto literally reaches
4189280	4192020	out of the TV and murders your children and stuff like that.
4192020	4194020	The Horde is after your children?
4194020	4200860	Yes, the Horde is after your children. It is a satanic cult cultivated by a video game.
4200860	4209140	It has 10 million followers and it will destroy the Christian race. I don't know how we can
4209140	4212140	go from that into another call, but we're going to try. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge
4212140	4213140	Radio. Who's this?
4213140	4216040	Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ronma.
4216040	4219460	You've been listening to that because sometimes I pick up calls and don't acknowledge for
4219460	4223340	a little bit just to get them on the line. You've been listening to that for 30 seconds.
4223340	4225940	I don't know how you held the laughter in so we couldn't hear you.
4225940	4226940	Yeah, pretty much.
4226940	4229940	All right. Ronma, what's on your mind?
4229940	4235120	Well, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I'm putting that aside because
4235120	4237860	I'm very pissed off right now.
4237860	4238860	Why is that?
4238860	4240980	I have one thing to say. Can I please say it?
4240980	4241980	Okay.
4241980	4242980	No.
4242980	4253500	People, shut the fuck up about DDR. It's done. God forbid Konami ignores these other franchises
4253500	4255740	to please you drooling fanboys.
4255740	4258820	I wouldn't say they're really ignoring their franchise. They're still releasing more than
4258820	4262180	two games a year for the damn thing. I mean, I wouldn't say it's dead.
4262180	4268380	Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I mean, be thankful you're getting something, you know?
4268380	4271900	It's all the people who play DDR. It's all their fault because they're not the ones playing
4271900	4276180	it. Konami's releasing plenty of games. It's just you guys, you all suck. That's why.
4276180	4280540	Ronma, I agree and I disagree. I agree to a point that at some point you have to let
4280540	4285620	DDR go. You just have to let it go. It's past its prime, whatever. But at the same part,
4285620	4290980	it sucks because without DDR, I would never have met Jamie. I would have never met Matt.
4290980	4293100	I would have never met you. You know what I mean?
4293100	4294660	It's true. That is so true.
4294660	4298940	So I think that's why people are so passionate about it and they know everybody has their
4298940	4303620	own idea of what's best for the series because a lot of us have made friends through that
4303620	4306900	community. It goes back to what we were talking about during the bonus segment. I don't know
4306900	4309820	if you were here for the bonus segment and I know our podcast listeners don't get to
4309820	4314960	hear the bonus segment, but during the bonus segment, Chris was talking about a fundraiser
4314960	4318900	going on on DeviantArt to help one of the artists in need. And I was talking about that's
4318900	4324180	a really great example of community. And I bet if something like that happened in the
4324180	4327540	DDR world, the DDR community would have done something similar. You know what I mean?
4327540	4329380	Thomas Howard, he's hungry.
4329380	4336060	Every community has done something like that, you know? I mean, some conventions, when they
4336060	4342460	have the auctions for artwork and stuff like that, they would say a portion of this would
4342460	4346860	go to this charitable organization, which is pretty cool.
4346860	4351180	Well, okay. So, all right. We've heard all sides of this. Let's not continue to indulge
4351180	4354820	the DDR discussion. What else did you want to say, Rama?
4354820	4360060	Okay. I do know a few episodes back, there was talk about the Wii and the Wii Remote.
4360060	4365540	And it's something I thought about. Let me ask all of you guys this, and girls. If the
4365540	4373060	Wii came loaded with the Wii Remote and the classic controller, would the console still
4373060	4381860	be considered a gimmick system?
4381860	4385660	You know, it's weird, because I don't think that would have ever happened, because Nintendo's
4385660	4390180	thing was to force developers to get away from that. So, it's kind of hard for me to
4390180	4394900	answer that, because I think the whole niche about the waggle and the motion sensing, that
4394900	4401060	was Nintendo's whole thing. So, if they had bundled in a classic controller with that,
4401060	4405740	it kind of would have defeated the purpose altogether. You see some developers sneaking
4405740	4409660	around that a little bit. Like, for instance, I think of Geometry Wars. Like, you can play
4409660	4415420	that with the motion sensing way, or you can play it with the good old-fashioned, old-school
4415420	4421780	2 sticks way, if you have a classic controller, which a lot of people do. But, you know, it's
4421780	4425100	really hard to say, Rama, because I think that was Nintendo's whole thing in the first
4425100	4428620	place, and for them to have included a classic controller would have defeated the entire
4428620	4429620	purpose.
4429620	4434380	Well, I agree on that. I do see how Nintendo wanted to get away from that. That was cool.
4434380	4439780	I played some of the Wii games on launch, and it was cool. I played Dragon Ball Z Budokai
4439780	4443820	2. I couldn't get into it. I was like, I need a regular controller in order to play the
4443820	4448620	game. At first, everyone was like, oh, this is so cool. This is so great. Now, developers
4448620	4453580	are like saying, this ain't a joke, you know? Let's go on to other things.
4453580	4458780	I think a very realistic possibility in the future, Rama, is that when the Wii start coming
4458780	4462700	out in other colors, and again, this is all speculation, why not throw in a matching classic
4462700	4467340	controller of another color? You know, the Wii is an established thing now. This whole
4467340	4470980	new, you know, the waggling and the motions, it's established now. Developers will buy
4470980	4474860	into it. I think it's okay to start putting in classic controllers and kind of see what
4474860	4476420	can happen with a good mix.
4476420	4480740	That'll definitely work. I mean, like, you got, like, a game where one person uses a
4480740	4485980	controller to, like, drive a car. Some other person can use the Wii, the controller, like,
4485980	4488500	the little guns or the lasers. That'd be pretty cool.
4488500	4492780	Yeah. Lots of ideas. And, of course, I think back to that YouTube that came out a little
4492780	4496860	while ago with the whole reverse thing where the guy had the whole conceptualized space
4496860	4500100	thing but he was, like, wearing the sensor bar on his head. That thing was amazing. I
4500100	4501100	don't know if you saw it.
4501100	4502220	Yeah, I didn't see it.
4502220	4505580	I'm sure someone in chat has a link to the YouTube. It's freaking amazing. Rama, really
4505580	4508460	quickly, any last thoughts? And we got to let you go.
4508460	4513060	I'm tired of 3D games. I want more 2D games and 3D environments. That's it.
4513060	4516620	Real quickly, how do you feel about the Bionic Commando remake? Because that seems to be
4516620	4520060	exactly the kind of thing you're talking about.
4520060	4522060	I'll buy that for $20.
4522060	4525300	All right. You do that. All right, thanks so much for your call, Rama. Take care.
4525300	4526300	No problem.
4526300	4527300	Bye-bye.
4527300	4528300	All right.
4528300	4532300	Seriously, like, I had the biggest nerdgasm when I saw that Bionic Commando thing last
4532300	4534660	week, if I can even say that. All right, any other...
4534660	4535660	Any other?
4535660	4540220	Any other? Yes, I fangasmed all over myself. All right, real quick, I got another call
4540220	4543420	driving. This is the last one, I promise. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
4543420	4547420	Hello.
4547420	4548420	Hi, who's this?
4548420	4551060	This is Let's Have Tea.
4551060	4555140	Hello, Let's Have Tea. Welcome to the show. Real quick, because we're trying to wrap up,
4555140	4558380	what did you want to say?
4558380	4563740	I know you didn't really want any more comments on the whole DDR thing, but there are communities
4563740	4572700	out there working together using DDR for charities. I know there's an organization in Indiana
4572700	4584580	that they've been doing annual charities for seven years now, using DDR as a way to raise
4584580	4591860	money. And this year, they raised just over $2,800 a weekend for a children's hospital.
4591860	4596620	That's awesome. Do you happen to have a website link or anything?
4596620	4604740	The community for that is over at nddr.com, and it's called the DDR-a-thon.
4604740	4607460	Very cool. Let's Have Tea. We've got to let you go, because I swore we were going to wrap
4607460	4610420	it up, but thank you so much for sharing that with us. Have a good one, okay?
4610420	4611420	Yep.
4611420	4612420	All right.
4612420	4613420	Bye.
4613420	4616700	Bye-bye. I love that nickname, too. I forgot to compliment him when he was on the line,
4616700	4620820	but Let's Have Tea is one of my favorite nicknames of anybody in chat. All right, I promised
4620820	4623100	we could wrap up. We're going to do a couple quick last minute stories, but I did want
4623100	4627060	to say this real quick, because he's talking about charity, and I think it's really interesting.
4627060	4630300	This has kind of become a fad lately. I don't know if that's the right word to use, because
4630300	4634940	that has kind of a negative context with it, but I've noticed it seems like I've seen a
4634940	4642420	lot of these 48-hour gaming sessions for charity lately. Like, you know, I want to say somebody
4642420	4645180	sent me an email. I think it was one of our listeners that they were going to play through
4645180	4651500	the Banjo-Kazooie games in one weekend, and of course, we saw the Mario-a-thon, the Sonic-a-thon,
4651500	4658320	the Zelda-a-thon, and, you know, it's a very interesting trend right now that people are
4658320	4662820	doing these marathons for different charities. I think it's cool. I think it's a great example
4662820	4670780	of how the community can kind of band together. I would caution, though, too much of a good
4670780	4675340	thing can be too much, so I would encourage those that are thinking about doing these
4675340	4679260	types of things in the future, I encourage you to think about a spin that you can kind
4679260	4682860	of put on it to make it your own. You know, what kind of spin can you put on it that makes
4682860	4690620	it stick out from the rest? That's all. Anyhow, that's it. That's all I'm going to say on
4690620	4695020	that. Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki? Sure. To kind of go back to some of
4695020	4704060	the stuff we talked about earlier, there is a rumor, I guess now, apparently a tipster
4704060	4714700	who tipped off QJNet about the phasing out of the 20-gig PS3s is also saying that now
4714700	4721340	he has information about the phase-out of the 80-gig PS3s for GameStop and EB. Apparently
4721340	4725560	they're also phasing them out as well. And he says, I went ahead and looked in our back
4725560	4731460	office inventory screen and found that only SKU listed as active for the PS3 console was
4731460	4738100	the 40-gig system. The 20, 60, and 80 SKUs were deleted. So that's kind of interesting
4738100	4746420	and of course Sony has come out and said no comment regarding the phased-out rumors. Most
4746420	4750380	likely though, if we're hearing that a lot of these retailers are phasing out, that something's
4750380	4756620	going to happen. So not a big surprise there. Someone else apparently found another hack
4756620	4762740	into the Wii to run their own code. Apparently there's an exploit using a game save for Zelda
4762740	4770700	Twilight Princess where you can crash it and run a code using a buffer overflow. So it's
4770700	4777860	kind of neat. Interesting. And then the surfer girl, of course, she's had a lot of rumors
4777860	4785860	that have come true here. Some of our newest ones include Slalom, I guess, a rare NES game
4785860	4791540	and that's rare in the company, that actually will be making its way to the Virtual Console
4791540	4796500	in the next few months here. Some other stuff, they're also talking about Onimusha 5 is apparently
4796500	4802340	coming out for both the PS3 and 360 sometime next year, as well as Dead Rising 2 and Lost
4802340	4808120	Planet 2 not too far behind. The PSP also getting a follow-up title coming in the form
4808120	4814380	of another siphon filter game. And we'll have the story tied into a PS3 version as well,
4814380	4821340	also set for 2009. And finally, there is some stuff coming from EA. Apparently they are
4821340	4826220	rumored to be working on another Wing Commander title, an actual Wing Commander title, not
4826220	4832100	some crappy Xbox Live Arcade game. However, there is also another Xbox Live Arcade game
4832100	4838780	coming from Rare, and that game is Mr. Pants, which I don't know if you've played Mr. Pants
4838780	4845660	but it's a weird game. I can't say I have. Mr. Pants. What is a game called Mr. Pants
4845660	4851140	about? I don't remember but it looked weird. Alright. We're way over for time tonight so
4851140	4855100	we definitely have to wrap things up. Any other last minute stories quickly though?
4855100	4860180	I just want to make sure. No. Alrighty. Then let's go ahead and wrap it up with our final
4860180	4866740	thoughts. Loki, your final thought tonight? My final thought is I need a cage match song
4866740	4871940	quick. Yes you do. Dark Soccer, your final thought? I picked my cage match song seven
4871940	4877580	hours ago. And my final thought is vitamin water is very good. It's much better for me
4877580	4882960	than soda too, I'm sure. As long as I drink it in moderation. I wouldn't live off vitamin
4882960	4886880	water but it's good stuff. And lastly but certainly not leastly, thank you so much Chris
4886880	4892300	for coming over tonight and lending your moral support and your shining face to our show.
4892300	4896760	And a very good bonus segment all thanks to you tonight. So Chris, any final thoughts
4896760	4904020	from you? The Horde is after your server. And please call in once in a while and let
4904020	4907580	us know you're doing okay. Oh I plan to. You better. And you're still going to be our roving
4907580	4911380	reporter in Wisconsin. We'll find something gaming related up there for you to cover.
4911380	4915420	Okay. Well actually I got something that I want to plug later but I'll do that later.
4915420	4919500	Do you want to plug it now? Because the show's almost over, you ain't got much time left.
4919500	4924700	No I'll do it in the cage match. Right before the cage match. Something for the live listeners.
4924700	4928780	Because you people are special and I love you all. Live listeners get a special treat
4928780	4932140	from Chris very soon. Well sorry podcasters but that's part of the magic of listening
4932140	4938060	live. And for those of you on video, I might just dance. That's right. The Justin TV-ers
4938060	4943140	get to hear it too. Alright and well thank you guys so much for, did I do a final thought?
4943140	4948820	Oh yeah I said vitamin water. So that, hello, I'm losing my memory already. Anyhow that's
4948820	4956660	going to do it. Get an old rub. Shut up. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange
