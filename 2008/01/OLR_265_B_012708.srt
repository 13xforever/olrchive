00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,600
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,700
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, our last show for January,

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,000
because it is January the 27th of 2008.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's get right back into the gaming news. If you missed Part A, you missed a lot.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,700
You missed a lot of randomness, that's for sure.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,000
But now we're going to get into some Nintendo news, because we had a substantial lack of Nintendo in Part A.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,300
So let's kick it off with some Nintendo news, Loki.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,000
One of the new things we learned this week about Smash Bros. Brawl

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,100
is that it will have classic game demos included with it,

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:01:01,300
including demos for The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Bros., as well as Star Fox 64.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,600
That's pretty cool and all.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,600
My question is, why the fuck don't they have demos on the Virtual Console if they're all available on Brawl?

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Come on, if it's that easy to make demos for this stuff, then why isn't it available for the other stuff?

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,100
Is it just me, or is this maybe a workaround?

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,900
Because they realize that tons and tons of Wii owners are going to be buying this game.

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,600
This is a AAA title of the highest kind for the Nintendo Wii.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,400
I think it's cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, but seriously though, if it's easy to implement,

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
why aren't they doing timed demos on some of these Nintendo games and stuff?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
Here's the weird thing. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea, I think it's great.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,800
It gives this game even more value than it had already.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,400
God, we all knew this was going to be a powerhouse game anyway.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,800
But the only thing that makes me go, are there really that many people who haven't played these games?

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,100
I don't think so.

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,600
Am I just spoiled because I'm older, so I kind of grew up with 8-bit Nintendo and stuff?

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,300
But are there a lot of people who have never played The Legend of Zelda?

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
Who have never played original Mario Bros.?

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,100
There may be some people though, obviously we grew up in the 80s and stuff,

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,200
but there's a lot of people that have never played the original games.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
Alright, Chris is raising her hand, I guess that's true.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
I was denied video games when I was five.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,600
That's right, you said during the break though, you were denied video games when you were a child,

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
so you didn't really have a lot of exposure to this.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,600
No, my parents refused to buy me anything that had to do with the video game

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,400
until I was finally in high school and I got my Pokemon games.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
My mom used to play with me.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Well, your mom was awesome, my parents were retarded.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Just the different, well I mean obviously, you pretty much have two different extremes right here.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,600
You have the no video games in this house whatsoever, and then the family that plays together.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I mean you literally have the two games in the spectrum here.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, the family I used loosely because it was me, my mom, and my brothers,

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
you know, we weren't the typical family unit.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Right, well, you know.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Well, it was just, it really was, my brothers ran outside and played the neighborhood

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,600
and my mom was usually in my room playing my Nintendo.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,200
So I had to, I didn't get to play my Nintendo as much as my mother played it.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,800
They also mentioned that there are other demos that are hidden in there.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
My question is why aren't there full games kind of like Animal Crossing had?

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Because now there's the virtual console.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
So?

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Because a virtual console is a money making machine, it's free money, essentially.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
I shouldn't say free money, but very, very low cost money.

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Because, you know, obviously somebody is having to make those manuals and those kinds of things,

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
you know, and QA the game and make sure it works in the emulator and all that stuff,

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
but that, all things considered, is extremely low cost.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
They should have a demo for Mother 3 on there, that would be hilarious.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Actually, that would be kind of rad.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I would kind of hope they would do something like that.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Like give us a game that has only been seen in Japan, I don't know.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
No, just a demo for it. You'll never see the full game over here, just the demo.

63
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Mother 3 came out in Europe.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
That's evil. Oh, that's true. True.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
RasteelUT has a thought. He says in chat.orangelsrader.com,

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
he says, Loki, Nintendo doesn't have many new games, so they have to sell this stuff.

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Well, that's cool. I don't mind them selling this stuff,

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
but like for some of these obscure games on a virtual console,

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I like to be able to try them out before I spend $5 on them.

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
And, of course, there's other people that are piping up.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
You know, Brad from Pod Culture says, I've never played a Zelda game.

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
And, you know, I guess, you know, and Act F says younger people maybe haven't played the games.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
And all very good points.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Again, I guess maybe my perspective is spoiled because I really grew up on this shit.

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Some people were also primarily PC gamers or had like an Apple II or something.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
You know, I had a friend who never had a Nintendo,

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
but she was the world's biggest Doom player that I knew.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, that's cool. That's cool.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
All right, I guess you guys make a good point.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I can admit when you guys make good points.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
But, I mean, like I said in the beginning, this was never a bad thing.

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
It was just kind of, wow, that's interesting.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
So I guess all you guys that never got to play these games will finally get your chance.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,800
And if you like it, you can send Nintendo $5 and get the full version.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Who knows, though, if there will be any Sega Master System games included in Smash Bros. Brawl.

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Not likely since the only Sega character in the game that we know of is Sonic.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
But we did get news this week that Sega Master System games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
That's right.

89
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
A whole resurgence of the Sega Master System.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,800
You know, the Sega Master System never really caught on here in America quite in the same way that Nintendo did.

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
It was always kind of the cultish thing.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll tell you where it caught on. Brazil.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
That's true.

94
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
And they still, you know, Genesis and all that stuff.

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I remember reporting on the Genesis handheld that's still big in Brazil.

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Dan was showing me a video file of Castle of Illusion for Master System, which looks oddly like DuckTales.

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, no matter where you live, Sega Master System games you are going to be able to get very soon.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
It's really funny.

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I actually, Sega popped in my mind.

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
When I was like, I don't even know how old I was, but my uncle, I had to go stay over at his house.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
He's like, oh, and don't worry.

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,800
It's like at my house I've got a lot of cool stuff like Sega and Sonic.

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I had no idea what the fuck that was.

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,800
And then he showed it to me and my mind blew up because I didn't know what to do with it.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
It was crazy.

106
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,800
There was this little blue thing running in circles trying to get these little dancing ring things.

107
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
And my perspective on that was, Satan!

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
And here you are on this program now.

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
And here I am years later.

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Life is funny.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
It is pretty funny.

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Life is funny.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,800
That reminded me of that because he was so excited to tell me about that when my mom forbid me to play video games.

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
What is this, Satan?

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Well, Japan will be the first country to get to indulge in the Sega Master System games.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,800
But it's almost a certainty that other countries will be soon to follow.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Fist of the North Star will be the first game to come out for 600 points.

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
And then, Jamie, you'll like this.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Fantasy Zone will be coming out for 500 points, the original Master System version.

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
That would be pretty cool.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I have it.

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,800
A lot of early speculation that since the Game Gear pretty much ran off the same hardware as the Master System,

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
it's only a matter of time before Game Gear follows on the Virtual Console.

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
That is actually true.

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
They were the same pretty much.

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Which is why a lot of the games that did come out on Game Gear had Master System releases in other countries.

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
And for the record, I have Fantasy Zone on Master System.

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Well, look for those.

129
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
If you don't have Fantasy Zone, maybe you ought to check it out.

130
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Look for those to come to Japan in February.

131
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm sure other regions will only be a little ways behind.

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I mean, it's not like we're talking about the MSX here.

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,800
You know, MSX is something the American and European audiences really don't know much about,

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
because all the games on the console were all in Japanese.

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
So we're probably never going to see that, unfortunately.

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
But that's the system.

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
They gave us Guardian Legend.

138
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, Guardic and Metal Gear, the old-school Metal Gear.

139
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Anyhow.

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
And the actual good sequel.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Instead of the one we got over here.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Snake's Revenge.

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
But anyhow, what other Virtual Console news do we have tonight?

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Well, this one makes me relatively happy,

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,800
is that Super Street Fighter II is going to be on the Virtual Console in the UK.

146
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Over on the PAL systems.

147
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,800
It's going to be 800 Wii points, which is £5.60 or €7.

148
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,800
And it's Ryu Ken, Gael Blanca, Zangief, Chun-Li, Honda, Dhalsim, Wu.

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Most importantly, Kami.

150
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
And the new challengers, yes.

151
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Kami, with her butt.

152
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Unfortunately, it wasn't Kylie Minogue at that time.

153
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
But, you know, playing this can make you reminisce about Kylie Minogue.

154
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
She had camo legs so you couldn't see them.

155
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Isn't that game out here in the US, Virtual Console?

156
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I think it came out last week.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Did it? Cool.

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Well, then there you go, Jamie.

159
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
If you're that excited, you can go grab it in the US, too, it sounds like.

160
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
But I have the original.

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh, well then, la-di-da.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I'm waiting for the Xbox One, to be honest.

163
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Like, why would I go buy this old one when there's going to be the new HD one?

164
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
That's going to be sexy.

165
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,800
When I moved out here, this is how big of a nerd I was.

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I shipped out a whole bunch of my stuff.

167
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
But in my luggage, I brought my Super Nintendo and all my games with it.

168
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
And the first game that I had on the Super Nintendo that was mine

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,800
was one that my boyfriend at the time bought me, which was Super Street Fighter II.

170
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Awesome.

171
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
And I still have the box, everything.

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
That's like my game.

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
And to this day, that remains a pretty great port.

174
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Oh yeah, it was really good.

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,800
You know, Street Fighter Alpha 2 had loading in a cartridge.

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
And I thought that was hilarious.

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I had Super Street Fighter II Turbo for the computer.

178
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
But the thing I remember about it on the PC is it had like remixed music.

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
And it was also the Red Book Audio.

180
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
You could put it in any CD player.

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
It was kind of cool.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Random tidbit.

183
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
So, moving on.

184
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Anyways, there's some other good news coming from Japan about the Wii.

185
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
They've surpassed five million units sold.

186
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Of course, you know, the Wii is the number one selling system in the world.

187
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,800
But, at least, well, the new generation of systems, it is the number one.

188
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Of course, not in the U.S., but, you know, not for long.

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Anyways, right now, they have sold, at least as of January 20th, five million, 19,337 units.

190
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Which is not bad, seeing that it's been out for 14 months already.

191
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,800
In the U.S., their sales were 7.38 million as of the end of 2007.

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
So, doing pretty good.

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Nice.

194
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Not unsurprising, but nice.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I mean, we all knew Wiis were selling like crazy, no matter where you are.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So, there you have it.

197
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
One other thing that's only sure to sell more Wiis, more and more,

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,800
is the release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which, of course, we were talking about a little earlier.

199
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Well, the demo kiosks are on their way to Japan.

200
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
In fact, if you look on YouTube, it's already there.

201
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,800
It was reported earlier this week that 30 shops throughout Japan were going to be getting kiosks with Super Smash Brothers Brawl on January 26th.

202
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
And, of course, that was yesterday.

203
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
So, some clips are already hitting YouTube.

204
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
So, pretty awesome.

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,800
So, it's only a matter of time before we find out all the secrets that the Smash Brothers dojo has yet to reveal.

206
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,800
And I did look at some of the YouTube clips, and I have to admit, the game looks a lot like Super Smash Brothers Melee,

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
which isn't to be surprised, but it definitely feels like it has that next level to it.

208
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
You know what I mean?

209
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
It definitely feels like the game is taken to the next level.

210
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Actually, I've been kind of seeing the Subspace Emissary, or whatever it's called.

211
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
That looks really cool, as far as a side-scrolling thing.

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
And I think Nintendo should make a game, not necessarily like Brawl,

213
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,800
but just a side-scrolling, kind of a beat-em-up type of game with Nintendo characters.

214
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I think that would be really awesome.

215
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,800
I can't wait to play that level that's the old-school Mario level that scrolls automatically while you're in it.

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
That's awesome.

217
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
The thing about this game that I think is going to make it a winner,

218
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
and I realize fanboys everywhere are peeing their pants over it.

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I think it's the same reason why WarioWare.

220
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
It's variety.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Yeah.

222
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
It is variety.

223
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
The game sounds like, really, they have thought of everything.

224
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Variety.

225
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
And that's value.

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
It is.

227
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
It really is.

228
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
You really feel like you're getting your money's worth, I think.

229
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
But then again, obviously, you have to withhold judgment until the game actually comes out.

230
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,800
But certainly the hype, they're doing a wonderful job.

231
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Well, we'll see, right?

232
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
We will soon see.

233
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Well, for our friends who are fortunate enough to have a Wii right now,

234
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
it's been said that Okami Wii will be out in the UK, actually, by the summer.

235
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
We're getting our version over here on 25th March.

236
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
But there's not a specific date stated for the UK.

237
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
But it will be coming out.

238
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
That's pretty cool.

239
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm glad to see it's making its way out, finally.

240
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
And there's, you know, just real quick, I want to say about Okami real quick.

241
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I actually kind of missed it in the PS2, because when it came out, I was too busy with,

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
ooh, Xbox, you know, I was too busy with all that,

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,800
as I think a lot of the late-gen games from the PS2 were kind of like that.

244
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
So I'm kind of looking forward to being able to give this a real shot on the Wii,

245
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.

246
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
So I'm glad to hear it's on its way.

247
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I'd like to see what they've done for controls on it.

248
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Me too.

249
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,800
From what I hear, it's not really changed that much from the PS2 version.

250
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
What, no Waggle?

251
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Well, they're going to have Waggle in there, but it's pretty much a straight port.

252
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Don't expect anything additional to it.

253
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Alright, alright.

254
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I did hear there's widescreen support, though, which is pretty awesome.

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm sold.

256
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,800
There's a new handheld MP4 player capable of running old-school Nintendo emulators,

257
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
and it's powered by the sun, using solar power.

258
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,800
It can also play MP3s, store ebooks, and records audio, and of course displays images,

259
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
all for $123.32.

260
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
The cool part, though, is it also has a USB port to connect to other portable devices

261
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,800
to share the solar energy it has collected, so you can power your other devices with it.

262
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,800
But it's kind of funny, though, because the whole thing looks very similar to the original Game Boy Advance.

263
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:38,800
So, I don't know, one of those things that you probably only see in Korea or something like that.

264
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
If nothing else, though, it makes for a great headline, you know?

265
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Console powered by sun!

266
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
But then how do I play late at night?

267
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
That's the bummer.

268
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
What was it, that one game member?

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I have to go outside to play a game?

270
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
This makes no sense.

271
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
There was that one game that came out on the Game Boy Advance, and I know, I can't remember the title.

272
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
A Boktai!

273
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
But the problem with the original Game Boy Advance is when you play it out in the sun,

274
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,800
you can't see it, because it's not backlit, and it made it hard to see.

275
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,800
So, not a good plan, unfortunately.

276
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Yeah, I was not a big Boktai fan.

277
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
The one that came out after that, which I can't...

278
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Oh, it was kind of like a sequel, but it was on the DS.

279
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Damn it, I can't remember, but they kind of took the sun part out of it,

280
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
but it was still an element of the game, but you could just hit a button to charge it.

281
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Yeah, it was something that Hideo Kojima did.

282
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
It was like a sequel.

283
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
It was on the DS.

284
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I can't remember the name.

285
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm sure someone in chat will save me.

286
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Solar Knights, was that it?

287
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Probably.

288
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Anyhow, another game making its way, another port.

289
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Nintendo DS is getting a version of Guitar Hero.

290
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
That's right, you're going to soon be able to play Guitar Hero on the go on the DS,

291
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
but it might not be what you think.

292
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Activision has filed a trademark for a game called Guitar Hero on Tour,

293
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,800
and of course some news that spilled earlier this week from a French website

294
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
that Guitar Hero on Tour was on the way to Nintendo DS eventually,

295
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
so who knows what this game could be.

296
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Probably a spin-off game.

297
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I would imagine there's not going to be a little guitar controller you actually plug in.

298
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Actually, I think there will be.

299
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Really? That's going to be weird.

300
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Because here's how they're going to probably do it.

301
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
They're going to have an attachment that plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot,

302
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
and there you go, you can have your additional buttons like that.

303
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I was going to assume maybe it was a tapping game,

304
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
kind of like Elite Beat Agents,

305
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
but you have the guitar on the lower screen or something,

306
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
you can tap the beats or something, does that make sense?

307
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I guess it makes sense, but I think that they're actually going to have it where you play the guitar.

308
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
The only thing I would think about, though, is if they did have it where you play the guitar like that,

309
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
there's no real easy way to see the screen and play the guitar.

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Well, actually, no, I take that back,

311
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
because you can hold it in your hand so that you look at the top screen

312
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,800
and use your left hand to hit all the keys and stuff.

313
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
It could work.

314
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
It's a weird idea, but it could work.

315
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
But if it does come out, it'll be probably selling quite a bit.

316
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Yeah, and regardless, we all know this is just a way to further milk a franchise that is prime.

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
It's not quite dead yet.

318
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
The hot thing right now, right?

319
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Jamie, I know you play a lot of games on the DS.

320
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Is Guitar Hero something you'd want to play on the DS?

321
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I'd try it out, but otherwise, probably not.

322
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It would be a nice diversion for a quick moment.

323
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I have Rock Band.

324
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
True, true.

325
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
By the way, oh, I totally forgot to say this during my gaming week,

326
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,800
but how could I forget, like, Thursday, you know what I did?

327
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I ran home, I powered on the Xbox, I put in Guitar Hero 3, and I downloaded me some Journey.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
And it was awesome.

329
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I just wanted to get that out there.

330
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
We were listening to the demo on that.

331
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Oh, it was so hot.

332
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I downloaded it, I didn't care.

333
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I just wanted Journey.

334
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Journey in Guitar Hero makes me happy.

335
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Anyhow, you know what else makes me happy?

336
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
It's hearing from you guys, our listeners.

337
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Every week, you guys send us e-mails at mailbag at orangelandrady.com,

338
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
and we pull a few of our favorites to read here on air.

339
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Remember, if you want to be included in this segment,

340
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
mailbag at orangelandrady.com.

341
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
So Dark Sakura is going to reach in the mailbag and pull out a few e-mails,

342
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
of which I understand there weren't a whole lot this week, but some.

343
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
There were some.

344
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
One of them is not going to be read because, honestly, it's worthless.

345
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh, snap.

346
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Because clearly if said person had been listening to the entirety of the thing,

347
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
they wouldn't have taken it completely out of context.

348
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,800
So therefore, addressing lucky nuts,

349
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,800
which just instantly indicates the quality of the person listening to this,

350
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
fuck you.

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
And I mean that with none of the respect that you intended as well.

352
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I didn't even see this e-mail.

353
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm going to have to check it out.

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
What was the comment about how I said I would be interested in physics

355
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
if not for the math?

356
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,800
You can be interested in a topic and not actually care to do anything with it.

357
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Fucking moron.

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Was it tongue-in-cheek or what?

359
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I don't think so.

360
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Interesting.

361
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
All right, whatever.

362
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Anyway, DidYouLoseASock wrote in and sent a link to StarTropics Wii decoder.

363
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,800
It was on YouTube because we are broadcasting, I don't know, it's 22 seconds,

364
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
but I'll link it in the chatroom.

365
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Apparently this is how it's supposed to work in StarTropics.

366
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Do we have more music?

367
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
No, that's the end of that music.

368
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Oh.

369
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Sorry.

370
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
But I did watch the video earlier this week.

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I can kind of describe it for our listeners.

372
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It's pretty rad.

373
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Inside the manual, you know how when you download games on Virtual Console,

374
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
you have the manual?

375
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Well, what's cool is that they actually included a little hyperlink

376
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
where it says in the story, you got a letter,

377
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
and when you click on a letter, it actually brings up the original letter,

378
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,800
the text, and then there's this little animation of the letter being dipped in water

379
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
and then it says code, frequency 747.

380
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
So they did include it.

381
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
We were kind of wondering how are they going to get the letter in there,

382
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
and it is in there.

383
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
You just have to dig through the manual a little bit, but the code is there.

384
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Sorry if I spoiled the code for anyone playing the game.

385
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
It's pretty neat.

386
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
That is pretty cool.

387
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I think that's very intelligently done, I should say.

388
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
It was a cute way to get around it.

389
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I'll check out the video in just a sec.

390
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Also, we have an e-mail from Silver Chaos.

391
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Last week, as of when I'm writing this,

392
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
you all were talking about the dusty PS3 with Ranma.

393
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Sorry if I felt it wrong.

394
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah, you did, but I won't point it out.

395
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
And he brought up the fact that it might have been a setup.

396
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
You were all discussing who might have done it,

397
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
mentioning Microsoft and Nintendo as possibilities,

398
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
but you missed the most obvious answer,

399
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
and I'm surprised no one in chat mentioned this,

400
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
the makers of Dustcat 3.

401
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
If you people thought that Dust is this big problem,

402
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,800
they would rush out and purchase one to protect their beloved PS3s.

403
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Thanks for reading this in need of a new screen name, Silver Chaos.

404
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I like your screen name.

405
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I think it's kind of cool.

406
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
All righty.

407
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Is this supposed to be Lucky Nuts?

408
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Lucky Nuts is clearly not all that lucky.

409
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,800
The hate is spewing out of the mailbag this week.

410
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Ranma.

411
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
They can hate on me. I can hate back.

412
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
All right.

413
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I am a PMSing female, goddammit.

414
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Do we have a happy email we can read?

415
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Yes.

416
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay.

417
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Robert M., our good buddy, went to Video Games Live,

418
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
so I'm going to read this.

419
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Well, I paid to see Video Games Live at Fox Theater in St. Louis

420
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
and enjoyed the experience.

421
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
A few minor FUs presented as wishes, such as it is.

422
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,800
One, wish the mid-balcony seats weren't high enough to obscure the top part

423
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
of the video screen behind the lighting structure,

424
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
had I known that I would have paid more for the lower-level seating.

425
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Two, wish I had been in these lower-level seating at least

426
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
to get better connections with other DS players.

427
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
My attempts to start four-player Pac-Man versus matches

428
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
ended in connection failures.

429
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Fun to connect with that many gamers, though.

430
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Three, I almost wish the Zelda section had featured more music

431
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
than the iconic overworld theme,

432
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,800
something more along the lines of their medley of music from the Sonic games.

433
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
And finally, one major FU, well, absolutely not really,

434
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
ending the show with one-winged angel.

435
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Enjoyable experience overall, part of me wish it had been longer,

436
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
you know, than the three hours it ran, plus pre-show and intermission.

437
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
He also sent another email.

438
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Oh, just about to add one more,

439
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
because he couldn't go to the chat room for some reason.

440
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,800
He sent me to Square Enix for not allowing use of their video in the show.

441
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

442
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Last email.

443
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
You know why?

444
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I think it's because they have something to do.

445
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Don't quote me on this,

446
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
but I think they have something to do with the competing show, Play,

447
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
because Play is a derivative of Dear Friends.

448
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
It's put on by the same production company.

449
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
So, something to think about.

450
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
And GS68 says he went to play in San Jose,

451
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
which I had no idea it was even going to be in San Jose

452
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
or I might have gone.

453
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
That's like two hours away.

454
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Yeah.

455
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
For a good concert, I'll drive that.

456
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You know what I mean?

457
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Oh, yeah.

458
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I drive that far just to see one person.

459
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Hey, I drove to the San Jose HP Pavilion,

460
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
or whatever it's called, to see the Spice Girls.

461
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Worth every dollar of gas it took me.

462
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Yeah.

463
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Alright, anyhow.

464
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
So, anyway, he says he went to play in San Jose GS68

465
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
and says there were so many people in PictoChat

466
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
that people were actually using Room B.

467
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Wow.

468
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You don't see that.

469
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Anyway, sorry.

470
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Well, I remember doing PictoChat at E3 a couple years ago

471
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
and realized that one of the people I was talking to

472
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
was Melody.

473
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
We were in the Nintendogs line.

474
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
That's great.

475
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah.

476
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Anyway, this last one says,

477
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Hi, OLR.

478
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
It's officially a year I've been listening to your show.

479
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
You rock and keep up the good work.

480
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I listen to OLR on my iPod to keep my sanity

481
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
while I do homework.

482
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,800
And then when I run out of recent episodes to listen to,

483
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I tune into your radio station and listen to the music.

484
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Great job on everything.

485
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
And you have taught me important lessons.

486
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
After the band, I feel like I'm less immature.

487
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Now, is DDR dead?

488
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I don't seem to see much DDR action anymore.

489
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
And when I used to play DDR,

490
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I'd get people to stop and watch me play.

491
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Now, people really don't care

492
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
if someone's triple A-ing Mac songs.

493
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Also, how do I deal with a kid at school

494
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
who thinks I'm a nerd,

495
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
yet he devoted all of his time and money

496
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
to do World of Warcraft?

497
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Can I use the fact he plays World of Warcraft against him

498
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
and was...

499
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Thank you, Chris.

500
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Can you hear me?

501
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
She said yes.

502
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
And was it a mistake using my $100 Dell gift card

503
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
towards buying a widescreen computer monitor

504
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
instead of buying an Xbox 360 with it?

505
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Too many questions, I know.

506
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
This is from Sakura Max.

507
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I like her.

508
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Can I say this about DDR is dead?

509
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
We kind of got into this in a previous episode.

510
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Let me try to phrase this best I can.

511
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
No, DDR is not dead.

512
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
But DDR has evolved,

513
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
and it hasn't evolved in the way I think

514
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
most of us hardcore fans that grew up with DDR

515
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
wanted it to.

516
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
It didn't evolve for us.

517
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It evolved to where the money's at,

518
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
which you can't blame them for doing.

519
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
That's what they want to do.

520
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
But when you look at the mixes,

521
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Disney Channel, plug into your TV,

522
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
my first DDR.

523
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
DDR is kind of geared towards 12-year-old girls

524
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
and their slumber parties,

525
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
which, again, that's where the money's at.

526
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
It's disappointing because you would think

527
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
that there's two distinctly different audiences,

528
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
the 12-year-old girls and the anime convention-going people

529
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
that kind of helped foster DDR in the first place.

530
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
You would think we would get a new mix

531
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
that caters to us a little bit,

532
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
and I suppose you could say Supernova 2 is that,

533
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
but is it really anything new?

534
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
No.

535
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I always kind of said they needed to let the people

536
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
responsible for the Xbox versions of DDR

537
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
develop the next arcade mix

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
because the last time we ever saw any true innovation

539
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
out of DDR was all done on the Xbox versions,

540
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
good and bad, but at least it was innovation.

541
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
That's all I'm really going to say about DDR.

542
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Can I finish reading the e-mail?

543
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Sorry, yes, you may.

544
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Well, I'm going to give my...

545
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Well, you know, with inflation,

546
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I guess it's $5 worth.

547
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Um...

548
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Are you really that incredibly amusing?

549
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Okay.

550
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I made Chris laugh.

551
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
That was great.

552
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Remember when we threw you into the fire

553
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
and pretended that we were going to kill you?

554
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I thought somebody was going to be reading an e-mail.

555
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Oh, yeah, okay, fine.

556
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Okay.

557
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Yes, you can use the fact

558
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
that that guy plays World of Warcraft against him,

559
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
and I actually...

560
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
If I had an option of getting a monitor

561
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
or an Xbox 360 right now, I'd get a monitor,

562
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,800
but then again, I already have an Xbox 360.

563
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
So, um...

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
And he assigns this kid who likes Toho music

565
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
on OLR station MMOs and Crysis,

566
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
and there's a PS on here that is addressed to Loki.

567
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Loki, if you haven't yet, go on crymod.com.

568
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
It has a bunch of Crysis mods and maps.

569
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Download the...

570
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
I guess Physis?

571
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,800
It's P-H-Y-S-I-S 3 map.

572
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
It has random contractions

573
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
that showcase the physics engines of Crysis.

574
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I'll try that.

575
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Actually, I finally got my second graphics card in

576
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
and running in SLI,

577
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,800
and it's tough because overclocking one graphics card's easy.

578
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Overclocking two graphics cards is not easy

579
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
because you actually have to flash them.

580
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
So, I've been playing around with that a little bit,

581
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
trying to get it stable,

582
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
and benchmarks now.

583
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I got 17,000-something in 3 Mark 06,

584
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
which is supposedly pretty good,

585
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
but I have to try Crysis yet with my cards in SLI.

586
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
He offers another description for that particular mod.

587
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
It says,

588
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,800
You get to play bowling with a barrel with Korean soldiers as pins.

589
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
I've seen videos of that. It's funny.

590
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Drop weights on a wedge to make a truck go flying, and much more.

591
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
And that's the last email.

592
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I'll have to try it.

593
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Let me say a comment here from chat real quick

594
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
regarding the whole DDR thing we were talking about a minute ago.

595
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
RossdielUT says,

596
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
in chat.orangetownstrator.com,

597
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Rob, there's clearly not as much money for DDR

598
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
as there is for SingStar, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band.

599
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
And you know, I hate to say it,

600
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,800
because I do love Konami and all that stuff,

601
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
and they really did start a revolution, no pun intended.

602
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
But the more I think about it,

603
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
the more I really want Harmonix to do a dance game.

604
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Like, I really want them to make a dance game

605
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,800
that would use a similar DDR mat to what we've already bought.

606
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,800
That would make me very happy for Harmonix to develop something like that,

607
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,800
because honestly, I think Harmonix gets American audiences

608
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
in a way Konami just never did,

609
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
or when they did, they were never noticed.

610
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Because I think the Xbox versions of DDR were great,

611
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,800
but even then, it didn't ever take DDR to the next, next level.

612
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
And I don't know, I think Harmonix would just kind of start from scratch.

613
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
I mean, they would have to.

614
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
And I think DDR has needed that for a while.

615
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
I think there needs to be a DDR mix that starts from scratch.

616
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
You know, say Konami will sue all you want,

617
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,800
but if Harmonix was able to innovate guitar freaks

618
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
in a way that the game feels completely different,

619
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm sure the same can be done for a dance game.

620
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,800
So, I don't know if we have any people from Harmonix that listen to this program,

621
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
but if we do, please be a known.

622
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I would like you to make a dance game for me, please?

623
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Or I would like, you know, I wouldn't mind if Konami would reinvent,

624
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,800
but if Konami is going to make a new one, they need to start over from scratch.

625
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Throw out all the old code, we are starting over, mean it.

626
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Throw out all your old code and start again.

627
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm serious.

628
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Anyhow, sorry.

629
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
We can get back to gaming news now.

630
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Can we?

631
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Yes, sorry.

632
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Okay.

633
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Well, this is a weird bit of news, but apparently the Gizmondo is coming back.

634
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
What?

635
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Yes, apparently they had a Gizmondo teaser site stating that the legend is reborn

636
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,800
and exciting physic worlds and some other stuff,

637
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,800
but apparently it will be back according to, at least in some form,

638
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Plextech technical director, Ian Murphy,

639
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,800
insists that the product has been recovered from liquidators

640
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,800
and Plextech is bringing it back to the market.

641
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Okay.

642
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Now, some folks are asking in chat, wasn't this then retracted a little later?

643
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Was this story ended up being retracted?

644
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
It might have been, I don't know.

645
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm not sure if it's been retracted or not.

646
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,800
At least this article didn't really say that,

647
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:46,800
but he basically said that the device's second coming is happening as soon as May 2008.

648
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
But, I don't know.

649
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
To be honest, if it was retracted, great,

650
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
because I don't think it was too good to begin with.

651
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
All right.

652
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Well, this is not being retracted, and actually I think this is kind of cool.

653
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,800
I did not realize this franchise was set to make a comeback.

654
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
It's a game called Populous.

655
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I don't know if you guys ever played this.

656
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
I remember that.

657
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Yeah, it was on Super Nintendo, but it was more of a computer game.

658
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I think it's more best remembered as a computer game.

659
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Well, it's going to have a resurgence on the DS,

660
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
and Electronic Arts is bringing Populous out for the DS.

661
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
But here's what's really cool.

662
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,800
One thing about Populous was that basically the game had,

663
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I would call it different skins.

664
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
There were many different skins the game had,

665
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,800
and you would build these cities that were human cities or Martian cities,

666
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
or it was more like, I shouldn't say human cities.

667
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,800
It was like a medieval city or a new age city or what have you.

668
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,800
But this is really cool, and the DS version of Populous,

669
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
a new type of skin is going to be added.

670
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
It's a Nintendo civilization.

671
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
That's right.

672
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
The small cities start off as a little Game & Watch system.

673
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Then they grow into NESs.

674
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Then they grow into Game Boys,

675
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,800
which grow into Super Nintendos and DSs and so on,

676
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
until the Supreme Nintendo Wii won.

677
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
However, I would like to point out,

678
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,800
I noticed a distinct lack of Virtual Boy in the civilization.

679
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
What's up with that?

680
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Are you just trying to pretend it never existed?

681
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Maybe.

682
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I was going to say that as far as the Gizmondo story,

683
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
the story was retracted at one time,

684
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
then the retraction was retracted, so it is coming.

685
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
What?

686
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
What does that even mean, the retraction was retracted?

687
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
The first retraction was a mistake.

688
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Make up your goddamn mind.

689
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
No, the first retraction was a mistake.

690
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
It is actually coming.

691
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Scary enough.

692
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
DM ends in chat and trying to make a joke about OLRs

693
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
that you can evolve your crappy guys on a show to a Sunday show,

694
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
like there should be an OLR skin.

695
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Actually, I think that's kind of a cool idea,

696
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
not so much what you're suggesting,

697
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
but a version of Populous where you can make your own skins.

698
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
That would be kind of fun.

699
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,800
A little silly, but fun.

700
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I am definitely looking forward to Populous DS.

701
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
That will be a good chance to revisit a series I haven't played in a long time.

702
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Well, I'm glad you'll have that opportunity.

703
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,800
For people who like games on their iPod,

704
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Pole Position is coming out to iPod.

705
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
So Namco is releasing Pole Position Remix.

706
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
It's available through iTunes.

707
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,800
And you drive with the iPod wheel.

708
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,800
So I hope that it comes out okay,

709
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
but they're actually saying that it's the worst of all iPod games that are available now.

710
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Don't.

711
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,800
But another reviewer said that it's the best one out.

712
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
It's five bucks.

713
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
If you've got five bucks, you know,

714
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
and don't have to spend it on kitty litter, give it a try.

715
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Or worse, or better.

716
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
You know, it makes sense though,

717
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
a driving game with the iPod wheel.

718
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I mean, it is kind of a logical step,

719
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
so I would think it would be okay.

720
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
But then again, Pole Position is a little bit,

721
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I don't know, old?

722
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Pole Position is definitely one of those games

723
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,800
that was way cooler when you were playing it at Chuck E. Cheese when you were six, right?

724
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Like, you go back and play it now, you're like...

725
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I had a Pole Position cabinet in my house for a long time.

726
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

727
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It had a name in it, and we had, actually, Dan found an identical one.

728
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
That's right, you had a stand-up cabinet for Pole Position.

729
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
We had a stand-up cabinet.

730
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I remember Chuck E. Cheese, they had the sit in the thing Pole Position.

731
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Oh, those were great!

732
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Those were awesome, but like, it was better when you were six.

733
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Remember Hard Drivin'?

734
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
That sucked.

735
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Hard Drivin', no.

736
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Hard Drivin' was good because I worked at a Namco arcade

737
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
when I was out of high school,

738
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
and one day I was there and we had no customers

739
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
and I'd been up all night and I took a nap and won.

740
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
There was a...

741
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
They were dark.

742
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
There was a game that was on the PC that was very similar to Hard Drivin'.

743
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,800
It was called Stunts, and you made your own stunt tracks,

744
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
but the graphics were pretty much the same as Hard Drivin'.

745
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
It was great, though, because if you made a bunch of little 45-degree ramps...

746
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
There was stunt drivin', too.

747
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Yeah, it was similar to that, but if you made a bunch of 45-degree ramps

748
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,800
and just drove on it really fast, your car would get up to like 500 miles an hour

749
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
and it would fly into the air like a tornado.

750
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
It was awesome.

751
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
If you think about it, games like Burnout,

752
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
you can trace their roots back to Hard Drivin'.

753
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I remember playing Test Drive 3 on the PC with the really crappy graphics.

754
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Hey, screw you, I had Test Drive on the Commodore 64.

755
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Well, this might as well have been on the Commodore 64

756
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
because the graphics were crap, but it was fun.

757
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I used to drive and run over chickens in that.

758
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Hey, when I was eight, Test Drive had like the best graphics ever.

759
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
What are you talking about?

760
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Well, this game may not be as good of an idea

761
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,800
as, say, you know, Pole Position on the iPod,

762
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,800
but there is a fan made, and I don't even know where this came from

763
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
because I think it was a joke at one time,

764
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
or they had a demo for it a while back,

765
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,800
but it's Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.

766
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,800
It's a fan made game made with RPG Maker,

767
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,800
and it basically tells an epic story of post-Cyberpocalypse,

768
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Neo-New York, in the wake of the great b-ball purge of 2041

769
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,800
that threatens to own the entirety of your existence for some time.

770
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Well, they actually have a bunch of weird stuff in there.

771
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
It's cool, though.

772
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
It's basically an RPG, and you have like your basketball moves you do

773
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
and little mini games and stuff.

774
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,800
It is free to download, and free is the magic word, of course.

775
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Free is a good price for this story,

776
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,800
and if you're interested, there's...

777
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm sure you can find it out there.

778
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
There are a bunch of different links and stuff hosting it.

779
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,800
The website that actually has the info is from a gaming forum.

780
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,800
It looks like gamingw.net, and just check their forums.

781
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,800
They've got the full game from Tales of Games Studios.

782
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
It presents Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gayden.

783
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Wow.

784
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Okay, well if you want to play a real RPG,

785
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
might I suggest World of Warcraft?

786
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Obviously, there's going to be people who want to argue with me on that point,

787
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
but you can argue this.

788
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
There's definitely a shitload of people playing World of Warcraft.

789
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
You want to know how much is a shitload?

790
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
It's 10 million.

791
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
That's right, it's been announced this week

792
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
that World of Warcraft now has 10 million subscribers.

793
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Now, they're counting people who are still in their free trials and stuff,

794
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
but whatever, there's 10 million people playing World of Warcraft right now.

795
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,800
To put that in perspective, and a lot of sites have been putting it this way,

796
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
that's half the size of Australia,

797
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
because Australia's population is like 20 million.

798
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Now, granted, you have to think about Australia is mostly desert in the middle,

799
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
in the outback.

800
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Most of the people kind of live on the coast, but whatever.

801
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
It's still a pretty staggering number there.

802
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Chris, I know you missed that.

803
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,800
10 million subscribers in World of Warcraft announced this week.

804
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
That's a lot.

805
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
That's not surprising.

806
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
And they all live in China, which is amazing.

807
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Actually, no, that's no joke.

808
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Actually, there are 5.5 million of those.

809
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Over half of those subscribers are in Asia.

810
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
So not just China, but the Asian region.

811
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,800
2.5 here in North America and 2 million subscribers in Europe.

812
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
That's pretty impressive.

813
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Yeah, well, some of those people from North America are kind of-

814
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Wait, I'm sorry, Chris. And a mic? What?

815
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Oh, never mind. I didn't see you.

816
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
I didn't see you. Stole one.

817
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Yeah, I stole it.

818
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Some of those people in America are not that bright.

819
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Like, I surf the forums.

820
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I'm not active on the forums because I just can't deal with it.

821
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Oh, yeah. World of Warcraft forums, home of some serious lulz.

822
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah.

823
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Serious lulz.

824
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Best one today.

825
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Server crash was deliberate hack by horde.

826
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Oh, noes. The horde crashed by server.

827
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
And the funny thing is this wasn't a joke.

828
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
This chick at- or it could be a guy. I don't know.

829
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
This person actually-

830
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Wait, is it a blood elf female?

831
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Yes.

832
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
It's a guy.

833
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Okay. This person- it's a level 7, too.

834
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
This person actually, like, was damn serious and everyone was, like, going,

835
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
oh, lulz broke the internet. What is it? The horde insert-

836
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,800
kills you and your internet. That's right. Your internet is under attack.

837
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,800
You know, so everyone- this person's, like, sitting there defending himself.

838
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
It's, like, no, no, no, I'm serious.

839
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
And, you know, they've got a reason for it, but it's just, like,

840
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,800
the horde is not after your fucking server.

841
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
ColorOfSakura says in chat.orensonsradio.com,

842
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,800
WoWForums is like the Gaia of gaming forums.

843
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Oh, God, I know.

844
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I have never seen it so, like, plainly put, but that is a very good point.

845
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Alright, let's move on from the internet lulz to something a little more newsworthy.

846
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Well, for-

847
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,800
It says for PlayStation 2 release in March, Ratchet and Clank Size Matters

848
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,800
will be coming from PSP to the PS2.

849
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,800
And also mentioned is-

850
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Well, I'm trying to- I thought there was another game mentioned in this.

851
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Is it not loading?

852
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, given that it's, you know, completely crashed my browser before.

853
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Don't-

854
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Well, Silent Hill Origins is the other game.

855
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Well, yeah, Silent Hill Origins. Well, we had already talked about that.

856
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
It wasn't particularly mentioned here.

857
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,800
But basically Ratchet and Clank Size Matters was officially announced on Sony's site.

858
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,800
So what basically- both these games that, like, everybody kinda knew was coming,

859
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
but like nobody wanted to announce, finally they're like,

860
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
oh yeah, since the entire internet found out, you know, the horde ruined it for everybody,

861
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
these games are coming up.

862
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Surprise, I'm sure you're shocked.

863
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I don't know about you, Jamie, but I'm actually excited about Silent Hill Zero on the PlayStation 2.

864
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Well, hell yeah.

865
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Because, like, Silent Hill wasn't really a game I wanted to play on the PSP, you know what I mean?

866
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah.

867
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Like, I was actually thinking of getting a light just so I could hook it up to the TV.

868
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Because Silent Hill's a scary game, you know, the little screen's not that scary.

869
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
I like scary.

870
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I like scary too.

871
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I like the kind of scary that fucks with your head.

872
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Well, if Silent Hill isn't your cup of tea, then maybe some old Sega arcade games are.

873
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Apparently the Niomi BIOS has been cracked and now will be...

874
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Finally?

875
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Yeah, finally.

876
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Ah, that means Planet Harrier.

877
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Now that means that this brand new emulator, well actually it's an emulator for the Dreamcast,

878
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,800
will be able to run wonderful games such as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Ferrari, F355 Challenge, and Ikaruga.

879
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Planet Harrier.

880
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Also known as the good stuff.

881
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Planet Harrier.

882
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Yes, so the Niomi games are going to be coming soon.

883
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Awesome.

884
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,800
More news as soon as we get some.

885
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Nice.

886
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Well, I want to go back to World of Warcraft for a minute, but not to talk about some internet

887
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
lols.

888
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I actually want to talk about something kind of a little bit sad.

889
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
It has to do with a Virginia Tech student.

890
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,800
This is not related to the tragedy that happened last year, but it was just another unfortunate

891
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
tragedy.

892
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,800
There was a student there, a 21 year old senior named Daniel Kim who actually killed himself

893
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
in a target parking lot in Virginia.

894
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,800
And of course, what was the first thing that was blamed in the death?

895
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Gaming.

896
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
Video games.

897
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
It was the Horde!

898
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Individuals...

899
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Not okay.

900
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Individuals were automatically making assumptions about his death.

901
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,800
But this writer here at Filefront.com who ran this article did a little research and

902
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,800
found out that actually one of the things that this person really liked and enjoyed

903
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
in life was World of Warcraft.

904
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
He developed a lot of friendships in the game over the past couple years.

905
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,800
In fact, the only warning signs that he was thinking of doing this were coming from World

906
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
of Warcraft.

907
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,800
The players that played with him in World of Warcraft were sending emails to university

908
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,800
telling them about warning signs, but little action was taken by the university because

909
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
of the warning signs.

910
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
And unfortunately, it came to this.

911
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,800
So, next time you want to bash video games, think about the community and the friendships

912
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
that people build throughout the video game community.

913
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
You know what I mean?

914
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Well, how else is the university going to take an email that says the Horde is going

915
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,800
to kill Billy or whatever his name is?

916
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I'm sorry, Loki, I can't laugh at that.

917
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
It's just very unfortunate, the whole thing.

918
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,800
But it makes me angry that people always jump to these conclusions.

919
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
And of course, you know, you save Virginia Tech, you think about that horrible, horrible

920
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
tragedy that happened there last year.

921
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,800
And who is the very first guy to come out and start blaming video games?

922
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Lord Voldemort.

923
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
And if you've listened to this show enough, you know who I'm referencing.

924
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Lord Voldemort comes right out and blames the video games.

925
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Turns out, guy never played, he didn't own a single video game thing.

926
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,800
There were mental problems that went beyond anything entertainment based.

927
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,800
So it just, it pisses me off that people jump to these conclusions.

928
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Okay, he's a lawyer, he can say whatever he wants.

929
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Oh, well, you know what?

930
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
No repercussions.

931
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,800
No, there is repercussions because there's angry people like us that get on the internet

932
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
and yell at them.

933
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I know, serious stuff, right?

934
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Regardless, this kind of stuff makes me very angsty when I hear people jumping to conclusions

935
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
about the video games made me do it or whatever.

936
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,800
So what better time for us to bring on the FUs of the week?

937
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:51,800
My FU of the week goes to my finger because it's been catching a lot more lately and I'm

938
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,800
going to have to go to the doctor next week and it's also starting in my index finger

939
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,800
now.

940
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,800
So it's looking like I'm going to have to have surgery on my hand.

941
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,800
But maybe I'll get disability and not have to go to work.

942
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,800
The thing is if I had that much time off of work, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.

943
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,800
And if I couldn't use my hand, I really wouldn't know what to do.

944
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
I would be so bored.

945
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
And that, and I haven't been able to draw anything in like three weeks.

946
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
It's been really a pain in the butt.

947
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
So whatever you do, don't let the evil get into your hand.

948
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Otherwise you're going to have to chop it off with a chainsaw.

949
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
That's right.

950
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,800
But then I can have a shotgun hand.

951
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
That is the plus.

952
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
Wow.

953
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
I can replace it with a machine gun hand.

954
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
You know, I thought the Wonder shows and stuff was bad, but you guys are...

955
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
This is not Boomstick.

956
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
You guys are taking it to a whole new level.

957
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Some folks in chat are giving you the finger, but only so you can type.

958
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,800
Thank you.

959
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
All right.

960
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Moving on, Loki.

961
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Effie to another one of my 360s crapping out.

962
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Luckily, though, I found out there is another way to fix it,

963
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,800
which involves heating up the motherboard with either a heat gun,

964
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800
or in this case, since I don't own a heat gun, a blow dryer,

965
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,800
until it gets really hot and then hopefully fixes everything.

966
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,800
That's about as effective as, I don't know,

967
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,800
throwing your console at a wall and hopefully fixing it that way.

968
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,800
But I'm going to give it a shot because, hey, what's the worst that can happen?

969
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
It's already broken.

970
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Wow.

971
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
All right.

972
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,800
I'm knocking on wood.

973
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
My turn?

974
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
Yes.

975
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,800
My FU of the week goes to this A&W float, which I saw at the grocery store.

976
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Who doesn't like root beer floats, right?

977
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
I do.

978
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,800
I love root beer floats.

979
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Exactly.

980
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
But have you tried this?

981
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
No.

982
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
It's shit.

983
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
I think there's a little bit.

984
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
You want to try some of this?

985
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
No.

986
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Here, try it.

987
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Try it on there.

988
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I don't like it.

989
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
That's not bad.

990
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
The first taste to me was good and the second one to me was blah.

991
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
FU to all y'all.

992
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
You don't know what you're talking about.

993
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
It's too sweet.

994
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
It is a little sweet.

995
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,800
It's missing that nice contrast between root beer and ice cream.

996
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,800
It's like what happens when you put too much ice cream and root beer together and it melts

997
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
and it's flat.

998
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,800
FU to A&W for this thing that is no substitute for the real thing.

999
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
And FU to you guys for disagreeing with me.

1000
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,800
How hard is it seriously to make a root beer float?

1001
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I mean, come on.

1002
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Well, I do.

1003
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,800
No, they should have.

1004
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,800
The concept of it all being in one bottle is interesting.

1005
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
You know what?

1006
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
I wonder if this would work.

1007
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Root beer with the vanilla Dippin' Dots dropped in there.

1008
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
I can say at the store they not only have the A&W float, but they have Sunkist floats

1009
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
too.

1010
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
But I don't think I'll be trying those.

1011
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,800
I don't think I'll be trying those.

1012
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
Well, like orange cream soda is actually really good.

1013
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Those are bad.

1014
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,800
I feel like a creamsicle.

1015
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Sane Delight floats?

1016
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
No, Sane Delight would be nasty.

1017
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
No, that wouldn't work.

1018
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
All right.

1019
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you want to give out?

1020
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Yeah, I'd FU to my dad's girlfriend.

1021
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,800
The woman's driving me absolutely fucking nuts because she's, well, you know, I've been

1022
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,800
saying on air all night, she's a new mom and she's hormonal and I get that.

1023
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,800
But keep the baby away from things that are going to kill her.

1024
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Like, for instance, baby 101.

1025
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,800
For those of you who do not have children, I would assume that all of you are intelligent

1026
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,800
to know that blankets are a potential hazard.

1027
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Like, you put the baby in baby blankets, but you keep it so that they're not, you know,

1028
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,800
in the way of the face.

1029
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,800
What does she do?

1030
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,800
She puts the baby on their bed and puts a comforter over it.

1031
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,800
Like a down comforter.

1032
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,800
No, she's not going to roll over and like suffocate herself.

1033
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,800
It's just like, give me the child and get away.

1034
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
But it's not mine, so I have to like hold my tongue.

1035
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
It's a learning experience for everyone.

1036
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
She's going to kill her, I swear to God.

1037
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,800
I'm not going to have a sister when I get back.

1038
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
She's driving me nuts.

1039
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,800
You know, just like I get, you're a new mom, I get that.

1040
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Everyone makes mistakes.

1041
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,800
But you're making like 101 mistakes.

1042
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
You should have learned.

1043
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
You've met your quota.

1044
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
You've met your quota of mistakes, right?

1045
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Yeah, no, it's like you're allowed to make mistakes,

1046
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,800
but you're not allowed to make mistakes that are this big.

1047
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,800
This is like stuff you should have learned when you learned you were pregnant.

1048
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
You know?

1049
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
And those baby wipes, they're supposed to be cold as fuck.

1050
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Well, I hope things get better.

1051
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Sorry to hear about the discomfort there.

1052
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
Anything else?

1053
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
No, I'm good.

1054
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Well, FU to you for leaving us.

1055
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
I'm sorry.

1056
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
I'm just kidding.

1057
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
You know I love you.

1058
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
I can't say FU to you.

1059
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
All right.

1060
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Well, you would, but it would be kinky.

1061
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,800
Hot.

1062
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
All right, we just have a couple more gaming stories,

1063
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,800
and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your phone calls

1064
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,800
at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1065
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
But first, some more gaming news.

1066
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Yes, Jamie?

1067
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Choo, choo, choo.

1068
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
I couldn't pass that up.

1069
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,800
There's a rumor that Space Channel 5 is coming to Wii and other systems.

1070
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,800
I mean, we're getting Nights in Samba de Amigo,

1071
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,800
so there was a mention saying that there was going to be Space Channel 5.0

1072
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,800
that was reported on Japanese news site The Magic Box.

1073
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,800
Sega denied it on IGN, but you know what?

1074
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,800
It could happen because they've done this before.

1075
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,800
And it was even stated by Mizuguchi that he'd be interested in bringing it

1076
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,800
as a downloadable game like a Res HD is.

1077
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,800
That would be cool if they made a new game.

1078
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,800
From what I heard, were they licensing some of the old Michael Jackson music?

1079
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,800
I think so, because I know that in the second Space Channel 5,

1080
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,800
the dances were in there in one of the dance battle ones.

1081
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Good stuff.

1082
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Well, I've got some last minute stories here real quick,

1083
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,800
and then after that we'll be taking some calls on the Skype line.

1084
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,800
First, of course, who doesn't like a good drinking game?

1085
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,800
Well, apparently Sexy Video Game Land's blog

1086
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
has come up with a few different drinking games,

1087
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,800
one of which is for Metal Gear Solid,

1088
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,800
and it requires a bunch of different concoctions to make up,

1089
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,800
including, I guess, American beer, a bottle of Russian vodka,

1090
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,800
a six-pack of Red Bull, and some other stuff.

1091
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Oh, coarse salt, lemon lime juice, and yeah.

1092
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Anyways, real quickly I'll just go over some of these.

1093
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,800
When you trigger alert, drink Red Bull.

1094
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,800
When an enemy shows inappropriate sexual attraction to Snake,

1095
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,800
you take a vodka shot.

1096
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,800
And let's see here, whenever your commander reminds you via the codec

1097
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,800
that you're on a stealth slash sneaking mission,

1098
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,800
that's when you take a beer shot.

1099
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
That's kind of complicated,

1100
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
and they have a big long list of stuff that you do,

1101
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
so you probably can get pretty wasted from that.

1102
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Other drinking games that they had available, though.

1103
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,800
One was for Final Fantasy X2, or X2, my mistake.

1104
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,800
Anyways, this one's a lot simpler.

1105
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Basically, four different things to take a shot to.

1106
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Every time you see YRP, you take a shot.

1107
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Every time you see a clumsy-framed Yuna fanservice upskirt, take a shot.

1108
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,800
And whenever you notice, or re-notice LeBlanc's impossible simultaneous

1109
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,800
side and under-boob dress setup, take a shot.

1110
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,800
What's the idea, to get drunk in like five seconds?

1111
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
I don't know.

1112
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Whenever a brother's antics become completely insufferable, take a shot.

1113
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,800
I'd like to see the OLR drinking game, I bet it's hilarious.

1114
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm sure they've got one.

1115
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Some other stuff real quick, of course.

1116
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
The Skype line's open, by the way.

1117
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,800
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1118
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,800
There's some screenshots showing a car in No More Heroes,

1119
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
and apparently it has a New Jersey played on it,

1120
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,800
and you're thinking, hey, Santa Destroy's in New Jersey.

1121
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
One cool thing, if you haven't played it yet,

1122
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
I was playing a little bit during break, Potapon,

1123
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
the demo is available in the US,

1124
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,800
and one of the cool things about playing the demo

1125
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,800
is it will unlock an exclusive weapon when you buy the full game.

1126
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
If you buy the full game, I guess.

1127
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,800
By the way, when I said the whole OLR drinking game,

1128
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
SSA-100-MAT and act deaf like in unison said, OLR drinking game,

1129
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,800
every time Loki says, anyway, you take a shot.

1130
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Love it.

1131
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
All right, let's go to the phones real quick.

1132
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I'll let Loki finish the stories in a little bit,

1133
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
but we want to hear from you guys.

1134
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1135
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Who's this?

1136
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
GS68.

1137
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Hello, GS68.

1138
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
What's on your mind, buddy?

1139
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Well, I've been playing Super Metroid lately,

1140
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,800
and several weeks ago I decided to try Metroid Prime 3.

1141
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Oh, crap, I can't solve.

1142
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,800
You were playing Metroid Prime 3, uh-huh.

1143
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Yeah, and, like, I found it pretty disorienting,

1144
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,800
and at some point I got stuck,

1145
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
and I started going around in circles and getting dizzy,

1146
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,800
and that's when I just realized that I'm not for first-person games,

1147
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,800
and I'm not a big fan of 3D games.

1148
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,800
I will admit, GS68, that's a lot of the problems I've had with 3D games.

1149
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,800
It was very hard for me to move from the old-school two-dimensional

1150
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
Super Nintendo games to, you know,

1151
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
when we got into PlayStation and PlayStation 2,

1152
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,800
and now, you know, where we're at with Wii and everything else,

1153
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
it was very hard to kind of make that transition into the first-person games.

1154
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
I'm kind of the same way.

1155
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,800
I always conceptualized Metroid in a 2D space,

1156
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,800
so to take Metroid to a 3D space is tough,

1157
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
because you really have to, you know,

1158
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,800
when you've played 2D games for a long time,

1159
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
to then suddenly have to conceptualize things in 3D

1160
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
takes some getting used to.

1161
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,800
It really does, and I think a lot of people don't give some of us enough credit.

1162
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,800
I partially blame it for why I suck so bad at Halo.

1163
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,800
I'm always getting lost, just because I don't know.

1164
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
I don't know what it is.

1165
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
I'd like to think I'm not stupid or anything.

1166
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
I don't think I am.

1167
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,800
I just am not used to gaming in a 3D space for a long time.

1168
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,800
Well, actually, I just started playing Super Metroid over summer,

1169
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,800
and I think it's more with me and first-person shooters.

1170
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,800
I mean, on caper, I mean, the first-person shooter on the Wii sounds really cool,

1171
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
but when I try it, I get dizzy.

1172
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
You know, maybe you're just...

1173
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
You might have a little bit of the motion sickness, too.

1174
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,800
You've got to make sure you look away once in a while and all that stuff.

1175
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
I mean, certainly.

1176
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,800
I know Dark Sakura's talked about that she doesn't like to play a whole lot of first-person shooters,

1177
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,800
because she, you know, on a big old TV can make you feel a little nauseous, right?

1178
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Yeah.

1179
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,800
So mostly it's probably, I'm assuming, and Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,

1180
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,800
I'm assuming it's kind of a lot of the same triggers that make people motion sick in cars

1181
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
come into play in video games.

1182
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
I think so.

1183
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Because it's like, you know, that whole thing where like if you're sitting in the back of a car around a whiny road...

1184
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Anyway, go ahead.

1185
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Sorry.

1186
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Yeah, there was like this cutscene in Final Fantasy VII where Cloud says never to read while at a car or truck,

1187
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,800
which I thought was interesting.

1188
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,800
Well, it's interesting you bring up Final Fantasy VII, because remember that was a big shock when it came out,

1189
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,800
because it was like, OMG, it's taking a 2D game and putting it in 3D space.

1190
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
But it was kind of different.

1191
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,800
Like Final Fantasy VII still felt pretty 2D to me, just with a 3D twist to it.

1192
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,800
It was like two and a half dimensions, if that makes sense.

1193
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:53,800
I think the point is like, overall, I guess I'm just more into side scores and first-person shooters.

1194
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,800
And I think that's okay.

1195
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I think people are into whatever they're into.

1196
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
So there's no particular type of game you have to like.

1197
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,800
All right, GS68, any other final thoughts for our listeners before we keep moving on?

1198
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Um, no.

1199
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
All right.

1200
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Well, thank you for your input tonight.

1201
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
And I hope...

1202
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Metroid Prime 3 is a great game once you can kind of get used to the first-person-ness.

1203
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
So I hope the sickness doesn't bog you down.

1204
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Give it another go.

1205
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
I think you'll find this a lot of fun.

1206
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,800
Good luck.

1207
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,800
Forgive it.

1208
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
I'll try sometime in the future.

1209
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Please do.

1210
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
Take care.

1211
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
You know, even...

1212
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,800
Here's the weird thing.

1213
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,800
I'm not a big fan of the first-person games.

1214
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
Like, I frickin' love Oblivion.

1215
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Love it.

1216
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
It's...

1217
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
I don't know.

1218
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Like, I don't have a problem with it.

1219
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
It's all about punching the animals.

1220
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
I guess so.

1221
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1222
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Who's this?

1223
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Yeah, what's up?

1224
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
This is RossdielUT.

1225
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Hello, RossdielUT, my friend.

1226
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Hi.

1227
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
What is on your mind?

1228
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Well, a few things.

1229
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:46,800
First off, you're talking about the whole idea of conceptualizing 3D games when you've

1230
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,800
been used to the 2D games just now.

1231
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:59,800
I think what's helped with the PS2 and the PS3, maybe late in the PS1 and the 64, but

1232
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:07,800
especially in the PS2 and PS3, you have environments that are more detailed to where you can associate

1233
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,800
landmarks.

1234
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:16,800
If you remember the old 3D games, like in the early PS1, all the walls looked the same.

1235
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,800
It made Doom damn near impossible for me, because one wall looked the same as the other.

1236
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I think you've got a damn good point here.

1237
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,800
That's one thing that always kind of frustrated me about the Mega Man Legends games, especially

1238
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
the early ones, is that everything kind of looked the same, so it was very hard.

1239
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Well, there were only two Mega Man Legends games.

1240
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
Yeah.

1241
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,800
But yeah, I know what you mean.

1242
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,800
You can't do a 3D game and have everything look the same, because you're just going to

1243
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,800
get horribly lost, and it doesn't matter what system.

1244
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,800
But then again, the same thing happens with a lot of 2D games.

1245
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,800
The original Metroid was a pain in the ass, because all you had was the black background

1246
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,800
and the different colors of the floor, so it took me a little while.

1247
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Super Metroid had the landmarks.

1248
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Yeah, you bring up a damn good point, because it's not like in the real world I have a problem

1249
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,800
conceptualizing 3D space.

1250
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
I don't think many of us do.

1251
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Maybe there's a condition out there.

1252
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
I don't know.

1253
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,800
But most people don't have a problem conceptualizing 3D space in the real world, and I think you're

1254
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
right.

1255
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,800
A lot of that is landmarks.

1256
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,800
Right?

1257
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,800
How do we give directions out?

1258
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,800
We say, okay, go straight down the street, and when you see the McDonald's, turn right.

1259
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
You know?

1260
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,800
Landmarks are huge.

1261
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Exactly.

1262
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
I think you got a damn good point.

1263
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
You need those recognizable landmarks.

1264
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Yeah, you need a McDonald's.

1265
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,800
You know, here's the other thing.

1266
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,800
For lack of a better term, yeah.

1267
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Let me say this, though, Ross Studio T, because I think here's the other big change I think

1268
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,800
that came later on in the PlayStation 2 and so on games that you didn't see a whole lot

1269
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
of in PlayStation 1 games.

1270
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Maps.

1271
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,800
Maps.

1272
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,800
Maps.

1273
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
One button maps.

1274
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,800
A little mini map in the corner.

1275
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,840
A way to conceptualize the 3D and 2D very quickly.

1276
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,800
That's one reason I way prefer Kingdom Hearts 2 to Kingdom Hearts 1 is the mini map.

1277
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Seriously.

1278
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,800
It's a huge improvement for me.

1279
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Yeah, I hear you.

1280
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,200
A lot of the games have the mini maps.

1281
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:04,360
Even the really late ones like Call of Duty 4 has a mini map when you pause.

1282
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,800
There are a lot of aids today.

1283
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,800
There is that.

1284
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Like I said, 3D is a lot easier today than it used to be.

1285
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Right.

1286
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,800
Well, what else did you want to say, Ross Studio T?

1287
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
Because we're trying to move through a lot of calls tonight.

1288
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,800
I want to go back to the whole idiots on mass effect thing.

1289
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
Ah, yes.

1290
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,400
You know, we've been seeing for the better part of a decade and a half idiots attacking

1291
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
video games.

1292
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,300
And I'm going to call them idiots because, you know, ignorant means you don't know better.

1293
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,800
Stupid means you don't want to learn.

1294
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
It's true.

1295
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,400
True words have not been spoken on this show tonight.

1296
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Go ahead.

1297
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Thank you.

1298
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,400
Thank you.

1299
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:52,040
The thing is, I always wonder what sort of impact they really have aside from the whole

1300
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,040
soundbite culture.

1301
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:00,820
Because when you look at it in that time when the anti-gaming attacks have been so intense,

1302
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,240
the industry has just grown and blossomed enormously.

1303
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,040
We just had this epic year last year, what was it, 18 billion dollars for the industry

1304
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,080
last year?

1305
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:18,100
You know, so you have to really wonder how important these Jack Thomsons, how many people

1306
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,660
they actually reach out to.

1307
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:26,240
I think what we lose sight of is that the United States is a country of 300 million

1308
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,040
people.

1309
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,860
There's a ton of cable networks, literally a ton of cable networks and satellite and

1310
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,760
everything else, you know, there's so many options out there.

1311
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,120
You know what, I think you're kind of right, Rosco, I think one thing we kind of don't

1312
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,100
consider about this Fox News piece is that they were probably preaching to the choir

1313
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,100
in a sense.

1314
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,360
Like a lot of the people that watch Fox News were probably already the crowd that bans

1315
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,480
their children from playing video games all together and all this stuff, you know, but

1316
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,540
it doesn't excuse the ignorance.

1317
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:00,180
And that's the thing, I think, in this day and age, I know you're with me there, but

1318
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,040
I think originally these guys were probably preaching to the choir, but at the same time

1319
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,600
it doesn't give them the right to lie.

1320
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:16,840
Of course, and I'm angry about the lie, but at the same time, compared to other times

1321
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,260
in history, other media's attacks, video games have had a pretty damn light and have

1322
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,520
gone through it pretty damn quickly in comparison.

1323
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,000
It took the movie industry 40 years to get over the Hays Code, for example.

1324
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,160
And the comic book industry only recently got out of the shadow of the comic school.

1325
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,600
Video games have had a very light.

1326
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,880
Rosco, you two, we've got to wrap up, but I've got to say this, it's going to be very

1327
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,200
interesting to see what happens, especially as this Hollywood writer's strike continues,

1328
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,820
where video games are going to become, you watch this happen, the longer this strike

1329
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,920
goes on, the more these writers are going to start writing for video games.

1330
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,160
And we're going to have very Hollywood-ish type of video games.

1331
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,160
It's going to be very interesting.

1332
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,760
Well, we're already seeing that happen.

1333
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,400
We're already seeing video games taking audience from television, which is part of why you

1334
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,720
see all this anti-gaming stuff on TV.

1335
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
True, but you know how...

1336
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,720
They're trying to get rid of that market.

1337
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,720
Anyway, I know you're tied.

1338
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
I'm sorry.

1339
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,960
I know, really quick, but there was another story about this this week.

1340
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,160
You know how they say that video game plots are always so thin they never make good movies.

1341
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,160
You know, that...

1342
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,960
I think you're going to start seeing a lot more games with them.

1343
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,600
Well, they don't make good movies because the directors suck.

1344
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,040
That's true a lot of the time, too.

1345
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
Uwe Boll, anyone?

1346
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,280
Silent Hill, some of them were passable.

1347
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,280
Some of them were...

1348
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
Even Mortal Kombat was passable.

1349
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,280
Passable.

1350
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,360
I liked the first Mortal Kombat.

1351
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,360
I liked the first Resident Evil.

1352
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,360
But then you look into shit.

1353
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
Those are good movies.

1354
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,360
You look at shit like BloodRayne, and you're just like, this is why we get about that.

1355
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,360
Okay.

1356
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,360
One sexy...

1357
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,360
All right, all right.

1358
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,360
You want to get to the next column.

1359
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
All right.

1360
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Rustiel Ute, I'm so sorry.

1361
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
We've got to let you go.

1362
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
But have a good one, buddy.

1363
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
It's always good to hear from you.

1364
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
Bye-bye.

1365
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
You do the same.

1366
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,360
Bye-bye.

1367
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,360
Hello.

1368
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,720
Anyone at the line?

1369
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
Oh, hi.

1370
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
Two- elders.

1371
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,720
Hi, everyone.

1372
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,720
Sorry to interrupt you.

1373
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,720
The phone is ringing off the hook tonight.

1374
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,720
I literally click the hang up button and another call drops in.

1375
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,720
It's crazy.

1376
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
It's an orange launch radio.

1377
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,720
Who's this?

1378
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,720
This is Act Def from chat.

1379
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Hello, Act Def from chat.

1380
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
What is on your mind?

1381
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,800
Actually, three things online.

1382
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,420
The first one is the DDR is dead thing.

1383
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,300
I agree with you on the Konami.

1384
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:29,580
definitely hire or commission harmonics on the whole renewal of DVR. They are having

1385
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:36,360
so much success with Guitar Hero and Rock Band that maybe they should work together

1386
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,320
and make a better new game.

1387
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,980
I don't know how feasible that arrangement is, but it would certainly be a fanboy's dream

1388
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:47,360
to see something like that happen. With the way complex corporate relationships and money

1389
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,060
and everything works, I don't know how feasible it is, but it certainly is a fun thing to

1390
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,060
dream about, right?

1391
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:59,660
True. So it would be nice to see them work together.

1392
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:03,340
Now Act Deaf, you're from Mexico, right, if I remember right?

1393
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,340
Yes.

1394
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,660
Here's one question. I hear that Pump It Up has a huge fan base in Mexico. Is that true

1395
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,740
in your neck? Now obviously Mexico is a very big place, but is that true in your neck of

1396
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,260
the woods?

1397
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:21,900
Actually Pump It Up is more popular on the center of the country, more on the south side.

1398
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,620
On the north, DVR has more popularity.

1399
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,860
I see. Do you think that might just be because a lot of American culture seeps through because

1400
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,620
the closer you get to the border and everything, do you think that might be a part of it or

1401
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,820
just coincidence?

1402
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:38,820
Yeah. Yeah, that's most a part of it.

1403
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,780
Because I was thinking, yeah, and somebody brought it up in chat too, Color Sakura said

1404
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,620
it in chat, and I was thinking of this too, that the World Pump Festival was happening

1405
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:50,540
in Mexico City. But yeah, Mexico City is much further south in Mexico than, you know, other

1406
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,540
places.

1407
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,540
Anyhow.

1408
01:05:52,540 --> 01:06:03,380
Yeah. Also, I wanted to comment on a news you said a week ago about Video Games Live,

1409
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,180
that it's coming to Mexico and it's coming to Mexicali, that's my hometown.

1410
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,180
Awesome.

1411
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,360
I'm pretty damn excited.

1412
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,360
That has got to be awesome.

1413
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,380
It's not going to be.

1414
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:19,420
I bet it's not every day. You know, unfortunately, a lot of big tours and things don't always

1415
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:24,540
think to go to Mexico or other countries. Like, you know, we hear a lot from Footy Monster

1416
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,060
who's in Argentina and not a lot of stuff comes to his neck of the woods either. I bet

1417
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,620
that's got to be pretty awesome to see something like this, like actually kind of recognize

1418
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,380
like, hey, let's go to some places a little bit outside the north. Let's go somewhere

1419
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,060
besides L.A. and New York, right?

1420
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,060
Pretty cool.

1421
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:45,100
Yeah. It's pretty exciting because here in my town, it doesn't happen anything like this

1422
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:50,740
huge, like Video Games Live, though maybe for some people it will be like, oh, video

1423
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:57,260
games. Oh, yeah. Like, whatever. But for me, it's like a great experience that is going

1424
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:06,220
to happen, like going to the ballroom that's going to be happening and hearing all the

1425
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,780
music I know and recognize from old video games and also with my friends that also are

1426
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,780
video game fans.

1427
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,420
Act F, let me ask you just one last question and then we've got to wrap up. Do you think

1428
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:22,820
it will succeed in a non-traditional place like Mexicali? Do you think this show has

1429
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,740
potential to do very well there?

1430
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:33,660
We have a pretty big community of gamers and also people who like anime, otakus and pretty

1431
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:44,940
much geeks. It would be a success, though not as great as in a big city.

1432
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,700
Well, you know, I know you've been saying in chat that I should go. It is a bit of a

1433
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,300
long drive to Mexicali. I know it's towards the north end of Mexico, so it's not unreasonable.

1434
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:57,100
Who knows? If I get my passport renewed, anything is possible. Who knows? I've never been to

1435
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,660
Mexico either. This will give me a great excuse. Who knows?

1436
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:03,140
Yeah. Another thing I wanted to add before...

1437
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,140
Really quick, yeah.

1438
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:13,140
...ending the call. It's the Fox News thing. Just a little opinion on that, on my part.

1439
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:25,300
It should be not us attacking them also or ignore them. We should acknowledge their opinions

1440
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:35,740
and maybe make a debate. The PAX Expo tried to do last year with Jack Thompson a debate.

1441
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:41,940
Very interesting perspective that maybe instead of getting on the offensive, like things that

1442
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:46,320
you see on Amazon.com, everybody attacking this lady who said this, maybe the video game

1443
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,260
community can kind of look at how can we stop this from happening in the future? If this

1444
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,140
is what people really think, how can we educate them otherwise?

1445
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,140
Yes.

1446
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,900
That's a very interesting way of looking at it. That's a very interesting way of looking

1447
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,280
at it. I appreciate your opinion. Act F, we're out of time. I got to let you go, but thanks

1448
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,280
so much for your call.

1449
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,280
You too.

1450
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,280
All right. Bye-bye.

1451
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
I don't want to be the better person.

1452
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,420
What did you say, Chris? I think that's worth saying to the mic. What?

1453
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,060
I don't want to be the better person.

1454
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,540
You're right. Sometimes you don't want to be the better person. You're right. But you

1455
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,900
know what? I think he makes a damn good point is that maybe instead of going on the offensive,

1456
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,380
we should take a look at how can we stop this shit from happening again? How can we educate

1457
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,580
these people. But then again, there's another part of me that says you can lead a horse

1458
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,720
to water, but you can't make a drink.

1459
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,600
Exactly. You can give them all the education. They can be the most educated people about

1460
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,580
video games. But if they have an agenda, like trying to be sensationalists and stuff like

1461
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,900
that, and really rile up people about video games, they're just going to do these stories.

1462
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:45,060
Anyway, since obviously they don't really care about apologizing about it, I'm surprised

1463
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,280
we don't see more crazy shit on there like, you know, Grand Theft Auto literally reaches

1464
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,020
out of the TV and murders your children and stuff like that.

1465
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,020
The Horde is after your children?

1466
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:00,860
Yes, the Horde is after your children. It is a satanic cult cultivated by a video game.

1467
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:09,140
It has 10 million followers and it will destroy the Christian race. I don't know how we can

1468
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,140
go from that into another call, but we're going to try. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge

1469
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,140
Radio. Who's this?

1470
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,040
Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ronma.

1471
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,460
You've been listening to that because sometimes I pick up calls and don't acknowledge for

1472
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,340
a little bit just to get them on the line. You've been listening to that for 30 seconds.

1473
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,940
I don't know how you held the laughter in so we couldn't hear you.

1474
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,940
Yeah, pretty much.

1475
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,940
All right. Ronma, what's on your mind?

1476
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:35,120
Well, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I'm putting that aside because

1477
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,860
I'm very pissed off right now.

1478
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:38,860
Why is that?

1479
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,980
I have one thing to say. Can I please say it?

1480
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:41,980
Okay.

1481
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:42,980
No.

1482
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:53,500
People, shut the fuck up about DDR. It's done. God forbid Konami ignores these other franchises

1483
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,740
to please you drooling fanboys.

1484
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,820
I wouldn't say they're really ignoring their franchise. They're still releasing more than

1485
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,180
two games a year for the damn thing. I mean, I wouldn't say it's dead.

1486
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:08,380
Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I mean, be thankful you're getting something, you know?

1487
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,900
It's all the people who play DDR. It's all their fault because they're not the ones playing

1488
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,180
it. Konami's releasing plenty of games. It's just you guys, you all suck. That's why.

1489
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:20,540
Ronma, I agree and I disagree. I agree to a point that at some point you have to let

1490
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,620
DDR go. You just have to let it go. It's past its prime, whatever. But at the same part,

1491
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:30,980
it sucks because without DDR, I would never have met Jamie. I would have never met Matt.

1492
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,100
I would have never met you. You know what I mean?

1493
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,660
It's true. That is so true.

1494
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:38,940
So I think that's why people are so passionate about it and they know everybody has their

1495
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,620
own idea of what's best for the series because a lot of us have made friends through that

1496
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,900
community. It goes back to what we were talking about during the bonus segment. I don't know

1497
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,820
if you were here for the bonus segment and I know our podcast listeners don't get to

1498
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,960
hear the bonus segment, but during the bonus segment, Chris was talking about a fundraiser

1499
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,900
going on on DeviantArt to help one of the artists in need. And I was talking about that's

1500
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:04,180
a really great example of community. And I bet if something like that happened in the

1501
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,540
DDR world, the DDR community would have done something similar. You know what I mean?

1502
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,380
Thomas Howard, he's hungry.

1503
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:16,060
Every community has done something like that, you know? I mean, some conventions, when they

1504
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:22,460
have the auctions for artwork and stuff like that, they would say a portion of this would

1505
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,860
go to this charitable organization, which is pretty cool.

1506
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:31,180
Well, okay. So, all right. We've heard all sides of this. Let's not continue to indulge

1507
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,820
the DDR discussion. What else did you want to say, Rama?

1508
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:40,060
Okay. I do know a few episodes back, there was talk about the Wii and the Wii Remote.

1509
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:45,540
And it's something I thought about. Let me ask all of you guys this, and girls. If the

1510
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:53,060
Wii came loaded with the Wii Remote and the classic controller, would the console still

1511
01:12:53,060 --> 01:13:01,860
be considered a gimmick system?

1512
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,660
You know, it's weird, because I don't think that would have ever happened, because Nintendo's

1513
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:10,180
thing was to force developers to get away from that. So, it's kind of hard for me to

1514
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:14,900
answer that, because I think the whole niche about the waggle and the motion sensing, that

1515
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:21,060
was Nintendo's whole thing. So, if they had bundled in a classic controller with that,

1516
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,740
it kind of would have defeated the purpose altogether. You see some developers sneaking

1517
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,660
around that a little bit. Like, for instance, I think of Geometry Wars. Like, you can play

1518
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:35,420
that with the motion sensing way, or you can play it with the good old-fashioned, old-school

1519
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:41,780
2 sticks way, if you have a classic controller, which a lot of people do. But, you know, it's

1520
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,100
really hard to say, Rama, because I think that was Nintendo's whole thing in the first

1521
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,620
place, and for them to have included a classic controller would have defeated the entire

1522
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,620
purpose.

1523
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,380
Well, I agree on that. I do see how Nintendo wanted to get away from that. That was cool.

1524
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:59,780
I played some of the Wii games on launch, and it was cool. I played Dragon Ball Z Budokai

1525
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:03,820
2. I couldn't get into it. I was like, I need a regular controller in order to play the

1526
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:08,620
game. At first, everyone was like, oh, this is so cool. This is so great. Now, developers

1527
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:13,580
are like saying, this ain't a joke, you know? Let's go on to other things.

1528
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:18,780
I think a very realistic possibility in the future, Rama, is that when the Wii start coming

1529
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,700
out in other colors, and again, this is all speculation, why not throw in a matching classic

1530
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:27,340
controller of another color? You know, the Wii is an established thing now. This whole

1531
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,980
new, you know, the waggling and the motions, it's established now. Developers will buy

1532
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,860
into it. I think it's okay to start putting in classic controllers and kind of see what

1533
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,420
can happen with a good mix.

1534
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,740
That'll definitely work. I mean, like, you got, like, a game where one person uses a

1535
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:45,980
controller to, like, drive a car. Some other person can use the Wii, the controller, like,

1536
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,500
the little guns or the lasers. That'd be pretty cool.

1537
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:52,780
Yeah. Lots of ideas. And, of course, I think back to that YouTube that came out a little

1538
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,860
while ago with the whole reverse thing where the guy had the whole conceptualized space

1539
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,100
thing but he was, like, wearing the sensor bar on his head. That thing was amazing. I

1540
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,100
don't know if you saw it.

1541
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,220
Yeah, I didn't see it.

1542
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,580
I'm sure someone in chat has a link to the YouTube. It's freaking amazing. Rama, really

1543
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,460
quickly, any last thoughts? And we got to let you go.

1544
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:13,060
I'm tired of 3D games. I want more 2D games and 3D environments. That's it.

1545
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:16,620
Real quickly, how do you feel about the Bionic Commando remake? Because that seems to be

1546
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:20,060
exactly the kind of thing you're talking about.

1547
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,060
I'll buy that for $20.

1548
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,300
All right. You do that. All right, thanks so much for your call, Rama. Take care.

1549
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,300
No problem.

1550
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,300
Bye-bye.

1551
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,300
All right.

1552
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:32,300
Seriously, like, I had the biggest nerdgasm when I saw that Bionic Commando thing last

1553
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,660
week, if I can even say that. All right, any other...

1554
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,660
Any other?

1555
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:40,220
Any other? Yes, I fangasmed all over myself. All right, real quick, I got another call

1556
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,420
driving. This is the last one, I promise. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

1557
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:47,420
Hello.

1558
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,420
Hi, who's this?

1559
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,060
This is Let's Have Tea.

1560
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,140
Hello, Let's Have Tea. Welcome to the show. Real quick, because we're trying to wrap up,

1561
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:58,380
what did you want to say?

1562
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,740
I know you didn't really want any more comments on the whole DDR thing, but there are communities

1563
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:12,700
out there working together using DDR for charities. I know there's an organization in Indiana

1564
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:24,580
that they've been doing annual charities for seven years now, using DDR as a way to raise

1565
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:31,860
money. And this year, they raised just over $2,800 a weekend for a children's hospital.

1566
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:36,620
That's awesome. Do you happen to have a website link or anything?

1567
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:44,740
The community for that is over at nddr.com, and it's called the DDR-a-thon.

1568
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,460
Very cool. Let's Have Tea. We've got to let you go, because I swore we were going to wrap

1569
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,420
it up, but thank you so much for sharing that with us. Have a good one, okay?

1570
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,420
Yep.

1571
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,420
All right.

1572
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,420
Bye.

1573
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,700
Bye-bye. I love that nickname, too. I forgot to compliment him when he was on the line,

1574
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,820
but Let's Have Tea is one of my favorite nicknames of anybody in chat. All right, I promised

1575
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,100
we could wrap up. We're going to do a couple quick last minute stories, but I did want

1576
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,060
to say this real quick, because he's talking about charity, and I think it's really interesting.

1577
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,300
This has kind of become a fad lately. I don't know if that's the right word to use, because

1578
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:14,940
that has kind of a negative context with it, but I've noticed it seems like I've seen a

1579
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:22,420
lot of these 48-hour gaming sessions for charity lately. Like, you know, I want to say somebody

1580
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,180
sent me an email. I think it was one of our listeners that they were going to play through

1581
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:31,500
the Banjo-Kazooie games in one weekend, and of course, we saw the Mario-a-thon, the Sonic-a-thon,

1582
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:38,320
the Zelda-a-thon, and, you know, it's a very interesting trend right now that people are

1583
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,820
doing these marathons for different charities. I think it's cool. I think it's a great example

1584
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:50,780
of how the community can kind of band together. I would caution, though, too much of a good

1585
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:55,340
thing can be too much, so I would encourage those that are thinking about doing these

1586
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:59,260
types of things in the future, I encourage you to think about a spin that you can kind

1587
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,860
of put on it to make it your own. You know, what kind of spin can you put on it that makes

1588
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:10,620
it stick out from the rest? That's all. Anyhow, that's it. That's all I'm going to say on

1589
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:15,020
that. Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki? Sure. To kind of go back to some of

1590
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:24,060
the stuff we talked about earlier, there is a rumor, I guess now, apparently a tipster

1591
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:34,700
who tipped off QJNet about the phasing out of the 20-gig PS3s is also saying that now

1592
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:41,340
he has information about the phase-out of the 80-gig PS3s for GameStop and EB. Apparently

1593
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:45,560
they're also phasing them out as well. And he says, I went ahead and looked in our back

1594
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:51,460
office inventory screen and found that only SKU listed as active for the PS3 console was

1595
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:58,100
the 40-gig system. The 20, 60, and 80 SKUs were deleted. So that's kind of interesting

1596
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:06,420
and of course Sony has come out and said no comment regarding the phased-out rumors. Most

1597
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,380
likely though, if we're hearing that a lot of these retailers are phasing out, that something's

1598
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:16,620
going to happen. So not a big surprise there. Someone else apparently found another hack

1599
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:22,740
into the Wii to run their own code. Apparently there's an exploit using a game save for Zelda

1600
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:30,700
Twilight Princess where you can crash it and run a code using a buffer overflow. So it's

1601
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:37,860
kind of neat. Interesting. And then the surfer girl, of course, she's had a lot of rumors

1602
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:45,860
that have come true here. Some of our newest ones include Slalom, I guess, a rare NES game

1603
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:51,540
and that's rare in the company, that actually will be making its way to the Virtual Console

1604
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:56,500
in the next few months here. Some other stuff, they're also talking about Onimusha 5 is apparently

1605
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:02,340
coming out for both the PS3 and 360 sometime next year, as well as Dead Rising 2 and Lost

1606
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:08,120
Planet 2 not too far behind. The PSP also getting a follow-up title coming in the form

1607
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:14,380
of another siphon filter game. And we'll have the story tied into a PS3 version as well,

1608
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:21,340
also set for 2009. And finally, there is some stuff coming from EA. Apparently they are

1609
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:26,220
rumored to be working on another Wing Commander title, an actual Wing Commander title, not

1610
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:32,100
some crappy Xbox Live Arcade game. However, there is also another Xbox Live Arcade game

1611
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:38,780
coming from Rare, and that game is Mr. Pants, which I don't know if you've played Mr. Pants

1612
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:45,660
but it's a weird game. I can't say I have. Mr. Pants. What is a game called Mr. Pants

1613
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:51,140
about? I don't remember but it looked weird. Alright. We're way over for time tonight so

1614
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:55,100
we definitely have to wrap things up. Any other last minute stories quickly though?

1615
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:00,180
I just want to make sure. No. Alrighty. Then let's go ahead and wrap it up with our final

1616
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:06,740
thoughts. Loki, your final thought tonight? My final thought is I need a cage match song

1617
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:11,940
quick. Yes you do. Dark Soccer, your final thought? I picked my cage match song seven

1618
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:17,580
hours ago. And my final thought is vitamin water is very good. It's much better for me

1619
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,960
than soda too, I'm sure. As long as I drink it in moderation. I wouldn't live off vitamin

1620
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,880
water but it's good stuff. And lastly but certainly not leastly, thank you so much Chris

1621
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,300
for coming over tonight and lending your moral support and your shining face to our show.

1622
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:36,760
And a very good bonus segment all thanks to you tonight. So Chris, any final thoughts

1623
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:44,020
from you? The Horde is after your server. And please call in once in a while and let

1624
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,580
us know you're doing okay. Oh I plan to. You better. And you're still going to be our roving

1625
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,380
reporter in Wisconsin. We'll find something gaming related up there for you to cover.

1626
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:55,420
Okay. Well actually I got something that I want to plug later but I'll do that later.

1627
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:59,500
Do you want to plug it now? Because the show's almost over, you ain't got much time left.

1628
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:04,700
No I'll do it in the cage match. Right before the cage match. Something for the live listeners.

1629
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,780
Because you people are special and I love you all. Live listeners get a special treat

1630
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:12,140
from Chris very soon. Well sorry podcasters but that's part of the magic of listening

1631
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:18,060
live. And for those of you on video, I might just dance. That's right. The Justin TV-ers

1632
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:23,140
get to hear it too. Alright and well thank you guys so much for, did I do a final thought?

1633
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:28,820
Oh yeah I said vitamin water. So that, hello, I'm losing my memory already. Anyhow that's

1634
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:36,660
going to do it. Get an old rub. Shut up. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange

1635
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:41,000
Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening. Thank you guys so much for tuning into and

1636
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,860
supporting independent podcasting and independent media. I know we say this every week and we

1637
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:50,460
start to sound like a broken record but we really mean it. Without your guys' support

1638
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,820
it just wouldn't happen. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be able to do this and we do it

1639
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,300
for free. We do it because we love getting to hang out with you all on a Sunday night

1640
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,940
and even for those guys who can't make it live, we love the feedback and the stuff we

1641
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,300
get. You guys are awesome and thank you so much for your support of us. If you like what

1642
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:10,260
we do, all we ask, help spread the word. Tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.

1643
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,420
Post a positive review on iTunes which by the way we got a couple of those this week.

1644
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:18,260
I'd like to really thank those new entries on iTunes this week. Some really nice reviews.

1645
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:22,220
Or wherever you think would be best. I know not everyone uses iTunes so you know whatever.

1646
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:28,700
Dig, Yahoo, podcast, whatever. I think it's great. Thank you guys so much as always and

1647
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:32,980
until next week when we will be joined with our first ever musical guest which is going

1648
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,820
to be all kinds of interesting. Can't wait. We'll see you then here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,820
