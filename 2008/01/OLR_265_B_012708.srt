2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, our last show for January, because it is January the 27th of 2008.

4
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get right back into the gaming news.

5
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: If you missed Part A, you missed a lot.

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,371
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed a lot of randomness, that's for sure.

7
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:40,858
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we're going to get into some Nintendo news, because we had a substantial lack of Nintendo in Part A, so let's kick it off with some Nintendo news, Loki.

8
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:44,459
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the new things we learned this week about Smash Bros.

9
00:00:44,519 --> 00:01:00,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl is that it will have classic game demos included with it, including demos for The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Super Metroid, and Super Mario Bros., as well as Star Fox 64.

10
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:10,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the fuck don't they have demos on the Virtual Console if they're all available on Brawl?

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, if it's that easy to make demos for this stuff, then why isn't it available for the other stuff?

12
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just me, or is this maybe a workaround?

13
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they realize that tons and tons of Wii owners are going to be buying this game.

14
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:27,919
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a, you know, AAA title of the highest kind for the Nintendo Wii.

15
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:35,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, but, I mean, seriously, though, if it's easy to implement, why aren't they doing, like, time demos on some of these, you know...

16
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:37,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo games and stuff.

17
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:39,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the weird thing.

18
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.

19
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the idea.

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great.

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives this game even more value than it had already.

22
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God, we all knew this was going to be a powerhouse game anyway.

23
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:53,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only thing that makes me kind of go like, are there really that many people who haven't played these games?

24
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

25
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I just spoiled because I'm older so I kind of grew up with 8-bit Nintendo and stuff?

26
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,154
[SPEAKER_07]: But are there a lot of people who have never played The Legend of Zelda?

27
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Who have never played original Mario Brothers?

28
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,810
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be some people, though.

29
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:13,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we grew up in the 80s and stuff, but there's a lot of people that have never played the original games.

30
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,994
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Chris is raising her hand.

31
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:15,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

32
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:17,475
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

33
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You said during the break, though, you were denied video games when you were a child, so you didn't really have a lot of exposure to this.

34
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:31,501
[SPEAKER_01]: No, my parents refused to buy me anything that had to do with video games until I was finally in high school, and I got my Pokemon games back.

35
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,562
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom used to play with me.

36
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:35,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, your mom was awesome.

37
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,324
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were retarded.

38
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:41,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the different, well, I mean, obviously, you pretty much have two different extremes right here.

39
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:45,648
[SPEAKER_07]: You have, you know, the no video games in this house whatsoever, and then the family that plays together.

40
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you literally have the two things in the spectrum here.

41
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:52,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, family I use loosely because it was me, my mom, and my brothers, you know, we weren't the typical family unit.

42
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:53,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, well, you know.

43
00:02:53,913 --> 00:03:01,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was just, it really was, my brothers ran outside and played in the neighborhood, and my mom was usually in my room playing my Nintendo.

44
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to, I didn't get to play my Nintendo as much as my mother played it.

45
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:08,769
[SPEAKER_05]: They also mentioned that there are other demos that are hidden in there.

46
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, why aren't there full games, kind of like Animal Crossing had?

47
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now there's the virtual console.

48
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:15,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So?

49
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a virtual console is a money-making machine.

50
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free money.

51
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:25,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouldn't say free money, but very, very low-cost money.

52
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:31,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, obviously somebody is having to make those manuals and those kinds of things, you know, and QA the game and make sure it works in the emulator and all that stuff.

53
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But that, all things considered, is extremely low-cost.

54
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,888
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have a demo for Mother 3 on there.

55
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:37,888
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be hilarious.

56
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that would be kind of rad.

57
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I would kind of hope they would do something like that.

58
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, give us a game that has only been seen in Japan.

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

60
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,071
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just a demo for it.

61
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll never see the full game over here.

62
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a demo.

63
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:48,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother 3 came out in Europe.

64
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's evil.

65
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:49,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's true.

66
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

67
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:51,449
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

68
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Ross Steel, UT, has a thought.

69
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,973
[SPEAKER_07]: He says in chat.orangesalmsradio.com, he says, Loki, Nintendo doesn't have many new games, so they have to sell this stuff.

70
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's cool.

71
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:07,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind them selling this stuff, but for some of these obscure games that are on Virtual Console, I'd like to be able to try them out before I spend $5 on them.

72
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course there's other people that are piping up.

73
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:14,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture says, I've never played a Zelda game.

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And Actdeft says younger people maybe haven't played the games.

75
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And all very good points.

76
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:23,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I guess maybe my perspective is spoiled because I really grew up on this shit.

77
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:29,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were also primarily PC gamers or had like an Apple IIe or something.

78
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:34,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who never had a Nintendo, but she was the world's biggest Doom player that I knew.

79
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:36,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool.

80
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:37,512
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I guess you guys make a good point.

82
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I can admit when you guys make good points.

83
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:46,030
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, like I said in the beginning, this was never a bad thing.

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of, wow, that's interesting.

85
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:52,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess all you guys that never got to play these games will finally get your chance.

86
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you like it, you can send Nintendo five bucks and get the full version.

87
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:02,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows, though, if there will be any Sega Master System games included in Smash Bros.

88
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Brawl.

89
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Not likely, since the only Sega character in the game that we know of is Sonic.

90
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:12,413
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did get news this week that Sega Master System games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

91
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:12,873
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

92
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,793
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole resurgence of the Sega Master System.

93
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:21,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Sega Master System never really caught on here in America quite in the same way that Nintendo did.

94
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It was always kind of the cultish thing.

95
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you where it caught on.

96
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil.

97
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, and they still, you know, Genesis and all that stuff.

98
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember reporting on the Genesis handheld that's still big in Brazil.

99
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:38,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan was showing me a video file of Castle of Illusion for Master System, which looks oddly like DuckTales.

100
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:44,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no matter where you live, Sega Master System games, you are going to be able to get very soon.

101
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,238
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really funny.

102
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, where Sega popped in my mind, when I was like...

103
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know how old I was.

104
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,591
[SPEAKER_01]: But my uncle, I had to go stay over at his house.

105
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh, and don't worry.

106
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:59,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, at my house, I've got a lot of cool stuff like Sega and Sonic.

107
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea what the fuck that was.

108
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:07,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he showed it to me, and I just, my mind blew up because I didn't know, like, what to do with it.

109
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:08,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.

110
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,316
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this little blue thing running in circles trying to get these little dancing ring things.

111
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And my perspective on that was, Satan!

112
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And here you are on this program now.

113
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am years later.

114
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is funny.

115
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty funny.

116
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is funny.

117
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:30,554
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminded me of that because he was so excited to tell me about that when my mom forbid me to play video games.

118
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,619
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this, Satan?

119
00:06:54,446 --> 00:07:03,372
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of early speculation that since the Game Gear pretty much ran off the same hardware as the Master System, it's only a matter of time before Game Gear follows on the Virtual Console.

120
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:04,833
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually true.

121
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,895
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the same, pretty much.

122
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:14,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why a lot of the games that did come out on Game Gear had Master System releases in other countries.

123
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the record, I have Fantasy Zone on Master System.

124
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, look for those.

125
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,647
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have Fantasy Zone, maybe you ought to check it out.

126
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Look for those to come to Japan in February.

127
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure other regions will only be a little ways behind me.

128
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like we're talking about the MSX here.

129
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:41,252
[SPEAKER_07]: MSX is something the American and European audiences really don't know much about because all the games on the console were all in Japanese, so we're probably never going to see that, unfortunately.

130
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,272
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the system they gave us.

131
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Guardian Legend.

132
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:48,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Guardic and Metal Gear, the old school Metal Gear.

133
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

134
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:52,890
[SPEAKER_00]: and the actual good sequel instead of the one we got over here.

135
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake's Revenge.

136
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,631
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyhow, what other virtual console news do we have tonight?

137
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:10,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one makes me relatively happy is that Super Street Fighter 2 is going to be on the virtual console in the UK over on the PAL systems.

138
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,795
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 800 Wii Points, which is £5.60 or a €7...

139
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:30,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryu, Ken, Gael, Blanca, Zangief, Chun-Li, Honda, Dhalsim, Wu And the new challengers, yes.

140
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Cammy, with her butt.

141
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,562
[SPEAKER_07]: She had camo legs, you couldn't see them.

142
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that game out here in the U.S., Virtual Console?

143
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it came out last week.

144
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:47,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it?

145
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:48,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

146
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:49,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then there you go, Jamie.

147
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:51,763
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're that excited, you can go grab it in the U.S., too, it sounds like.

148
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have the original...

149
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:55,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well then, la-di-da.

150
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:58,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting for the Xbox One, to be honest.

151
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, why would I go buy this old one when there's going to be the new HD one?

152
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,025
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be sexy.

153
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,526
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved out here, this is how big of a nerd I was.

154
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:14,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I shipped out a whole bunch of my stuff, but in my luggage I brought my Super Nintendo and all my games with it.

155
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:21,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first game that I had on the Super Nintendo that was mine was one that my boyfriend at the time bought me, which was Super Street Fighter II.

156
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:22,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

157
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,882
[SPEAKER_00]: and I still have the box everything.

158
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:25,983
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like my game.

159
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:28,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And to this day that remains a pretty great port.

160
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:29,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it was really good.

161
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:36,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Fighter Alpha 2 had loading in a cartridge and I thought that was hilarious.

162
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:43,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo for the computer but the thing I remember about it on the PC is it had like remixed music and it was also the Redbook audio.

163
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: You could put it in any CD player.

164
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:45,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of cool.

165
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Random tidbit.

166
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So, moving on.

167
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:50,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

168
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, there's some other good news coming from Japan about the Wii.

169
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:58,790
[SPEAKER_05]: They've surpassed 5 million units sold.

170
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:10,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the Wii is the number one selling system in the world, but at least the new generation of systems, it is the number one.

171
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, not in the U.S., but not for long.

172
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:18,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, right now they have sold, at least as of January 20th, 5,019,337 units.

173
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not bad, seeing as it's been out for 14 months already.

174
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,860
[SPEAKER_05]: In the US, their sales were 7.38 million as of the end of 2007.

175
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So, doing pretty good.

176
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

177
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:40,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Not unsurprising, but nice.

178
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:44,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we all knew we were selling like crazy, no matter where you are, so there you have it.

179
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:45,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Smash Bros.

180
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:45,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Brawl

181
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:15,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So some clips are already hitting YouTube, so pretty awesome.

182
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:21,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only a matter of time before we find out all the secrets that the Smash Bros.

183
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Dojo has yet to reveal.

184
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did look at some of the YouTube clips, and I have to admit, the game looks a lot like Super Smash Bros.

185
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:36,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Melee, which isn't to be surprised, but it definitely feels like it has that next level to it, you know what I mean?

186
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely feels like the game is taken to the next level.

187
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:06,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to play that level that's the old school Mario level that scrolls automatically while you're in it.

188
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,299
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

189
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing about this game that I think is going to make it winner, and I realize fanboys everywhere are peeing their pants over it.

190
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the same reason why WarioWare.

191
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:16,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It's variety.

192
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:17,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It is variety.

193
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,569
[SPEAKER_07]: This game sounds like, it's just like, really, they have thought of everything.

194
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Variety.

195
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's value.

196
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

197
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.

198
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,632
[SPEAKER_07]: You really feel like you're getting your money's worth, I think.

199
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:33,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you obviously have to withhold judgment until the game actually comes out, but certainly the hype, they're doing a wonderful job.

200
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:37,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll see, right?

201
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:38,577
[SPEAKER_07]: We will soon see.

202
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:50,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for our friends who are fortunate enough to have a Wii right now, it's been said that Okami Wii will be out in the UK, actually, by the summer.

203
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:57,907
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting our version over here on 25th March, but there's not a specific date stated for the UK.

204
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be coming out!

205
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,048
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.

206
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to see it's making its way out, finally.

207
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:07,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

208
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's you know I just real quick I want to say about Okami real quick I actually kind of missed it in the PS2 because when it came out I was too busy with ooh Xbox you know I was like too busy with all that as I think a lot of the late gen games from the PS2 were kind of like that so I'm kind of looking forward to being able to give this a real shot on the Wii and it looks like it's gonna be a lot of fun so I'm glad to hear it's on its way I'd like to see what they've done for controls on it me too

209
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:41,153
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I hear, it's not really changed that much from the PS2 version.

210
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: What, no waggle?

211
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're going to have waggle in there, but it's pretty much a straight port.

212
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't expect anything additional to it.

213
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:47,994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right.

214
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I did hear there's widescreen support, though, which is pretty awesome.

215
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sold.

216
00:13:53,876 --> 00:14:04,458
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new, I guess, handheld MP4 player capable of running old-school Nintendo emulators, and it's powered by the sun using solar power.

217
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:13,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It can also play MP3s, store e-books, and records audio, and of course displays images, all for $123.32.

218
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The cool part, though, is it also has a USB port to connect to other portable devices to share the solar energy it has collected, so you can power your other devices with it.

219
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:31,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's kind of funny, though, because the whole thing looks very similar to the original Game Boy Advance.

220
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

221
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:38,651
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those things that you probably only see in Korea or something like that.

222
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,233
[SPEAKER_07]: If nothing else, though, it makes for a great headline, you know.

223
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Console powered by sun.

224
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:47,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's... But then how do I play late at night?

225
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:49,178
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the bummer.

226
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:50,519
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it, that one game?

227
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:53,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember... I have to go outside to play a game?

228
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:54,842
[SPEAKER_07]: This makes no sense.

229
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:58,604
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that one game that came out on the Game Boy Advance, and I know I can't remember the title.

230
00:14:58,644 --> 00:14:59,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Boktai!

231
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Boktai.

232
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem with the original Game Boy Advance is when you play it out in the sun, you can't see it.

233
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:11,376
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's very... It's not backlit, and it made it hard to see, so... Not a good plan, unfortunately.

234
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was not a big Boktai fan.

235
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:18,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that came out after that, which I can't... Oh, it was kind of like a sequel, but it was on the DS.

236
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:26,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, I can't... But, like, they kind of took the sun part out of it, but it was still an element of the game, but you could just hit a button to charge it.

237
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was something that Hideo Kojima did.

238
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a sequel.

239
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the DS.

240
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name.

241
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure someone in chat will...

242
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:34,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero on Tour

243
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:06,652
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course some news that spilled earlier this week from a French website that Guitar Hero On Tour was on the way to Nintendo DS eventually.

244
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So who knows what this game could be.

245
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably a spin-off game.

246
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:14,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine there's not going to be a little guitar controller you actually plug in.

247
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think there will be.

248
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

249
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be weird.

250
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Because here's how they're going to probably do it.

251
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,766
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have an attachment that plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot and there you go.

252
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:24,348
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have your additional buttons like that.

253
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to assume maybe it was a tapping game, kind of like Elite Beat Agents, where you have the guitar on the lower screen or something, and you can tap the beats or something.

254
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:32,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

255
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:36,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it makes sense, but I think that they're actually going to have it where you can play the guitar.

256
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:44,031
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I would think about that, though, is if they did have it where you play the guitar like that, there's no real easy way to see the screen and play the guitar.

257
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:52,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, no, I take that back, because you can hold it in your hand so that you look at the top screen and use your hand, I guess...

258
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:55,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, your left hand could hit all the keys and stuff.

259
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:56,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It could work.

260
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a weird idea, but it could work.

261
00:16:59,002 --> 00:16:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It could.

262
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:02,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it does come out, it'll be probably selling quite a bit.

263
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:08,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and regardless, we all know this is just a way to further milk a franchise that, you know, is prime.

264
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not quite dead yet.

265
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The hot thing right now, right?

266
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

267
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, I know you play a lot of games on the DS.

268
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Guitar Hero something you'd want to play on the DS?

269
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd try it out, but otherwise, probably not.

270
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a nice diversion from Cooking Mama.

271
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:21,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Rock Band.

272
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:22,809
[SPEAKER_07]: True, true.

273
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:44,161
[SPEAKER_07]: by the way oh I totally forgot to say this during my gaming week but how could I forget like Thursday you know what I did I ran home I powered on the Xbox I put in Guitar Hero 3 and I downloaded me some Journey and it was awesome I just wanted to get that out there we were listening to the demo on that oh it was so hot

274
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:45,181
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

275
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,358
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some.

276
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,019
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is not going to be read because, honestly, it's worth it.

277
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:15,659
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worthless.

278
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

279
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:24,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, clearly, if said person had been listening to the entirety of the thing, they wouldn't have taken it completely out of context.

280
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:37,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So, therefore, addressing Lucky Nuts, which just instantly indicates the quality of the person listening to this, fuck you.

281
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:39,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that with

282
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,419
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the respect that you intended as well.

283
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even see this email.

284
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to check it out.

285
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,963
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the comment about how I said I would be interested in physics if not for the math?

286
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:54,925
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be interested in a topic and not actually care to do anything with it.

287
00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:57,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking moron.

288
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:00,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it tongue-in-cheek or what?

289
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:00,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.

290
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:01,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

291
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:02,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, whatever.

292
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, DidYouLoseASock wrote in and sent a link to StarTropic's Wii decoder.

293
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:16,754
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on YouTube because we are broadcasting on those 22 seconds by linking in the chat room.

294
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:22,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently this is how it's supposed to work in StarTropic, so... Do we have more music?

295
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:26,143
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's the end of that music.

296
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:26,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

297
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:27,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

298
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,343
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did watch the video earlier this week.

299
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:31,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of describe it for our listeners.

300
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty rad.

301
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:38,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Inside the manual, you know how when you download games on Virtual Console, you have the manual?

302
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:44,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's cool is that they actually included a little hyperlink where it says in the story, you said you got a letter.

303
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:51,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you click on a letter, it actually brings up the original letter, the text, and then there's this little animation of...

304
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:51,911
[SPEAKER_07]: SilverChaos

305
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:22,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, as of when I'm writing this, you all were talking about the Dusty PS3 with Ranma.

306
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:23,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if I spelled it wrong.

307
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you did, but I won't point it out.

308
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:30,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought up the fact that it might have been a setup.

309
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:37,557
[SPEAKER_00]: You were all discussing who might have done it, mentioning Microsoft's and Nintendo's possibilities, but you missed the most obvious answer, and I'm surprised no one in chat mentioned this.

310
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:38,778
[SPEAKER_00]: The makers of Dusty Cap 3.

311
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:45,896
[SPEAKER_00]: If you people thought that dust is this big problem, they would rush out and purchase one to protect their beloved PS3s.

312
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:46,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reading this.

313
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,717
[SPEAKER_00]: In need of a new screen name, Silver Chaos.

314
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:51,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your screen name.

315
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of cool.

316
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,339
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

317
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucky Nuts is clearly not all that lucky.

318
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,345
[SPEAKER_07]: The hate is spewing out of the mailbag this week.

319
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:06,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Oof.

320
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:07,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Drama.

321
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:08,686
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hate on me.

322
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hate back.

323
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:12,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PMSing female, goddammit!

324
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a happy email we can read?

325
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:16,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

326
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:21,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert M., our good buddy, went to Video Games Live.

327
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:23,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to read this.

328
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I paid to see video games live at Fox Theater in St.

329
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:28,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis and enjoyed the experience.

330
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:32,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few minor FUs presented as wishes, such as it is.

331
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:41,296
[SPEAKER_00]: One, wish the mid-balcony seats were high enough to obscure the top part of the video screen behind the lighting structure, had I known that I would have paid more for the lower-level seating.

332
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:46,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, wish I had been in these lower-level seating at least to get better connections with other DS players.

333
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:50,998
[SPEAKER_00]: My attempts to start four-player Pac-Man vs. matches ended in connection failures.

334
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun to connect with that many gamers, though.

335
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:57,977
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.

336
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:57,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost wish the Zelda section had featured more music than the iconic overworld theme.

337
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Something more along the lines of their medley of music from the Sonic games.

338
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, one major F you.

339
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:05,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, absolutely not really.

340
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:07,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Ending the show with one winged angel.

341
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoyable experience overall.

342
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of me wishes it had been longer.

343
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:15,850
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the three hours at Ran plus pre-show and intermission.

344
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,051
[SPEAKER_00]: He also sent another email.

345
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just about...

346
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,942
[SPEAKER_00]: To add one more, because we couldn't get the chat room for some reason.

347
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:27,705
[SPEAKER_00]: ObviousFE to Square Enix for not allowing use of their video in the show.

348
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:29,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.

349
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:31,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Last email.

350
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:32,368
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

351
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's because they have something to do.

352
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't quote me on this, but I think they have something to do with the competing show, Play.

353
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Play is a derivative of Dear Friends.

354
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It's put on by the same production company.

355
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So, something to think about.

356
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And GS68 says he went to Play in San Jose.

357
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:47,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

358
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Spice Girls Spice Girls Spice Girls Spice Girls

359
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:12,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

360
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:19,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, he says he went to play in San Jose GS68 and says there were so many people in PictoChat that people were actually using Room B. Wow.

361
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,009
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see that that often.

362
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

363
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:27,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I remember doing PictoChat at E3 a couple years ago and realized that one of the people I was talking to was Melody.

364
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,020
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the Nintendogs line.

365
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,061
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

366
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:32,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

367
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:56,988
[SPEAKER_00]: um anyway this last one um says hi OLR it's officially a year I've been listening to your show you rock and keep up the good work I listen to OLR on my iPod to keep my sanity while I do homework and then when I run out of recent episodes to listen to I tune into your radio station and listen to the music great job on everything and you have taught me important lessons after the ban I feel like I'm less immature now is DDR dead

368
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:03,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't seem to see much DDR action anymore, and when I used to play DDR, I'd get people to stop and watch me play.

369
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:07,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people really don't care if someone's AAA-ing Mac songs.

370
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:13,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how do I deal with a kid at school who thinks I'm a nerd, yet he devoted all of his time and money to do World of Warcraft?

371
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use the fact he plays World of Warcraft against him?

372
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:19,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.

373
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:21,348
[SPEAKER_00]: She said yes.

374
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:28,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And was it a mistake using my $100 Dell gift card towards buying a widescreen computer monitor instead of buying an Xbox 360 with it?

375
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:29,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many questions, I know.

376
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,074
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Sakura Max.

377
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I say this about DDR is dead?

378
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:38,680
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of got into this in a previous episode.

379
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me try to phrase this best I can.

380
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,903
[SPEAKER_07]: No, DDR is not dead.

381
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:52,657
[SPEAKER_07]: But DDR has evolved, and it hasn't evolved in the way I think most of us hardcore fans that grew up with DDR wanted it to.

382
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:54,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't evolve for us.

383
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It evolved to where the money's at, which you can't blame them for doing.

384
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they want to do.

385
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,028
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you look at the mixes, Disney Channel...

386
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:04,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Plugin to your TV, My First DDR.

387
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:11,019
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR is kind of geared towards 12-year-old girls and their slumber parties, which, again, that's where the money's at.

388
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:24,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disappointing because you would think that there's two distinctly different audiences, the 12-year-old girls and the anime convention-going people that helped foster DDR in the first place.

389
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think we would get...

390
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,370
[SPEAKER_07]: A new mix that caters to us a little bit.

391
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suppose you could say Supernova 2 is that.

392
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,751
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it really anything new?

393
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:32,911
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

394
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:39,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I always kind of said they needed to let the people responsible for the Xbox versions of DDR develop the next arcade mix.

395
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:44,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the last time we ever saw any true innovation out of DDR was all done on the Xbox versions.

396
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:46,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Good and bad, but at least it was innovation.

397
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,954
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm really going to say about DDR.

398
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:50,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I finish reading the email?

399
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:51,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, yes you may.

400
00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:56,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to give my, well, you know, with inflation, I guess it's $5 worth.

401
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:05,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

402
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Chris laugh.

403
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,181
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.

404
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:12,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when we threw you into the fire and pretended that we were going to kill you?

405
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:14,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought somebody was going to be reading an email.

406
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:15,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, fine.

407
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:16,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

408
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:16,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

409
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can use the fact that that guy plays World of Warcraft against him.

410
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:26,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, if I had an option of getting a monitor or an Xbox 360 right now, I'd get a monitor.

411
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,382
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, I already have an Xbox 360.

412
00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:37,483
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and he signs this, kid who likes Toho music on OLR station MMOs and Crysis.

413
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a PS on here that is addressed to Loki.

414
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:43,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, if you haven't yet, go on Crymod.com.

415
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,285
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a bunch of Crysis mods and maps.

416
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Download the... I guess Physis?

417
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It's P-H-Y-S-I-S 3 map.

418
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:58,964
[SPEAKER_00]: It has random contractions that showcase the physics engines of Crysis.

419
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:00,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try that.

420
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I finally got my second graphics card in and running in SLI.

421
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:10,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough because I... Overclocking one graphics card is easy.

422
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Overclocking two graphics cards is not easy because you actually have to flash them.

423
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:15,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

424
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:19,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing around with that a little bit, trying to get it stable.

425
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:28,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Benchmarks now, I got 17,000 something in 3 Mark 06, which is supposedly pretty good.

426
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:33,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to try Crysis yet with my cards in SLI.

427
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:37,218
[SPEAKER_00]: He offers another description for that particular mod.

428
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:41,282
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you get to play bowling with a barrel with Korean soldiers as pins.

429
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen videos of that.

430
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:43,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

431
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:46,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop weights on a wedge to make a truck go flying and much more.

432
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the last email.

433
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want Harmonix to do a dance game.

434
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:52,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want them to make a dance game.

435
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:23,778
[SPEAKER_07]: that would use a similar DDR mat to what we've already bought.

436
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:36,203
[SPEAKER_07]: That would make me very happy for Harmonix to develop something like that, because honestly, I think Harmonix gets American audiences in a way Konami just never did, or when they did, they were never noticed.

437
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:44,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the Xbox versions of DDR were great, but even then, it didn't ever take DDR to the next, next level.

438
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, I think Harmonix would just kind of start from scratch.

439
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:48,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they would have to.

440
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:51,268
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think DDR has needed that for a while.

441
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:53,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there needs to be a DDR mix that starts from scratch.

442
00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:06,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, say Konami will sue all you want, but if Konami, or I'm sorry, if Harmonix was able to innovate Guitar Freaks in a way that the game feels completely different, I'm sure the same can be done for a dance game.

443
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:13,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know if we have any people from Harmonix that listen to this program, but if we do, please be a known.

444
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like you to make a dance game for me.

445
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:14,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Please?

446
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I would like, you know, I wouldn't mind if Konami would

447
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:24,515
[SPEAKER_07]: but if Konami is going to make a new one, they need to start over from scratch.

448
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:25,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

449
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:25,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Mean it.

450
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw out all your old code and start again.

451
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:29,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

452
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:30,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

453
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:32,802
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get back to gaming news now.

454
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:34,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we?

455
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:35,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sorry.

456
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

457
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is a weird bit of news, but apparently the Gizmondo is coming back.

458
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:48,074
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

459
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:48,174
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

460
00:29:49,071 --> 00:30:02,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, apparently they had a Gizmondo teaser site stating that the legend is reborn and exciting physic worlds and some other stuff.

461
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:16,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently it will be back according to, at least in some form, Plex technical director Ian Murphy and says that the product has been recovered from liquidators

462
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:19,199
[SPEAKER_05]: and PlexTech is bringing it back to the market.

463
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:23,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

464
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:29,725
[SPEAKER_07]: But now some folks are asking in chat, wasn't this then retracted a little later?

465
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Was this story ended up being retracted?

466
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:32,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been.

467
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:33,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

468
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if it's been retracted or not.

469
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:38,610
[SPEAKER_05]: At least this article doesn't really say that.

470
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But he basically said that the device's second coming is happening as soon as May 2008.

471
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:46,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

472
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, I don't know.

473
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:53,269
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, if it was retracted, great, because I don't think it was too good to begin with.

474
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:55,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

475
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:59,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is not being retracted, and actually, I think this is kind of cool.

476
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not realize this franchise was set to make a comeback.

477
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game called Populous.

478
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:04,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys ever played this.

479
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:05,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

480
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:08,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was on Super Nintendo, but it was more of a computer game.

481
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:10,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more best remembered as a computer game.

482
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:15,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's going to have a resurgence on the DS, and Electronic Arts is bringing Populous out for the DS.

483
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's what's really cool.

484
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:21,717
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing about Populous was that basically the game had, I would call it, different skins.

485
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,899
[SPEAKER_07]: There were many different skins the game had.

486
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:33,866
[SPEAKER_07]: and you would build these cities that were human cities or Martian cities or it was more like, I shouldn't say human cities, it was like a medieval city or a, you know, new age city or what have you.

487
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:34,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is really cool.

488
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,809
[SPEAKER_07]: In the DS version of Populous, a new type of skin is going to be added.

489
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Nintendo civilization.

490
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:41,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

491
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:45,193
[SPEAKER_07]: The small cities start off as a little game and watch system.

492
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:46,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they grow into NESs.

493
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:47,795
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

494
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:47,935
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

495
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that even mean, the retraction was retracted?

496
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,040
[SPEAKER_07]: The first retraction was a mistake.

497
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Make up your goddamn mind.

498
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:22,222
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the first retraction was a mistake.

499
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:23,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It is actually coming.

500
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:25,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Scary enough.

501
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:34,649
[SPEAKER_07]: DM ends in chat and trying to make kind of a joke about OLR, is that you can evolve your crappy guys on a show to a Sunday show, like there should be an OLR skin.

502
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:41,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think that's kind of a cool idea, not so much what you're suggesting, but a version of Populous where you can make your own skins.

503
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:42,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be kind of fun.

504
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,195
[SPEAKER_07]: A little silly, but fun.

505
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I am definitely looking forward to Populous DS.

506
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,000
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be a good chance to revisit a series I haven't played in a long time.

507
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you'll have that opportunity.

508
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,681
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who like games on their iPod, Pole Position is coming out to iPod.

509
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So Namco is releasing Pole Position Remix.

510
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,063
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available through iTunes.

511
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And you drive with the iPod wheel.

512
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:13,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

513
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:21,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it comes out okay, but they're actually saying that it's the worst of all iPod games that are available now.

514
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't!

515
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,211
[SPEAKER_00]: But another reviewer said that it's the best one out.

516
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:25,851
[SPEAKER_00]: It's five bucks.

517
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:30,532
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got five bucks, you know, and don't have to spend it on kitty litter, give it a try.

518
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Worse or better?

519
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:38,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it makes sense, though, a driving game with the iPod wheel.

520
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:42,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is kind of a logical step, so I would think it would be okay.

521
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, pole position's a little bit

522
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:46,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, old?

523
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:54,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Pole Position is definitely one of those games that was way cooler when you were playing it at Chuck E. Cheese when you were six, right?

524
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you go back and play it now, you're like... I had a Pole Position cabinet in my house for a long time.

525
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:00,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

526
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:04,335
[SPEAKER_00]: But we put the MAME in it, and we had actually... Dan found an identical one.

527
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, you had a stand-up cabinet for Pole Position.

528
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:06,596
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a stand-up cabinet.

529
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Chuck E. Cheese, they had the sit-in-the-thing Pole Position.

530
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:10,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, those were great!

531
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were awesome, but, like, it was better when you were six.

532
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Hard Drivin'?

533
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,142
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucked.

534
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:15,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

535
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:19,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard Drivin' was good because I worked at a Namco arcade when I was out of high school.

536
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:24,365
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day I was there and we had no customers and I had been up all night and I took a nap in one.

537
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,407
[SPEAKER_05]: They were dark.

538
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:30,051
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a game that was on the PC that was very similar to Hard Drivin' and it was called Stunts.

539
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:34,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And you made your own stunt tracks but the graphics were pretty much the same as Hard Drivin'.

540
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great though because if you made a bunch of little 45 degree ramps...

541
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:50,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was similar to that, but if you made a bunch of 45 degree ramps and just drove on it really fast, your car would get up to like 500 miles an hour and it would fly into the air like a tornado.

542
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

543
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,924
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, games like Burnout, you can trace their roots back to hard driving.

544
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing Test Drive 3 on the PC with the really crappy graphics.

545
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, screw you, I had Test Drive on the Commodore 64.

546
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this might as well have been on the Commodore 64 because the graphics were crap, but

547
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

548
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to drive and run over chickens in that.

549
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, when I was eight, Test Drive had like the best graphics ever.

550
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:17,594
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

551
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:39,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this game may not be as good of an idea as, say, you know, Pole Position on the iPod, but there is a fan-made, and I don't even know where this came from, because I think it was a joke at one time, or they had a demo for it a while back,

552
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:45,023
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's Charles Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaten.

553
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:51,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fan-made game made with RPG Maker.

554
00:35:51,828 --> 00:36:07,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And it basically tells an epic story of post-cyberpocalypse Neo-New York in the wake of the great b-ball purge of 2041 that threatens to own the entirety of your existence for some time.

555
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:11,704
[SPEAKER_05]: and well they actually have a bunch of weird stuff in there.

556
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:12,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool though.

557
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically an RPG.

558
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,847
[SPEAKER_05]: You have like your basketball moves you do and little mini games and stuff.

559
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It is free to download and free is the magic word of course.

560
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Free is a good price for this story.

561
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:29,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're interested there's I'm sure you can find it out there.

562
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,875
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a bunch of different links and stuff hosting it.

563
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:37,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The website that actually has the info is from a gaming forum.

564
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,159
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a

565
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:42,139
[SPEAKER_05]: GamingW.net and just check their forums.

566
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:46,484
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got the full game from Tales of Games Studios.

567
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:49,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Presents Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaten.

568
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:50,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

569
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

570
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:27,038
[SPEAKER_07]: To put that in perspective, and a lot of sites have been putting it this way, that's half the size of Australia.

571
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Australia's population is like 20 million.

572
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Now granted, you have to think about like Australia is like mostly desert in the middle, in the outback.

573
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the people kind of live on the coast, but whatever.

574
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a pretty staggering number there.

575
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:41,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, I know you missed that.

576
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:44,384
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 million subscribers in World of Warcraft announced this week.

577
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot.

578
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:48,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Not surprising.

579
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And they all live in China.

580
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is amazing.

581
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, that's no joke.

582
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there are 5.5 million of those.

583
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Over half of those subscribers are in Asia.

584
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So not just China, but the Asian region.

585
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:05,649
[SPEAKER_07]: 2.5 here in North America and 2 million subscribers in Europe.

586
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:06,610
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty impressive.

587
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, some of those people from North America are kind of... Wait, I'm sorry, Chris.

588
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:09,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And a mic, what?

589
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:10,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you got... Oh, never mind.

590
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:11,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see... I got a mic.

591
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:12,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see you stole one.

592
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:12,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I stole it.

593
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:16,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those people in America are not that bright.

594
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:17,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Like...

595
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I surf the forums.

596
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not active on the forums because I just can't deal with it.

597
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:27,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, World of Warcraft forums, home of some serious lulz.

598
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Serious lulz.

599
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:34,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Best one today, server crash was deliberate hack by horde.

600
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, it was the horde crashed by server.

601
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny thing is, this wasn't a joke.

602
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,670
[SPEAKER_01]: This chick, or it could be a guy, I don't know.

603
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,744
[SPEAKER_07]: This person actually... Wait, is it a blood elf female?

604
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

605
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:49,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a guy.

606
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:50,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

607
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:52,268
[SPEAKER_01]: This person... It's a level 7, too.

608
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,096
[SPEAKER_01]: This person actually, like, was damn serious, and everyone was, like, going, Oh, lols, broke the internet.

609
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:58,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it the horde?

610
00:38:59,217 --> 00:38:59,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Insert...

611
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:03,506
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't never seen it so, like, plainly put, but that is a very good point.

612
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, um, let's

613
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:35,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on from the internet lulls to something a little more newsworthy.

614
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:50,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it says for PlayStation 2 release in March, Ratchet & Clank Size Matters will be coming from PSP to the PS2.

615
00:39:52,109 --> 00:40:00,136
[SPEAKER_00]: And also mentioned is... Oh, I'm trying to... I thought there was another game mentioned in this.

616
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it not loading?

617
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:09,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, given that it's completely crashed my browser before.

618
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:15,813
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill Origins is the other game.

619
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, Silent Hill Origins.

620
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:18,335
[SPEAKER_00]: We had already talked about that.

621
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:21,477
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't particularly mentioned here.

622
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:27,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, Ratchet & Clank, Size Matters, was officially announced on Sony's site.

623
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:41,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, both these games that everybody kind of knew was coming, but nobody wanted to announce, finally they're like, oh yeah, since the entire internet found out, the horde ruined it for everybody, these games are coming up.

624
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:45,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise, I'm sure you're shocked.

625
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:49,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about you, Jamie, but I'm actually excited about Silent Hill Zero on the PlayStation 2.

626
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:50,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hell yeah.

627
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:53,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Silent Hill wasn't really a game I wanted to play on the PSP, you know what I mean?

628
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:57,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually thinking of getting a light just so I could hook it up to the TV.

629
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:58,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Silent Hill is a scary game.

630
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,549
[SPEAKER_07]: A little screen is not that scary.

631
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I like scary.

632
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I like scary too.

633
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:03,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

634
00:41:03,832 --> 00:41:04,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

635
00:41:05,072 --> 00:41:07,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the kind of scary that fucks with your head.

636
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:14,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Silent Hill isn't your cup of tea, then maybe some old Sega arcade games are.

637
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:19,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the Naomi BIOS has been cracked and now will be... Finally?

638
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, finally.

639
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:23,745
[SPEAKER_00]: That means Planet Harrier.

640
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:40,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that means that this brand new emulator, well actually it's an emulator for the Dreamcast, will be able to run wonderful games such as Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Ferrari F-355 Challenge, and Ikaruga.

641
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:42,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Also known as The Good Stuff.

642
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Planet Harrier.

643
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so the Naomi games are going to be coming soon.

644
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:49,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

645
00:41:49,953 --> 00:41:51,914
[SPEAKER_05]: More news as soon as we get some.

646
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:53,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

647
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:58,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I want to go back to World of Warcraft for a minute, but not to talk about some internet lulls.

648
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:02,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually want to talk about something kind of a little bit sad.

649
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with a Virginia Tech student.

650
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,982
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not related to the tragedy that happened last year, but it was just another unfortunate tragedy.

651
00:42:09,742 --> 00:42:15,925
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a student there, a 21-year-old senior named Daniel Kim, who actually killed himself in a Target parking lot in Virginia.

652
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:19,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, what was the first thing that was blamed in the death?

653
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:20,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming.

654
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:21,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games.

655
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:22,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the horde!

656
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Individuals...

657
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:25,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Not okay.

658
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Individuals were automatically making assumptions about his death.

659
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

660
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

661
00:43:28,378 --> 00:43:28,938
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing.

662
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:33,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But it makes me angry that people always jump to these conclusions.

663
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you know, you say Virginia Tech, you think about that horrible, horrible tragedy that happened there last year.

664
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:42,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And who is the very first guy to come out and start blaming video games?

665
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:44,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord Voldemort.

666
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you've listened to this show enough, you know who I'm referencing.

667
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord Voldemort comes right out and blames the video games.

668
00:43:51,026 --> 00:43:51,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Turns out,

669
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:55,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Guy never played, he didn't own a single video game thing.

670
00:43:55,483 --> 00:44:01,846
[SPEAKER_07]: He just, there were mental problems that went beyond, you know, anything entertainment based.

671
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:04,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just, it pisses me off that people jump to conclusions.

672
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,288
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, he's a lawyer, he can say whatever he wants.

673
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:07,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, you know what?

674
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:08,529
[SPEAKER_07]: No repercussions.

675
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:13,451
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there is repercussions because there's angry people like us get on the internet and yell at them.

676
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, serious stuff, right?

677
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:22,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless, this kind of stuff makes me very angsty when I hear people jumping to conclusions about the video games made me do it or whatever.

678
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:25,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So what better time for us to bring on the FUs of the week?

679
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:44,971
[SPEAKER_00]: My FU of the week goes to my fingerprint.

680
00:44:46,511 --> 00:45:00,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been catching a lot more lately, and I'm going to have to go to the doctor next week, and it's also starting in my index finger now, so it's looking like I'm going to have to have surgery on my hand.

681
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,478
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe I'll get disability and not have to go to work.

682
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:04,839
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

683
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,361
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that if I had that much time off of work, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.

684
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:14,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I couldn't use my hand, I really wouldn't know what to do.

685
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:15,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be so bored.

686
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:19,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't been able to draw anything in like three weeks.

687
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:21,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really a pain in the butt.

688
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:26,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you do, don't let the evil get into your hand, otherwise you're going to have to chop it off with a chainsaw.

689
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:26,969
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

690
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:28,549
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I can have a shotgun hand.

691
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,470
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the plus.

692
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:32,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

693
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I can replace it with a machine gun hand.

694
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:40,612
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I thought the Wonder Shows and stuff was bad, but you guys are... This is not Boomstick!

695
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:42,012
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are taking it to a whole new level.

696
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:46,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Some folks in chat are giving you the finger, but only so you can type.

697
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:48,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

698
00:45:48,221 --> 00:45:49,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

699
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:50,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, Loki.

700
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to another one of my 360s crapping out.

701
00:45:54,283 --> 00:46:07,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, though, I found out there is another way to fix it, which involves heating up the motherboard with either a heat gun or, in this case, since I don't own a heat gun, a blow dryer until it gets really hot and then hopefully fixes everything.

702
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about as effective as, I don't know, throwing your console at a wall and hopefully fixing it that way.

703
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,611
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to give it a shot because, hey, what's the worst that can happen?

704
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already broken.

705
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:18,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

706
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:20,377
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

707
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:21,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm knocking on wood.

708
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:24,138
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn?

709
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:25,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

710
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:31,460
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes to this A&W float, which I saw at the grocery store.

711
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, who doesn't like root beer floats, right?

712
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

713
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I love root beer floats.

714
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:35,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

715
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:36,421
[SPEAKER_07]: But have you tried this?

716
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:36,981
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

717
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:37,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It's shit.

718
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:38,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a little bit.

719
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:39,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just like cream.

720
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:39,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to try some of this?

721
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:40,822
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just like.

722
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, try it.

723
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:41,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Try it on there.

724
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:42,502
It's.

725
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:44,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like it.

726
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:46,423
Here is just.

727
00:46:46,563 --> 00:46:46,703
Ooh.

728
00:46:47,668 --> 00:46:48,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

729
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, F you to A&W for this thing that is no substitute for the real thing.

730
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to you guys for disagreeing with me.

731
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:17,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And how hard is it seriously to make Rupir float?

732
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:17,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

733
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:20,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do... No, they should have.

734
00:47:20,226 --> 00:47:23,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept of it all being in one bottle is... You know what?

735
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:24,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if this would work.

736
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Rupir with the vanilla Dippin' Dots dropped in there.

737
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:35,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say at the store they not only have the A&W float, but they have Sunkissed floats too, but I don't think I'll be trying those.

738
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:38,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like orange cream soda is actually really good.

739
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:41,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Saint Delight floats?

740
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:43,437
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Saint Delight would be nasty.

741
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:44,857
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that wouldn't work.

742
00:47:46,098 --> 00:47:46,358
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

743
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:48,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you want to give out?

744
00:47:49,379 --> 00:47:51,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, an FU to my dad's girlfriend.

745
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,862
[SPEAKER_01]: The woman's driving me absolutely fucking nuts because she's...

746
00:47:57,594 --> 00:48:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I've been saying on air all night, she's a new mom, and she's hormonal, and I get that.

747
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:08,381
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but keep the baby away from things that are going to kill her!

748
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:19,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for instance, Baby 101, for those of you who do not have children, I would assume that all of you are intelligent to know that blankets are a potential hazard.

749
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:27,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you put the baby in baby blankets, but you keep it so that they're not, you know, in the way of the face.

750
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:28,474
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

751
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:53,765
[SPEAKER_01]: She's driving me nuts!

752
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:57,649
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just the, like, I get, you're a new mom, I get that.

753
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:58,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone makes mistakes.

754
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,053
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're making, like, 101 mistakes.

755
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:02,813
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have learned.

756
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:03,554
[SPEAKER_07]: You've met your quota.

757
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You've met your quota of mistakes, right?

758
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:11,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's like, you're allowed to make mistakes, but you're not allowed to make mistakes that are this big.

759
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,564
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, like, stuff you should have learned when you learned you were pregnant.

760
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:17,346
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

761
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:19,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Baby wipes, they're supposed to be cold and fucking cold.

762
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope things get better.

763
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to hear about the discomfort there.

764
00:49:25,264 --> 00:49:25,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

765
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:27,747
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm good.

766
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, F you to you for leaving us.

767
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:32,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

768
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:32,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

769
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:33,252
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I love you.

770
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:34,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say F you to you.

771
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:35,995
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

772
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:37,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you would, but it would be kinky.

773
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:38,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot.

774
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we just have a couple more gaming stories, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

775
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, some more gaming news.

776
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Jamie?

777
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:53,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Choo, choo, choo.

778
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:56,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't pass that up.

779
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,057
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a rumor that Space Channel 5 is coming to Wii and other systems.

780
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:05,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're getting Knights and Samba D'Amico, so...

781
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:14,910
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mention saying that there was going to be Space Channel 5.0 that was reported on Japanese news site The Magic Box.

782
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:21,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega denied it on IGN, but it could happen because they've done this before.

783
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:32,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was even stated by Mizuguchi that he'd be interested in bringing it as a downloadable game like a Res HD is.

784
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:36,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool if they made a new game

785
00:50:38,191 --> 00:50:44,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from what I heard when they were licensing some of the old Michael Jackson music.

786
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:44,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

787
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:49,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know that in the second Space Channel 5, the dances were in there.

788
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,903
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the dance battle ones.

789
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:53,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.

790
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:57,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got some last minute stories here real quick.

791
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, we'll be taking some calls on the Skype line.

792
00:51:02,611 --> 00:51:05,893
[SPEAKER_05]: First, of course, who doesn't like a good drinking game?

793
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:06,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently...

794
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:28,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Sexy Video Game Land's blog has come up with a few different drinking games, one of which is familiar solid, and it requires a bunch of different concoctions to make up, including, I guess, American beer, bottle of Russian vodka, six-pack of Red Bull, and some other stuff.

795
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, coarse salt, lemon-lime juice, and... Yeah.

796
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

797
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:36,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quickly, I'll just go over some of these.

798
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,224
[SPEAKER_05]: When you trigger alert, drink Red Bull.

799
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:48,168
[SPEAKER_05]: When an enemy shows inappropriate sexual attraction to Snake, you take a vodka shot.

800
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see here.

801
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:58,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever your commander reminds you via the codec that you're on a stealth slash sneaking mission, that's when you take a beer shot.

802
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:04,358
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's kind of complicated and they have a big long list of stuff that you do so you probably can get pretty wasted from that.

803
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:14,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Other drinking games that they had available though, one was for Final Fantasy X2 or X2, my mistake.

804
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, this one's a lot simpler.

805
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically four different things to take a shot to.

806
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time you see YRP, you take a shot.

807
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:30,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time you see a clumsy-framed Yuna fanservice upskirt, take a shot.

808
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:40,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever you notice or re-notice LeBlanc's impossible simultaneous side and underboob dress setup, take a shot.

809
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:44,051
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the idea, to get drunk in like five seconds?

810
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:44,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

811
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:49,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever Brother's antics become completely insufferable, take a shot.

812
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,190
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

813
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see the OLR drinking game.

814
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:54,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it's hilarious.

815
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:57,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they've got one.

816
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:00,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other stuff real quick, of course.

817
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:02,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The Skyplane's open, by the way.

818
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:04,577
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

819
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:05,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Use name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

820
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some screenshots showing a car in No More Heroes, and apparently it has a New Jersey plate on it.

821
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:15,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So people are thinking, hey, Santa destroys in New Jersey.

822
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

823
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:32,009
[SPEAKER_05]: One cool thing, if you haven't played it yet, I was playing a little bit during break, Patapon, the demo is available in the US, and one of the cool things about playing the demo is it will unlock an exclusive weapon when you buy the full game.

824
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,951
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy the full game, I guess.

825
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:46,020
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, when I said the whole OLR drinking game, SSJ100Matt and Actdeft, like in unison, said, OLR drinking game, every time Loki says anyway, you take a shot.

826
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:48,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it!

827
00:53:49,014 --> 00:53:50,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to the phones real quick.

828
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:52,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let Loki finish the stories in a little bit, but we want to hear from you guys.

829
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

830
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:55,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

831
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:57,319
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68.

832
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:58,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, GS68.

833
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,320
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

834
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:06,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've been playing Super Metroid lately, and several weeks ago I decided to try Metroid Prime 3.

835
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:11,727
[SPEAKER_07]: You were playing Metroid Prime 3, uh-huh.

836
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:17,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I found it pretty disorienting, and

837
00:54:20,013 --> 00:54:24,578
[SPEAKER_11]: and at some point I got stuck and I started going around in circles and getting dizzy and that's when I just realized that

838
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:31,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not for first-person games, and I'm not a big fan of 3D games.

839
00:54:54,563 --> 00:55:05,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So to take Metroid to a 3D space is tough because you really have to, you know, when you've played 2D games for a long time to then suddenly have to conceptualize things in 3D takes some getting used to.

840
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:06,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.

841
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of people don't give some of us enough credit.

842
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I partially blame it for why I suck so bad at Halo.

843
00:55:11,617 --> 00:55:14,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always getting lost just because I'm, I don't know.

844
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is.

845
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to think I'm not stupid or anything.

846
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:17,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I am.

847
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:21,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I just am not used to gaming in a 3D space for a long time.

848
00:55:21,466 --> 00:55:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

849
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:32,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I just started playing Super Metroid over the summer, and I think it's more with me and first-person shooters.

850
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:39,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, on paper, first-person shooter on the Wii sounds really cool, but when I try it, I get dizzy.

851
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,157
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe you're just...

852
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have a little bit of the motion sickness, too.

853
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:46,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to make sure you look away once in a while and all that stuff.

854
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, certainly, I know DarkSakura has talked about that she doesn't like to play a whole lot of first-person shooters because she, on a big old TV, can make you feel a little nauseous, right?

855
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

856
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:09,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly, it's probably, I'm assuming, and Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'm assuming it's kind of a lot of the same triggers that make people motion sick in cars come into play in video games.

857
00:56:10,082 --> 00:56:10,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

858
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:15,906
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's like, it's like, you know, like that whole thing where like if you're sitting in the back of a car around a windy road.

859
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:16,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, go ahead.

860
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:17,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

861
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:27,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there was like this cutscene in Final Fantasy 7 where Cloud says never to read while in a car or truck, which I thought was interesting.

862
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:37,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's interesting you bring up Final Fantasy VII because remember that was a big shock when it came out because it was like, OMG, it's taking a 2D game and putting it in a 3D space.

863
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was kind of different.

864
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:44,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII still felt pretty 2D to me, just with a 3D twist to it.

865
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like two and a half dimensions, if that makes sense.

866
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:53,011
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the point is, overall, I guess I'm just more into side scores and first-person shooters.

867
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:54,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's okay.

868
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:56,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are into whatever they're into, so...

869
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,726
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no particular type of game you have to like.

870
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:02,289
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, GS68, any other final thoughts for our listeners before we keep moving on?

871
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:03,470
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

872
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,130
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

873
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:11,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for your input tonight, and I hope Metroid Prime 3 is a great game once you can kind of get used to the first-person-ness, so I hope the sickness doesn't bog you down.

874
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:12,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it another go.

875
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:13,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'll find this a lot of fun.

876
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:14,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

877
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try sometime in the future.

878
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:18,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

879
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:20,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

880
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:21,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the weird thing.

881
00:57:21,344 --> 00:57:25,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I'm not a big fan of the first-person games, I freaking love Oblivion.

882
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

883
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with it.

884
00:57:28,606 --> 00:57:29,807
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about punching the animals.

885
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:30,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

886
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:31,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

887
00:57:31,968 --> 00:57:32,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

888
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:34,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up?

889
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,749
[SPEAKER_02]: This is RossDLUT.

890
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, RossDLUT, my friend.

891
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:38,510
[SPEAKER_07]: What is on your mind?

892
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:40,571
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things.

893
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:50,475
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, you're talking about the whole idea of conceptualizing 3D games when you've been used to 2D games just now.

894
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:52,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's helped is

895
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:58,409
[SPEAKER_02]: You have environments that are more detailed to where you can associate landmarks.

896
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:00,469
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember the old 3D games, like in the early PS1,

897
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all the walls look the same.

898
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:21,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it made Doom damn near impossible for me, because everything, you know, one wall was the same as the other, you know what I mean?

899
00:58:22,111 --> 00:58:23,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you've got a damn good point here.

900
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:30,474
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing that always kind of frustrated me about the Mega Man Legends games, especially the early ones, is that, you know, everything kind of looked the same, so it was very hard.

901
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:32,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were only two Mega Man Legends games.

902
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but... But yeah, I know what you mean.

903
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:42,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do a 3D game and have everything look the same, because you're just going to get horribly lost, and it doesn't matter...

904
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:50,099
[SPEAKER_02]: but then again the same thing happens with a lot of 2D games the original Metroid was a pain in the ass because all you had was the

905
00:58:51,638 --> 00:58:56,262
[SPEAKER_02]: The Black Background, and the different colors of the floors, so it took me a little while.

906
00:58:56,322 --> 00:59:04,868
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, you bring up a damn good point, because it's not like in the real world I have a problem conceptualizing 3D space.

907
00:59:04,928 --> 00:59:06,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think many of us do.

908
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,571
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe there's a condition out there, I don't know.

909
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:12,154
[SPEAKER_07]: But most people don't have a problem conceptualizing 3D space in the real world.

910
00:59:12,394 --> 00:59:14,876
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you're right, a lot of that is landmarks, right?

911
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:16,177
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we give directions out?

912
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:19,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We say, okay, go straight down the street, and when you see the McDonald's, turn right.

913
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:20,120
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

914
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:21,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

915
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: You need those recognizable landmarks.

916
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:26,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you need a McDonald's.

917
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:27,548
[SPEAKER_07]: For lack of a better term, yeah.

918
00:59:40,768 --> 00:59:47,212
[SPEAKER_07]: maps, instant maps, one-button maps, a little mini-map in the corner, a way to conceptualize the 3D and 2D very quickly.

919
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:50,894
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one reason I way prefer Kingdom Hearts 2 to Kingdom Hearts 1 is the mini-map.

920
00:59:50,974 --> 00:59:51,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

921
00:59:52,374 --> 00:59:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge... Yeah, I hear you.

922
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:56,757
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the games have the mini-maps.

923
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:03,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the really late ones, like Call of Duty 4 has a mini-map when you pause.

924
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:05,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of aids today.

925
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is that, you know.

926
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, 3D is a lot easier today than it used to be.

927
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:15,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what else did you want to say, RustyLUT?

928
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:18,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're trying to move through a lot of calls tonight.

929
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back to the whole idiots on Mass Effect thing.

930
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

931
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:29,806
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been seeing for the better part of a decade and a half idiots attacking video games.

932
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:32,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to call them idiots because, you know, ignorant means you don't know better.

933
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid means you don't want to learn.

934
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

935
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

936
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:41,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew, your words have not been spoken on this show tonight.

937
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:41,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

938
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:44,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you.

939
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, I always wonder what sort of impact they really have, aside from the whole soundbite culture.

940
01:00:52,976 --> 01:00:59,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you look at it, in that time when the anti-gaming attacks have been so intense...

941
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:04,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry has just grown and blossomed enormously.

942
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had this epic year last year.

943
01:01:06,823 --> 01:01:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

944
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:11,444
[SPEAKER_02]: $18 billion for the industry last year?

945
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:19,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to really wonder how important these Jack Thompson, how many people they actually reach out to.

946
01:01:19,705 --> 01:01:26,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we lose sight of is that the United States is a country of 300 million people.

947
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:28,067
[SPEAKER_02]: There's...

948
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:33,479
[SPEAKER_02]: A ton of cable networks, literally, a ton of cable networks and satellite and everything else.

949
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:35,680
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many options out there.

950
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

951
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're kind of right, Ross.

952
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:43,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one thing we kind of don't consider about this Fox News piece is that they were probably preaching to the choir in a sense.

953
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:51,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of the people that watch Fox News were probably already the crowd that bans their children from playing video games altogether and all this stuff.

954
01:01:53,306 --> 01:01:54,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't excuse the ignorance.

955
01:01:55,467 --> 01:02:00,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nothing excuses the ignorance.

956
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I think originally these guys were probably preaching to the choir, but at the same time it doesn't give them the right to lie.

957
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:21,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, and I'm angry about the lie, but at the same time, compared to other times in history, other media's attacks, video games have had a pretty damn light.

958
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:24,454
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've gone through it pretty damn quickly in comparison.

959
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:28,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the movie industry 40 years to get over the Hays Code, for example.

960
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,932
[SPEAKER_02]: and the comic book industry only recently got out of the shadow of the comic book.

961
01:02:32,952 --> 01:02:34,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games have had it very light.

962
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:37,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Ross Dill, UT, we've got to wrap up but I've got to say this.

963
01:02:37,215 --> 01:02:46,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens especially as this Hollywood writer's strike continues where video games are going to become... You watch this happen.

964
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:52,725
[SPEAKER_07]: The longer this strike goes on, the more of these writers are going to start writing for video games and we're going to have very Hollywood-ish type of video games.

965
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:54,226
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very interesting.

966
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already seeing that happen.

967
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:57,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already seeing video games

968
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: taking audience from television, which is part of why you see all this anti-gaming stuff on TV.

969
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:06,595
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to get rid of that market.

970
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:07,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I know you're tired.

971
01:03:07,956 --> 01:03:08,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

972
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another story about this this week.

973
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:16,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they say that video game plots are always so thin they never make good movies.

974
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:18,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're going to start seeing a lot more games.

975
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:21,066
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't make good movies because the directors suck.

976
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:22,707
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true a lot of the time, too.

977
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:25,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Uwe Ball anyone?

978
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:51,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill some of them were passable some of them were even Mortal Kombat was passable passable I liked the first Mortal Kombat I liked the first Resident Evil but then you look into shit those were good movies you look at shit like Blood Rain and you're just like this is why I get better okay one sex scene we're not gonna be alright Rusty or UT I'm so sorry we gotta let you go but have a good one buddy it's always good to hear from you bye bye you do the same bye bye

979
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:52,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft from chat

980
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:10,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, three things on mine.

981
01:04:11,773 --> 01:04:14,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is the DVR is dead thing.

982
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:27,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you on the Konami should definitely hire or commission harmonics on the whole renewal of DVR.

983
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:33,388
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having so much success with Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

984
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, you're from Mexico, right?

985
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:37,927
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember right?

986
01:05:03,129 --> 01:05:03,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

987
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's one question.

988
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear that Pump It Up has a huge fan base in Mexico.

989
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:09,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true in your neck?

990
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:11,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, obviously, Mexico is a very big place, but is that true in your neck of the woods?

991
01:05:13,936 --> 01:05:20,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Pump It Up is more popular on the center of the country, more on the south side.

992
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.

993
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,642
[SPEAKER_03]: On the north, DVR has more popularity.

994
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:25,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

995
01:05:25,663 --> 01:05:31,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that might just be because a lot of American culture kind of seeps through because the closer you get to the border and everything?

996
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:32,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that might be a part of it or just

997
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:33,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Coincidence.

998
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:34,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

999
01:05:36,129 --> 01:05:37,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's most part of it.

1000
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:38,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1001
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was thinking, yeah, and somebody brought it up in chat too, ColorSakura said it in chat, and I was thinking of this too, that the World Pump Festival was happening in Mexico City.

1002
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:51,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Mexico City is much further south in Mexico than, you know, other places.

1003
01:05:51,437 --> 01:05:52,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow.

1004
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:53,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1005
01:05:54,919 --> 01:06:02,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I wanted to comment on what you said a week ago about Video Games Live.

1006
01:06:02,244 --> 01:06:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1007
01:06:03,243 --> 01:06:07,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's coming to Mexico and it's coming to Mexicali, that's my hometown.

1008
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1009
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty damn excited.

1010
01:06:10,194 --> 01:06:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: That has got to be awesome.

1011
01:06:11,456 --> 01:06:12,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be easy.

1012
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:15,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it's not every day.

1013
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:22,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, a lot of big tours and things don't always think to go to Mexico or other countries.

1014
01:06:23,126 --> 01:06:27,549
[SPEAKER_07]: We hear a lot from Footy Monster, who's in Argentina, and not a lot of stuff comes to his neck of the woods either.

1015
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:31,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet that's got to be pretty awesome to see something like this actually kind of recognized.

1016
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, hey, let's go to some places a little bit outside the North.

1017
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:36,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go somewhere besides L.A.

1018
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:36,815
[SPEAKER_07]: and New York, right?

1019
01:06:37,936 --> 01:06:38,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool.

1020
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:47,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty exciting because here in my town doesn't happen anything like this huge, like, video game slide, though.

1021
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for some people, it would be like, oh, video games, oh yeah, whatever.

1022
01:06:54,082 --> 01:07:02,608
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it's a great experience that's going to happen, going to the bullring that's going to be happening.

1023
01:07:04,569 --> 01:07:12,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And hearing all the music I know and recognize from old video games, and also with my friends that also are video game fans,

1024
01:07:13,536 --> 01:07:16,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, let me ask you just one last question, then we've got to wrap up.

1025
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:21,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it will succeed in a non-traditional place like Mexicali?

1026
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:23,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the show has the potential to do very well there?

1027
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:34,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a pretty big community of gamers, and also people who like anime, otakus, and pretty much geeks.

1028
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:43,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I... It would be a success, though not as great as in the big city.

1029
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I wanted to add before ending the call.

1030
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Fox News thing.

1031
01:08:09,662 --> 01:08:12,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little opinion on my part.

1032
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be not us attacking them also or ignore them.

1033
01:08:22,153 --> 01:08:27,057
[SPEAKER_03]: We should acknowledge their opinions and maybe make a debate.

1034
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the PAX Expo tried to do last year with Jack Thompson, a debate.

1035
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:50,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting perspective that maybe instead of getting on the offensive, like things that you see on Amazon.com, everybody attacking this lady who said this, maybe the video game community can kind of look at how can we stop this from happening in the future?

1036
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:53,259
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is what people really think, how can we educate them otherwise?

1037
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,360
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting way of looking at it.

1038
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting way of looking at it.

1039
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your opinion.

1040
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, we're out of time.

1041
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to let you go, but thanks so much for your call.

1042
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

1043
01:09:02,622 --> 01:09:02,862
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1044
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1045
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:05,677
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1046
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:43,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they have an agenda, like, you know, trying to be sensationalists and stuff like that, and really rile up people about video games, they're just gonna do these stories anyway, since, obviously, they don't really care about apologizing about it.

1047
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:44,171
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

1048
01:09:44,611 --> 01:09:51,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised we don't see more crazy shit on there, like, you know, Grand Theft Auto literally reaches out at the TV and murders your children and stuff like that.

1049
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:53,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... The Horde is after your children?

1050
01:09:54,054 --> 01:09:55,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the Horde is after your children.

1051
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:58,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a satanic cult.

1052
01:09:59,164 --> 01:10:04,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Cultivated by a video game, it has 10 million followers, and it will destroy the Christian race.

1053
01:10:08,327 --> 01:10:11,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how we can go from that into another call, but we're going to try.

1054
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:12,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1055
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:13,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1056
01:10:14,648 --> 01:10:15,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up, everyone?

1057
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:15,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ranma.

1058
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:21,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to that, because sometimes I pick up calls and don't acknowledge for a little bit, just to get them on the line.

1059
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:23,171
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to that for 30 seconds.

1060
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how you held the laughter in, so we couldn't hear you.

1061
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:27,992
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1062
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:29,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Ramma, what's on your mind?

1063
01:10:31,305 --> 01:10:37,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was a couple things I wanted to discuss, but I'm putting that aside because I'm very pissed off right now.

1064
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:38,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that?

1065
01:10:38,312 --> 01:10:39,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one thing to say.

1066
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:40,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I please say it?

1067
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:41,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1068
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:47,342
[SPEAKER_09]: People, shut the fuck up about DDR.

1069
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:47,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It's

1070
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:49,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

1071
01:10:49,486 --> 01:10:55,696
[SPEAKER_09]: God forbid Konami ignores its other franchises to please you drooling fanboys.

1072
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say they're really ignoring their franchise.

1073
01:10:57,579 --> 01:11:00,764
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still releasing more than two games a year for the damn thing.

1074
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't say it's dead.

1075
01:11:02,226 --> 01:11:03,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

1076
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:08,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, be thankful you're getting something, you know?

1077
01:11:08,482 --> 01:11:09,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the people who play DDR.

1078
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:12,025
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all their fault because they're not the ones playing it.

1079
01:11:12,045 --> 01:11:13,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's releasing plenty of games.

1080
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,367
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you guys, you all suck.

1081
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

1082
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:18,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, I agree and I disagree.

1083
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:21,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree to a point that at some point you have to let DDR go.

1084
01:11:21,492 --> 01:11:22,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to let it go.

1085
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:23,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It's past its prime, whatever.

1086
01:11:24,354 --> 01:11:29,257
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same part, it sucks because without DDR, I would never have met Jamie.

1087
01:11:29,677 --> 01:11:30,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have never met Matt.

1088
01:11:31,018 --> 01:11:31,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have never met you.

1089
01:11:32,338 --> 01:11:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1090
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:58,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris was talking about a fundraiser going on on DeviantArt to help one of the artists in need.

1091
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was talking about that's a really great example of community.

1092
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:06,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet if something like that happened in the DDR world, the DDR community would have done something similar.

1093
01:12:06,897 --> 01:12:09,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, Thomas Howard, he's hungry.

1094
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:11,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Every community has done something like that.

1095
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:28,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Some conventions, when they have the auctions for artwork and stuff like that, they will say a portion of this will go to this charitable organization, which is pretty cool.

1096
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:29,554
[SPEAKER_07]: We've heard all sides of this.

1097
01:12:29,874 --> 01:12:32,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not continue to indulge the DDR discussion.

1098
01:12:32,316 --> 01:12:33,256
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did you want to say, Ranma?

1099
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:41,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I do know a few episodes back it was talking about the Wii and the Wii Remote, and it's something I thought about.

1100
01:12:42,064 --> 01:12:44,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask all of you guys this, and girls.

1101
01:12:45,045 --> 01:12:54,848
[SPEAKER_09]: If the Wii came loaded with the Wii Remote and a classic controller, would the console still be considered a gimmick system?

1102
01:12:59,070 --> 01:12:59,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1103
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:02,747
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1104
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:25,539
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1105
01:13:50,503 --> 01:13:51,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree on that.

1106
01:13:51,524 --> 01:13:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see how Nintendo wanted to get away from that.

1107
01:13:53,686 --> 01:13:54,306
[SPEAKER_09]: That was cool.

1108
01:13:54,486 --> 01:13:57,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some of the Wii games on launch, and it was cool.

1109
01:13:57,888 --> 01:13:59,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Dragon Ball Z, Budokai 2.

1110
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:00,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't get into it.

1111
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:04,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I need a regular controller in order to play the game.

1112
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:07,515
[SPEAKER_09]: At first, everyone was like, oh, this is so cool, this is so great.

1113
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:10,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, developers are like saying, this ain't a joke, you know?

1114
01:14:11,097 --> 01:14:12,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go on to other things.

1115
01:14:14,259 --> 01:14:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a very realistic possibility in the future, Ranma, is that when the Wii start coming out in other colors, and again, this is all speculation, why not throw in a matching classic controller of another color?

1116
01:14:24,462 --> 01:14:26,523
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is an established thing now.

1117
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:29,884
[SPEAKER_07]: The waggling and the motions, it's established now.

1118
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:31,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Developers will buy into it.

1119
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:35,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's okay to start putting in classic controllers and kind of see what can happen with a good mix.

1120
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,020
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll definitely work.

1121
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:42,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, you got, like, a game where one person uses a controller to, like, drive a car.

1122
01:14:42,922 --> 01:14:47,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other person can use the remote, the control, like, the little guns or the lasers.

1123
01:14:47,465 --> 01:14:48,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be pretty cool.

1124
01:14:48,246 --> 01:14:49,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, lots of ideas.

1125
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:59,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, I think back to that YouTube that came out a little while ago with the whole reverse thing where the guy had the whole conceptualized space thing, but he was, like, wearing the sensor bar on his head.

1126
01:14:59,092 --> 01:15:00,032
[SPEAKER_07]: That thing was amazing.

1127
01:15:00,052 --> 01:15:00,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you saw it.

1128
01:15:02,274 --> 01:15:04,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure someone in chat has a link to the YouTube.

1129
01:15:04,055 --> 01:15:04,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freaking amazing.

1130
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:07,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, really quickly, any last thoughts and we've got to let you go.

1131
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:09,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tired of 3D games.

1132
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I want more 2D games and 3D environments.

1133
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:13,403
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1134
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quickly, how do you feel about the Bionic Commando remake?

1135
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that seems to be exactly the kind of thing you're talking about.

1136
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:20,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll buy that for $20.

1137
01:15:20,828 --> 01:15:21,109
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1138
01:15:21,129 --> 01:15:21,589
[SPEAKER_09]: You do that.

1139
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:22,410
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1140
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for your call, Ranma.

1141
01:15:25,032 --> 01:15:25,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1142
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:26,033
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1143
01:15:26,053 --> 01:15:26,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1144
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:26,493
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1145
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:32,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, like, I had the biggest nerdgasm when I saw that Bionic Commando thing last week.

1146
01:15:33,088 --> 01:15:33,769
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can even say that.

1147
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,551
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, any other... Any other... Yes, I fangasmed all over myself.

1148
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:39,572
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, real quick.

1149
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:40,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I got another call.

1150
01:15:40,272 --> 01:15:41,393
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the last one, I promise.

1151
01:15:41,993 --> 01:15:43,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1152
01:15:43,094 --> 01:15:43,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1153
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1154
01:15:47,396 --> 01:15:47,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, who's this?

1155
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:50,318
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Let's Have Tea.

1156
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:52,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Let's Have Tea.

1157
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:53,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the show.

1158
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, because we're trying to wrap up.

1159
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:55,821
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you want to say?

1160
01:15:58,462 --> 01:16:06,767
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you didn't really want any more comments on the whole DDR thing, but there are communities out there working together using DDR for charities.

1161
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:20,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's an organization in Indiana that they've been doing annual charities for seven years now, using DDR as a...

1162
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:24,890
[SPEAKER_12]: away to raise money.

1163
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:31,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year, they raised just over $2,800 a weekend for a children's hospital.

1164
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:32,316
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1165
01:16:32,336 --> 01:16:33,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you happen to have a website link or anything?

1166
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:40,062
[SPEAKER_12]: The community for that is over at NDDDR.com.

1167
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:40,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1168
01:16:41,803 --> 01:16:43,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's called the DDR-a-thon.

1169
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:44,465
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1170
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:45,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1171
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:49,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's have T. We've got to let you go because I swore we were going to wrap up, but thank you so much for sharing that with us.

1172
01:16:49,128 --> 01:16:49,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, okay?

1173
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:51,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1174
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:52,111
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1175
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1176
01:16:53,941 --> 01:17:21,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that nickname too I forgot to compliment him when he was on the line but Let's Have Tea is like one of my favorite nicknames of anybody in chat alright I promised we could wrap up we're gonna do a couple quick last minute stories but I did want to say this real quick because he's talking about charity and I think it's really interesting this has kind of become a fad lately I don't know if that's the right word to use because that has kind of a negative context with it but I've noticed it seems like I've seen a lot of these 48 hour gaming sessions for charity lately like you know I want to say

1177
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:27,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody sent me an email, I think it was one of our listeners, that they were going to play through the Banjo-Kazooie games in one weekend.

1178
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:33,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we saw the Mario-a-thon, the Sonic-a-thon, the Zelda-a-thon.

1179
01:17:33,745 --> 01:17:40,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a very interesting trend right now that people are doing these marathons for different charities.

1180
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's cool.

1181
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:42,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great example of...

1182
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:45,748
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1183
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:40,660
[SPEAKER_05]: To kind of go back to some of the stuff we talked about earlier, there is a rumor, I guess now, apparently a tipster who tipped off QJNet about the phasing out of the 20 gig PS3s is also saying that now he has information about the phase out of the 80 gig PS3s for GameStop and EB.

1184
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they're also phasing them out as well.

1185
01:18:43,860 --> 01:19:13,615
[SPEAKER_05]: and he says I went ahead and looked in our back office inventory screen and found that only SKU listed as active for the PS3 console was the 40 gig system the 2060 and 80 SKUs were deleted so that's kind of interesting and of course Sony has come out and said no comment regarding the phased out rumors most likely though if we're hearing that a lot of these retailers are phasing out that something's going to happen so not a big surprise there

1186
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:19,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone else apparently found another hack into the Wii to run their own code.

1187
01:19:19,785 --> 01:19:29,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's an exploit using a game save for Zelda Twilight Princess where you can crash it and run a code using a buffer overflow.

1188
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:31,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of neat.

1189
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:33,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1190
01:19:33,872 --> 01:19:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Surfer Girl, of course, she's had a lot of rumors that have come true here.

1191
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our newest ones include Slalom, I guess, a rare

1192
01:19:44,484 --> 01:19:47,525
[SPEAKER_05]: and Dead Rising 2 and Lost Planet 2 not too far behind.

1193
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:51,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP will also be getting a follow-up title coming in the form of another Syphon Filter game.

1194
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:14,753
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll have the story tied into a PS3 version as well, also set for 2009.

1195
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:19,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, there is some stuff coming from EA.

1196
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:28,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they are rumored to be working on another Wing Commander title, an actual Wing Commander title, not some crappy Xbox Live Arcade game.

1197
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:40,101
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there is also another Xbox Live Arcade game coming from Rare, and that game is Mr. Pants, which I don't know if you've played Mr. Pants, but it's a weird game.

1198
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:42,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Pants.

1199
01:20:44,242 --> 01:20:45,642
[SPEAKER_07]: What is a game called Mr. Pants?

1200
01:20:45,722 --> 01:20:47,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember, but it looked weird.

1201
01:20:47,883 --> 01:20:49,503
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1202
01:20:49,543 --> 01:20:52,524
[SPEAKER_07]: We're way over for time tonight, so we definitely have to wrap things up.

1203
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last minute stories quickly, though?

1204
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:55,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure.

1205
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:56,425
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1206
01:20:56,825 --> 01:20:57,125
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1207
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:01,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Then let's go ahead and wrap it up with our final thoughts.

1208
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:03,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

1209
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:05,573
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1210
01:21:19,894 --> 01:21:21,675
[SPEAKER_07]: as long as I drink it in moderation.

1211
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't live off vitamin water, but it's good stuff.

1212
01:21:24,315 --> 01:21:34,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, but certainly not leastly, thank you so much, Chris, for coming over tonight and lending your moral support and your shining face to our show and a very good bonus segment all thanks to you tonight.

1213
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:37,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Chris, any final thoughts from you?

1214
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:40,019
[SPEAKER_01]: The Horde is after your server.

1215
01:21:42,512 --> 01:21:44,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And please call in once in a while and let us know you're doing okay.

1216
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:45,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I plan to.

1217
01:21:45,754 --> 01:21:46,155
[SPEAKER_07]: You better.

1218
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:48,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're still going to be our roving reporter in Wisconsin.

1219
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:51,198
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll find something gaming-related up there for you to cover.

1220
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:52,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1221
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've got something that I want to plug later, but I'll do that later.

1222
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to plug it now?

1223
01:21:57,315 --> 01:21:57,815
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1224
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:27,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm losing my memory already.

1225
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:51,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wouldn't happen.

1226
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:52,254
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't be here.

1227
01:22:52,294 --> 01:22:53,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't be able to do this.

1228
01:22:53,415 --> 01:22:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do it for free.

1229
01:22:54,356 --> 01:22:57,358
[SPEAKER_07]: We do it because we love getting to hang out with y'all on a Sunday night.

1230
01:22:57,478 --> 01:23:01,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And even for those guys that can't make it live, we love the feedback and the stuff we get.

1231
01:23:01,922 --> 01:23:04,184
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are awesome, and thank you so much for your support of us.

1232
01:23:04,705 --> 01:23:07,547
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like what we do, all we ask, help spread the word.

1233
01:23:07,808 --> 01:23:09,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell a couple friends about Orange Lounge Radio.

1234
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:13,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Post a positive review on iTunes, which, by the way, we got a couple of those this week.

1235
01:23:13,433 --> 01:23:17,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to really thank those new entries on iTunes this week, some really nice reviews.

1236
01:23:18,237 --> 01:23:19,678
[SPEAKER_07]: or wherever you think would be best.

1237
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:21,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I know not everyone uses iTunes.

1238
01:23:21,098 --> 01:23:21,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, whatever.

1239
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:24,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Dig, Yahoo, Podcast, whatever.

1240
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great.

1241
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much as always.

1242
01:23:28,581 --> 01:23:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And until next week when we will be joined with our first ever musical guest, which is going to be all kinds of interesting.

1243
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:34,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait.

1244
01:23:35,323 --> 01:23:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you then here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1245
01:23:37,964 --> 01:23:38,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Rob.

1246
01:23:38,484 --> 01:23:39,325
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Dark Sakura.

1247
01:23:39,365 --> 01:23:39,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Loki.

1248
01:23:40,245 --> 01:23:40,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're out.

1249
01:23:42,066 --> 01:23:45,767
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1250
01:23:46,525 --> 01:23:49,426
