00:00.487 --> 00:05.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.891 --> 00:14.757
[SPEAKER_02]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.458 --> 00:19.140
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.881 --> 00:26.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this part B of our program.

00:26.846 --> 00:29.888
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

00:30.325 --> 00:39.747
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there's some big news coming from Nintendo Power talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.

00:40.648 --> 00:50.350
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently the game's titled Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.030
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, what do I know?

00:52.550 --> 00:53.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a bad thing?

00:53.991 --> 00:57.792
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG?

00:57.972 --> 00:58.532
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

00:58.912 --> 00:59.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

00:59.919 --> 01:03.240
[SPEAKER_04]: A, Bioware didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.

01:03.600 --> 01:03.861
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

01:04.561 --> 01:06.141
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree that it doesn't matter.

01:06.201 --> 01:08.102
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if Square does it or, you know.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.483
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?

01:11.523 --> 01:14.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.225
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the closest thing I've played to that since.

01:16.805 --> 01:17.926
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss Mario RPG.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.467
[SPEAKER_12]: But the Sonic thing looks pretty good.

01:21.567 --> 01:26.489
[SPEAKER_12]: They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.

01:27.309 --> 01:28.130
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of neat.

01:28.270 --> 01:28.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

01:31.470 --> 01:31.770
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:32.170 --> 01:37.656
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't know much about it yet, but it should be the next issue, I guess.

01:37.996 --> 01:40.558
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.

01:40.618 --> 01:46.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out, or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?

01:47.825 --> 01:52.109
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not done by Sonic Team, it doesn't exist in my universe.

01:52.149 --> 01:52.530
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

01:52.650 --> 01:53.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

01:54.291 --> 01:54.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.

01:55.666 --> 02:03.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to and one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.

02:04.194 --> 02:11.421
[SPEAKER_04]: But some fans are kind of pissed off because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere.

02:12.201 --> 02:16.384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC, but no love for the Nintendo Wii.

02:16.825 --> 02:26.051
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.

02:26.832 --> 02:27.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Cue the petition!

02:29.154 --> 02:33.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost immediately an internet petition went up, bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.

02:33.417 --> 02:36.239
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're taking a page out of Konami's book there.

02:36.895 --> 02:41.459
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then we'll make the product.

02:41.699 --> 02:45.482
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.

02:47.444 --> 02:49.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.

02:49.906 --> 02:53.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, it will largely depend on what the fans want for the future Bionic Commando.

02:53.709 --> 02:58.573
[SPEAKER_04]: If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.

03:01.095 --> 03:05.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's got people very happy.

03:07.008 --> 03:08.569
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?

03:09.729 --> 03:10.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

03:10.410 --> 03:17.292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007 because everybody said it was great, but I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.

03:17.673 --> 03:28.717
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a DS version now where you can basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff and sword fight and kill people and stuff.

03:29.297 --> 03:35.540
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers and picking pockets and doing other stuff.

03:35.860 --> 03:36.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

03:37.236 --> 03:38.957
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use a stylus for interrogating.

03:38.977 --> 03:39.937
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you do?

03:39.957 --> 03:40.717
[SPEAKER_04]: You just poke them?

03:40.737 --> 03:42.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke, poke, poke.

03:42.238 --> 03:42.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me.

03:42.698 --> 03:43.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke, poke, poke.

03:43.899 --> 03:48.421
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you talk into the speaker part and go, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

03:49.081 --> 03:49.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that.

03:51.442 --> 03:53.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

03:54.323 --> 03:55.063
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be interesting.

03:55.124 --> 03:56.224
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be kind of cute.

03:56.324 --> 03:57.344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be a prequel.

03:57.364 --> 03:58.165
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks kind of neat.

03:58.645 --> 03:58.925
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

04:00.906 --> 04:02.987
[SPEAKER_12]: The Nyko Wireless Nunchuck.

04:03.007 --> 04:04.788
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember we talked about that a little bit ago.

04:07.074 --> 04:08.936
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty useless device, I think.

04:09.256 --> 04:14.940
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess if that little cord really bothers you, then great.

04:15.401 --> 04:16.822
[SPEAKER_12]: You can buy this.

04:16.862 --> 04:19.304
[SPEAKER_04]: That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.

04:20.745 --> 04:21.125
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

04:21.966 --> 04:23.407
[SPEAKER_04]: How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?

04:23.447 --> 04:24.067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

04:26.509 --> 04:24.067
$30.

04:28.751 --> 04:29.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

04:29.151 --> 04:31.573
[SPEAKER_04]: I can deal with it for $30.

04:32.694 --> 04:36.737
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, though, it did win a CNET CES Gaming Award

04:38.106 --> 04:39.926
[SPEAKER_12]: for Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.027
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I forgot to talk about this this week, my game week.

04:44.207 --> 04:50.329
[SPEAKER_12]: I played some Ghost Squad and I bought those Nyko Perfect Shots.

04:51.049 --> 04:52.409
[SPEAKER_12]: The ones that look like the little pistols.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.749
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are fucking awesome.

04:54.590 --> 05:05.052
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing about Ghost Squad and why I love the game even more, they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper so that you don't use the B button as a trigger, you use the Z button so that you're actually firing it correctly.

05:05.852 --> 05:06.012
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

05:06.601 --> 05:15.445
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters, will look to Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.

05:18.306 --> 05:20.907
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.

05:21.387 --> 05:24.649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, because you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.

05:26.149 --> 05:27.170
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was I going to say about this?

05:27.450 --> 05:28.990
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they get for getting this award?

05:29.010 --> 05:31.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get a trophy or a plaque or just internet fame?

05:31.471 --> 05:32.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Internet fame.

05:32.212 --> 05:32.512
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

05:32.612 --> 05:35.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about this device on the program.

05:35.635 --> 05:36.456
[SPEAKER_04]: I want another trophy.

05:36.476 --> 05:37.276
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a 2008 trophy.

05:58.138 --> 06:01.940
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, you had to go all the way to LA and you had to meet Adam Curry, poor you.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.983
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.

06:09.105 --> 06:10.946
[SPEAKER_07]: With his Bon Jovi hair.

06:11.386 --> 06:14.608
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a new 2008 trophy.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.949
[SPEAKER_04]: So what award can we win?

06:17.189 --> 06:19.211
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.

06:19.231 --> 06:21.592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to look into that to make that happen.

06:22.116 --> 06:25.058
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the year is young, and there are the Darwin Awards.

06:26.218 --> 06:27.879
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit of a permanent solution.

06:27.899 --> 06:29.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give ourselves a stupid award?

06:29.400 --> 06:30.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do something really stupid?

06:30.761 --> 06:33.603
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?

06:33.963 --> 06:35.664
[SPEAKER_04]: Robway says, make your own awards show.

06:35.704 --> 06:38.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are podcasts out there that make their own awards show.

06:39.006 --> 06:45.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, the Gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.

06:47.931 --> 06:49.091
[SPEAKER_04]: You think we could team up with Sony?

06:49.111 --> 06:50.332
[SPEAKER_04]: They got nothing going for them, right?

06:52.415 --> 06:53.056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, forget it.

06:53.396 --> 06:54.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with the gaming news.

06:54.517 --> 06:56.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.

06:56.078 --> 06:59.962
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.

06:59.982 --> 07:01.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could use that too.

07:02.324 --> 07:06.067
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit.

07:06.327 --> 07:12.032
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th, if a new one-up column is to be believed.

07:12.312 --> 07:17.537
[SPEAKER_04]: The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers both in Japan and abroad.

07:17.884 --> 07:19.165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:48.720 --> 07:49.080
[SPEAKER_12]: News Trophy

08:18.826 --> 08:24.148
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of airtime, if that, and I'll say something brief.

08:25.149 --> 08:25.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so much fun.

08:26.369 --> 08:26.670
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

08:28.430 --> 08:31.452
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news, it's on YouTube.

08:31.572 --> 08:33.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.

08:33.553 --> 08:36.194
[SPEAKER_12]: They interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes, and that's what they used.

08:36.594 --> 08:37.234
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's so much fun.

08:37.815 --> 08:38.095
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

08:40.543 --> 08:40.964
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

09:00.362 --> 09:02.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.

09:03.484 --> 09:05.045
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get a Golden Globe.

09:05.425 --> 09:08.087
[SPEAKER_05]: You get an aluminum foil ball.

09:08.807 --> 09:10.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and spray-painted gold.

09:10.389 --> 09:11.649
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there you have it.

09:11.689 --> 09:16.372
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Orange Lounge Radio Orangies, even though they're gold.

09:16.512 --> 09:16.693
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

09:16.713 --> 09:21.336
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight.

09:23.417 --> 09:23.737
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

09:24.538 --> 09:26.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag.

09:26.439 --> 09:27.459
[SPEAKER_04]: And the envelope, please.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wins Orangie number one?

09:31.564 --> 09:32.404
[SPEAKER_07]: You're funny, Rob.

09:33.725 --> 09:36.147
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is from TJ.

09:36.187 --> 09:37.888
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, That's a good excuse.

09:37.908 --> 09:38.608
[SPEAKER_07]: I have other crap to do.

09:38.628 --> 09:38.808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

09:58.151 --> 09:58.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Jenga the Game

10:21.775 --> 10:23.876
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.

10:23.996 --> 10:29.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.

10:30.077 --> 10:30.817
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just me.

10:30.837 --> 10:32.717
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

10:34.638 --> 10:36.078
[SPEAKER_04]: So, next email.

10:36.378 --> 10:43.160
[SPEAKER_07]: With Bioshock, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Wii Play, Super Mario Galaxies, and an iPhone, this must be the best Christmas ever.

10:43.940 --> 10:49.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know this email's a bit late, but I felt I must comment on how especially kick-ass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.

10:49.707 --> 10:51.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this the same email or a new one?

10:51.028 --> 10:51.648
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a different one.

10:51.828 --> 10:52.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, who sent this one in?

10:53.088 --> 10:54.469
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's from Osfer.

10:54.809 --> 10:55.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

10:56.590 --> 11:00.251
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.

11:01.031 --> 11:03.572
[SPEAKER_07]: As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.

11:03.672 --> 11:07.814
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so much fun to play and controls are nothing short of sexy.

11:09.534 --> 11:13.616
[SPEAKER_07]: I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies.

11:14.016 --> 11:16.337
[SPEAKER_07]: And some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.

11:16.377 --> 11:17.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.

11:18.118 --> 11:18.798
[SPEAKER_07]: What's Chapter 4, Rob?

11:20.071 --> 11:21.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 4 is fucking epic

11:42.324 --> 11:46.149
[SPEAKER_07]: You play the game to experience it yourself and then watch your jaw hit the floor.

11:46.689 --> 11:50.474
[SPEAKER_07]: Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?

11:51.195 --> 11:51.375
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

11:53.918 --> 11:54.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Not live, no.

11:55.059 --> 11:58.063
[SPEAKER_04]: You can listen to the podcast from any touchtone phone.

11:58.724 --> 12:00.286
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something, I want to say like,

12:01.468 --> 12:02.689
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do it from a touch-tone phone?

12:03.009 --> 12:04.269
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a regular phone?

12:04.650 --> 12:06.290
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear the podcast on a phone.

12:06.390 --> 12:10.632
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some service out there, free service, because I know one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.

12:11.293 --> 12:12.813
[SPEAKER_04]: She might have signed our podcast up for it.

12:12.853 --> 12:13.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

12:13.554 --> 12:14.094
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.015
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.

12:17.075 --> 12:17.576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up.

12:17.596 --> 12:19.637
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.

12:19.657 --> 12:25.479
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work, but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.

12:27.801 --> 12:29.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading, as always.

12:29.141 --> 12:29.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

12:32.196 --> 12:35.678
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.

12:37.439 --> 12:39.480
[SPEAKER_07]: This email comes from Stan.

12:41.360 --> 12:41.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there.

12:42.181 --> 12:44.962
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.

12:45.002 --> 12:46.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes me wonder why I wasn't listening to you folks before.

12:48.104 --> 12:53.106
[SPEAKER_07]: After listening to your year-end wrap-up show, I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.

12:53.226 --> 12:53.927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do y'all?

12:54.487 --> 12:57.688
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit.

12:58.369 --> 12:58.469
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

12:59.306 --> 13:00.907
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys had a booth or something.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we usually do when we do our panels.

13:08.112 --> 13:10.734
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, then taping something while there.

13:10.774 --> 13:13.696
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.

13:13.936 --> 13:15.917
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, actually, that's more what we do is we do the recording.

13:17.558 --> 13:20.360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone else in Chicago listens to your show, but I'm sure...

13:21.209 --> 13:22.970
[SPEAKER_07]: They're here somewhere, just never looked.

13:23.091 --> 13:25.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur 3?

13:25.532 --> 13:26.533
[SPEAKER_07]: I could really use a challenge.

13:27.554 --> 13:32.257
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get Soul Calibur 3 because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.160
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Soul Calibur 3, but maybe that's just me.

13:37.921 --> 13:42.385
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs to be played during your music portions.

13:42.845 --> 13:43.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I read that right?

13:44.306 --> 13:49.610
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands, I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.

13:49.650 --> 13:50.731
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a rock band set up.

13:51.383 --> 13:57.927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride Saxophone Ensemble and a few of us are big gamers and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.

13:58.407 --> 14:03.830
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks, especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.

14:05.749 --> 14:09.371
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can guess, a sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.

14:09.951 --> 14:18.715
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tinkered around with arrangements before, but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience, then sure, all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.

14:18.775 --> 14:19.395
[SPEAKER_07]: So how about it?

14:19.735 --> 14:22.056
[SPEAKER_07]: Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?

14:22.556 --> 14:23.337
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say so, dude.

14:23.357 --> 14:24.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I played saxophone.

14:24.657 --> 14:25.557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not.

14:26.118 --> 14:32.640
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation, meaning like 10-minute songs are a little much.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.522
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most.

14:36.562 --> 14:38.643
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while.

14:38.903 --> 14:42.564
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have something radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat, I don't see why not.

14:42.825 --> 14:43.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't see why not.

14:43.865 --> 14:49.427
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet, so I don't see why not.

14:50.908 --> 14:51.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

14:51.826 --> 14:52.447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much.

14:52.547 --> 14:53.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great work.

14:53.389 --> 14:55.772
[SPEAKER_07]: I really get a kick if this was read on the air.

14:55.832 --> 14:56.934
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days I'll call in.

14:57.094 --> 14:57.735
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

14:57.755 --> 14:58.216
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

14:58.276 --> 14:58.857
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a kick.

14:59.137 --> 14:59.979
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got an orangey.

15:01.090 --> 15:02.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for emailing us tonight.

15:02.411 --> 15:04.532
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I want to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.

15:04.792 --> 15:08.855
[SPEAKER_04]: The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone, it's called Podlines.

15:09.275 --> 15:13.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we don't like totally endorse this because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.

15:13.998 --> 15:14.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

15:14.298 --> 15:15.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done this in a long time.

15:15.558 --> 15:16.599
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the phone number.

15:16.719 --> 15:19.181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's area code 650-523-6855.

15:19.921 --> 15:24.484
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what happens because I don't know what happens when you call this.

15:27.806 --> 15:30.307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens or if we get an ad or what.

15:33.923 --> 15:38.304
[SPEAKER_04]: OneRingyDingy And it's busy.

15:39.664 --> 15:40.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we've been taken off the air.

15:40.985 --> 15:41.385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

15:41.985 --> 15:44.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he sent in another part to his email.

15:44.785 --> 15:45.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

15:45.666 --> 15:48.786
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Oops, I forgot, but have any of you watched Street Fighter the later years?

15:49.206 --> 15:49.746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have.

15:50.527 --> 15:51.427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so damn funny.

15:51.947 --> 15:54.807
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2 will appreciate this.

15:54.888 --> 15:58.268
[SPEAKER_07]: I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.

15:58.408 --> 15:58.968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, gamers.

15:59.749 --> 16:01.749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay.

16:03.036 --> 16:03.857
[SPEAKER_07]: I've watched some of it.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty darn funny.

16:06.178 --> 16:06.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

16:07.179 --> 16:16.526
[SPEAKER_07]: And last, well, we actually got an email from our good buddy Rob, the two Bs, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.

16:17.686 --> 16:17.987
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

16:18.207 --> 16:20.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.

16:20.989 --> 16:21.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

16:22.110 --> 16:29.795
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable cord.

16:30.302 --> 16:31.983
[SPEAKER_07]: for one of his video game pads.

16:32.043 --> 16:35.086
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't said what the system was or anything.

16:35.866 --> 16:41.871
[SPEAKER_07]: It said that the guy was playing a game and the father was trying to get him to stop.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.754
[SPEAKER_07]: He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.

16:46.875 --> 16:52.720
[SPEAKER_07]: The dad took out the power cable and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.

16:55.802 --> 16:56.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

16:57.243 --> 16:59.225
[SPEAKER_07]: He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.

17:00.040 --> 17:00.560
[SPEAKER_04]: As you should be.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?

17:04.624 --> 17:05.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.966
[SPEAKER_04]: You were just mad because he was playing right to speak.

17:08.187 --> 17:09.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.

17:10.088 --> 17:11.689
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said last email.

17:11.870 --> 17:12.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fine.

17:15.032 --> 17:15.713
[SPEAKER_04]: One more email then.

17:15.733 --> 17:16.453
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's important.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Belgium.

17:17.474 --> 17:17.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

17:18.255 --> 17:18.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

17:19.226 --> 17:20.947
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.

17:21.067 --> 17:24.910
[SPEAKER_07]: I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming and I am a PC gamer.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.251
[SPEAKER_07]: It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.

17:27.831 --> 17:34.655
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say that I would appreciate very much if you could do a show at noon in your time zone like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.

17:35.836 --> 17:43.121
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.

17:43.561 --> 17:46.663
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to do that sometime so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.

17:47.350 --> 17:52.253
[SPEAKER_07]: I always download the podcast to my PSP, so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.

17:52.674 --> 17:57.757
[SPEAKER_07]: I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live, it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.

17:58.517 --> 18:00.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, an interesting story perhaps.

18:00.759 --> 18:04.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.

18:05.082 --> 18:08.384
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.

18:09.044 --> 18:12.727
[SPEAKER_07]: With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007, the PS3 sold the most, closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.

18:16.698 --> 18:23.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360 is the least popular console and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.

18:24.565 --> 18:26.968
[SPEAKER_07]: After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.

18:27.048 --> 18:28.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.

18:30.251 --> 18:32.553
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made...

18:33.240 --> 18:38.502
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money on a next-generation console.

18:39.062 --> 18:46.864
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the feeling the Xbox Never was a really big success here, and so many people are more inclined to play PlayStation 3, although the 360 might have the best games so far.

18:50.103 --> 18:56.048
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the casual gamers are of course going for the Wii over here too.

18:56.448 --> 19:05.997
[SPEAKER_07]: If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose, because it is the most innovative system and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.

19:06.177 --> 19:08.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Gritz, G-R-T-Z.

19:10.761 --> 19:13.863
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's in closing, his name is Martin.

19:14.944 --> 19:15.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for the email.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.994
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?

19:19.154 --> 19:20.395
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a three-day weekend coming up.

19:21.736 --> 19:22.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon, though.

19:22.396 --> 19:24.757
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get the word out, you know, so people know, you know.

19:25.338 --> 19:25.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

19:25.778 --> 19:27.399
[SPEAKER_04]: A three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.

19:27.479 --> 19:28.660
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have Marissa up here, too.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.441
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have Marissa up here, too.

19:30.461 --> 19:31.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be good.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.

19:34.744 --> 19:40.207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have to check our schedules because I know around, you know, Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know, things might get busy.

19:40.327 --> 19:41.788
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometime in February.

19:44.146 --> 19:47.547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.528
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done it before, like for pre-taping.

19:49.568 --> 19:52.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?

19:53.289 --> 19:53.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not.

19:54.049 --> 19:54.830
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not either.

19:54.910 --> 19:56.910
[SPEAKER_04]: We will make that happen for our overseas listeners.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.211
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.

19:59.291 --> 20:03.832
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day week is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February?

20:06.633 --> 20:07.153
[SPEAKER_04]: President's Day?

20:07.753 --> 20:08.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe so.

20:08.754 --> 20:09.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can make it happen around then.

20:10.194 --> 20:10.414
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

20:10.614 --> 20:11.335
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check our schedules.

20:12.235 --> 20:12.475
Okay.

20:12.755 --> 20:12.955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

20:14.246 --> 20:23.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with one and only Loki.

20:24.273 --> 20:24.513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

20:25.194 --> 20:33.580
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that, there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.881
[SPEAKER_12]: One of which was shown off at CES.

20:36.121 --> 20:43.907
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of

20:44.591 --> 20:46.252
[SPEAKER_12]: Rock Band Stage Kit GameStop GameStop

21:14.574 --> 21:29.570
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out around June for $100 and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show This actually sounds kind of epic You know what though?

21:31.110 --> 21:34.635
[SPEAKER_12]: If I still have $200 in store credit around that time, I'll pick it up.

21:35.456 --> 21:36.717
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be awesome.

21:36.938 --> 21:38.159
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do it during the show.

21:38.219 --> 21:39.902
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just leave it on during the show.

21:40.242 --> 21:40.643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

21:40.663 --> 21:43.506
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Launch Radio one night.

21:43.686 --> 21:45.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the webcam's back by then.

21:45.469 --> 21:45.789
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

21:46.610 --> 21:47.792
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

21:49.032 --> 21:50.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Light Show and Smoke.

21:50.072 --> 21:51.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me not to be here for that show.

21:52.073 --> 21:52.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, seriously.

21:53.154 --> 22:01.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can imagine just how, you know, it looks one way on the box, but then when you actually do it in person, it probably... It probably smells like farts or something.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.

22:04.897 --> 22:05.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, though.

22:05.498 --> 22:10.699
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to look like somebody... We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you do this?

22:12.540 --> 22:16.121
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, why would you play this, like, in your living room with smoke and stuff here?

22:16.401 --> 22:18.022
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't see the screen anymore.

22:18.362 --> 22:20.303
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's filling up the house full of smoke.

22:20.863 --> 22:24.944
[SPEAKER_04]: Macman in our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com says, Does it come with some weed, too?

22:25.004 --> 22:26.805
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the true rocker experience.

22:27.925 --> 22:28.265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

22:28.345 --> 22:32.627
[SPEAKER_12]: It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.

22:33.207 --> 22:36.628
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, you know, it's a pretty well-known company.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.269
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, but is it $100 funny?

22:39.469 --> 22:41.270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, how many of these are they really going to sell?

22:41.770 --> 22:43.010
[SPEAKER_12]: And let me put it this way.

22:43.090 --> 22:47.812
[SPEAKER_12]: If it is, like, an actual smoke machine, I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that, but...

22:48.649 --> 22:53.472
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, you gotta, like, buy the liquid smoke for it, and, you know, that's expensive.

22:54.613 --> 22:56.374
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine!

22:56.414 --> 22:58.696
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell are you gonna be doing playing with a smoke machine?

22:58.776 --> 23:02.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.

23:03.079 --> 23:03.539
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

23:03.619 --> 23:04.299
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be funny.

23:05.060 --> 23:08.522
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be funny, too, just to do for one show, but Loki, $100 funny.

23:09.963 --> 23:10.343
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

23:10.604 --> 23:11.464
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all store credit.

23:11.484 --> 23:13.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, is it $100 funny?

23:13.626 --> 23:14.446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I need to know.

23:15.307 --> 23:18.269
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of the Judgement instead.

23:19.696 --> 23:23.338
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:42.498 --> 23:52.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.

23:56.068 --> 24:03.033
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.974
[SPEAKER_04]: on the DS was going to interact with the ride.

24:06.054 --> 24:11.377
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride, you'd unlock a new character or something.

24:11.657 --> 24:20.142
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to kind of go into the park and actually get this, especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.

24:21.183 --> 24:26.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of, I guess, application that would download to your DS.

24:26.986 --> 24:30.187
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a tour of the park, basically.

24:30.227 --> 24:31.188
[SPEAKER_04]: What you could do, imagine this.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say you use your...

24:33.809 --> 24:36.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles Snickerdoodles

25:04.158 --> 25:04.598
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hold on.

25:04.918 --> 25:05.359
[SPEAKER_04]: These are hot.

25:05.399 --> 25:06.139
[SPEAKER_04]: These are just out of the oven.

25:06.439 --> 25:06.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.801
[SPEAKER_04]: The show has been interrupted for cookies.

25:10.341 --> 25:10.982
Oh, my God.

25:11.102 --> 25:12.182
They're so good.

25:12.783 --> 25:13.903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting to try one.

25:13.923 --> 25:15.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hot.

25:15.284 --> 25:15.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

25:15.824 --> 25:16.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know they're hot.

25:16.405 --> 25:16.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

25:17.525 --> 25:18.806
[SPEAKER_07]: Snickerdoodles are, like, the best cookies ever.

25:18.826 --> 25:19.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those are good.

25:19.767 --> 25:20.587
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a snickerdoodle?

25:21.488 --> 25:22.608
[SPEAKER_07]: They're cinnamon sugar cookies.

25:22.648 --> 25:23.208
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cinnamon.

25:23.248 --> 25:24.409
[SPEAKER_04]: They taste like... Thank you, Katie.

25:26.190 --> 25:26.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she can hear.

25:26.770 --> 25:26.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

25:27.331 --> 25:27.571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

25:28.231 --> 25:28.952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, where were we?

25:29.012 --> 25:29.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm, cookie goodness.

25:30.292 --> 25:30.833
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Disney.

25:31.273 --> 25:31.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

25:32.935 --> 25:33.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

25:33.515 --> 25:35.076
[SPEAKER_06]: How to manage your weight right.

25:35.556 --> 25:35.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

25:35.876 --> 25:38.877
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can, like, click on an area and see, you know, how long the weight is.

25:39.457 --> 25:43.419
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually go, like, let's say you could click on it.

25:43.479 --> 25:45.559
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylus, obviously, right?

25:45.939 --> 25:53.622
[SPEAKER_04]: You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney World, and you could see what their menu is.

25:54.082 --> 25:56.343
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.

25:57.824 --> 26:02.005
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.

26:02.858 --> 26:03.898
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to call Disney Dining.

26:33.351 --> 26:44.074
[SPEAKER_07]: Something else that's really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now is that Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games.

26:47.015 --> 27:01.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games, which is Peggle Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

27:01.733 --> 27:03.273
[SPEAKER_07]: and Portal First Slice.

27:04.494 --> 27:16.316
[SPEAKER_07]: And First Slice is actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.

27:17.877 --> 27:22.278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.

27:22.338 --> 27:23.038
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's kind of cool.

27:24.498 --> 27:27.599
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

27:28.905 --> 27:32.206
[SPEAKER_07]: So that you can have real life versus competitions and things like that.

27:32.686 --> 27:32.906
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

27:35.366 --> 27:37.187
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, chewing on a cookie.

27:37.207 --> 27:38.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookies are freaking good.

27:38.387 --> 27:39.347
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways.

27:42.108 --> 27:42.588
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

27:45.049 --> 27:55.011
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.

27:56.129 --> 28:03.795
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how much they're really entitled to.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.238
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.781
[SPEAKER_12]: One day worth of outages is approximately $13.7.

28:11.741 --> 28:15.404
[SPEAKER_12]: So for about the six days of outages, that's $0.82.

28:15.525 --> 28:18.547
[SPEAKER_12]: Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.

28:22.423 --> 28:29.907
[SPEAKER_12]: So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.

28:30.747 --> 28:34.029
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.

28:35.610 --> 28:38.911
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft.

28:38.931 --> 28:39.231
[SPEAKER_04]: 82 cents.

28:41.172 --> 28:41.813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

28:41.853 --> 28:44.294
[SPEAKER_04]: They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.

28:44.314 --> 28:47.836
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it.

28:47.936 --> 28:50.237
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're getting a way better deal this way.

28:50.737 --> 28:52.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but at the same time...

28:53.558 --> 28:55.959
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?

28:55.999 --> 28:59.700
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.961
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?

29:02.701 --> 29:03.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

29:03.781 --> 29:04.182
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't.

29:04.782 --> 29:05.322
[SPEAKER_04]: But, anyway.

29:06.382 --> 29:07.663
[SPEAKER_04]: No, DarkTestSuyu, you're right.

29:07.823 --> 29:10.944
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTestSuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.

29:10.984 --> 29:11.824
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right, I'm not.

29:11.924 --> 29:12.464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

29:12.624 --> 29:16.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.

29:16.506 --> 29:17.686
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't owe me anything.

29:18.926 --> 29:19.426
[SPEAKER_04]: But a hug.

29:20.247 --> 29:20.927
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like a hug.

29:21.769 --> 29:22.769
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:51.781 --> 29:52.821
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who is to blame.

30:15.012 --> 30:19.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair enough, just another person, you know, trying to knock video games for making kids fat.

30:19.778 --> 30:22.442
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.

30:22.742 --> 30:24.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know who he's the CEO of?

30:24.565 --> 30:25.185
[SPEAKER_04]: McDonald's.

30:28.089 --> 30:31.654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all their blame game thing, trying to, you know, get the...

30:32.518 --> 30:38.883
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing off of them, you know, especially since they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.

30:39.183 --> 30:42.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.

30:42.966 --> 30:48.451
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo 64 play zones and stuff.

30:48.491 --> 30:52.334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's not like, you know, granted, he's in the UK, he's in America.

30:52.454 --> 30:52.614
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

30:53.956 --> 30:55.977
[SPEAKER_12]: Here kid, go play with some old games.

31:22.751 --> 31:27.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Do Not Make Kids Fat, or McFlurries and Cones.

31:45.225 --> 31:49.391
[SPEAKER_07]: And even, and this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.

31:49.411 --> 32:01.388
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym and it tricked her body right back into, you know, losing again because it's like,

32:01.752 --> 32:02.152
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

32:26.798 --> 32:27.318
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

32:55.623 --> 32:56.143
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever.

32:56.884 --> 32:59.786
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.

33:00.847 --> 33:02.508
[SPEAKER_04]: And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.

33:02.528 --> 33:03.149
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done that before.

33:04.230 --> 33:06.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.013
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.

33:08.053 --> 33:12.196
[SPEAKER_04]: So regardless, just saying, it's not you eat it occasionally and not every day.

33:12.256 --> 33:16.059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not where you eat.

33:16.179 --> 33:18.040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what you do and what you eat.

33:18.241 --> 33:21.203
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the where, the who, any of that.

33:21.323 --> 33:23.865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what you're doing.

33:25.017 --> 33:26.958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nobody else's fault but your own.

33:27.699 --> 33:30.561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I see it.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just be fat and be beautiful.

33:32.782 --> 33:33.342
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're happy?

33:33.462 --> 33:34.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Be BB.

33:34.843 --> 33:37.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman, or a BBM.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.466
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

33:39.526 --> 33:45.150
[SPEAKER_07]: People should be happy the way they are, and I think that a lot of this crap that people go through for...

33:48.865 --> 33:51.207
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that is just people being unhappy with themselves.

33:51.247 --> 34:03.516
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself, and I know that I don't always do the same thing myself, but the moment that you are happy with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body is going to follow.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you won't care.

34:08.099 --> 34:15.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites a certain sort of rage within us that can only be...

34:17.383 --> 34:21.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Crushed by us venting our FUs of the week.

34:29.992 --> 34:32.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I accidentally used the old song tonight, but we'll deal.

34:32.113 --> 34:32.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

34:32.634 --> 34:33.634
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

34:33.674 --> 34:36.236
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Rob for using the old music.

34:38.138 --> 34:41.760
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.242
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had sort of a disappointing day.

34:46.129 --> 34:47.991
[SPEAKER_07]: And disappointing is a very good word for it.

34:48.011 --> 34:51.053
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had multiple in a row disappointments.

34:52.454 --> 34:54.196
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want an iMac.

34:55.477 --> 34:58.279
[SPEAKER_07]: So F you to me not having an iMac.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go next, if you're done.

35:02.663 --> 35:06.286
[SPEAKER_04]: My F you goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today.

35:06.366 --> 35:08.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first F you to me for putting in the wrong song.

35:08.828 --> 35:10.530
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to this cup of coffee for getting cold.

35:10.910 --> 35:14.573
[SPEAKER_04]: And then F you to me going to the store today without my wallet.

35:17.068 --> 35:23.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God I didn't do that.

35:23.535 --> 35:29.482
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're picturing, you know, me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because thank God I was looking for, um,

35:30.126 --> 35:30.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

35:51.249 --> 35:52.230
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

35:52.510 --> 36:03.280
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to the muscle that's pulled in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.

36:03.380 --> 36:04.300
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts when you laugh?

36:04.541 --> 36:05.281
[SPEAKER_12]: It hurts when I laugh.

36:05.381 --> 36:13.228
[SPEAKER_07]: I would give you a bit of advice if you were going to rub it clockwise because otherwise you will get constipated.

36:13.649 --> 36:14.009
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

36:14.029 --> 36:14.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

36:15.051 --> 36:16.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had trouble going lately?

36:17.032 --> 36:18.252
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not had trouble going.

36:18.312 --> 36:19.073
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

36:19.973 --> 36:24.695
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion goes clockwise.

36:25.296 --> 36:28.477
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually block your digestion by going counterclockwise.

36:28.957 --> 36:29.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

36:29.658 --> 36:30.578
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn something new every day.

36:30.618 --> 36:31.098
[SPEAKER_04]: You really do.

36:31.478 --> 36:31.618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

36:31.638 --> 36:34.400
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not talk about colon.

36:34.740 --> 36:37.121
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.

36:40.350 --> 36:45.792
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that a trick I can play on my friends, is run up to people and rub their bellies counterclockwise and go, ha ha, you're constipated?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.273
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it takes everyone.

36:49.233 --> 36:50.194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being a little silly.

36:50.694 --> 36:55.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Macman in chat says, it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make Loki laugh.

36:55.796 --> 37:00.918
[SPEAKER_12]: I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 deaths video and that was painful enough.

37:01.818 --> 37:03.319
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put my advice in the chat room now.

37:03.599 --> 37:03.839
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

37:04.298 --> 37:07.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you need to do your next story, DarkSakura, before you get to advice.

37:08.040 --> 37:08.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Games first.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Constipation later.

37:12.362 --> 37:21.125
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, coming out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have StarTropics for NES.

37:22.106 --> 37:24.607
[SPEAKER_07]: It was released on the 11th.

37:25.887 --> 37:32.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so we are getting that.

37:32.770 --> 37:33.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they are getting that

37:35.000 --> 37:38.101
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.

37:40.802 --> 37:41.042
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

37:41.262 --> 37:42.122
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a Master System.

37:42.402 --> 37:45.083
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, it was not on Master System.

37:45.103 --> 37:46.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe it was a Genesis game.

37:46.403 --> 37:48.164
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

37:48.184 --> 37:48.664
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

37:50.024 --> 37:51.885
[SPEAKER_04]: Any news yet on... No, I think they're back.

37:52.085 --> 37:54.766
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?

37:58.827 --> 37:59.467
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

37:59.667 --> 38:00.127
[SPEAKER_04]: In U.S.?

38:01.127 --> 38:01.427
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

38:02.428 --> 38:03.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

38:04.417 --> 38:05.257
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, more news

38:34.895 --> 38:39.636
[SPEAKER_12]: flat out refusing to give EGM access to early previews or reviews.

38:40.116 --> 38:50.639
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, basically he said, you know, warning readers that they're going to get little, late, or no coverage of, you know, these three companies' games.

38:51.799 --> 38:55.080
[SPEAKER_12]: And they won't treat these products or companies any differently.

38:55.480 --> 39:00.201
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll just cover them to their best ability without their support.

39:02.101 --> 39:04.422
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, after all, they're writing for the reader, not them.

39:05.251 --> 39:10.214
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of interesting that he, you know, planned out, called them out.

39:10.254 --> 39:17.599
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies because, you know, after the whole Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of heard them.

39:19.621 --> 39:22.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of support the calling out of these companies.

39:24.744 --> 39:25.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't know.

39:25.965 --> 39:33.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is like such huge news, but I think it is kind of big because, you know, somebody's kind of finally taken a step and saying, you know,

39:35.523 --> 39:38.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call them out on what they're doing and the fact that

39:38.539 --> 39:39.199
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

40:05.865 --> 40:11.206
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative, you know, feedback for them.

40:11.246 --> 40:19.288
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but, you know, and this isn't the first, you know, companies to do this.

40:19.488 --> 40:26.309
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from, you know, EGM as well, and now they're back supporting them.

40:26.429 --> 40:28.610
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

40:28.770 --> 40:35.591
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game is going to be exposed to less people, you know,

40:36.363 --> 40:38.166
[SPEAKER_12]: Coverage is coverage.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.610
[SPEAKER_12]: You may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.

40:41.010 --> 40:48.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind of ruin it.

40:48.542 --> 40:49.845
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not be... For instance...

40:50.575 --> 40:51.216
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41:15.868 --> 41:16.389
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

41:26.078 --> 41:34.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not necessarily Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.

41:34.946 --> 41:35.647
[SPEAKER_12]: It is pretty bad.

41:36.408 --> 41:37.389
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't really reviews.

41:37.469 --> 41:49.120
[SPEAKER_12]: It was based on previews and stuff because they were being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these bugs in the game and hopefully they get worked out because otherwise it's going to suck.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.382
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's an honest opinion.

41:51.778 --> 41:56.662
[SPEAKER_12]: And they realize that it's not finished yet, and that's why they phrased it in such a way.

41:56.742 --> 42:01.285
[SPEAKER_12]: But apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you talk about our game, blah, blah, blah.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.547
[SPEAKER_12]: They only want glowing reviews.

42:03.627 --> 42:10.052
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit it to the magazine, if you don't want anyone doing that.

42:10.092 --> 42:13.414
[SPEAKER_12]: Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.

42:13.694 --> 42:15.676
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do it all like press releases or something like that.

42:16.311 --> 42:18.231
[SPEAKER_12]: Then everybody can own a game magazine.

42:18.391 --> 42:20.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.

42:21.232 --> 42:21.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

42:21.792 --> 42:28.173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when I say public, I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know, literally the public at trade shows and things.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be careful who you have dealing with the public.

42:30.753 --> 42:31.073
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

42:32.594 --> 42:33.854
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good customer service, right?

42:34.014 --> 42:34.294
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

42:35.914 --> 42:36.914
[SPEAKER_06]: Good customer service.

42:37.055 --> 42:42.895
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're in a PR department, then your customer is the press.

42:43.656 --> 42:45.116
[SPEAKER_04]: So be careful who you have representing.

42:45.476 --> 42:45.696
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

42:46.992 --> 43:09.945
[SPEAKER_07]: and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer service classes when I worked on the phone, is that for every one person that is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends and they're going to talk to their friends.

43:10.565 --> 43:15.028
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like dropping a boulder in a lake or something.

43:15.612 --> 43:16.372
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell's wrong with you?

43:41.152 --> 43:41.792
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.

43:41.892 --> 43:42.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be nice.

44:00.243 --> 44:03.385
[SPEAKER_04]: I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job and it's a very challenging job.

44:03.405 --> 44:07.368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to try and help you.

44:07.788 --> 44:08.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're being douchebags.

44:09.069 --> 44:11.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.

44:12.211 --> 44:14.853
[SPEAKER_07]: And do not ask for the supervisor first.

44:15.093 --> 44:15.853
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them a chance.

44:16.133 --> 44:16.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

44:17.554 --> 44:20.576
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?

44:20.596 --> 44:22.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that was a stupid prank.

44:22.858 --> 44:23.418
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different.

44:24.839 --> 44:25.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Much different.

44:26.040 --> 44:26.300
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

44:27.102 --> 44:28.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's talk about something else.

44:29.624 --> 44:31.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the Diamond Card?

44:31.946 --> 44:32.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you have one of these, Loki?

44:32.987 --> 44:33.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do have one of these.

44:33.727 --> 44:39.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the Xbox Live Diamond Card, which gets you a discount.

44:39.812 --> 44:41.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever used the Diamond Card, out of curiosity?

44:41.613 --> 44:41.773
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

44:42.294 --> 44:42.874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.

44:43.274 --> 44:45.656
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.

44:46.357 --> 44:47.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it won't be free much longer.

44:47.678 --> 44:50.640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.

44:51.421 --> 44:56.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the Diamond Card program is moving over to a new...

44:58.122 --> 44:58.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of system.

44:59.263 --> 45:00.724
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Passport Unlimited.

45:01.284 --> 45:01.965
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

45:02.225 --> 45:14.313
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what you're... Unless you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's not very good.

45:14.653 --> 45:17.615
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.

45:17.755 --> 45:21.477
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing really... I don't know what works for me.

45:21.757 --> 45:22.818
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have one because it's neat.

45:23.629 --> 45:28.613
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.

45:28.733 --> 45:30.514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.

45:31.074 --> 45:32.755
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee.

45:33.536 --> 45:35.978
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think a lot of people will be.

45:37.078 --> 45:38.860
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why you would need to pay a $7 fee.

45:40.681 --> 45:41.181
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

45:41.221 --> 45:46.785
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, HitStun in the chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave & Buster's.

45:47.646 --> 45:48.587
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty fun place.

45:48.607 --> 45:50.628
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a second, though.

45:50.908 --> 45:52.209
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just think about this for a second.

45:52.790 --> 45:53.250
[SPEAKER_12]: How are these...

45:54.119 --> 46:01.245
[SPEAKER_12]: businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not.

46:02.065 --> 46:03.346
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just going to have your card.

46:03.647 --> 46:04.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have a barcode?

46:05.548 --> 46:05.688
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

46:07.830 --> 46:10.312
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.

46:10.532 --> 46:11.353
[SPEAKER_12]: Expiration date?

46:11.873 --> 46:14.695
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way.

46:14.916 --> 46:15.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's getting out the card.

46:15.916 --> 46:17.077
[SPEAKER_12]: He's getting out his wallet.

46:17.177 --> 46:17.598
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

46:17.638 --> 46:17.898
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

46:20.117 --> 46:20.817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

46:20.877 --> 46:21.618
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they going to know?

46:21.898 --> 46:25.899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they know?

46:25.919 --> 46:27.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, it has the year on it.

46:28.320 --> 46:28.600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.

46:30.861 --> 46:33.882
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.

46:33.982 --> 46:38.284
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year.

46:38.304 --> 46:39.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me see.

46:40.304 --> 46:41.365
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have an expiration date?

46:41.405 --> 46:41.805
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does.

46:42.125 --> 46:42.485
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it does.

46:42.625 --> 46:44.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Expiration 507, so there you go.

46:46.387 --> 46:47.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's how they know.

46:47.654 --> 47:09.453
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll send something out to all the retailers to say Those things suck anyways because I remember when that program first came around It took me like six months to get mine So, you know, even if you paid the $7 You're already pissed away half a year So, I don't know Well, alright So, I don't know I'd be curious to see if anybody Does anybody in chat Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?

47:09.953 --> 47:15.358
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'd like to know Or get some phone calls on that later Meanwhile, while we await that feedback We'll move on to another story

47:16.616 --> 47:26.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle and Bust a Move and Bliss Island for the Xbox 360.

47:29.763 --> 47:33.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.

47:33.485 --> 47:33.865
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.866
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really played it any.

47:37.367 --> 47:41.649
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there's also, I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

47:44.298 --> 47:46.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Pagel is fun, actually.

47:46.299 --> 47:50.761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.

47:51.621 --> 47:53.102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say this about the PopCap games.

47:53.322 --> 47:59.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played are really addicting and fun.

48:00.165 --> 48:04.847
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see people at work playing those games all the time on their breaks and stuff.

48:04.867 --> 48:07.729
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, Pagel was confirmed that it is coming out.

48:08.049 --> 48:10.370
[SPEAKER_12]: So PopCap did confirm that one.

48:10.610 --> 48:10.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

48:11.810 --> 48:12.230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

48:12.250 --> 48:12.811
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Peggle.

48:13.091 --> 48:16.112
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.

48:16.812 --> 48:18.052
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you rate them if they're not?

48:18.712 --> 48:19.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

48:19.793 --> 48:20.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

48:21.353 --> 48:30.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room except SSJ100 Matt says, I still use my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts.

48:31.236 --> 48:32.257
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's the other thing too.

48:32.297 --> 48:40.119
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?

48:40.512 --> 48:42.253
[SPEAKER_12]: They might not, or they may just not care.

48:42.833 --> 48:44.053
[SPEAKER_12]: So, try it.

48:47.274 --> 48:51.516
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive.

48:51.536 --> 48:53.577
[SPEAKER_12]: You may be wondering, what the hell am I going to use this for?

48:54.117 --> 49:04.060
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out for a while now.

49:04.540 --> 49:09.502
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.

49:10.687 --> 49:38.899
[SPEAKER_12]: 5 gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive oh and by the way that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes so before you can play your game you must waste 40 minutes awesome and I know it's not the only game that has you install it to it's hard drive like for example Ratchet and Clank Ridge Racer has the option to do that I'm pretty sure Oblivion does and a bunch of other ones

49:42.383 --> 49:42.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

49:44.945 --> 49:47.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?

49:47.548 --> 49:47.988
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

49:48.088 --> 49:49.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it save that much time by doing so?

49:50.070 --> 49:50.430
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

49:50.951 --> 49:51.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

49:52.152 --> 49:54.794
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.

49:54.834 --> 49:55.855
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn, that game is great.

49:56.075 --> 49:56.556
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

49:56.716 --> 49:58.517
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.

49:59.618 --> 50:01.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?

50:01.760 --> 50:01.900
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

50:02.141 --> 50:02.401
[SPEAKER_04]: At all?

50:02.881 --> 50:03.962
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they gotta be making it.

50:04.583 --> 50:08.106
[SPEAKER_12]: Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.

50:08.857 --> 50:09.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

50:09.498 --> 50:10.599
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go back and play.

50:10.779 --> 50:11.540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not Oblivion.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.801
[SPEAKER_12]: Half-Life 2 or something.

50:12.881 --> 50:16.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter 4 when it's released because it looks better and better every day.

50:16.665 --> 50:18.327
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like the look of Street Fighter 4.

50:18.367 --> 50:20.850
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me.

50:21.360 --> 50:49.584
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzin has been announced as well but there's some new characters and one of the new ones is Crimson Viper and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine scans that were posted all over the interwebs Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit but with more boobage, like you know King from Art of Fighting and this big pink ponytail but she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her

50:50.307 --> 50:51.268
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:19.028 --> 51:21.670
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter.

51:22.190 --> 51:23.831
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like large-breasted women fighting games.

51:23.851 --> 51:25.212
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the first Dead or Alive.

51:25.292 --> 51:26.893
[SPEAKER_04]: And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.

51:27.234 --> 51:29.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.

51:32.717 --> 51:35.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style.

51:36.019 --> 51:37.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Never seen in the Street Fighter series.

51:38.121 --> 51:41.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boobs.

51:42.364 --> 51:42.864
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt that.

51:43.324 --> 51:44.765
[SPEAKER_12]: Or probably fighting with her hair.

51:45.166 --> 51:46.647
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, wait, wasn't that done before?

51:46.707 --> 51:48.087
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was done before somewhere.

51:48.108 --> 51:48.748
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Milia.

51:50.022 --> 51:50.543
[SPEAKER_07]: and Guilty Gear.

51:52.644 --> 52:02.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing, at least it's a rumor right now, that there's another Resident Evil arcade game.

52:02.049 --> 52:06.251
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.

52:06.691 --> 52:09.953
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, there were the Gun Survivor games.

52:10.593 --> 52:11.433
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, those were in the arcade?

52:11.694 --> 52:11.894
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

52:12.274 --> 52:12.494
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, cool.

52:13.120 --> 52:16.041
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.

52:16.121 --> 52:21.162
[SPEAKER_07]: That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.

52:21.762 --> 52:33.564
[SPEAKER_07]: The voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.

52:36.505 --> 52:38.385
[SPEAKER_07]: She said that she really likes playing Jill.

52:40.346 --> 52:42.386
[SPEAKER_07]: The quote at the end of what she had to say is,

52:42.830 --> 52:46.194
[SPEAKER_07]: You can bet it'll be on the lookout for the game in arcades there.

52:49.017 --> 52:53.583
[SPEAKER_04]: They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.

52:54.266 --> 52:55.987
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the Gun Survivor games are fun.

52:56.107 --> 52:57.988
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit better be coming to a console.

52:58.429 --> 52:59.009
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the Wii.

52:59.169 --> 52:59.629
[SPEAKER_04]: It should.

53:00.070 --> 53:01.470
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.

53:01.511 --> 53:07.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii using the gun controller thingy.

53:07.654 --> 53:11.997
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.

53:12.357 --> 53:16.840
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't know about Target Terror, but something tells me it's not going to be that good.

53:18.772 --> 53:25.956
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old Gun Survivor games, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?

53:26.476 --> 53:28.217
[SPEAKER_07]: How it had the controller on it?

53:28.697 --> 53:41.644
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game, and you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have your gun.

53:41.684 --> 53:46.827
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about how they should do a walkthrough House of the Dead.

53:47.567 --> 53:49.329
[SPEAKER_07]: that use that sort of functionality.

53:49.369 --> 53:51.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that would work for Gun Survivor.

53:51.692 --> 53:53.934
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.

53:56.089 --> 53:56.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

53:56.950 --> 53:58.591
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skyplane will be opening soon, by the way.

53:58.751 --> 54:02.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or you can always give us a call toll-free in the U.S.

54:02.613 --> 54:05.535
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

54:05.595 --> 54:08.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype again, Orange Lounge Radio, but one more story before we get to that.

54:09.178 --> 54:14.922
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the WiiWare service is going to actually come out.

54:16.323 --> 54:25.909
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch date is scheduled,

54:26.567 --> 54:29.808
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:52.580 --> 54:55.081
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be right up their alley for them to announce something like that.

54:55.321 --> 55:01.844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive or something to keep all this crap on that I download.

55:02.284 --> 55:05.045
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.

55:05.065 --> 55:09.467
[SPEAKER_12]: At least allowing you to put them on memory sticks or something like that.

55:09.487 --> 55:12.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again.

55:12.628 --> 55:16.490
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the point of having an SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to use it?

55:17.364 --> 55:19.565
[SPEAKER_12]: or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.

55:20.525 --> 55:24.347
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?

55:25.407 --> 55:26.588
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that a lot, actually.

55:27.568 --> 55:28.568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's silly, but it's fun.

55:28.628 --> 55:31.950
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?

55:32.470 --> 55:33.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a couple.

55:33.530 --> 55:36.832
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of seeing that.

55:36.892 --> 55:39.833
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.

55:39.893 --> 55:42.574
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.

55:44.784 --> 55:46.505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.

55:46.845 --> 55:47.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

55:48.926 --> 55:52.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.

55:52.667 --> 55:54.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we've had a problem with our WeConnect.

55:55.148 --> 55:55.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

55:55.849 --> 55:56.649
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't wanted to.

55:56.669 --> 55:57.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that sucks.

55:58.270 --> 56:01.591
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had a hard time updating our software.

56:04.172 --> 56:04.592
[SPEAKER_04]: What a bummer.

56:05.232 --> 56:11.354
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's open up the Skype line at username OrangeLaunchRadio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

56:11.454 --> 56:12.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Skype line is now open.

56:13.422 --> 56:14.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Open for business.

56:14.402 --> 56:17.003
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.

56:17.063 --> 56:18.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

56:18.444 --> 56:18.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

56:19.584 --> 56:20.665
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Raven Stolfen.

56:20.865 --> 56:21.245
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

56:21.625 --> 56:24.946
[SPEAKER_04]: I am fine, and I'm so shocked and awed that you got through first somehow.

56:25.146 --> 56:27.487
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a quick finger there dialing in.

56:27.507 --> 56:27.907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

56:27.927 --> 56:28.547
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

56:29.308 --> 56:29.988
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on my mind?

56:30.008 --> 56:30.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Navarro.

56:30.808 --> 56:31.768
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's on my mind.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.

56:33.869 --> 56:36.390
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought him up briefly in Part A. What did you want to say?

56:37.389 --> 56:38.650
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's a shocker.

56:38.710 --> 56:41.971
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the other guy, Greg Provo left, and now Jeff.

56:42.011 --> 56:44.652
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.

56:44.732 --> 56:46.893
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.

56:47.554 --> 56:51.436
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.

56:53.897 --> 56:54.237
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

56:54.337 --> 57:01.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is just some corporate website and, you know, I mean... True.

57:03.181 --> 57:04.962
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have, you know...

57:05.862 --> 57:06.922
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wish I had IGN myself.

57:35.922 --> 57:38.424
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think about the editorial from EGM?

57:39.585 --> 57:41.127
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that's just a little shocking.

57:41.167 --> 57:44.089
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just going like, yeah, F them.

57:44.129 --> 57:44.710
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

57:45.130 --> 57:47.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, we'll blackball you.

57:47.993 --> 57:48.733
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll send you the game.

57:48.773 --> 57:49.634
[SPEAKER_09]: We just rate games.

57:49.674 --> 57:55.019
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs to do.

57:56.246 --> 58:07.672
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was going, rawr, we're going to beat you up, because he was like, we'll review their games anyway, but it just might be slower because, you know, they don't send us the free stuff.

58:09.073 --> 58:12.775
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.

58:12.815 --> 58:13.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at what we're doing.

58:13.795 --> 58:14.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

58:14.556 --> 58:15.956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I understand.

58:15.997 --> 58:19.558
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not for profit either, and all these guys are, so obviously it's a little different.

58:19.698 --> 58:24.161
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you love what you do, you can do it.

58:24.361 --> 58:24.641
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

58:25.279 --> 58:25.820
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I do.

58:25.860 --> 58:27.701
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand you've got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.

58:28.982 --> 58:30.303
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?

58:30.323 --> 58:30.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

58:31.364 --> 58:32.805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, one more thing.

58:33.205 --> 58:35.567
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking about that four girls finger painting.

58:35.787 --> 58:44.074
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday night, and they kind of dug me.

58:44.114 --> 58:47.817
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to get some digs out of me, so I had to watch it live on air.

58:48.077 --> 58:50.599
[SPEAKER_09]: This video is really bad, so stay away.

58:51.896 --> 58:52.777
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard things.

58:53.117 --> 58:57.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on PerezHilton.com.

58:57.159 --> 58:57.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh.

58:57.799 --> 59:02.462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw his reaction video to it, and it was kind of funny.

59:03.242 --> 59:04.163
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one of me now.

59:04.863 --> 59:05.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there really?

59:05.504 --> 59:05.964
[SPEAKER_09]: On YouTube?

59:06.744 --> 59:09.486
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead, Operator11.

59:09.806 --> 59:10.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's on Operator11?

59:11.367 --> 59:11.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

59:11.607 --> 59:12.267
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can I find it?

59:13.208 --> 59:15.989
[SPEAKER_09]: Under my name, just saying return of RavensDolphin.

59:16.049 --> 59:18.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, RavensDolphin.

59:19.671 --> 59:21.052
[SPEAKER_09]: But how far in the show do I have to look?

59:22.096 --> 59:22.656
[SPEAKER_09]: Not far.

59:22.676 --> 59:24.037
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be, like, right there.

59:24.057 --> 59:28.058
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be, like, the second one before the cartoon cast and all that.

59:28.618 --> 59:29.478
[SPEAKER_09]: You can search for it later.

59:29.518 --> 59:30.858
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you the thing.

59:30.998 --> 59:32.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you RavensDolphin1 here?

59:32.379 --> 59:32.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

59:32.819 --> 59:33.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm 1.

59:34.599 --> 59:35.500
[SPEAKER_04]: Cartoon cast?

59:35.520 --> 59:36.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about cartoon cast.

59:36.980 --> 59:37.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Return of RavensDolphin?

59:37.920 --> 59:39.721
[SPEAKER_09]: Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.

59:40.141 --> 59:41.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Poop on a Stick, Return of Dolphin.

59:41.581 --> 59:43.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.

59:43.862 --> 59:45.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you call it Poop on a Stick?

59:45.222 --> 59:46.123
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of nasty.

59:47.263 --> 59:48.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is nasty!

59:48.683 --> 59:50.684
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, where in the show will I see this?

59:50.764 --> 59:51.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at the very beginning?

59:52.145 --> 59:53.486
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's only six minutes.

59:55.006 --> 59:56.247
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not watching all six minutes.

59:57.548 --> 01:00:00.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Just speed it up, speed it up, speed it up.

01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:02.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic, listen to the epic.

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:08.573
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing it right now.

01:00:09.213 --> 01:00:12.215
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think he's doing it.

01:00:14.016 --> 01:00:15.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, my precious ears.

01:00:15.556 --> 01:00:15.896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:00:16.297 --> 01:00:17.097
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:18.057
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it was loud.

01:00:18.638 --> 01:00:19.098
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

01:00:22.017 --> 01:00:24.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:27.140
[SPEAKER_04]: It was chaos, what do you expect?

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.661
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, alright, forget it.

01:00:28.861 --> 01:00:29.741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wasting everybody's time.

01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:30.802
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing it from a MacBook.

01:00:30.822 --> 01:00:32.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm wasting everybody's time.

01:00:32.823 --> 01:00:34.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with us, Raven Stolfen?

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:37.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just that, and bye.

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:38.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, buh-bye.

01:00:38.026 --> 01:00:42.748
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, forget it, another one's already coming in.

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:44.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:46.070
[SPEAKER_01]: GS68.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:47.951
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?

01:00:49.152 --> 01:00:50.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with the release of Rock Band, like,

01:00:51.866 --> 01:00:56.590
[SPEAKER_01]: As I expected, there are people who think it's the first game to have a drum part.

01:00:57.471 --> 01:01:09.120
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people who think it's the first game to use drums.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:10.809
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Play Beatmania

01:01:35.678 --> 01:01:42.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in America, and they said it was a rip-off of Guitar Hero, and all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like, What the fuck?

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.781
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are stupid!

01:01:44.821 --> 01:01:45.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

01:01:45.361 --> 01:01:51.663
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get the credit for doing it first.

01:01:52.664 --> 01:01:53.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

01:01:53.924 --> 01:01:59.186
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on top of rock bands' drums, before anyone calls me a Bambani Alitas, it's...

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.498
[SPEAKER_01]: Drum Media was not the first game to have drums.

01:02:02.578 --> 01:02:07.081
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?

01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:11.965
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?

01:02:12.489 --> 01:02:16.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?

01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:17.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't really think there was anything to it.

01:02:17.392 --> 01:02:19.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.

01:02:19.853 --> 01:02:22.895
[SPEAKER_04]: Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.

01:02:23.075 --> 01:02:27.618
[SPEAKER_07]: You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with them.

01:02:27.838 --> 01:02:29.619
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?

01:02:29.659 --> 01:02:30.759
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no... Did they?

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.961
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.

01:02:34.121 --> 01:02:35.042
[SPEAKER_07]: No, nothing like that.

01:02:35.062 --> 01:02:35.442
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:02:36.543 --> 01:02:36.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:02:37.903 --> 01:02:38.584
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:40.425
[SPEAKER_04]: When did the first... Well, let's see.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.365
[SPEAKER_04]: If Drumscape was out in 96...

01:02:42.902 --> 01:02:45.104
[SPEAKER_04]: The first DDR was out in 98, so I don't know.

01:02:45.784 --> 01:02:48.186
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think it was 97 or so.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:52.929
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.

01:02:53.429 --> 01:03:00.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to tag it with the... Well, DarkTek Studio did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.

01:03:01.394 --> 01:03:03.716
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it was around the same time as Drum Mania.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:06.798
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless, I mean, I get your point.

01:03:07.798 --> 01:03:11.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Even so, you could say that I'm sure there were older games that even...

01:03:12.563 --> 01:03:13.424
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:42.742
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of drum games already out there, it's just that Rock Band gave it a different twist.

01:03:43.342 --> 01:03:52.484
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tell me that Rock Band was not, like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having with that.

01:03:53.665 --> 01:03:55.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.

01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:58.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I said this before Rock Band came out.

01:03:59.426 --> 01:04:03.267
[SPEAKER_04]: If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.

01:04:03.967 --> 01:04:08.068
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could have had.

01:04:08.499 --> 01:04:09.880
[SPEAKER_04]: If they just wouldn't put the effort into it.

01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:12.022
[SPEAKER_01]: But, it's a risk they don't want to take.

01:04:13.824 --> 01:04:23.233
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix, I mean, sure they're Konami's rivals for its music games, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.

01:04:24.213 --> 01:04:30.059
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do accomplishments or high scores.

01:04:32.544 --> 01:04:33.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, that's kind of obscure, though.

01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:37.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.

01:04:37.247 --> 01:04:38.928
[SPEAKER_04]: That just seems like a logical thing to me.

01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:46.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's lots of games that... I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download, if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.

01:04:46.172 --> 01:04:49.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.

01:04:50.535 --> 01:04:56.118
[SPEAKER_04]: So... All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:57.779
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm good.

01:04:58.259 --> 01:04:59.360
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, you have a great week.

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.020
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk to you again.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.081
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:01.641
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

01:05:02.925 --> 01:05:05.326
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:06.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.

01:05:07.006 --> 01:05:09.707
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.

01:05:10.047 --> 01:05:11.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:05:11.087 --> 01:05:11.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

01:05:12.327 --> 01:05:14.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.

01:05:14.808 --> 01:05:15.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, Ranma.

01:05:15.728 --> 01:05:16.168
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:17.729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing good.

01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:18.489
[SPEAKER_11]: How's everybody out there?

01:05:18.609 --> 01:05:19.209
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:26.571
[SPEAKER_04]: It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that –

01:05:27.526 --> 01:05:28.967
[SPEAKER_04]: You can introduce yourself to the listener.

01:05:29.007 --> 01:05:31.948
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length of time.

01:05:32.468 --> 01:05:33.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy in New York City.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:35.490
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind this week, Ranma?

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.772
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter at a later years, right?

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:41.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:05:42.893 --> 01:05:44.414
[SPEAKER_11]: Look up Minesweeper, the movie.

01:05:44.754 --> 01:05:45.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:05:46.374 --> 01:05:47.115
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to see this one.

01:05:47.135 --> 01:05:48.635
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of stupid.

01:05:49.356 --> 01:05:50.196
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to see it.

01:05:50.316 --> 01:05:52.037
[SPEAKER_11]: It's stupid in a funny way.

01:05:53.538 --> 01:05:56.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:58.457
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:19.011 --> 01:06:25.414
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something and maybe I should just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.

01:06:25.974 --> 01:06:28.995
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lounge Radio very soon, aren't you?

01:06:29.816 --> 01:06:31.476
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's still in works.

01:06:31.676 --> 01:06:35.578
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting for my co-host and it looks like it's definitely going to happen.

01:06:35.598 --> 01:06:39.779
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.

01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:41.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about your new show.

01:06:42.436 --> 01:06:44.138
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Anime Jam Sessions.

01:06:44.499 --> 01:06:49.644
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime podcast.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.767
[SPEAKER_11]: I started listening to a couple of them and I didn't like it.

01:06:53.128 --> 01:06:56.131
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always felt that if you don't like it,

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:23.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Do something about it, put up or shut up And thus I started doing it I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out And a lot of people liked it So I have me and my friend Kuro Usagi Who's going to be my news reporter girl And I have some interviews lined up And basically we're going to be talking about What's going on in anime, anime movies, anime games Cosplay, upcoming conventions And just a touch of randomness here and there Very cool

01:07:24.116 --> 01:07:41.967
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that will definitely be coming to the station soon we don't know what night yet we're still trying to figure that out based on other programs like there's another program that I told like a year ago we were going to get on our station and it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24 hour 7 station but now in 2008 we're trying to kind of go back to that so

01:07:42.327 --> 01:07:43.708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:08:08.764 --> 01:08:18.567
[SPEAKER_04]: And to those of you that have missed myself and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon, I hope.

01:08:18.587 --> 01:08:19.708
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.

01:08:19.968 --> 01:08:21.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to it, too.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:25.830
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki has been talking about he might even get back into the swing of things.

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.771
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be a show that's on our station, though.

01:08:29.655 --> 01:08:32.996
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, F you then.

01:08:33.356 --> 01:08:35.536
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just an audio program.

01:08:35.996 --> 01:08:43.678
[SPEAKER_04]: And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com, and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.

01:08:44.238 --> 01:08:48.179
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw around with your time.

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:51.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us some samples, because we are looking to address – I should put it this way.

01:08:52.062 --> 01:08:55.584
[SPEAKER_04]: We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.

01:09:13.976 --> 01:09:15.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Variety is the spice of life

01:09:43.241 --> 01:09:44.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?

01:09:45.622 --> 01:09:46.242
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:48.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.

01:09:48.604 --> 01:09:49.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was awesome.

01:09:49.664 --> 01:09:55.507
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture you sent and where you saw it.

01:09:56.728 --> 01:10:06.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Anywho, me and my friend Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but when we got there, the machining was off, and we're walking around on our way out, and I see...

01:10:06.894 --> 01:10:07.294
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Kart GP2

01:10:23.866 --> 01:10:24.966
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say this much.

01:10:25.086 --> 01:10:34.088
[SPEAKER_11]: If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Race or anything like that.

01:10:34.348 --> 01:10:36.789
[SPEAKER_11]: This, I can play, and it's just totally fun.

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:42.310
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick up different weapons and stuff.

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:47.591
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.

01:10:48.251 --> 01:10:53.532
[SPEAKER_11]: That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games, if you come in first place, you get a free game.

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:57.586
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically have to pay for each round when you play.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:58.307
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:04.911
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I love at Dave & Buster's that I would probably play instead is that fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.

01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:08.513
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there just playing it.

01:11:08.593 --> 01:11:09.634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just uber fun.

01:11:10.695 --> 01:11:13.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:13.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:14.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Painting finger.

01:11:16.459 --> 01:11:17.619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.

01:11:17.779 --> 01:11:18.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Any quick final thoughts?

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:22.318
[SPEAKER_11]: about the LAN adapter for GameCube.

01:11:22.898 --> 01:11:27.222
[SPEAKER_11]: One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.

01:11:28.323 --> 01:11:33.588
[SPEAKER_11]: We had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.

01:11:34.409 --> 01:11:35.730
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use that with Double Dash?

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:36.290
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:37.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can.

01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:37.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight-player play.

01:11:37.932 --> 01:11:38.472
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you can.

01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:40.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.

01:11:40.534 --> 01:11:44.638
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of mana it was ever used.

01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:55.323
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, if we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if somebody was like, if they were like a few floors down below us.

01:11:56.164 --> 01:11:57.705
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.

01:11:57.725 --> 01:12:01.007
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.

01:12:01.147 --> 01:12:02.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.

01:12:02.908 --> 01:12:05.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Ranma, we really got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:06.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:09.612
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:12:09.672 --> 01:12:11.614
[SPEAKER_04]: Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:11.654 --> 01:12:14.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.

01:12:14.195 --> 01:12:15.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys heard about this.

01:12:15.646 --> 01:12:18.268
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was Gizmodo blog.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:19.748
[SPEAKER_04]: They were at CES.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about this?

01:12:20.589 --> 01:12:25.732
[SPEAKER_04]: They got some TV Be Gone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.

01:12:25.772 --> 01:12:27.253
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a little bit of a clip here.

01:12:27.693 --> 01:12:34.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?

01:12:34.657 --> 01:12:35.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:36.618
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.479
[SPEAKER_04]: People are playing this game.

01:12:38.519 --> 01:12:39.860
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using the TV, shutting it all off.

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:50.538
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to see the full videos, post it at gizmodo.com And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish.

01:12:50.979 --> 01:12:51.479
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was.

01:12:51.619 --> 01:12:52.220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's funny.

01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:55.825
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way.

01:12:55.865 --> 01:12:58.068
[SPEAKER_04]: But you kind of look in retrospect and you go, what a dick.

01:12:58.869 --> 01:12:59.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:00.071
[SPEAKER_04]: What a dick.

01:13:00.533 --> 01:13:08.940
[SPEAKER_04]: and they actually post in the Go's Moto blog, they say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some people's jobs harder and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.161
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry.

01:13:10.701 --> 01:13:17.206
[SPEAKER_04]: And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh down.

01:13:18.246 --> 01:13:21.849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:13:46.684 --> 01:13:48.566
[SPEAKER_04]: I say a well-deserved ban.

01:13:48.767 --> 01:13:50.349
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it might have been funny in the moment.

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:54.113
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in a dick jerk kind of way, it is funny.

01:13:54.213 --> 01:13:58.518
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you're going to be a dick jerk, expect to get punished like a dick jerk does.

01:13:58.759 --> 01:13:59.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Get jerked back.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:13:59.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:03.705
[SPEAKER_04]: A well-deserved ban from CES.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:37.447
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'm not going to say that certain other media outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media outlets came in drunk to certain press events and that's all I have to say about that.

01:14:37.467 --> 01:14:38.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one.

01:14:38.247 --> 01:14:39.708
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting.

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:41.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should be naming names on this show.

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:46.493
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names of the journalists, but not tonight.

01:14:46.533 --> 01:14:48.174
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.

01:14:48.615 --> 01:14:53.578
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:54.058 --> 01:14:55.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:55.519 --> 01:14:55.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.661
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ross Steel, UT.

01:14:58.901 --> 01:14:59.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steel, UT.

01:15:00.001 --> 01:15:00.842
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind, buddy?

01:15:02.563 --> 01:15:03.243
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things.

01:15:03.303 --> 01:15:04.664
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, yeah, I agree.

01:15:05.324 --> 01:15:11.368
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.

01:15:11.388 --> 01:15:13.349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:20.573
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's kind of one of those, you laugh for 30 seconds, and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at this.

01:15:20.653 --> 01:15:23.334
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it really isn't funny, like, in retrospect, you know?

01:15:23.354 --> 01:15:23.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's so funny.

01:15:24.915 --> 01:15:25.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're just an asshole.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:31.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was about to say, Loki's a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is... Oh, snap!

01:15:32.358 --> 01:15:33.238
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway, what do you want?

01:15:34.258 --> 01:15:39.080
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, man, doing that during the presentations, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody locked a job over that crap, you know?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.742
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, that's just wrong, you know?

01:15:43.442 --> 01:15:47.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.

01:15:47.485 --> 01:16:00.313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's why CES is saying, we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to do against Gawker and all that stuff, is because I think they're waiting to see what the response is going to be.

01:16:00.613 --> 01:16:04.095
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.

01:16:04.135 --> 01:16:06.037
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.

01:16:06.337 --> 01:16:10.520
[SPEAKER_04]: But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it, so what?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.

01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:19.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.

01:16:19.181 --> 01:16:22.623
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.

01:16:23.103 --> 01:16:23.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:16:23.384 --> 01:16:24.544
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that could be a problem.

01:16:24.985 --> 01:16:29.047
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see, we'll see.

01:16:30.228 --> 01:16:30.848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see.

01:16:31.009 --> 01:16:34.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.

01:16:34.731 --> 01:16:38.213
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?

01:16:39.254 --> 01:16:39.414
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:16:39.434 --> 01:16:39.474
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:16:40.239 --> 01:16:40.739
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:58.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently the FBI went to this kid in Texas, I forgot the exact city, but apparently the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, the radiation in their houses doubled.

01:16:59.029 --> 01:17:01.470
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a few years ago.

01:17:01.531 --> 01:17:02.271
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this was recent.

01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:03.532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it happened again?

01:17:05.172 --> 01:17:09.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was posted on January 10th, actually.

01:17:10.906 --> 01:17:12.867
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read something about something similar a few years ago.

01:17:12.887 --> 01:17:14.728
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw just posted the link in our chat.

01:17:14.808 --> 01:17:16.849
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.

01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:20.251
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else.

01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:24.493
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a gamer, it was this 11-year-old genius.

01:17:25.499 --> 01:17:34.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.

01:17:34.488 --> 01:17:36.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read this from Kotaku here.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.253
[SPEAKER_04]: The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:41.716
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he started studying physics around the 8th grade.

01:17:41.756 --> 01:17:45.099
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.

01:17:45.526 --> 01:17:46.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.

01:17:46.946 --> 01:17:47.886
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.

01:17:47.906 --> 01:17:48.387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 30 bucks.

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:48.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

01:17:48.687 --> 01:17:49.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I thought they cut them like little cans.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:13.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockwall, Texas.

01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:18.262
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this guy, you know, just in case.

01:18:19.483 --> 01:18:22.985
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.

01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:26.568
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.

01:18:26.608 --> 01:18:27.569
[SPEAKER_12]: Then that's when you blog about it.

01:18:27.989 --> 01:18:33.333
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this, um... I agree with what SSJ100Matt's saying in chat.

01:18:33.373 --> 01:18:35.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill Nye.

01:18:36.595 --> 01:18:37.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?

01:18:39.217 --> 01:18:40.458
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombie Mr. Wizard, huh?

01:18:41.687 --> 01:18:42.788
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is, there it is.

01:18:42.808 --> 01:18:51.356
[SPEAKER_07]: This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear reactor in.

01:18:51.496 --> 01:18:52.036
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait for it.

01:18:52.196 --> 01:18:57.081
[SPEAKER_12]: If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.

01:18:58.942 --> 01:18:59.883
[SPEAKER_12]: Games made him do it.

01:19:00.684 --> 01:19:04.888
[SPEAKER_07]: The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee.

01:19:06.161 --> 01:19:10.669
[SPEAKER_07]: and the radiation level was actually fairly safe.

01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:14.155
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I need, a nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.

01:19:14.175 --> 01:19:17.521
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a 15 year old using graduate level physics textbooks.

01:19:19.165 --> 01:19:24.588
[SPEAKER_07]: and used vacuum pump manufacturer manuals and scoured the web for cheap.

01:19:24.608 --> 01:19:27.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.

01:19:27.289 --> 01:19:28.670
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be going to offer him a job.

01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:30.671
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be freaking sending him to college.

01:19:30.691 --> 01:19:30.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:33.453
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.

01:19:33.513 --> 01:19:36.494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with all this attention, he's going to be working in a university.

01:19:36.534 --> 01:19:37.915
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on no time at all.

01:19:38.035 --> 01:19:40.456
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.

01:19:41.036 --> 01:19:41.237
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:19:41.257 --> 01:19:43.678
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty?

01:19:43.698 --> 01:19:43.818
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

01:19:46.731 --> 01:19:52.076
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three companies.

01:19:52.116 --> 01:19:53.197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you.

01:19:53.437 --> 01:19:56.399
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.885
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is with the 1UP Network is that really they're little more than a tabloid.

01:20:03.005 --> 01:20:10.751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being sensational.

01:20:11.091 --> 01:20:12.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that word was going to come into play.

01:20:12.352 --> 01:20:14.915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking like sensationalist.

01:20:16.138 --> 01:20:17.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, yeah, I kind of agree.

01:20:18.922 --> 01:20:25.230
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember after Gershman got fired, the whole thing with the protest in front of the CNET building?

01:20:27.093 --> 01:20:29.155
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalists.

01:20:29.196 --> 01:20:31.318
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not like they come to press events drunk.

01:20:31.338 --> 01:20:33.862
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait, no, no, they do.

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:36.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:38.530
[SPEAKER_03]: They do their podcast drunk.

01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:41.671
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

01:20:41.692 --> 01:20:43.753
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, we have too, but you know.

01:20:44.233 --> 01:20:45.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but also we don't get paid.

01:20:45.854 --> 01:20:47.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody pays us to do this program.

01:20:47.274 --> 01:20:48.635
[SPEAKER_04]: We pay to do this program.

01:20:48.675 --> 01:20:49.535
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how sick we are.

01:20:49.996 --> 01:20:51.196
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

01:20:51.436 --> 01:20:54.057
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.

01:20:54.118 --> 01:21:03.282
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit in the entire gaming big review industry, you know?

01:21:04.623 --> 01:21:06.124
[SPEAKER_03]: and you see it in their reviews.

01:21:06.184 --> 01:21:07.926
[SPEAKER_03]: They go out of their way to be negative.

01:21:08.026 --> 01:21:15.653
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at, particularly in EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that, quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.

01:21:16.233 --> 01:21:20.477
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they could say, hey, look how negative we can be.

01:21:20.497 --> 01:21:21.438
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not like GameSpot.

01:21:23.425 --> 01:21:24.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting perspective.

01:21:24.526 --> 01:21:29.229
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because, again, I don't really read a lot of these sites.

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:30.150
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:35.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but, like, secretly I'm, like, watching every move they make.

01:21:35.554 --> 01:21:36.494
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't.

01:21:36.634 --> 01:21:40.397
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.

01:21:40.457 --> 01:21:51.925
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I... Actually, this is a little off-topic, but IGN did... Lately, their thing is they've been revealing some of the Destiny-era games, the data design stuff, you know, the absolute shit on, you know, the Wii, and...

01:21:52.245 --> 01:21:58.268
[SPEAKER_12]: And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man.

01:21:58.728 --> 01:22:00.429
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course it got a really low score.

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:02.230
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they did a video review for it.

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:08.613
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally a minute long.

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.474
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?

01:22:10.514 --> 01:22:12.015
[SPEAKER_12]: It has platforms and jumping.

01:22:12.435 --> 01:22:13.296
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about it.

01:22:13.856 --> 01:22:15.997
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was the end of the video review.

01:22:16.277 --> 01:22:17.198
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, seriously.

01:22:17.825 --> 01:22:20.327
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're going to do.

01:22:20.627 --> 01:22:21.407
[SPEAKER_12]: Take it seriously.

01:22:21.747 --> 01:22:29.452
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though the game is crap, you've got to point out, you can do it funny, but point out why it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did one for you.

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.373
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's stupid.

01:22:32.934 --> 01:22:38.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now that you're talking about that, not enough people are doing good, funny reviews.

01:22:38.677 --> 01:22:42.520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember the old Alex Navarro review for Big Rigs?

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.701
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was hilarious.

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:45.691
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes Peggle.

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:46.452
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes Psychonauts.

01:23:12.577 --> 01:23:14.199
[SPEAKER_03]: He generally likes Assassin's Creed.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.346
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing with him is that he'll point out... He looks at the games.

01:23:18.386 --> 01:23:20.108
[SPEAKER_03]: He just looks at the games to look at the games.

01:23:20.148 --> 01:23:21.691
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not, you know...

01:23:23.025 --> 01:23:25.767
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.328
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as long as there's a balance to it.

01:23:28.388 --> 01:23:29.889
[SPEAKER_04]: He tells it like it is.

01:23:29.949 --> 01:23:32.450
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the people that do nothing but negative reviews.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:35.231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, okay, haha, joke's over.

01:23:36.072 --> 01:23:36.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Move on.

01:23:37.372 --> 01:23:38.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us both sides.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:38.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Be balanced.

01:23:39.173 --> 01:23:43.055
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross Steele, I've got to wrap up because we want to try and take one more call before we close the show tonight.

01:23:43.295 --> 01:23:45.596
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:23:47.297 --> 01:23:48.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Embrace false idols.

01:23:48.218 --> 01:23:48.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.

01:23:50.339 --> 01:23:50.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:23:53.769 --> 01:23:56.311
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess RawSteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.

01:23:56.331 --> 01:23:56.851
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to say.

01:23:56.991 --> 01:23:57.231
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:23:57.772 --> 01:23:59.172
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take one more call if we have any time.

01:23:59.593 --> 01:24:01.294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, if we have any more people who want to call in.

01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:04.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:24:05.036 --> 01:24:07.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, any last-minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?

01:24:08.178 --> 01:24:13.061
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have a last-minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an exploding baby in it.

01:24:13.521 --> 01:24:19.445
[SPEAKER_12]: So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.

01:24:21.226 --> 01:24:22.567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy for you.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.

01:24:29.222 --> 01:24:31.123
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to his reviews every week.

01:24:31.183 --> 01:24:34.745
[SPEAKER_12]: We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.

01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:38.206
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.

01:24:38.286 --> 01:24:40.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?

01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:40.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

01:24:40.487 --> 01:24:40.727
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.670
[SPEAKER_04]: One more call.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:46.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:47.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

01:24:48.191 --> 01:24:48.771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DT.

01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:50.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dartetsuya.

01:24:50.352 --> 01:24:51.032
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:24:52.543 --> 01:24:53.144
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nothing.

01:24:53.184 --> 01:24:55.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought I'd call.

01:24:56.005 --> 01:24:56.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chilling?

01:24:56.846 --> 01:24:57.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Listening to OLR?

01:24:57.867 --> 01:24:58.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Just chilling?

01:24:58.867 --> 01:24:59.768
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.069
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?

01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:05.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty interesting.

01:25:06.072 --> 01:25:06.612
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:25:06.672 --> 01:25:07.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting stuff.

01:25:08.994 --> 01:25:10.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good stuff, yeah.

01:25:11.475 --> 01:25:12.716
[SPEAKER_04]: What games have you been playing this week?

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:20.121
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.

01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:21.342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

01:25:21.863 --> 01:25:22.283
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.

01:25:22.303 --> 01:25:23.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

01:25:25.004 --> 01:25:29.045
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, it's like an adventure game.

01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:33.186
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games.

01:25:33.426 --> 01:25:38.187
[SPEAKER_10]: And you go around and you collect items and kill enemies.

01:25:38.747 --> 01:25:40.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of like Castlevania.

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:42.448
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.

01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:43.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I updated it.

01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:44.082
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny.

01:26:09.716 --> 01:26:16.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:18.119
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game is hard?

01:26:19.699 --> 01:26:21.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.420
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't give you, like, any help or anything, I don't think.

01:26:25.061 --> 01:26:26.681
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no cheat mode, no help mode?

01:26:28.122 --> 01:26:30.482
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean, there was a trick I learned.

01:26:30.502 --> 01:26:33.383
[SPEAKER_10]: There was this video walkthrough.

01:26:34.383 --> 01:26:36.984
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.

01:26:38.785 --> 01:26:39.505
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might help.

01:26:40.506 --> 01:26:43.907
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

01:26:43.927 --> 01:26:43.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:09.710
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:10.671
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's about it.

01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:11.331
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:11.652 --> 01:27:13.113
[SPEAKER_04]: So go play La Mulana.

01:27:13.133 --> 01:27:13.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play some more.

01:27:14.914 --> 01:27:15.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:15.434
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:15.474 --> 01:27:15.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

01:27:16.975 --> 01:27:17.155
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

01:27:17.195 --> 01:27:17.656
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:17.696 --> 01:27:17.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:27:18.896 --> 01:27:19.137
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:19.157 --> 01:27:22.159
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and end the show.

01:27:22.559 --> 01:27:36.208
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent Hill Origin, which apparently he says the whole series jumped the shark, and between Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and all this stuff, right?

01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:38.073
[SPEAKER_12]: SILENT HILL ORIGINS

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:19.516
[SPEAKER_04]: for those of you guys listening because there's some really kick-ass songs I mean it's it's more Akira Yamaoka doing some great stuff let's see what was oh this song I think I liked unfortunately I couldn't tell you the name of it because the songs aren't labeled but here's one

01:28:37.591 --> 01:28:39.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.

01:28:39.312 --> 01:28:41.893
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week.

01:28:42.413 --> 01:28:45.235
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.

01:28:46.115 --> 01:28:48.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.

01:28:48.776 --> 01:28:50.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?

01:28:50.877 --> 01:28:51.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, I don't have anything.

01:28:51.918 --> 01:28:52.418
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything?

01:28:52.858 --> 01:28:53.138
[SPEAKER_04]: All good.

01:28:53.558 --> 01:28:54.479
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, then we're good.

01:28:54.539 --> 01:28:56.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.641
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.

01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:00.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I like these cookies.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.604
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is penguins are cute.

01:29:05.084 --> 01:29:05.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:08.171
[SPEAKER_04]: This game filler is pretty fun.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.700
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:04.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Tune in next week.

01:30:04.196 --> 01:30:05.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

01:30:05.977 --> 01:30:06.258
[SPEAKER_04]: See ya.

01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:11.903
