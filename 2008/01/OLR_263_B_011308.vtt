00:15.100 --> 00:19.600
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.600 --> 00:26.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 13th of 2008 for this Part B of our program.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.100
So we're just going to cut the crap and get right back into some gaming news, aren't we, Loki?

00:30.100 --> 00:33.600
Yes, there is some big news coming from Nintendo Power

00:33.600 --> 00:40.100
talking about BioWare's Sonic the Hedgehog RPG that's going to be coming out in the DS.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.400
And apparently the game's title is Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood

00:44.400 --> 00:47.900
and will feature 11 playable characters in the Sonic universe

00:47.900 --> 00:52.200
and looks a little bit like Mario RPG to me, but, you know, what do I know?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.400
Is that a bad thing?

00:53.400 --> 00:58.700
Uh, no, not a bad thing, but why the fuck won't you make another Mario RPG? Seriously.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.400
Well, A, BioWare didn't make Mario RPG in the first place.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
So?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.200
No, I agree that it doesn't matter.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.800
I don't care if Square does it or, you know, BioWare.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.500
But did you ever play the Mario Luigi Superstar Saga games?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.200
Because those were very close to being Mario RPG.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.600
They were the closest thing I've played to that since.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.400
I miss Mario RPG.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.500
And, um, but the Sonic thing looks pretty good.

01:21.500 --> 01:27.200
They're supposed to have a combat system that's supposed to resemble the gameplay of Elite Beat Agents.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
So that's kind of neat.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.500
Oh, that's kind of cool.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.000
Uh, I don't know.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.900
Don't know much about it yet, but, um, should be the next issue, I guess.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.500
Dark Soccer, you've been a Sonic fangirl as long as I've known you.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.700
Are you excited about the new role-playing game that's coming out,

01:42.700 --> 01:47.700
or is it just another opportunity for the Sonic franchise to suck?

01:47.700 --> 01:50.500
If it's not done by Sonic Team,

01:50.500 --> 01:52.500
it doesn't exist in my universe. How's that?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.100
Oh, snap.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.500
Well said.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.700
Alright, well, uh, Bionic Commando is a game that a lot of folks are looking forward to,

01:59.700 --> 02:04.100
and, uh, one system that it's not coming out on is the Nintendo Wii.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.600
But some fans are kind of pissed off,

02:05.600 --> 02:08.100
because who wouldn't want to pretend that they have a robotic claw,

02:08.100 --> 02:11.800
and they can use the, you know, Wiimote to swing their claw everywhere?

02:11.800 --> 02:14.500
Well, it's coming out on the 360, PlayStation 3, and the PC,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.700
but no love for the Nintendo Wii.

02:16.700 --> 02:22.100
However, Ben Judd from Capcom said that a Wii version of the sequel

02:22.100 --> 02:26.500
would largely depend on how many Bionic Commando fans wanted it.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.700
Cue the petition!

02:28.700 --> 02:31.500
Almost immediately an internet petition went up,

02:31.500 --> 02:33.300
bring us Bionic Commando on the Wii.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.700
So they're taking a page out of, uh, Konami's book there.

02:36.700 --> 02:41.600
Oh, we want a petition to guaranteed sales, you know, and then, uh, we'll make the product.

02:41.600 --> 02:47.300
Well, it must be nice to operate your business without any sort of, I don't know, risk.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.800
Well, anyhow, here's the exact quote from Ben Judd.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.300
Quote,

02:50.300 --> 02:53.600
It will largely depend on what the fans want for the future of Bionic Commando.

02:53.600 --> 03:01.000
If the interest is there, of course we want as many people as possible to appreciate this great franchise.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.200
Well, speaking of other great franchises, at least the ones that's had people very happy.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.600
Um, anyone in here play Assassin's Creed?

03:09.600 --> 03:13.800
Not yet, it's another one of those games that I needed to play from 2007

03:13.800 --> 03:17.500
because everybody said it was great, but I just, I haven't had a copy of it delivered to my door.

03:17.500 --> 03:25.100
Well, there's a DS version now, where you can, um, basically go through and do all of the crazy acrobatic stuff,

03:25.100 --> 03:29.200
and sword fight, and kill people, and stuff.

03:29.200 --> 03:35.800
But you can also use the stylus for interrogating informers, and picking pockets, and doing other stuff.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.000
Wait, wait, you can use a stylus for interrogating informers, so what do you do, you just poke them?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.600
Poke, poke, poke, poke, tell me!

03:42.600 --> 03:43.800
Poke, poke, poke, poke!

03:43.800 --> 03:46.700
And then you talk into the, um, the speaker part, and go,

03:46.700 --> 03:49.000
bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.400
Like that.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.000
Well, this sounds like it's going to be a great game!

03:54.000 --> 03:56.300
I know, it could be interesting, I think it'd be kind of cute.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.600
It's supposed to be a prequel, looks kind of neat.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
I don't know.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.200
Um, the Nyko Wireless Nunchak, I remember we talked about that a little bit ago,

04:05.200 --> 04:12.600
um, pretty useless device, I think, but I guess if you, that little cord really bothers you,

04:12.600 --> 04:16.300
um, then great, you can buy this.

04:16.300 --> 04:16.800
Anyways...

04:16.800 --> 04:20.600
That little cord does really bother me, I would like to say.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.800
Whatever, okay, so...

04:21.800 --> 04:23.400
How much is it going to cost me to get rid of it?

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
That's what I want to know.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.500
Uh, $30.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.400
Never mind, I can deal with it for $30.

04:30.400 --> 04:36.900
Yeah, and, um, so, apparently though, it did win a, uh, CNET CES Gaming Award.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.100
For, uh, Wonderful New Peripheral, I guess.

04:40.100 --> 04:44.100
You know, I kind of, I forgot to talk about this this week, my gaming week,

04:44.100 --> 04:48.900
I played, um, some Ghost Squad, and I bought those, um,

04:48.900 --> 04:52.500
Nyko Perfect Shots, the ones that look like the little pistols.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.900
Those are fucking awesome.

04:53.900 --> 04:57.200
And, the other thing about Ghost Squad, and why I love the game even more,

04:57.200 --> 05:01.700
they do have a configuration in there for the Wii Zapper, so that you don't use the B button as a trigger,

05:01.700 --> 05:05.700
you use the Z button, so that you're actually firing it correctly.

05:05.700 --> 05:09.800
So, hopefully, more game companies, especially when they're putting out shooters,

05:09.800 --> 05:16.500
will look to, uh, Ghost Squad for an example of how to do a shooter on the Wii.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.200
Ooh, Robway has a good point in our chat room.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.300
He says, you'll want the wireless when Samba de Amigo comes out.

05:21.300 --> 05:25.000
That's true, because, you know, you have to have those Sambas way out there for some of those poses.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.300
Um, what else was I going to say about this?

05:27.300 --> 05:29.000
What did they get for getting this award?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.300
Did you get a trophy, or a plaque, or just internet fame?

05:31.300 --> 05:32.100
Internet fame.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.500
I see. Well, I guess it worked, because here we are talking about the device on the program.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.800
Maybe a plaque, who knows.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.000
A trophy?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
I want to win a trophy!

05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
Are there any award shows coming up where you can win a trophy in?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.600
I want a trophy.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.100
I have a trophy for us.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.700
That's from, like, 2005, and it's at your house.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.200
I want a trophy here.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.400
I can bring that one here.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.200
You should bring that one here. But I want another trophy.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.600
I want a 2008 trophy.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.000
But I went all the way for that trophy.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I know, you had to go all the way to L.A. and you had to meet Adam Curry. Poor you.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.100
No, I had to sit and stare at Adam Curry's butt as he was talking to other people by our table.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.700
Look, no, I-

06:09.700 --> 06:11.100
With his Bon Jovi hair.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.700
I want a new 2008 trophy.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.100
So what award can we win?

06:17.100 --> 06:19.400
There's got to be something out there we can campaign for.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.700
I'll have to look into that to make that happen.

06:21.700 --> 06:25.200
Well, the year is young and, you know, there are the Darwin Awards.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.900
It's a little bit of a permanent solution.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.700
Can we give ourselves a stupid award? Can we do something really stupid?

06:30.700 --> 06:33.700
But, you know, we don't give trophies for the stupid awards, so what can we do?

06:33.700 --> 06:35.600
Rob Way says, make your own award show.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.800
Well, there are, you know, there are podcasts out there that make their own award show.

06:38.800 --> 06:46.000
Hell, the gamertag folks, their thing was advertised on Xbox's official thingy inside Xbox.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.200
You think we could team up with Sony? They got nothing going for them, right?

06:50.200 --> 06:54.200
Alright, forget it. Let's move on with the gaming news.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.800
Maybe we could team up with Wii Fit.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.800
That's something I know I could use a little partnering with.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.200
Yeah, I could use that too.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.800
So maybe we'll win a trophy for losing weight on Wii Fit,

07:05.800 --> 07:09.400
but we're not going to get a chance to play Wii Fit until May 20th,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.800
if a new one-up column is to be believed.

07:11.800 --> 07:16.200
The blurb read, quote, Wii Fit is expected to be one of the year's biggest sellers,

07:16.200 --> 07:17.600
both in Japan and abroad.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.200
North Americans can expect to see the game on May 20th,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.400
by which time presumably they'll have that plus-sized Western Balance Board

07:23.400 --> 07:26.200
properly stress-tested and ready for use.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.600
However, the interesting thing about that was that that little drop date

07:29.600 --> 07:31.200
had never been mentioned before.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.800
So, is May 20th the day that this game will come out?

07:34.800 --> 07:37.400
If it is the day, then hooray, they got it correct.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.600
If it's not the day, they can just say, oh, it's been delayed.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.200
Loki, from the distribution angle,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.400
do you have any insider information possibly on this?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.600
Nope, haven't heard a thing.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.400
Interesting.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.600
At least not on that game.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.200
Well, I'm looking forward to this game, you know,

07:52.200 --> 07:54.400
just because I think it'll be fun.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.000
Maybe Loki and I can have a contest as we both want to play some Wii Fit.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.400
Maybe we can have that OLR Biggest Loser contest

08:01.400 --> 08:03.200
we've been talking about for a long time.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.000
Maybe Loki and I will get fit with Wii Fit.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.400
We can have like a blog and shit.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
Yeah, we can be on the news.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
Yay!

08:10.400 --> 08:13.000
Because people losing weight on a weight loss game,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.600
that's so fucking new.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.400
And there we go, we get a trophy for being on the news.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
News trophy.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.600
Yeah, but they'll only give me like 10 seconds worth of air time

08:21.600 --> 08:24.200
if that, and I'll say something brief.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.000
Oh, it's so much fun.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.600
Alright, by the way, if you haven't seen the clip of Loki on the news,

08:30.600 --> 08:31.400
it's on YouTube.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.200
Just look for the Orange Long Radio channel on YouTube.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.200
It's great.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.200
And like, they interviewed me for like a good 10 minutes,

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
and that's what they used.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.200
Oh, it's so much fun.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.800
Alright, let's give out some trophies right now to our listeners.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.400
Our listeners are awesome, and we wouldn't be here without you guys.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.400
And we always invite you to interact with our program,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.200
whether it be through the chat room or through our email.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.600
It's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.200
and Dark Sakura will be giving you a trophy in spirit

08:55.200 --> 08:57.800
every time she reads one of your emails tonight, won't you, Dark Sakura?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.800
In fact, you'll actually be winning a Golden Globe.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.800
Since there was no real ceremony, we're just going to give you a Golden Globe.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.000
You don't get a Golden Globe.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.200
You get an aluminum foil ball.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.400
Okay, and spray-painted gold.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.600
Alright, so there you have it.

09:11.600 --> 09:16.400
So, the Orange Lounge Radio Oranges, even though they're gold.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.400
We're going to give them out right now in our mailbag.

09:18.400 --> 09:23.800
Maybe we do win a stupid award tonight, I don't know.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.400
Dark Sakura, open up the mailbag and the envelope, please.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.800
Who wins orangie number one?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.600
You're funny, Rob.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.600
The first one is from TJ.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
It says, hey, before I begin, I want to say that I love your show

09:39.600 --> 09:44.000
and wish I could catch it live, but unfortunately I have other crap to do.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.400
That's a good excuse. I have other crap to do.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.400
Regardless, I try and catch the podcast as often as possible.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.800
I couldn't help noticing that nobody mentioned my opinion on the year's worst game.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.600
I work part-time at a GameStop. I'm sorry.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.600
And the one game that sold zero units during December was Jenga for the Wii.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.600
I mean, come on. Everyone's bored with the original game.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
It's not going to do shit on the Wii.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.600
Anyway, I just wanted to get that out there and keep up the good work.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
TJ.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.600
Thank you, TJ. The only reason I didn't mention Jenga

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
is that I had completely erased it from my memory.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.600
I'd like to thank you personally for bringing it back into my existence, you jerk.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.600
Jenga's a game. Horrible.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
Honestly, I'm telling a half-truth there.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.600
Obviously, I don't really think you're a jerk, but I really did just forget about that game

10:26.600 --> 10:29.600
because Jenga on the Wii is pretty forgettable.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.600
I don't know if it's just me.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
So there you have it.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Next email.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.600
With Bioshock Mass Effect Call of Duty 4, we play Super Mario Galaxies and an iPhone.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
This must be the best Christmas ever.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.600
Yeah, I know this email's a bit late,

10:45.600 --> 10:49.600
but I felt I must comment on how especially kickass Mario Galaxy and Call of Duty 4 are.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.600
Wait, is this the same email or a new one?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
This is a different one.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Oh, who sent this one in?

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
This one's from Ospher.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
Oh, okay.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.600
Super Mario Galaxies is just one of those games that's just hard to put down.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.600
As you obtain stars, more galaxies appear and the game just grows.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.600
It's so much fun to play and control, and controls are nothing short of sexy.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
Ooh.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.600
I may even consider searching for the soundtrack as the music is great in many of the galaxies,

11:13.600 --> 11:16.600
and some say this game is the only one to ever make me cry.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.600
Just read Chapter 4 in the storybook.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
What's Chapter 4, Rob?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.600
Wait, in Mario Galaxy?

11:21.600 --> 11:24.600
I don't want to spoil anything,

11:24.600 --> 11:29.600
but the soundtrack is out there on the internet, so take a look.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
On your favorite torrent site.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
Not that I endorse that sort of thing.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
Look on your iPhone!

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
But it is out there.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.600
Okay.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.600
Next paragraph.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.600
As for Call of Duty 4, it's just as Rob said, it's fucking epic.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.600
You play the game to experience it yourself, and then watch your jaw hit the floor.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.600
Last thing, is it at all possible to listen to the show live on my iPhone?

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
No.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
Not live, no.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
You can listen to the podcast from any touch-tone phone.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.600
It's something I want to say, like...

12:00.600 --> 12:03.600
You can't do it from a touch-tone phone, like a regular phone.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
You can hear it, you can hear the podcast on a phone.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
There's some service out there, free service,

12:07.600 --> 12:10.600
because I know, because one of our listeners, Misty, has used it before.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.600
She might have signed our podcast up for it, I don't even know, I don't remember.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.600
But I know she uses it, and I think a couple other people do.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
I'll look it up.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
There's some phone number you can call, and you can actually hear our show.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.600
I haven't actually tried to see if any of the programs work,

12:22.600 --> 12:27.600
but I know a lot of Java compatibility isn't there yet.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.600
Thanks for reading, as always, Ospher sent from my iPhone.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.600
You can actually, like, not have that included in there if you deleted it.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.600
This email comes from Stan.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.600
Hi there.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.600
I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now, and I'm really getting into it.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.600
It makes me wonder why I was listening to you folks before.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
After listening to your year-end wrap-up show,

12:49.600 --> 12:52.600
I believe DarkSakura mentioned something about ASIN and if y'all will be going.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
Well, do y'all?

12:54.600 --> 12:57.600
I live in Chicago and would love to meet you guys, even if it were for a bit,

12:57.600 --> 13:00.600
and if you guys had a booth or something.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.600
Not sure how all this would work, but I think it would be cool

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
if you did a sort of live broadcast of it.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.600
That's what we usually do when we do our panels.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.600
If not, then taping something while there,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.600
I'm sure there will be gamers mixed in a crowd of anime people.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.600
I mean, actually, that's more what we do as we do the recording.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.600
I don't know if anyone else in Chicago that listens to your show,

13:19.600 --> 13:22.600
but I'm sure they're here somewhere just never looked.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.600
Oh, any of you good at Soul Calibur III?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
I could really use a challenge.

13:27.600 --> 13:33.600
I didn't get Soul Calibur III because there were a lot of problems with the gameplay in it.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.600
I like Soul Calibur III, but maybe that's just me.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
Also, I read a MySpace posting about cover bands submitting songs

13:40.600 --> 13:42.600
to be played during your music portions.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
Did I read that right?

13:44.600 --> 13:46.600
Some of you asked for cover bands, and when I think of cover bands,

13:46.600 --> 13:49.600
I always think a guitar, bassist, drummer, and maybe a singer.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
You know, a rock band setup.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
Well, I play with the Lakeside Pride saxophone ensemble,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
and a few of us are big gamers,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.600
and I was wondering if you were accepting non-garage band tunes.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
Right now, I'm really getting into Phoenix Wright soundtracks,

14:00.600 --> 14:05.600
especially after finding out about their orchestral soundtrack.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.600
As you can guess, the sax ensemble isn't very, I don't know, rockish.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.600
I've tinkered around with arrangements before,

14:11.600 --> 14:16.600
but if I knew that one of our performers were to be played to a world audience,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.600
then I'm sure all of us would be gung-ho for the idea.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
So how about it?

14:19.600 --> 14:22.600
Are classical pieces acceptable to be submitted for airing?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
I would say so, dude. I played saxophone.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
I don't see why not.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.600
One thing to keep in mind, we don't like to have a lot of bloated songs in rotation,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
meaning like ten-minute songs are a little much,

14:32.600 --> 14:36.600
but if you have anything short, like maybe six minutes at the most,

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
I know a lot of classical pieces kind of go on a little while,

14:38.600 --> 14:41.600
but if you have something, you know, radio-friendly, maybe slightly upbeat,

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
I don't see why not. Yeah, I don't see why not.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.600
I mean, heck, I was in a bassoon quartet on clarinet,

14:47.600 --> 14:50.600
so I don't see why not.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.600
Anyway, thanks so much. Keep up the great work.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
I really get a kick if this was read on the air.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
One of these days, I'll call in.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
You should.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
There you go. You got a kick.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.600
And you got an orangey.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
Yes, you do.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
Just for emailing us tonight.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
By the way, I wanted to say really quickly, the chat room helped me out.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.600
The service where you listen to our podcast through any touchtone phone,

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
it's called Podlines.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
Now, we don't like totally endorse this,

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
because we don't know, like, I don't think they charge you or nothing.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.600
I don't know. I haven't done this in a long time.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
But here's the phone number.

15:16.600 --> 15:22.600
It's area code 650-523-6855.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.600
I'm actually going to call that right now on our Skype line.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
Let's see what happens,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.600
because I don't know what happens when you call this.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.600
I don't know if it just goes into the show or what happens,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.600
or if we get an ad or what.

15:31.600 --> 15:37.600
One ringy dingy.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
And it's busy.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
I guess we've been taken off the air.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
I don't know.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.600
Well, he sent in another part to his email.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
All right, fine.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
It says, oops, I forgot,

15:46.600 --> 15:48.600
but have any of you watched the Street Fighter the later years?

15:48.600 --> 15:50.600
Yes, I have.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
It's so damn funny.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.600
Surely anyone who grew up playing the first Street Fighter 2

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
will appreciate this.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.600
I even like the fact that they kind of mentioned the whole Zangief Gay thing.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.600
Yay, gamers.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.600
It's like, okay.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
I've watched some of it.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
It's pretty darn funny.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600
Good times.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.600
Well, we actually got an email from our good buddy, Rob,

16:12.600 --> 16:16.600
the two B's, who sent me really cool Doctor Who stuff.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
Really?

16:17.600 --> 16:20.600
Yes, he sent me old fanzines and stuff.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
Cool.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.600
But there was a thing about an 18-year-old arrested

16:25.600 --> 16:29.600
for trying to kill his father by strangling him with a cable

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
for one of his video game pads.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.600
They haven't said what the system was or anything.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.600
It said that the guy was playing a game

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
and the father was trying to get him to stop.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.600
He went in there and finally the kid just unattached.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.600
The dad took out the power cable

16:48.600 --> 16:54.600
and the kid went crazy and tried to strangle him with it.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.600
Interesting.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.600
He's being charged for, of course, domestic violence.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
As you should be.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.600
Yeah, kind of crazy go nuts, huh?

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
He was mad because he was playing right to speak.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
Wait, I thought you said that was the last email.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.600
No, I said last email.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
Oh, and?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.600
Oh, fine.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
One more email then.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
This one's important.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
It's from Belgium.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
Oh, cool.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
Yes.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
Hey, Sky, DarkSakura and Loki.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
I love your show even though you talk more about console gaming

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
and I am a PC gamer.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.600
It is highly entertaining and fun to listen to.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.600
I just want to say that I would appreciate very much

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
if you could do a show at noon in your time zone

17:31.600 --> 17:35.600
like you suggested last week during the call of the Swedish guy.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.600
Since I am located in Belgium, the show airs when I am fast asleep

17:38.600 --> 17:43.600
and can't listen live and chat in the chat room or something like that.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
I would love to do that sometime,

17:44.600 --> 17:47.600
so let me know if you plan on airing at noon.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.600
I always download the podcast on my PSP,

17:49.600 --> 17:52.600
so yes, there are people who listen to the show via their PSP.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
I use the RSS feed, but for the people listening live,

17:54.600 --> 17:58.600
it might be cool to figure out how to make it work via Shoutcast.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
Also, an interesting story perhaps.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.600
Here in Belgium, the PlayStation 3 outsells any of the other next-gen consoles.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.600
We are a small country, but with a big gaming market nonetheless, I think.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.600
With 634,000 consoles sold in 2007,

18:12.600 --> 18:16.600
the PS3 sold the most closely followed by the Wii and the PS2.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.600
Xbox 360 is the least popular console,

18:19.600 --> 18:24.600
and only after the release of Halo 3 could make it sell a little better.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.600
After the price drop, the PS3 started selling even better.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.600
Sorry if I didn't have the exact numbers per console.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.600
I think the fact that the PlayStation 3 was so successful made a lot of people

18:33.600 --> 18:36.600
instantly think that PlayStation 3 would also be the best way to spend your money

18:36.600 --> 18:38.600
on a next-generation console.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.600
I have the feeling the Xbox never was a really big success here,

18:42.600 --> 18:45.600
and so many people are more inclined to play a PlayStation 3,

18:45.600 --> 18:49.600
although the 360 might have the best games so far.

18:49.600 --> 18:55.600
Also, the casual gamers are, of course, going for the Wii over here, too.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.600
If I would buy a console, it would be the Wii, I suppose,

18:58.600 --> 19:00.600
because it is the most innovative system,

19:00.600 --> 19:05.600
and it differs the most from the games I could play on my PC.

19:05.600 --> 19:10.600
Keep up the great show, and I guess it's Grits, G-R-T-Z.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.600
Oh, I'm sorry. That's in closing. His name is Martin.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
Well, thank you for the e-mail.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
And what do you guys think of the idea of doing a show at noon one random week?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.600
I have a three-day weekend coming up.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.600
Too soon, though. We want to get the word out so people know.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.600
Yeah, I know, a three-day weekend would have been a good time to do it.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
We might have Marissa up here, too.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.600
Huh?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.600
We might have Marissa up here, too.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.600
Oh, that would be good.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.600
Maybe in February we'll look at trying to do a show at noon.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
We'll just have to check our schedules,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.600
because I know around Valentine's Day and stuff, I don't know,

19:38.600 --> 19:42.600
things might get busy, but we'll see.

19:42.600 --> 19:47.600
Sometime in February. I don't think any of us object to doing a one-off show at noon on a Sunday.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.600
We've done it before, like for pre-taping.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.600
Yeah, we've done pre-taping that early before, so why not just do a live thing?

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
I don't see why not.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
I don't see why not either.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
We will make that happen for our overseas listeners,

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
but we'll give you some warning when it's going to happen.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.600
Usually all else I'm going to do on a three-day weekend is sit around in my pajamas and play Ragnarok, so why not?

20:03.600 --> 20:07.600
Isn't there another three-day weekend for you in February, President's Day?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
I do believe so.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
Maybe we can make it happen around then.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
Maybe.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
We'll check our schedules.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
Okay.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
All right.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.600
Well, then that's going to do it for our mailbag, but if you would like to send us an email,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.600
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.600
But for now, we're going to get back into the gaming news with the one and only Loki.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.600
Yes.

20:24.600 --> 20:30.600
Anyways, so Rock Band is pretty popular right now, and because of that,

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
there's a whole bunch of weird peripherals coming out for it,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
one of which was shown off at CES.

20:35.600 --> 20:45.600
It's actually a new drum set, and what it looks like to me is just a MIDI drum set that they've kind of souped up for Rock Band.

20:45.600 --> 20:54.600
It's got the four drums, and then it's got three cymbals as well, mapped to yellow, blue, and green.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
So that's kind of neat.

20:56.600 --> 21:02.600
No word on when it's going to come out or how much it is, but cool nonetheless.

21:02.600 --> 21:12.600
Now, one thing that's not so cool but kind of weird is this Rock Band stage kit that was spotted on GameStop,

21:12.600 --> 21:25.600
and apparently it's coming out around June for $100, and it's an interactive light and smoke stage show.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.600
This actually sounds kind of epic.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
You know what, though?

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
Oh, Lordy.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
I still have $200 in store credit around that time. I'll pick it up.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.600
That would be awesome.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.600
We'll do it during the show. We'll just leave it on during the show.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.600
That's right. We'll just have the light and smoke during Orange Lawns Radio one night.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.600
Hopefully the webcam's back by then.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.600
That would be awesome. A light show and smoke.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
Remind me not to be here for that show.

21:51.600 --> 21:56.600
I know, seriously, because you can imagine just how it looks one way on the box,

21:56.600 --> 22:01.600
but then when you actually do it in person, it probably smells like farts or something.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.600
It's probably just going to fill up the room with a big cloud of smoke.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
Seriously, though.

22:05.600 --> 22:10.600
We had a smoke machine for Halloween one year, and I swear it smelled like farts.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
Why would you do this?

22:12.600 --> 22:15.600
I mean, why would you play this in your living room with smoke and stuff here?

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
I can't see the screen anymore.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
It's filling up the house full of smoke.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.600
Mac Man in our chat room at chat.orangeslawnsradio.com says,

22:23.600 --> 22:27.600
Does it come with some weed, too? That would be the true rocker experience.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.600
I don't know.

22:28.600 --> 22:32.600
It's put out by Performance Design Products, who also does a lot of the Pelican supplies.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.600
It's a pretty well-known company.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.600
It's funny, but is it $100 funny?

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
How many of these are they really going to sell?

22:41.600 --> 22:45.600
Let me put it this way. If it is an actual smoke machine,

22:45.600 --> 22:47.600
I can understand where they're getting the $100 for that,

22:47.600 --> 22:54.600
but, dude, you got to buy the liquid smoke for it, and that's expensive.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
Plus, it's a fucking smoke machine.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.600
What the hell are you going to be doing playing with the smoke machine?

22:58.600 --> 23:02.600
You can recycle it around Halloween, I suppose, and use it as a scary smoke machine.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.600
I don't know. I think it would be funny.

23:04.600 --> 23:09.600
I think it would be funny, too, just to do for one show, but, Loki, $100 funny?

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
I don't know.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
It's all store credit.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.600
Chat room, is it $100 funny? That's what I need to know.

23:14.600 --> 23:19.600
I'm sure they'd rather me buy an Eye of Judgment instead.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
I don't think so.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
Ain't going to happen.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.600
Eye of Judgment rock band smoke machine.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.600
Sometimes it's just too hard to tell.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
Loki, I know what you should do.

23:28.600 --> 23:33.600
You should give me that money, and I'm going to put it towards my Disney World trip

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
that Dark Soccer and I are going to take.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
Right, Dark Soccer?

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
Yes.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
All right.

23:37.600 --> 23:42.600
Disney World is the place that Dark Soccer and I have to visit someday.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.600
The cool thing is that maybe this will be up and running by the time we go there.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.600
Now, this is just a rumor, but I think this is awesome.

23:48.600 --> 23:52.600
Disney is considering using the DS as a platform to run park maps.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
Now, this wouldn't be the first time that Disney's done something like this.

23:55.600 --> 24:03.600
You might remember a story earlier last year when they enacted the Pirates of the Caribbean game

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
on the DS was going to interact with the ride.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.600
In other words, if you booted up the game when you were in proximity of the ride,

24:08.600 --> 24:11.600
you'd unlock a new character or something.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.600
Something a little silly, but it gave you incentive to go into the park and actually get this,

24:16.600 --> 24:20.600
especially if you were a season pass holder and you could just go any old time.

24:20.600 --> 24:25.600
Well, the cool thing about this is that the DS, this would be some type of application

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
that would download to your DS.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.600
It would be a tour of the park, basically.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
What you could do, imagine this.

24:30.600 --> 24:35.600
Let's say you use your stylus to click on New Orleans Square.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
You click on that, and then you can actually click on the Haunted Mansion

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
and see that the wait time for that ride is 20 minutes.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
Smart.

24:42.600 --> 24:47.600
That's a really kick-ass application, I think, in many ways.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
Oh, thank you.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.600
Sorry, we're being brought cookies right now that are being made.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
I don't want to drop them like I did the coffee.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
What kind of cookies are these?

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
Snickerdoodles.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
Snickerdoodles.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
Oh, I get all three then.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
No.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
I'm just kidding.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.600
No, you can get me one.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
All right, hold on.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
These are hot.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
These are just out of the oven.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.600
All right, guys, the show has been interrupted for cookies.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
Oh, my gosh, they're so good.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.600
I'm waiting to try one.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.600
Oh, hot.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.600
Hold on.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
Yeah, I know they're hot.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
Hold on.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
Snickerdoodles are like the best cookies.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
Oh, those are good.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
What's a snickerdoodle?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
They're cinnamon sugar cookies.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.600
They're cinnamon.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.600
They taste like, thank you, Katie.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.600
Oh, she can hear it good.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
All right.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
So anyway, where were we?

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
Cookie goodness.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
No, Disney.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
Let's see.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
Haunted Mansion wait ride.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
Oh, yeah.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.600
So you can click on an area and see how long the wait is.

25:39.600 --> 25:43.600
And you can actually go, let's say you could click on it.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.600
And when I say click, I mean tap with your stylist, obviously, right?

25:45.600 --> 25:52.180
You could click on the Liberty Tree Tavern, which is one of the restaurants at Walt Disney

25:52.180 --> 25:53.600
World, and you could see what their menu is.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.840
So you could actually see the menus of the restaurants without having to go into them.

25:57.840 --> 26:02.600
If you could make reservations at Blue Bayou with this, then this would be the shit.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
You have to call Disney Dining.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
No, I know.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
I know.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.600
But anyway, I think that's kind of rad.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.600
That would be an awesome thing.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
I mean, can you imagine if they did this?

26:09.600 --> 26:14.880
Like, me, you, Chris, Megsy would all have to make a trip and just have our DSs out the

26:14.880 --> 26:15.880
whole time.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
Like, okay, what's got a short wait right now?

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
Let's go to Indy.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Right?

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
It'd be fun.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.720
That would be a very smart thing, but we go to Disneyland much more than we go to Disney

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
World.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.880
But someday, someday we have to make it to Disney World.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.080
I'm actually planning on going sometime this year, which is partly why we didn't renew

26:29.080 --> 26:30.480
my annual pass.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.600
Sounds like fun, though.

26:32.600 --> 26:38.280
Well, something else is really fun and sort of making me kind of want an Nvidia card now.

26:38.280 --> 26:46.880
Is it Nvidia entered into agreement with Valve for development and distribution of games?

26:46.880 --> 26:52.720
Valve is going to have available for Steam users that use Nvidia hardware for free games,

26:52.720 --> 27:01.840
which is PEGL Extreme, whatever the hell that is, Half-Life Lost Coast, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.600
and Portal First Slice.

27:04.600 --> 27:17.920
And First Slice, it's actually a demo of Portal, a free demo of Portal.

27:17.920 --> 27:22.360
So I guess if you were wanting to try it on your system, then this is your way to do it.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.360
But it's kind of cool.

27:23.360 --> 27:28.360
And they're also working on doing releases for Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike, so

27:28.360 --> 27:33.200
they can have real-life versus competitions and things like that.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.200
Cool.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.800
Sorry, chewing on a cookie.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.000
I know, cookies are freaking good.

27:40.000 --> 27:48.160
Anyways, let's see, last week we talked about an Xbox Live lawsuit that some people are

27:48.160 --> 27:56.040
trying to file to claim $5 million in damages for downtime for Xbox Live.

27:56.040 --> 28:02.240
Well, Gaming Steve actually did the math to figure out how much that would be, or how

28:02.240 --> 28:04.640
much they're really entitled to.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.460
And apparently, of course, the service is $50 a year.

28:08.460 --> 28:13.080
One day worth of outages is approximately 13.7 cents.

28:13.080 --> 28:18.080
So for about the six days of outages, that's 82 cents.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.480
Or $2.46 for the three who filed the suit.

28:22.480 --> 28:30.820
So punitive damages aside, the $5 million would cover 36.5 million Xbox Live Gold users.

28:30.820 --> 28:34.840
And of course, we know that there's only about 10 million users right now.

28:34.840 --> 28:39.680
And you can send that to me in a check, Microsoft, 82 cents.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.880
No, I'm just kidding.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.240
They are giving the free Xbox Live game, I suppose.

28:44.240 --> 28:49.800
Which is approximately worth $5, if you think about it, so you're getting a way better deal

28:49.800 --> 28:50.800
this way.

28:50.800 --> 28:55.720
Yeah, but at the same time, how do we not know they weren't planning on doing this anyway?

28:55.720 --> 29:00.360
I mean, it's not like Microsoft hasn't given away free arcade games before.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.920
How do we know they weren't planning this anyway?

29:01.920 --> 29:02.920
Just saying.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.920
You don't know.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
You don't.

29:04.920 --> 29:05.920
But anyway.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.920
No, Darktitsuyu, you're right.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.080
Darktitsuyu in chat says, Rob, wait, I thought you weren't endorsing this lawsuit.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
You're right, I'm not.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
It's stupid.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.560
Obviously, I'm being an idiot when I say that they should send me an 82 cent check.

29:16.560 --> 29:20.200
They don't owe me anything but a hug.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.800
I would like a hug and reassurance that everything will be okay soon.

29:24.800 --> 29:30.320
Anyhow, you would think that maybe more news on the lawsuit would invoke our FUs of the

29:30.320 --> 29:35.240
week or possibly win a stupid award, but my God, how could we when there was this news

29:35.240 --> 29:36.880
that came out this week?

29:36.880 --> 29:45.400
And this has to do with a certain CEO in the UK named Steve Easterbrook.

29:45.400 --> 29:51.680
He made a quote this week blaming video games for the obesity epidemic.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.640
I don't know who is to blame.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.640
The issue of obesity is complex and is absolutely one our society is facing.

29:57.640 --> 30:01.320
There's no denial about that, but if you break it down, I think there's an education piece.

30:01.320 --> 30:04.800
How can we better communicate to individuals the importance of a balanced diet and taking

30:04.800 --> 30:06.000
care of themselves?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.520
Then there's a lifestyle element.

30:07.520 --> 30:11.700
There's fewer green spaces and kids are sat home playing computer games on the TV when

30:11.700 --> 30:14.680
in the past they'd have been burning off energy outside.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.040
Okay, fair enough.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.840
Just another person trying to knock video games for making kids fat.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.280
But then you have to consider who he is the CEO of.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.600
Do you know who he's the CEO of?

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
McDonald's.

30:25.600 --> 30:35.080
It's all their blame game thing trying to get the thing off of them, especially since

30:35.080 --> 30:39.480
they were under such heavy scrutiny after Super Size Me came out.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.760
So I'm thinking like, okay, so video games make kids fat.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.880
I would like to point out that in many McDonald's around the country, they have those Nintendo

30:46.880 --> 30:52.600
64 play zones and stuff, so it's not like, granted, he's in the UK and it's America.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.000
Here, kid, go play with some old games.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.600
They still have Nintendo 64 after all these years.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.520
Don't they have a DS wireless station too?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.480
I seem to remember that was big news last year.

31:04.480 --> 31:11.720
But anyhow, regardless, despite that hypocrisy where McDonald's actually endorses video games

31:11.720 --> 31:16.560
in their stores, there's just that whole thing about, okay, well, so the video games make

31:16.560 --> 31:21.800
kids fat, but the chicken McNuggets and hot apple pies with the molten lava in the center

31:21.800 --> 31:27.600
of them do not make kids fat, or McFlurries and cones.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
You know what it is?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
What?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.140
And actually, he did say it himself.

31:31.140 --> 31:34.680
It's a matter of lifestyle.

31:34.680 --> 31:41.000
You can sit around all day and play a game, or you can get out and engage in a sport,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.280
but also it has to do with what you're eating.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.520
And this is something that my trainer said when I used to do spin all the time.

31:49.520 --> 31:53.560
She's like, you know, you can, all these people who hit a plateau, she says she broke her

31:53.560 --> 31:57.480
plateau by going out and eating junk food for a week and then went back to the gym,

31:57.480 --> 32:02.320
and it tricked her body right back into losing again because it's like, okay, well, I'm no

32:02.320 --> 32:07.240
longer on this little amount of food, I'm on this much food, and so it went right back

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
into burning.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.840
I mean, you've got to eat to lose, is how it works.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.720
McDonald's can be a part of a healthy diet.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
It can.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.480
Well, especially they've enacted so many different choices that they have.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.520
You can get apples, as long as you don't dip them in caramel sauce.

32:21.520 --> 32:25.440
I freaking love that apple walnut salad thingy they have there.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.720
Be careful of the yogurt dressing.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.720
Yeah.

32:27.720 --> 32:30.680
Well, not just that, but the walnuts themselves aren't that healthy, but certainly more healthy

32:30.680 --> 32:33.120
than a quarter pounder with cheese, right?

32:33.120 --> 32:38.220
Well, yeah, and it's all a matter of not only looking at the content of your food but looking

32:38.220 --> 32:40.280
at how much of it you are eating.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.280
Right.

32:41.280 --> 32:46.400
I mean, you can even go and have a freaking Chicken McNuggets meal as long as you have

32:46.400 --> 32:51.100
it once a week and you don't get super-sized french fries.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.480
You have your six nuggets and small fries.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.640
No, you don't eat the french fries.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.640
Or whatever.

32:56.640 --> 33:00.920
If you're going to get your chicken nuggets, get a side salad with it.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.680
And put the nuggets in the salad, instant chicken salad.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
I've done that before.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.000
Actually, they have really good chicken salad there.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.080
I used to order it when I worked right next to McDonald's.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.920
So regardless, just saying, you know, it's not like you eat it occasionally and not every

33:11.920 --> 33:12.920
day.

33:12.920 --> 33:13.920
You're fine.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.920
It's not where you eat.

33:14.920 --> 33:18.360
It's not, you know, it's what you do and what you eat.

33:18.360 --> 33:21.440
It's not the where, the who, the any of that.

33:21.440 --> 33:25.100
It's what you're doing.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.840
It's nobody else's fault but your own.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.160
That's how I say it.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.800
Or just be fat and be beautiful.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
If you're happy.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
Be BB.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.440
Be a BBW, a big beautiful woman or a BBM.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.440
You know what?

33:38.440 --> 33:43.840
People should be happy the way they are and I think that a lot of this, you know, crap

33:43.840 --> 33:50.040
that people go through for, you know, the yo-yo diets and all of that is just people

33:50.040 --> 33:51.040
being unhappy with themselves.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.440
And I think the moment that you learn to be happy with yourself and, you know, and I know

33:55.440 --> 33:58.720
that I don't always, you know, do the same thing myself but the moment that you are happy

33:58.720 --> 34:02.880
with yourself, you will find that with an improvement in your self-esteem, your body

34:02.880 --> 34:03.880
is going to follow.

34:03.880 --> 34:04.880
All right.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Well, anyway.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.880
Or you won't care.

34:07.880 --> 34:13.040
Obviously, the hypocrisy of the McDonald's CEO pointing the finger at video games incites

34:13.040 --> 34:20.920
a certain sort of rage within us that can only be crushed by us venting our FUs of the

34:20.920 --> 34:23.920
week.

34:23.920 --> 34:32.240
I accidentally used the old song tonight but we'll deal.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.240
Sorry.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.240
Dark Sakura.

34:34.240 --> 34:38.000
I don't know if you're using the old music.

34:38.000 --> 34:46.800
Actually, I'd have to say FU to my day, I've had sort of a disappointing day and disappointing

34:46.800 --> 34:48.000
is a very good word for it.

34:48.000 --> 34:57.600
I've had multiple in a row disappointments and I want an iMac so FU to me not having

34:57.600 --> 34:59.960
an iMac.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.680
I'll go next if you're done.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.680
My FU goes to, oh, me going to the grocery store today, well, first FU to me for putting

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
in the wrong song.

35:08.680 --> 35:13.560
FU to this cup of coffee for getting cold and then FU to me going to the store today

35:13.560 --> 35:15.880
without my wallet.

35:15.880 --> 35:20.320
That's a bit embarrassing if you go to the front with a full thing of groceries and you

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
don't have your wallet.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.600
Thank God I didn't do that.

35:23.600 --> 35:27.960
So if you're picturing me in the store in that awkward moment, that didn't happen because

35:27.960 --> 35:32.080
thank God I was looking for something at the store to deal with the fly problem we have

35:32.080 --> 35:36.920
here in the studio and while I was browsing, that was the first thing I was looking at

35:36.920 --> 35:40.240
and I got a phone call while I was browsing and as I reached for my phone, that was the

35:40.240 --> 35:44.000
moment I realized, hey, wait a minute, my phone's here but my wallet's not so thankfully

35:44.000 --> 35:47.800
I just put the cart back empty and snuck out of the store like nothing ever happened in

35:47.800 --> 35:48.800
the first place.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.800
But that still was a waste of gas.

35:51.800 --> 36:02.320
FU to the muscle that's cold in my abdomen here because it makes it really hard for me

36:02.320 --> 36:05.320
to breathe and it hurts when I laugh.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.320
It hurts when you laugh?

36:06.320 --> 36:07.320
It hurts when I laugh.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.320
I will give you a bit of advice if you are going to rub it good clockwise because otherwise

36:10.320 --> 36:13.160
you will get a constitution.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.160
It's true.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.720
Have you had trouble going lately?

36:16.720 --> 36:18.440
No, I have not had trouble going.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.880
No, no, no, no.

36:19.880 --> 36:23.880
I have actually discovered this little fact as a massage therapist that your digestion

36:23.880 --> 36:27.440
grows clockwise and you can actually block your digestion by going counter-clockwise

36:27.440 --> 36:29.720
if you are looking at your stomach.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.720
You learn something new every day.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
You really do.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.720
You can actually handle it.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.720
I want really good.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.720
Yeah.

36:34.720 --> 36:40.920
Let's not talk about colon physics on the air.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.360
Is that a trick I can play on my friends is run up to people and rub their bellies counter-clockwise

36:44.360 --> 36:46.080
and go, ha ha, you're constipated.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.160
No, it takes everyone.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.720
I'm just being a little silly.

36:50.720 --> 36:54.600
Although Mac Man in chat says it's almost like a challenge now, he says, everyone make

36:54.600 --> 36:55.600
Loki laugh.

36:55.600 --> 37:01.120
I already watched the Gary's Mod 100 Deaths video and that was painful enough.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.240
I'm going to put my advice in the chat window.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.240
All right.

37:05.240 --> 37:08.240
You need to do your next story, Dark Soccer, before you get to advice.

37:08.240 --> 37:13.120
Games first, constipation later.

37:13.120 --> 37:23.160
Starting out on the Virtual Console in the UK, we have Star Tropics for NES.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.240
It was released on the 11th.

37:26.240 --> 37:35.120
Also, our good friends at Sega have produced Alien Storm, so they are getting that, which

37:35.120 --> 37:41.280
is a side-scrolling game where you fight aliens.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.280
It was a master system.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.920
Actually, no, it was not on Master System.

37:44.920 --> 37:50.080
I do believe it was a Genesis game.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.080
Any news yet?

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
No, I take that back.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.040
It was on Master System, but it was missing characters on Master System.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.760
Do we have any news on what games we're getting over here in this country yet?

37:58.760 --> 37:59.760
I have no idea.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.760
In the US?

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
All right.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.440
Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.440
In the meantime, more news.

38:06.440 --> 38:16.320
In the latest editorial for EGM, the editor-in-chief, Dan Hsu, actually called out three companies

38:16.320 --> 38:22.320
for allegedly refusing to work with the magazine due to negative reviews of their games.

38:22.320 --> 38:27.960
According to him, the three companies involved with that would be Midway's Mortal Kombat

38:27.960 --> 38:37.080
team, the Sony Sports Division, and Ubisoft, and they're flat-out refusing to give EGM

38:37.080 --> 38:44.800
access to early previews or reviews, and so basically he said, warning readers, that they're

38:44.800 --> 38:52.240
going to get little, late, or no coverage of these three companies' games, and they

38:52.240 --> 38:56.780
won't treat these products or companies any differently, they'll just cover them to their

38:56.780 --> 39:04.240
best ability without their support, because after all, they're writing for the reader,

39:04.240 --> 39:05.320
not them.

39:05.320 --> 39:10.240
So that's kind of interesting that he called them out.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.320
I don't know if that's a really good idea for those companies, because after the whole

39:14.320 --> 39:19.720
Gerstmann thing, I mean, I can kind of herd them.

39:19.720 --> 39:26.440
I kind of support the calling out of these companies, yeah, so I don't know.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.540
Part of me was kind of like, I don't know why this is such huge news, but I think it

39:29.540 --> 39:35.880
is kind of big, because somebody's kind of finally taking a step and saying, let's call

39:35.880 --> 39:40.920
them out on what they're doing, and the fact that if they get negative reviews, they leave

39:40.920 --> 39:43.860
the room with their panties in a huff, but I'm just surprised that somebody would do

39:43.860 --> 39:49.160
this to a company like EGM, Ziff Davis, who has the one-up, they have a lot of muscles,

39:49.160 --> 39:51.720
so that seems kind of counterproductive.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.920
Your company is going to put out a game that's not well-liked once in a while, but the same

39:55.920 --> 40:01.080
thing happens with movie studios, and does 20th Century Fox stop showing their movies

40:01.080 --> 40:03.800
to Roger Ebert just because they don't like one of his reviews?

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
No?

40:04.800 --> 40:05.800
You just, you deal.

40:05.800 --> 40:10.760
Well, and I think it's stupid anyways, because it's just going to be more negative feedback

40:10.760 --> 40:11.760
for them.

40:11.760 --> 40:18.680
I mean, not that it really affected Kent Lynch, I guess, but this isn't the first companies

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
to do this.

40:19.680 --> 40:24.600
Apparently, Capcom at one time pulled all their coverage from EGM as well, and now they're

40:24.600 --> 40:28.160
back supporting them, so...

40:28.160 --> 40:29.160
I don't know.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.000
It's just going to hurt, really, those three publishers anyways, because now their game's

40:33.000 --> 40:36.680
going to be exposed to less people, you know?

40:36.680 --> 40:41.160
Coverage is coverage, you know, you may have bad coverage, but at least it's coverage.

40:41.160 --> 40:47.180
Sometimes too, I've noticed in my experience, it's one douchey person at a company can kind

40:47.180 --> 40:48.180
of ruin it.

40:48.180 --> 40:52.200
Like, you know, it might not be, like, for instance, I did not have a positive experience

40:52.200 --> 40:56.520
with Capcom at one E3, but that's because they had one douchey person representing them

40:56.520 --> 41:01.280
that kind of treated me kind of mean and looked down on me because I wasn't a journalist from

41:01.280 --> 41:05.120
some big, huge magazine or whatever, but I had some shitty little podcast, right?

41:05.120 --> 41:08.880
So that kind of tarnished Capcom's image, but I'm sure there's a lot of great people

41:08.880 --> 41:12.080
that work for that company, and they do put out a lot of very solid games, but it did

41:12.080 --> 41:16.040
kind of leave you this taste in my mouth of, like, wow, Capcom kind of fucking sucks, but

41:16.040 --> 41:21.060
it obviously didn't impact the amount of news or coverage we did on this program, but sometimes

41:21.060 --> 41:27.480
one douchey person can really, you know, so I kind of wonder, maybe it's not necessarily

41:27.480 --> 41:32.320
Ubisoft, but it's like that one person in the department who's the liaison who got their

41:32.320 --> 41:34.560
feathers ruffled is now kind of ruining it for everybody.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.920
It is pretty bad, and it's all, it wasn't really reviews, it was based on, like, previews

41:38.920 --> 41:43.360
and stuff, because they're being honest with their previews saying, hey, there's these

41:43.360 --> 41:47.280
bugs in the game, you know, and hopefully they get worked out, because otherwise, you

41:47.280 --> 41:49.100
know, it's gonna suck.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.880
And I think that's an honest opinion.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.800
And they realize that it's, you know, not finished yet, and that's why they phrased

41:55.800 --> 41:59.520
it in such a way, but, you know, apparently they took that as, oh, well, how dare you

41:59.520 --> 42:03.480
talk about our game, blah, blah, blah, you know, they only want glowing reviews.

42:03.480 --> 42:07.000
Well, if that's the case, then why don't you write your own fucking previews and just submit

42:07.000 --> 42:10.240
it to the magazine, then, if you don't want anyone doing that.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.480
Just have all the game companies write their fluff and submit it in.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.400
We'll just do it all like press releases or something like that.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.600
Then everybody can own a game magazine.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.200
Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, period.

42:21.200 --> 42:26.480
I mean, when I say public I could be other, you know, game journalists or other, you know,

42:26.480 --> 42:28.300
literally the public at trade shows and things.

42:28.300 --> 42:31.680
Just be careful who you have dealing with the public, that's all.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.640
That's good customer service, right?

42:33.640 --> 42:34.980
I don't know.

42:34.980 --> 42:35.980
Right.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.000
Good customer service.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.460
Whether that be, you know, customer service, meaning your customer is, you know, if you're

42:40.460 --> 42:45.700
in a PR department, then your customer is the press, so be careful who you have representing.

42:45.700 --> 42:50.980
Well, and to put it this way, this is something that we went over in one of my old customer

42:50.980 --> 42:59.860
service classes when I, you know, worked on the phone, is that for every one person that

42:59.860 --> 43:05.580
is an advocate that goes out and says something, you have eight more people who are going to

43:05.580 --> 43:09.180
talk to their friends, and they're going to talk to their friends, and they're going to

43:09.180 --> 43:10.180
talk to their friends.

43:10.180 --> 43:15.920
It's sort of like dropping, you know, a boulder in a lake or something.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.660
Eventually it's going to cause enough waves.

43:17.660 --> 43:21.580
Something I don't talk about a lot on this program, but my day job, I actually am a trainer

43:21.580 --> 43:26.980
for customer service for our call center for a major health insurance company.

43:26.980 --> 43:32.580
So you know, I definitely, it always makes me frown when I see poor customer service,

43:32.580 --> 43:37.900
whether it be at a, you know, at a Safeway, Bel Air grocery store type thing, or a, you

43:37.900 --> 43:38.900
know, video game trade show.

43:38.900 --> 43:41.220
What the hell is wrong with you?

43:41.220 --> 43:42.220
It's easy.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.220
Just be nice.

43:43.220 --> 43:44.220
It's a tough job.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.860
Customer service is a tough job, and so I never, like whenever I call in, if I'm like

43:47.860 --> 43:51.860
totally pissed off, like the, you know, let's say the cable's down or whatever, you know,

43:51.860 --> 43:55.140
it's been down for a long time or whatever, and I call in, I never get mad at the rep.

43:55.140 --> 43:57.940
I just go, I'm really upset about this situation.

43:57.940 --> 44:00.040
What can we do to resolve the situation?

44:00.040 --> 44:02.460
You know, I never get mad at the rep because I realize they're just doing a job, and it's

44:02.460 --> 44:03.460
a very challenging job.

44:03.460 --> 44:06.660
And I urge everybody, don't get mad at the person on the phone because they're paid to

44:06.660 --> 44:07.660
try and help you.

44:07.660 --> 44:09.060
Unless they're being douchebags.

44:09.060 --> 44:12.780
Unless they're being douchebags, then have a field day.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.180
And do not ask for the supervisor first.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.180
Give them a chance.

44:16.180 --> 44:17.180
Exactly.

44:17.180 --> 44:20.620
SSJ100Matt says, wait, but Rob, didn't you hang up on the Nintendo rep?

44:20.620 --> 44:22.940
Yeah, but that was just a, that was a stupid prank.

44:22.940 --> 44:23.940
That's different.

44:23.940 --> 44:24.940
Much different.

44:24.940 --> 44:25.940
All right.

44:25.940 --> 44:29.740
Anyhow, let's talk about something else.

44:29.740 --> 44:32.060
Going back to Microsoft, do you remember the diamond card?

44:32.060 --> 44:33.060
Don't you have one of these, Loki?

44:33.060 --> 44:34.060
Yes, I do have one of these.

44:34.060 --> 44:37.540
I never bothered to get one, and I'm probably going to be kicking myself now because the

44:37.540 --> 44:39.860
Xbox Live diamond card, which gets you discount.

44:39.860 --> 44:41.660
Have you ever used the diamond card out of curiosity?

44:41.660 --> 44:42.660
No.

44:42.660 --> 44:43.660
That's what I thought.

44:43.660 --> 44:45.740
I just have it because it was neat, and it was free.

44:45.740 --> 44:47.700
Well, it won't be free much longer.

44:47.700 --> 44:51.560
It's going to have a $6.95 annual fee.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.620
Part of the reason this is being blamed for now having the fee is because the diamond

44:54.620 --> 44:59.340
card program is moving over to a new kind of system.

44:59.340 --> 45:01.340
It's the Passport Unlimited.

45:01.340 --> 45:02.340
So anyhow.

45:02.340 --> 45:06.860
To be honest, the program sucks, and it's really hard to figure out what your, unless

45:06.860 --> 45:13.660
you know what the website is to look up the discounts or whatever you get on it, it's

45:13.660 --> 45:14.660
not very good.

45:14.660 --> 45:17.800
I know there's discounts on clothing and shit, but I don't use it.

45:17.800 --> 45:21.660
It's nothing really, I don't know, it works for me.

45:21.660 --> 45:23.380
I just have one because it's neat.

45:23.380 --> 45:28.660
Well, beginning March 1st, 2008 is when the $6.95 annual fee will go into place.

45:28.660 --> 45:30.700
I am assuming that Loki will not be paying this fee.

45:30.700 --> 45:36.500
Fuck no, I will not be paying that fee, and I don't think a lot of people will be.

45:36.500 --> 45:40.780
I don't see why he would need to pay a $7 fee.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.220
Well I don't know if somebody is actually using it, which, let's see, Hitstun in the

45:44.220 --> 45:47.980
chatroom says, I used the diamond card at Dave and Buster's.

45:47.980 --> 45:48.980
That's a pretty fun place.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.980
Wait a second though.

45:50.980 --> 45:52.840
Let's just think about this for a second.

45:52.840 --> 45:57.380
How are these businesses or whatever that probably just have a blank discount for the

45:57.380 --> 46:02.180
diamond card are going to know whether you have paid the fee or not?

46:02.180 --> 46:03.780
You're just going to have your card.

46:03.780 --> 46:05.580
Does it have a barcode?

46:05.580 --> 46:07.860
I don't know.

46:07.860 --> 46:11.080
It doesn't have like a mag strip or anything.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.080
Expiration date?

46:12.080 --> 46:14.940
I don't think they have expiration dates, but that might be a way...

46:14.940 --> 46:15.940
Loki's getting out the card.

46:15.940 --> 46:16.940
He's getting out his wallet.

46:16.940 --> 46:17.940
He's getting out the card.

46:17.940 --> 46:18.940
Let's see here.

46:18.940 --> 46:19.940
Hold on.

46:19.940 --> 46:20.940
That's a good question.

46:20.940 --> 46:21.980
How are they going to know?

46:21.980 --> 46:25.820
It's just like if I go to the movies and I use my old Chico State ID card, how do they

46:25.820 --> 46:26.820
know?

46:26.820 --> 46:27.820
Oh wait, it has the year on it.

46:27.820 --> 46:28.820
I don't know.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.740
Actually, I don't know if it does have the year on it.

46:30.740 --> 46:33.940
I honestly lost the thing a long time ago, but I know people that do that.

46:33.940 --> 46:34.940
They use their student ID years later.

46:34.940 --> 46:37.820
It does have an expiration date, and for the record, mine expired last year, so...

46:37.820 --> 46:38.820
But it does have a...

46:38.820 --> 46:40.340
Wait, let me see.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.340
It doesn't have an expiration date?

46:41.340 --> 46:42.340
No, it does.

46:42.340 --> 46:43.340
No, it does.

46:43.340 --> 46:44.340
Expiration 507.

46:44.340 --> 46:46.540
So there you go.

46:46.540 --> 46:47.740
Maybe that's all they know.

46:47.740 --> 46:49.460
They'll send something out to all the retailers that say...

46:49.460 --> 46:52.820
Those things suck anyways, because I remember when that program first came around, it took

46:52.820 --> 46:58.740
me like six months to get mine, so even if you paid the $7, you're already pissed away

46:58.740 --> 47:01.740
half a year, so I don't know.

47:01.740 --> 47:02.780
Oh, alright.

47:02.780 --> 47:04.220
So I don't know.

47:04.220 --> 47:07.200
I'd be curious to see if anybody in chat...

47:07.200 --> 47:10.060
Is anybody in chat considering renewing the card?

47:10.060 --> 47:12.780
That's what I'd like to know, or get some phone calls on that later.

47:12.780 --> 47:16.980
Meanwhile, while we await that feedback, we'll move on to another story.

47:16.980 --> 47:25.500
Well, the ESRB has put out a rating on Peggle, and Bust-A-Move, and Bliss Island for the

47:25.500 --> 47:29.820
Xbox 360.

47:29.820 --> 47:33.500
Peggle is, I guess, a puzzle game.

47:33.500 --> 47:38.980
I don't know, I haven't really played it any, but then there's also...

47:38.980 --> 47:44.340
I'm guessing these are going to be stuff that's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

47:44.340 --> 47:47.700
Peggle is fun, actually.

47:47.700 --> 47:51.220
It's one of the better PopCap games to come out in a long time.

47:51.220 --> 47:53.380
You know, I'll say this about the PopCap games.

47:53.380 --> 47:57.580
Make fun of them all you want for being the casual games, but most of the ones I've played

47:57.580 --> 48:03.120
are really addicting and fun, and you know, I see people at work playing those games all

48:03.120 --> 48:04.820
the time on their breaks and stuff.

48:04.820 --> 48:10.300
I was going to say, Peggle was confirmed that it is coming out, so PopCap did confirm that

48:10.300 --> 48:11.300
one.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.300
Wow.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.300
It's fun!

48:13.300 --> 48:14.300
I like Peggle.

48:14.300 --> 48:16.860
So, you know, most likely these are going to be coming out at some point.

48:16.860 --> 48:19.060
Why would you rate them if they're not?

48:19.060 --> 48:20.060
Exactly.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.060
Exactly.

48:21.060 --> 48:27.420
Well, I didn't get any feedback from the chat room, except SSJ100Matt says, I still use

48:27.420 --> 48:30.900
my four years expired student ID for movie ticket discounts, so...

48:30.900 --> 48:32.300
Yeah, that's the other thing, too.

48:32.300 --> 48:35.980
I mean, most of these people, like if you're going into a store or whatever, are they really

48:35.980 --> 48:40.540
going to know to look for, you know, the expiration date on that?

48:40.540 --> 48:41.540
They might not.

48:41.540 --> 48:47.340
Or they may just not care, so try it.

48:47.340 --> 48:52.220
So with your PlayStation 3 systems, you have a pretty large hard drive, you may be wondering,

48:52.220 --> 48:53.860
what the hell am I going to use this for?

48:53.860 --> 48:59.020
Well, one such game, like Devil May Cry 4, which will have achievements, although I don't

48:59.020 --> 49:03.240
really know how you're going to be able to see these, seeing as home isn't coming out

49:03.240 --> 49:04.700
for a while now.

49:04.700 --> 49:10.420
But one thing it will require, though, is that you install it to the hard drive.

49:10.420 --> 49:13.780
Five gigabytes of it will be installed to the hard drive.

49:13.780 --> 49:19.180
Oh, and by the way, that will take approximately 25 to 40 minutes.

49:19.180 --> 49:25.260
So before you can play your game, you must waste 40 minutes.

49:25.260 --> 49:27.780
Awesome.

49:27.780 --> 49:31.220
And I know that's not the only game that has you install it to its hard drive.

49:31.220 --> 49:36.820
Like for example, Ratchet and Clank, Ridge Racer has the option to do that, I'm pretty

49:36.820 --> 49:40.460
sure Oblivion does, and a bunch of other ones.

49:40.460 --> 49:42.060
Cool.

49:42.060 --> 49:47.460
Wait, does Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 let you install?

49:47.460 --> 49:48.460
I think so.

49:48.460 --> 49:49.980
Does it save that much time by doing so?

49:49.980 --> 49:50.980
I don't know.

49:50.980 --> 49:51.980
Probably not.

49:51.980 --> 49:54.700
You know, I was just thinking, I really do need to go back and play some more Oblivion.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.060
God damn, that game is great.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.060
It really is.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.660
You have to do nothing in Oblivion and have fun.

49:59.660 --> 50:01.540
Do we have any news on Elder Scrolls V?

50:01.540 --> 50:02.540
No.

50:02.540 --> 50:03.540
At all?

50:03.540 --> 50:04.540
You know they've got to be making it.

50:04.540 --> 50:08.180
Just play, I don't know, play Half-Life or something.

50:08.180 --> 50:09.180
Why?

50:09.180 --> 50:10.940
I want to go back and play.

50:10.940 --> 50:11.940
That's not Oblivion.

50:11.940 --> 50:12.940
Half-Life 2 or something.

50:12.940 --> 50:15.940
Well, maybe I'll play Street Fighter IV when it's released, because it looks better and

50:15.940 --> 50:16.940
better every day.

50:16.940 --> 50:18.340
I actually like the look of Street Fighter IV.

50:18.340 --> 50:21.780
I know it's causing some controversy, but it looks like a lot of fun to me, and of course

50:21.780 --> 50:24.980
Street Fighter is going to be bringing back a lot of the old characters you know and love,

50:24.980 --> 50:28.620
like Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, I think Dalzim has been announced as well.

50:28.620 --> 50:29.620
But there's some new characters.

50:29.620 --> 50:35.560
One of the new ones is Crimson Viper, and Crimson Viper has showed up from some magazine

50:35.560 --> 50:38.180
scans that were posted all over the interwebs.

50:38.180 --> 50:42.740
Crimson Viper, I don't know, she kind of reminds me of King a little bit, but with more boobage,

50:42.740 --> 50:46.300
like you know King from Art of Fighting, and this big pink ponytail.

50:46.300 --> 50:50.380
But she has that very kind of manly tuxedo look to her.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.580
So she looks like she could be fun.

50:52.580 --> 50:58.420
Dark Soccer, you could probably cosplay that, you know, with the glasses look and everything.

50:58.420 --> 50:59.420
That's quite alright.

50:59.420 --> 51:00.420
You don't want to do the boobage?

51:00.420 --> 51:02.420
Well, I have before.

51:02.420 --> 51:10.220
No, I've cosplayed Biken before from Guilty Gear, because I remember Evan helped me with

51:10.220 --> 51:11.220
Claw.

51:11.220 --> 51:12.220
Oh, true true.

51:12.220 --> 51:13.820
We stayed up for three days working on it.

51:13.820 --> 51:19.460
They just need to come out with Namco and Capcom need to kind of come together, and

51:19.460 --> 51:25.340
also Tecmo and just make Boob Fighter, just like large-breasted women fighting games.

51:25.340 --> 51:27.380
And then steal the Clay Fighter theme.

51:27.380 --> 51:31.140
Boob Fighter, Boob Boob Fighter.

51:31.140 --> 51:36.840
Anyhow, apparently Crimson Viper has a whole new fighting style, never seen in the Street

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
Fighter series.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.260
Couldn't tell you what that style is yet, but maybe it has to do with her boops.

51:42.260 --> 51:43.320
I doubt that.

51:43.320 --> 51:46.500
Or probably fighting with her hair, although, wait, wasn't that done before?

51:46.500 --> 51:48.140
I think that was done before somewhere.

51:48.140 --> 51:51.980
That was Milia in Guilty Gear.

51:51.980 --> 52:00.160
Well, speaking of Capcom, they're doing... at least it's a rumor right now that there's

52:00.160 --> 52:02.420
another Resident Evil arcade game.

52:02.420 --> 52:06.540
I didn't know there was a first Resident Evil arcade game.

52:06.540 --> 52:10.300
Well, yeah, there were the gun survivor games.

52:10.300 --> 52:12.180
Oh, those were in the arcade?

52:12.180 --> 52:13.180
Yeah.

52:13.180 --> 52:14.180
Oh, cool.

52:14.180 --> 52:16.220
I played the second one, which was the one based on Code Veronica.

52:16.220 --> 52:21.780
That was in Las Vegas at some arcade that's not open anymore.

52:21.780 --> 52:29.900
But the voice actress, Tara Platt, who was Jill's voice actor, is saying that she's working

52:29.900 --> 52:36.540
for M on another arcade game that's going to be released in Japan.

52:36.540 --> 52:39.740
She said that she really likes playing Jill.

52:39.740 --> 52:44.420
And the quote at the end of what she had to say is, you can bet it'll be on the lookout

52:44.420 --> 52:49.060
for the game in arcades there.

52:49.060 --> 52:53.660
They just couldn't stand watching a Silent Hill arcade game come in there and look awesome.

52:53.660 --> 52:56.180
I don't know, the gun survivor games are fun.

52:56.180 --> 52:58.340
That should better be coming to a console.

52:58.340 --> 52:59.340
I hope the Wii.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.340
It should.

53:00.340 --> 53:01.700
I don't see why they couldn't do it on the Wii.

53:01.700 --> 53:05.300
Konami, if y'all are listening, seriously, put that Silent Hill game on the Wii with

53:05.300 --> 53:07.720
the using the gun controller thingy.

53:07.720 --> 53:12.260
And for the love of God, look at what Ghost Squad is doing and do it that way.

53:12.260 --> 53:16.380
Because I don't know about target terror, but something tells me it's not going to be

53:16.380 --> 53:17.380
that good.

53:17.380 --> 53:23.580
Well, you know, I always thought that when they brought out the old gun survivor games,

53:23.580 --> 53:26.540
that they, like how, you know the Dreamcast gun, right?

53:26.540 --> 53:28.620
How it had the controller on it?

53:28.620 --> 53:32.740
I always thought that they should do a game where, because if you hold it two hands, you've

53:32.740 --> 53:36.820
got your D-pad on there that you can use to move through the game.

53:36.820 --> 53:41.260
And you know, you can use it for the pushing motions and all of that too, but you have

53:41.260 --> 53:42.260
your gun.

53:42.260 --> 53:48.340
We were talking about how they should do a walk through House of the Dead that used that

53:48.340 --> 53:49.340
sort of functionality.

53:49.340 --> 53:51.780
I think that that would work for a gun survivor.

53:51.780 --> 53:54.980
That's basically what they're doing right now with Time Crisis 4.

53:54.980 --> 53:56.980
Very cool.

53:56.980 --> 53:58.760
The Skype line will be opening soon, by the way.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.940
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can always give us a call toll free

54:01.940 --> 54:05.820
in the U.S. and Canada, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

54:05.820 --> 54:09.220
Username on Skype again, OrangeLoungeRadio, but one more story before we get to that.

54:09.220 --> 54:12.980
So one of the big announcements that we're waiting for is a firm date on when the Wii

54:12.980 --> 54:16.360
Ware service is going to actually come out.

54:16.360 --> 54:20.140
Now a little bit of a hint to this may be coming from a third-party developer, Engine

54:20.140 --> 54:24.780
Software, who has a game that's going to be on there, and according to them, the launch

54:24.780 --> 54:28.240
date is scheduled for this March.

54:28.240 --> 54:33.220
So with, I know, Game Developers Conference right around the corner, maybe that's something

54:33.220 --> 54:36.860
that they'll talk about since, you know, that would be something that developers would be

54:36.860 --> 54:39.660
interested in, maybe.

54:39.660 --> 54:41.940
Oh, that's true.

54:41.940 --> 54:45.140
That's a really good point, is that possibly that's something we'll be seeing around Game

54:45.140 --> 54:46.140
Developers Conference.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.140
I hope so.

54:47.140 --> 54:51.380
That would make sense, because, you know, something that they can produce games cheaply

54:51.380 --> 54:55.060
on their service, it would be right up their alley for them to announce something like

54:55.060 --> 54:56.060
that.

54:56.060 --> 54:59.080
I'm looking forward to WiiWare, but I'm also looking forward to some type of hard drive

54:59.080 --> 55:02.700
or something to keep all this crap on that I download.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.180
I really, really hope that's in Nintendo's future, but who knows.

55:05.180 --> 55:09.620
At least allowing you to put them on, like, memory sticks or something like that.

55:09.620 --> 55:13.380
Because I'm sorry, that whole excuse of, well, you can just download it again doesn't work

55:13.380 --> 55:14.380
for me.

55:14.380 --> 55:16.060
What's the point of having a damn SD memory card slot in there if you're not going to

55:16.060 --> 55:17.380
use it?

55:17.380 --> 55:20.580
Or even USB ports if you're not going to use them.

55:20.580 --> 55:25.380
So I can put pictures on my camera phone and send them to my friends on the Wii?

55:25.380 --> 55:26.820
I've done that a lot, actually.

55:26.820 --> 55:28.020
A little silly.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.020
It's silly, but it's fun.

55:29.020 --> 55:32.580
So how many pictures have you sent for Pokemon Snap?

55:32.580 --> 55:33.580
Only a couple.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.380
I don't have a lot of friends, I don't know who on my Wii list would get a kick out of

55:36.380 --> 55:37.380
seeing that.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.660
I sent some to Jason, our webmaster, my friend in New York.

55:39.660 --> 55:43.460
I told Dan to download it, but he hasn't yet because he's a butthead.

55:43.460 --> 55:44.660
I have it, nah nah nah.

55:44.660 --> 55:47.060
I'll send you some pictures that you can show Dan.

55:47.060 --> 55:48.060
Okay.

55:48.060 --> 55:52.620
I'd be like, Rob says he'll stop sending us pictures if you give me a game.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.860
Actually, we've had a problem with our Wii Connect.

55:54.860 --> 55:55.860
Oh no.

55:55.860 --> 55:56.860
It hasn't wanted to.

55:56.860 --> 55:57.860
Oh, that sucks.

55:57.860 --> 56:01.580
So we've had a hard time updating our software.

56:01.580 --> 56:04.260
So, ew.

56:04.260 --> 56:05.260
What a bummer.

56:05.260 --> 56:06.260
All right.

56:06.260 --> 56:11.460
Well, let's open up the Skype line at username Orange Launch Radio or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

56:11.460 --> 56:14.460
Our Skype line is now open for business.

56:14.460 --> 56:17.060
And of course, we're already getting some calls, so let's go take a call.

56:17.060 --> 56:18.060
Hi.

56:18.060 --> 56:19.060
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

56:19.060 --> 56:20.060
Who's this?

56:20.060 --> 56:21.060
This is Ravenstaufen.

56:21.060 --> 56:22.060
How are you?

56:22.060 --> 56:23.060
I'm fine.

56:23.060 --> 56:24.980
And I'm so shocked and odd that you got through first somehow.

56:24.980 --> 56:25.980
Hello.

56:25.980 --> 56:27.420
You got a quick finger there dialing in.

56:27.420 --> 56:28.420
That's all right.

56:28.420 --> 56:29.420
What's on your mind, buddy?

56:29.420 --> 56:30.420
What's on my mind?

56:30.420 --> 56:31.420
Alex Navarro.

56:31.420 --> 56:32.420
What's on your mind?

56:32.420 --> 56:33.900
Ah, the editor who left GameSpot this week.

56:33.900 --> 56:37.460
We brought him up briefly in part A. What did you want to say?

56:37.460 --> 56:38.780
You know, that's a shocker.

56:38.780 --> 56:42.060
You know, the other guy, Greg Provo, left and now Jeff.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.780
It just seems like everyone's jumping ship of GameSpot.

56:44.780 --> 56:47.660
It just seems like it's just been a nightmare over there.

56:47.660 --> 56:53.660
And you know, I'm glad that he jumped ship because I thought he was really going to stay.

56:53.660 --> 56:54.660
I don't know.

56:54.660 --> 56:58.100
Am I the only one that kind of thinks really it's not that big of a deal because this is

56:58.100 --> 57:04.780
just some corporate website and you know, I mean, I don't, I don't really have, you

57:04.780 --> 57:08.300
know, attachments to reviewers, you know what I mean?

57:08.300 --> 57:15.060
It's just, I guess you could say, okay, this just continues that fallout from what was

57:15.060 --> 57:20.380
a huge thing that happened in the journalistic industry as a whole late last year, but I

57:20.380 --> 57:21.380
don't know.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.060
I'm kind of over it at this point.

57:23.060 --> 57:27.060
You know, I think, I think lots of lessons have been learned here that aren't soon to

57:27.060 --> 57:31.260
be repeated, especially now this whole, you know, now it's, oh, we're not afraid to name

57:31.260 --> 57:32.540
names after this week.

57:32.540 --> 57:33.540
You know what I mean?

57:33.540 --> 57:34.540
What do you think about all that?

57:34.540 --> 57:36.260
I just watch IGN myself.

57:36.260 --> 57:39.500
What do you think about the editorial from EGM?

57:39.500 --> 57:41.260
I just think that's just a little shocking.

57:41.260 --> 57:44.100
He's just going like, yeah, F them.

57:44.100 --> 57:45.100
I don't care.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.100
Yeah.

57:46.100 --> 57:47.540
You know, we're blackball you.

57:47.540 --> 57:48.800
Just send, we'll send you the game.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.800
We just rate games.

57:49.800 --> 57:54.620
So it's kind of like unprofessional, but I don't know why he's just doing what he needs

57:54.620 --> 57:55.620
to do.

57:55.620 --> 57:59.560
Well, it was kind of, but it was kind of one of those, you know, it wasn't like he was

57:59.560 --> 58:03.980
going rawr, we're going to beat you up because he was like, well, we'll review their games

58:03.980 --> 58:09.140
anyway, but it just might be slower because you know, they don't send us the free stuff.

58:09.140 --> 58:12.820
But I mean, it's not like you can't run a gaming website without ever getting free games.

58:12.820 --> 58:14.180
I mean, look at what we're doing.

58:14.180 --> 58:15.180
Hello.

58:15.180 --> 58:18.280
You know, but I understand we don't, we're not for profit either and all these guys are.

58:18.280 --> 58:23.780
So obviously it's a little different, but you know, if you love what you do, you can

58:23.780 --> 58:24.780
do it.

58:24.780 --> 58:25.780
I know I do.

58:25.780 --> 58:28.180
But I understand you got to pay the bills, blah, blah, blah.

58:28.180 --> 58:30.860
So what else did you want to share with us Raven's Dolphin?

58:30.860 --> 58:31.860
Anything else?

58:31.860 --> 58:32.860
Yes.

58:32.860 --> 58:33.860
One more thing.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.740
You were talking about that four girls finger painting.

58:35.740 --> 58:41.180
I'm not going to say anything about it, but let's just say that I do a show every Saturday

58:41.180 --> 58:44.180
night and they kind of dug me.

58:44.180 --> 58:45.780
They had to get some digs out of me.

58:45.780 --> 58:47.940
So I had to watch it live on air.

58:47.940 --> 58:50.020
So this video is really bad.

58:50.020 --> 58:51.660
So stay away.

58:51.660 --> 58:52.820
I've heard things.

58:52.820 --> 58:56.360
I actually, the only way I heard of it is don't hate me for this, but I was on Perez

58:56.360 --> 58:57.360
Hilton.com.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.360
Don't laugh.

58:58.360 --> 59:02.780
And I saw his reaction video to it and it was kind of funny.

59:02.780 --> 59:06.860
So is there really on YouTube?

59:06.860 --> 59:09.780
Not on YouTube, but on that site that's dead operator 11.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.540
Oh, it's on operator 11.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.300
Really where can I find it?

59:13.300 --> 59:19.860
Under my name, just saying return of Raven's Dolphin under my account.

59:19.860 --> 59:22.220
How far in the show do I have to look?

59:22.220 --> 59:23.220
Not far.

59:23.220 --> 59:24.220
It should be like right there.

59:24.220 --> 59:28.940
It should be like the second one before failure, before the cartoon cast and all that.

59:28.940 --> 59:29.940
Search for it later.

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
I'll give you the thing.

59:30.940 --> 59:32.500
Are you Raven's Dolphin one here?

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
Let's see.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
Did you?

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
Yeah, I'm one.

59:35.500 --> 59:36.500
Cartoon cast?

59:36.500 --> 59:37.500
I don't care about cartoon cast.

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
Where's return of Raven's Dolphin?

59:38.500 --> 59:39.500
Poop on a stick.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.500
Return of dolphin.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.500
Poop on a stick.

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
Return of dolphin.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.500
Oh, there it is.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.500
Why did you call it poop on a stick?

59:45.500 --> 59:47.500
That's kind of nasty.

59:47.500 --> 59:48.500
Because it is nasty.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.500
All right.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.860
Where, where in the show will I see this?

59:50.860 --> 59:52.420
Right at the very beginning?

59:52.420 --> 59:55.100
Yeah, it's only six minutes.

59:55.100 --> 59:56.460
We're not watching all six minutes.

59:56.460 --> 59:57.460
Just speed it up.

59:57.460 --> 59:58.460
Speed it up.

59:58.460 --> 59:59.460
Speed it up.

59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460
It's epic.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460
It should be epic.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460
I'm doing it right now.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460
I'm doing it right now.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460
Oh, I think he's doing it.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460
Wow, my precious ears.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460
I'm sorry.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.460
That's all right.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.460
I said it was loud.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.460
That's all right.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:25.180
Anyhow, it just sounded like chaos.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.180
It was chaos.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.180
What do you expect?

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.340
But, I mean, all right.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340
Forget it.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340
I'm wasting everybody's time.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340
I was doing it from a MacBook.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
All right.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
I'm wasting everybody's time.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.100
Anything else you want to share with us, Raven's Dolphin?

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.100
Not just that.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.100
And bye.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.100
All right.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100
All right.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.100
If you want to give us a call.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.100
Forget it.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.100
Another one's already coming in.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.100
Hi.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.100
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.100
Who's this?

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.100
GS68.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.100
Hi, GS68.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100
What's on your mind?

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:55.020
Well, with the release of Rock Band, as I expected, there are people who think it's

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.500
the first game to have a drum part.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500
Wait.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.500
I'm sorry.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
We're in the back.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500
You're a little quiet.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500
Get close to your microphone and repeat that.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500
I'm sorry.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.220
Well, with the recent release of Rock Band, I've been, as I expected, coming across people

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.260
who think it's the first game to use drums.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.260
Oh, yeah.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.260
Of course.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.260
Yeah.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.780
I mean, didn't the same thing happen with Guitar Hero?

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:18.540
Like, remember how all these awards were lavished upon Guitar Hero for being original?

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.540
Yeah.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.540
Just an original game, et cetera.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.420
And to be fair, it did, you know, I would say there was a lot original about Guitar

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.420
Hero.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.060
It wasn't the first game to ever use a guitar, but it was the first one to be so successful.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.540
But then, remember this?

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:36.180
Remember when, I think it was X-Play, then did a review of Beatmania here in America,

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.540
and they said it was a ripoff of Guitar Hero?

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.340
And like, all us people that have been following music games for years and years were like,

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.340
what the fuck?

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.340
You guys are stupid.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.340
Right?

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:50.500
It's just kind of like that mentality all over again, where if you do it well, you get

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.660
the credit for doing it first.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660
Of course.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:00.900
Well, on top of Rock Band's drums, before anyone calls me up and money elite this, Drummino

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.660
is not the first game to have drums.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:08.500
Like, wasn't MTV Drumscape released in, like, I think 1996?

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.720
You know, I don't really remember, but was Drumscape even really a game?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.140
Wasn't Drumscape just kind of a, like, screw-around thing?

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.460
Like I don't really think there was anything to it.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.980
Like I don't remember there being songs in Drumscape.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.140
Drumscape looked like a phone booth with drums in it.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:27.540
You played along with the songs, and you were judged on your accuracy for going along with

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.540
them.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.540
But there was no rhyme or reason to it, right?

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.540
Bad songs?

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.540
Did they?

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.980
I don't know, like, hit when the line crosses such and such.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.980
There's nothing like that.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980
Interesting.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.780
I'm not sure.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780
When did the first...

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780
Well, let's see.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.700
If Drumscape was out in 96, the first DDR was out in 98.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.700
So I don't know.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.220
Actually, I think it was 97 or so.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:53.220
I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, but right now it's not written very well.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.740
I had to tag it with the tag.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.460
Well Darktad soon did the research for you and says it came out in 2000.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.820
So maybe it was around the same time as DrumMania.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.820
But regardless, I mean, I get your point, is that maybe, you know, even so, you could

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:14.180
say that I'm sure there were older games that even made use of drums.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.620
Maybe not like a full drum peripheral, but I'm trying to think of like older games.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:22.740
This whole topic came back to me as a recent gif after recent Rockman, and someone's like,

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:29.980
oh, there's another game besides Donkey Kong that uses drums, and that had me face-powling

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.980
for a bit.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.980
Well, there's also Taiko no Tatujin.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.980
Let's not forget that.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:34.980
That's kind of a drum game.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.180
I mean, it's not like a drum set, but certainly it's drums.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.100
So there's plenty of drum games already out there.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.420
It's just that Rockband gave it a different twist.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:48.180
You can't tell me that Rockband was not like, you can't tell me nobody there at Harmonix

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.100
thought about Konami's session mode in the arcade and how much fun we were all having

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.100
with that.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.460
But props to them, you know, and I've said this for a long time.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.500
I said this before Rockband came out.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.020
If Konami doesn't have the balls to do it, someone else will.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.820
And someone else did, and someone else is now taking all the money that Konami could

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.780
have had if they just would have put the effort into it.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.820
But it's a risk they don't want to take.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.780
I've noticed recently that, I mean, Harmonix and Sugar, Konami's Marvel's Forest music

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:23.340
game is good, but I've noticed that they've been taking some cues from Konami.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.560
It's like, for example, the fact that hyperspeed is the only cheat you can use and still do

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.860
accomplishments or high scores.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.980
That's kind of obscure, though.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.380
I wouldn't say that's anything that was directly inspired by Konami.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.940
That just seems like a logical thing to me.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.060
I mean, there's lots of games that, I mean, a lot of the arcade games that you download,

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.140
if you change the arcade default settings, you're not eligible for achievements.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.100
I mean, I wouldn't say that's something that was inspired by Konami, really.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:55.500
All right, well, we've got to let you go here soon, but GS68, do you have any final thoughts

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500
for us tonight?

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.500
No, I'm good.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500
All right.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500
Well, you have a great week.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500
We'll talk to you again.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500
You, too.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Bye-bye.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.460
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to give us a call.

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.940
Dang, the phone's ringing off the hook.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.660
I don't even get through the phone number before another call starts coming in.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.140
Who's this?

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.700
I give you three guesses, and the first two don't count.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.780
Well, hello, Rama.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.780
How are you?

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780
I'm doing good.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780
How's everybody out there?

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780
Hello.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780
Good.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.580
It also helps that I see your name come up on the screen, but it's what we call the magic

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.380
of radio where we pretend that I don't see it so that, you know, you can introduce yourself

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.380
to the listener.

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.500
But they've probably heard you by now if they've been listening to this show for any length

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.500
of time.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.460
Our buddy in New York City, what is on your mind this week, Rama?

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.140
Okay, you said you saw Street Fighter the later years, right?

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.140
Yes.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140
Mm-hmm.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.780
Look up Minesweeper, the movie.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.780
Okay.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.220
I have to see this one.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.420
That sounds kind of stupid.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.420
You have to see it.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.620
It's stupid in a funny way.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:57.260
Well, briefly describe it for our listeners who don't feel motivated to go look.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:03.220
It's like a parody of, like, an epic movie or something like that, counting, like playing,

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.660
it's like real-life Minesweeper.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.220
It's like, Minesweeper meets, like, a standard army movie.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.660
That's what it is.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.660
Very cool.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660
Yeah.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.100
I like those fake movie trailers.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100
They're funny.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100
Pretty much.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.420
Rama, I don't know if I'm maybe blowing the lid open on something, and maybe I should

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.660
just kind of sit on it and shut up for a little while longer, but I'm just going to say something.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.340
I believe you are going to be having a show coming to Orange Lawns Radio very soon, aren't

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.340
you?

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340
Yeah.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.340
It's still in the works.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.540
I'm waiting for my co-host, and looks like it's definitely going to happen.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:40.060
We're going to start recording brand new episodes the week of January 20th.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.780
Tell us a little bit about your new show.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780
Okay.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.520
It's called Anime Jam Sessions.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.220
The reason why I started doing Anime Jam Sessions is because I was looking for a decent anime

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.220
podcast.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.020
I was listening to a couple of them, and I didn't like it.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:57.420
I've always felt that if you don't like it, do something about it.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.420
Put up or shut up.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.260
Thus, I started doing it.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.300
I did a couple episodes to see how it turned out, and a lot of people liked it.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.380
I have me and my friend Koto Usagi, who's going to be my news reporter girl, and I have

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.700
some interviews lined up.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.660
Basically, we're going to be talking about what's going on in anime, anime movies, anime

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:23.100
games, cosplay, upcoming conventions, and just a touch of randomness here and there.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.460
Very cool.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:27.060
That will definitely be coming to the station soon.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.060
We don't know what night yet.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.600
We're still trying to figure that out based on other programs.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.540
There's another program that I told a year ago we were going to get on our station, and

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:38.740
it just never worked out because we have not been having the push to better our 24-hour

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.380
seven station, but now in 2008, we're trying to go back to that.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.980
We got to get all these other guys, and I got to see if they even still want to be on

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980
the station.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:51.100
All these other folks are putting together shows, and Dark Soccer, your show coming back

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.100
at some point?

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100
Hopefully, maybe.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:56.580
Well, we've got the computer we're working on, so...

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.300
What about, and I don't know how much I can say about this, but what about your new project?

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.300
I was very excited about that, the one you were going to co-host.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.040
The new project is in the works.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.220
With my computer being down, it's been hard.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.700
To those of you that have missed myself, and X-Fern, Rice Princess, and the stuff we were

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:18.180
doing on Wednesday nights, we are going to reform to bring one show very soon.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180
I hope.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.180
That's going to be awesome.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.740
I'm looking forward to it, too.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.940
So anyhow, so are we going to, and Loki has been talking about, he might even get back

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.980
into the swing of things.

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.220
It won't be a show that's on our station, though.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.380
Oh, well, F you then.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.580
I don't care.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.060
It's not just an audio program.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:41.020
And folks, if you want to have a show on Orange Launch Radio, send me an email, rob at orangelaunchradio.com,

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.180
and I'll pass it to the other folks, and we'll kind of talk about it.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.220
I would ask if you have any samples, just so we know you're not going to just screw

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:53.100
around with your time, send us some samples, because we are looking to aggressively expand

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.100
our programming in 2008 to really make ourselves a full-fledged station.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.460
Because right now, we're kind of a station built around this show, and featuring Travis

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.020
on Saturday night, who also does a pretty kick-ass show, you know what I mean?

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.780
There's not a lot else right now.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.700
Oh, Diamand has his show, so there's that, too, but there's not a lot.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.020
We want something every night that people can look forward to, so hopefully soon.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.780
Variety is the spice of life.

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780
Exactly.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:21.580
And we're not opposed to, you know, obviously, anime is not video games, but we realize,

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:24.660
you know, especially with this program, the fan bases cross over a little bit.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.740
So we're not opposed to, you know, and Travis does a lot of sci-fi, also, you know, kind

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:29.740
of a cross-section.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:34.880
So we're not opposed to things that aren't 100% game-related, but are kind of like in

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.860
that same nerdy realm, but just not like G4.

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.660
Okay, you're not going to see Fastlane repeats on Orange Launch Radio anytime soon, okay?

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.660
Mm-hmm.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.660
Alright.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.460
Rob, did you get the picture mail I sent you?

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.980
I did.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.620
Tell the listeners real quick about the picture mail.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.700
I thought it was awesome.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.540
My phone was dying yesterday, though, so I couldn't reply, but tell us about the picture

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.100
you sent and where you saw it.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.780
Well, anywho, me and my friend, Shaley, we went to Dave and Buster's to play DDR, but

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:05.860
when we got there, the machine was off, and we were walking around on our way out, and

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:11.740
I see a picture of Mario, and I turn around, and they're at Dave and Buster's Mario Kart

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.740
GP2.

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.740
That's right.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.100
I heard rumors that was coming, so it's kind of neat to see in arcades.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.300
But the question is, is this one fun?

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300
Because the other one kind of...

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.300
Yeah.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.300
It wasn't...

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.820
The first one wasn't that great, I have to admit.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.140
I will say this much.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.440
If you suck at racing games in the arcade, you're definitely going to jump on this, because

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.100
I picked up on this really quickly, because I can't play Ridge Racer or anything like

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.100
that.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.820
But I can play, and it's just totally fun.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.020
Plus, it has a webcam where it takes a picture of you, and it kind of emulates as you pick

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.700
up different weapons and stuff.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:48.420
GS68 says, too bad Mario Kart in the US sucks ass for no card slot.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.860
That I can kind of agree with, and on the downside, you know, in most racing games,

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.880
if you come in first place, you get a free game.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.940
You basically have to pay for each round when you play.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.500
That sucks.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.500
I would probably...

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.060
You know what I love at Dave and Buster's that I would probably play instead is that

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.300
fucking trivia game that gives you tickets.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.300
I kick ass.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.660
Oh yeah, I find myself just sitting there, just playing it.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.020
It's just uber fun.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.420
And, yes, and SSJ100Matt says, and jumping jackpot.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.420
Absolutely, jumping jackpot.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.420
Painting fingers.

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.860
Alright, Rama, we gotta let you go.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.060
Any quick final thoughts?

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.980
Yeah, about the LAN adapter for GameCube.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:28.420
One convention we went to years ago, Mario Kart Double Dash, eight players.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:34.420
You had two cubes hooked up, ran a 50-foot cable down the hallway just to play.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.740
You could use that with Double Dash?

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.740
I forgot.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740
Yes, you can.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.740
Eight player play.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740
Yes, you can.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.740
Well, that's kind of awesome, I guess.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.940
Too bad that anime convention was probably the only time in the history of man that was

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:44.940
ever used.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.940
Probably.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.820
If we were talking about it for a while, if it came down to it, we were going to pop a

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:54.620
hole in the window and do some MacGyver shit to run the cable down if they were a few floors

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620
down below us.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.660
Wow, that sounds like all kinds of fun, though.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:01.380
I hope the new Mario Kart's going to bring things like that to the Wii.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.740
Please don't suck, Mario Kart Wii.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.740
Okay, Rama, we really gotta let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.740
Bye-bye.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.780
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.780
Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:14.140
Really quick, though, before I go back to the phones, I want to mention this story.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.900
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was Gizmodo blog.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.900
They were at CES.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.900
Did you hear about this?

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.500
They got some TV-begone clickers, and they were turning off TVs at CES.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.820
We actually have a little bit of a clip here.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:34.580
Some guy doing the Motorola presentation, and the guy walks up, and what the hell?

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.020
Oh, he tries to turn the TV on.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.700
It doesn't work.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.700
People are playing this game.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:44.060
Just the TV guy shutting it all off.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.700
And if you want to see the full videos, post to gizmodo.com.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.580
And they kind of realized that what they were doing was really dickish, and it was.

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580
I mean, it's funny.

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:55.940
I hear Loki giggling over there, and it is a little funny in a jackass kind of way, but

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.700
you kind of look in retrospect, and you go, what a dick, right?

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700
What a dick.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.740
And they actually post in the Gizmodo blog.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:06.380
They say, it was too much fun, but watching this video, we realize it probably made some

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:09.460
people's jobs harder, and I don't agree with that, especially Motorola.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.780
We're sorry.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:16.700
And possibly that's in response to the fact that CEA is threatening to layeth the smacketh

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:22.020
down on this guy who is going around shutting off the computers.

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.260
We have been informed of inappropriate behavior on the show floor by a credentialed media

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.040
attendee from the website Gizmodo, owned by Gawker Media, specifically the Gizmodo staffer

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.820
interfered with the exhibitor booth operations of numerous companies, including disrupting

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.820
at least one press event.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:38.260
The Gizmodo staffer violated the terms of CES media credentials and caused harm to CES

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.260
exhibitors.

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.340
The Gizmodo staffer has been identified and will be barred from attending any future CES

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.340
events.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.560
Additional sanctions against Gizmodo and Gawker Media are under discussion.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.660
I say a well-deserved ban.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:53.540
I realize it might have been funny in the moment, and in a dick-jerk kind of way it

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.860
is funny, but if you're going to be a dick-jerk, expect to get punished like a dick-jerk does.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860
Get jerked back?

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.860
Yep.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:06.860
So, a well-deserved ban from CES, and the reason why also I say that is because it gives

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:11.560
a bad name to bloggers and independent media everywhere when these guys get invited and

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.560
do this.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.920
This is why we get treated like crap at press events.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.020
No, this is not why we get treated like crap at press events, but they treat us like crap

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:26.260
anyways and then they invite these guys, and I'm not going to say that certain other media

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.420
outlets do this kind of behavior, but I do know on certain occasions where certain media

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:37.300
outlets came in drunk to certain press events, and that's all I have to say about that.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.300
I remember that one.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.300
It was interesting.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.820
Maybe we should be naming names on this show.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.620
Hell, if the journalists are going to name names, maybe we should be naming the names

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.580
of the journalists, but not tonight.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.300
We'll give them something to listen forward to in the future.

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.020
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.020
Launch Radio.

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.580
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.580
Who's this?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.780
This is Ross Deal UT.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.080
Ross Deal UT.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.300
What is on your mind, buddy?

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.300
A few things.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.420
First off, yeah, I agree.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:11.500
That whole nonsense Gizmodo pulled off at CES, that is just completely bushly.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.940
That's the sort of thing you'd expect a fifth grader to do.

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.740
I know.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:20.540
You laugh for 30 seconds and then you go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole for laughing at

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540
this.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540
It really isn't funny in retrospect.

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540
That's so funny.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.540
Loki, you're just an asshole.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:35.340
Yeah, I was about to say Loki is a piece of crap anyway, but the thing is that doing that

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:41.660
during the presentations, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody lost their job over that crap.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660
That's just wrong.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:47.540
Well, maybe the guy who worked for Gizmodo did, and rightfully so.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:55.700
And I think that's why CES is saying we are awaiting what further sanctions we want to

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.780
do against Gawker and all that stuff is because I think they're waiting to see what the response

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.780
is going to be.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.220
And I'll bet you if this guy gets fired, then CEA will take no further action.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.400
They're going to go, okay, we're happy with what happened.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.540
But if Gawker, on the other hand, wanted to go out and say, yeah, we did it.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.540
So what?

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.860
And then, you know what, that's going to have severe repercussions.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:19.620
Well, it's going to have severe repercussions if it goes throughout the whole Gawker network.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.020
Kotaku could even suffer several other sites that are on Gawker.

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.020
That could be a problem.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.780
It'll be unfortunate if one jerk has that kind of impact, but we'll see.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780
We'll see.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780
Yeah, we'll see.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.780
Anyways, a few stories that I was thinking about.

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:39.300
You heard about this guy who tried to make the nuclear reactor in his home?

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.300
No.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.300
That's cool.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.300
No, it wasn't.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300
Yeah.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:51.700
Apparently, the FBI went to this kid in Texas that fucked up the exact city, but apparently

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:57.500
the guy was blogging about how he was playing around with some uranium, you know, the radiation

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.500
in their houses doubled.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.500
This was a few years ago.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.500
No, no.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.500
This was recent.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.260
Oh, it happened again?

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.820
Yeah.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.740
It was posted on January 10th, actually.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.940
I've read something about something similar a few years ago.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.780
Tigerclaw just posted the link in our chat.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.500
Apparently, it ran on Kotaku earlier this week.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:22.060
I've read something similar about that, but I think it was somewhere else, but it wasn't

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:23.060
a game.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.060
It was like this 11-year-old genius.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.580
Yeah, 11-year-old kid.

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:31.860
I remember that one, but this one was an out-of-work guy living in his parents' basement who thought

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.940
it'd be fun to play with some uranium and make a little reactor.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.420
Let me read this from Kotaku here.

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.580
The man is an out-of-work computer whiz who redesigns video games.

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.740
He said he started studying physics around the eighth grade.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:46.140
He said he's a science buff who is fascinated by nuclear reactions and radiations.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.480
These things are in your tap water, you know, in the dirt.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.500
You could hold a Geiger counter up to a banana and get a count off of it.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.040
He's always been curious about how things work and likes to do his own experiments.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.940
The man decided to create a small-scale nuclear reaction in the same room he plays his video

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.500
games as his latest experiment.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.500
What a weirdo.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.020
Yeah, but you need plutonium, not uranium.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.660
You can buy uranium off of Amazon.com.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.940
It's like 30 bucks.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:08.940
Seriously.

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.340
Yeah, I thought they put him in my little hand.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.880
Rockwall, Texas.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.140
So if you live in Rockwall, you might want to make sure you don't live next door to this

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.580
guy, you know, just in case.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.020
And the only reason he got caught is because he's an idiot and blogged about it.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.700
You don't blog about it until you actually create a nuclear reactor.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:31.060
Then that's when you blog about it.

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.340
I agree with SSJ 100 Matt saying in chat, leave the experiments to Mr. Wizard and Bill

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.340
Nye.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.140
Except Mr. Wizard's dead, isn't he?

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.820
Zombie Mr. Wizard.

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.820
There it is.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:43.820
There it is.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:50.740
This other one was a 15-year-old who had another building that he was building the nuclear

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.740
reactor in.

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:52.740
Wait for it.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:59.220
If he kills himself or gives himself radiation poisoning, he's going to blame it on Half-Life.

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.700
Games made him do it.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:08.500
The machine that he made only created enough energy to heat a cup of coffee, and the radiation

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.020
level was actually fairly safe.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020
That's what I need.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.180
A nuclear Hello Kitty coffee machine to keep my coffee warm.

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:22.260
But it was a 15-year-old using graduate level physics textbooks and used vacuum pump manufacturer

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.660
manuals and scoured the web for two times.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.300
Dude, the FBI shouldn't be going to this guy's house to bust the guy.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.020
They should be going to offer him a job.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.820
They should be freaking sending him to college.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.780
This guy's going to have all sorts of work coming towards him.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.100
With all this attention, he's going to be working in a university, so no time at all.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.620
We're looking at the next Doogie Howser of the physics world.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.620
All right.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.620
Well, here it is.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.780
Any other stories you want to share with us, Rusty, on YouTube?

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:51.940
Well, one other thing I wanted to talk about was the whole thing with EGM and the three

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.940
companies.

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.940
I'm going to be honest with you.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.980
I find it real hard to be sympathetic to the 1UP Network.

01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:04.060
The thing is with the 1UP Network is that, really, they're a little more than a tabloid.

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:09.580
It's not so much about delivering news and giving honest opinions as it is about being

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:10.980
sensational.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.300
I knew that word was going to come into play.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.100
I'm thinking in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, he's talking sensationalist, which I kind

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.100
of agree.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:24.040
Listen, I mean, you remember after Gerstmann got fired, the whole thing with the protest

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.140
in front of the CNET building?

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:29.420
You know, I don't believe that they're sensationalist.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.620
It's not like they come to press events drunk.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.620
Oh, wait, no, no.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.620
They do.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.620
I'm safe.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.620
Yes, they do.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.620
They do their podcast drunk.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:40.620
What are you talking about?

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.100
To be fair, we have two, but you know.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.840
Yeah, but also, we don't get paid.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.300
Nobody pays us to do this program.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.780
We pay to do this program.

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.020
That's how sick we are.

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.020
You know what I mean?

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:54.220
But I was about to say, you guys are a bunch of amateurs in a garage.

01:20:54.220 --> 01:21:00.460
These guys are supposed to be professionals, and they are the least professional outfit

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.460
in the entire gaming big review industry.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:06.260
And you see it in their reviews.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.140
They go out of their way to be negative.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:12.700
You look at, particularly in the EGM, the thing that got Ubisoft mad was the fact that

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.260
quite frankly, they were unfair about Assassin's Creed.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.820
They wanted, I can only assume that they wanted to make Assassin's Creed an example so they

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:23.900
could say, hey, look how negative we can be, we're not like GameSpot.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:24.900
Interesting perspective.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.820
You know, I feel uneducated on the matter because again, I don't really read a lot of

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.820
these sites.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.820
I really don't.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.980
Like, I know people might think I sit here and bash on them, but like secretly I'm like

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.700
watching every move they make.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.700
But I just don't.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.540
I don't, I'm too busy playing the games to read other people's thoughts on them.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:46.000
You know, I actually, this is a little off topic, but IGN did, lately their thing is

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.620
they've been reviewing some of the Destiny games, the data design stuff, you know, the

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.340
absolute shit on, you know, the Wii.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.980
And we know they're crap, but they did, for example, a review for Ninja Bread Man, and

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:02.360
of course it got a really low score, and then they did a video review for it.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:08.020
But the thing is, and I understand that the game's crappy, but the video review was literally

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020
a minute long.

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.540
He's like, okay, what can I say about this game?

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.640
It has platforms and jumping.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.920
That's about it.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.340
And that was the end of the video review.

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:20.740
It's like, seriously, don't fucking post a video review if that's what you're gonna do.

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:21.740
Take it seriously.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.940
Even though the game is crap, you gotta point out, you can do it funny, but point out why

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.380
it's crap instead of saying, well, you guys won the video review, so I did win it for

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.380
you.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:31.380
I mean, that's stupid.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:37.860
Yeah, now that you're talking about that, you know, not enough people are doing good,

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:38.860
funny reviews.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.060
I mean, you remember the old Alex Avar review for Big Rigs?

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.260
I mean, that was hilarious.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.620
What about the kid from Zero Punctuation, is it?

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.620
Oh, I love that kid.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:51.620
He's awesome.

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.740
That's what we need to see more of.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:59.180
I mean, if people would do more witty reviews, you wouldn't see this obsession over the score.

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:00.900
People would actually stick around for the content.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.700
But has that guy ever done a positive review?

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.820
I mean, isn't that kind of the joke, that all his reviews like tear apart the games?

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:07.820
He likes Pagle.

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.820
He likes Pagle.

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.820
He likes Psychonauts.

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:14.540
He generally likes Assassin's Creed.

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.780
The thing is with him is that he'll point out, he looks at the games, he just looks

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.180
at the games to look at the games.

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:25.940
He's not, you know, the fact is, a lot of games have a lot of flaws, and that's fine.

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.820
I think as long as there's a balance to it.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:29.820
He tells it like it is.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.260
Like, I don't like the people who do nothing but negative reviews.

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:36.500
I mean, it's kind of like, okay, you know, haha, joke's over, you know, move on.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.500
Exactly.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500
Show us both sides.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.500
Be balanced.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.740
Well, I gotta wrap up, because we want to try and take one more call before we close

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740
the show tonight.

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.300
We've been going on a little while now, but any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.860
Embrace false idols.

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:49.860
Goodbye.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:50.860
Alright.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:51.860
Bye-bye.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:56.340
So, I guess RasteelUT is a big Britney Spears fan.

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.340
I don't know what to say.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.340
Alright.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.780
We'll take one more call if we have any time, or I'm sorry, if we have any more people who

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780
want to call in.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.500
Orange Launch Radio is our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.100
Meanwhile, any last minute stories while we wait for calls to come in?

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.860
I don't really have a last minute story, but the trailer they had for Condemned 2 had an

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.580
exploding baby in it.

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:21.140
So finally, my design comes to fruition, the Iraqi Suicide Babies.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.820
I'm so happy for you.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:29.180
Xenocore is reminding us that Zero Punctuation gave Portal a near-perfect review.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.220
I look forward to his reviews every week.

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.840
We literally stop working and go watch them whenever they get put online.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.340
Not that, you know, we get distracted easy or anything.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.420
Do you think someone's going to give him a TV show in 2008?

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.340
Um, no.

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340
Alright.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.700
One more call.

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.700
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.700
Who's this?

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.700
This is BT.

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.700
Hey, Dartetsuya.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:50.700
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.700
Oh, nothing.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:52.700
Not on call.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:53.700
Just chilling?

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.700
Listening to OLR?

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:55.700
Yeah.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700
Just chilling?

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.700
Oh, yeah.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:02.700
What do you think about some of the gaming news we've been talking about this week?

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.700
Pretty interesting.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.020
That's right.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.020
Interesting stuff.

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.540
Pretty good stuff, yeah.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.980
What are games you've been playing this week?

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:19.660
Well, actually there was this freeware game I downloaded called La Mulana.

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.700
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.700
I have not.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.180
Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:28.460
Well, basically it's like an adventure game.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:36.260
I guess it's like a tribute to all those old MSX-type games that when you go around and

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.780
you collect items and kill enemies, sort of like a Castlevania.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.980
A lot like Symphony of the Night, I think.

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:43.980
Oh, that's kind of cool.

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.980
MSX.

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.780
I haven't heard that system name in a long time.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.780
Yeah.

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.940
I'm looking at a post you made in our forums on the freeware game thread, and it looks

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:54.940
like you're...

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:55.940
Yeah, I updated it.

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.220
You call out a La Mulana, and you say it's an old-school-style adventure game designed

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.600
to look like an old MSX game.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.060
There's all sorts of craziness going on in it.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:06.900
A hidden mini-game that's a nod to both Snatcher and Tokimeki Memorial.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:09.220
That's pretty funny.

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:12.740
Additionally, you can pick up MSX ROMs along the way to use as power-ups.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:17.420
That's funny.

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.140
But the game is hard?

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.340
Oh, yeah.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.140
They don't give you any health or anything, I don't think.

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:26.140
So there's no cheat mode.

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.140
No help mode.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:31.380
No, I mean, there was a trick I learned at one of the...

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.340
There was this video walk-through.

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:38.860
There's a trick you can just teleport back to town and save it.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.860
So that might help.

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.860
Wow.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.860
This is a lot...

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:43.660
I'm looking at the site where this is posted.

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:47.300
It looks like somebody says it took 26 hours for him to get through the game.

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.300
That's crazy.

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.300
Oh, wow.

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.300
Yeah.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.460
Well, that is a labor of love right there.

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:55.820
It even kind of has a... it looks like an old-ass...

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:59.540
Oh, yeah, that totally looks like an old MSX game or an NES game.

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:00.540
Yeah.

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.540
Wow, that's cool.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.540
So check that out.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.540
It's called La Mulana.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.580
All right, well, Darktitsu, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.580
today?

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:08.580
No, not really.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.940
I think that's about it.

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:11.940
All right.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.940
So go play La Mulana.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:13.940
Go play some more.

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.940
Yeah.

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.940
All right.

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:16.940
Take care, buddy.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:17.940
You too.

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:18.940
All right, bye-bye.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.780
All right, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype line, so we want to go ahead and

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.780
end the show.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:27.100
And Tigerclaw in our chat is asking if we've seen the Zero Punctuation review on Silent

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.100
Hill Origin, which apparently he says that the whole series jumped the shark, and between

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:35.420
Silent Hill 4 and Origins, he doesn't want to play another Silent Hill game ever and

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.300
all this stuff, right?

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.580
Origins coming out in Plague Station 2 soon.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.500
I'm actually going to pick that up, because I didn't bother to get it on the PSP, because

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.420
I just can't see a scary game on the PSP, but I'll play it on PS2.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.820
They also have Twisted Metal head-on coming out on PS2 for 20 bucks.

01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.540
By the way, do you know what I found on the internets?

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:58.060
I actually found the soundtrack to Silent Hill Origins, and it's got some kick-ass music

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060
in it.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.060
Let me see.

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.660
Totally need to give that to me.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.060
I will totally give that to you.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.060
Let me see.

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.620
I'm going to play a little teaser for those of you guys listening, because there's some

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.620
really kick-ass songs.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.780
I mean, it's more Kiryamoka doing some great stuff.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.780
Let's see.

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:14.780
What was...

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.780
Oh, this song I think I liked.

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:19.020
Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you the name of it, because the songs aren't labeled, but

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.020
here's one.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:39.420
Just some classic Silent Hill stuff there.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:43.700
There's actually a soundtrack coming out in Japan, I believe, next week, so I'm sure there's

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.180
a lot of people that are going to be reporting that soon.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.780
Anyhow, let's see if there's any other last-minute stories.

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.780
Loki, I don't think you said you had anything else, right?

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.780
Nope.

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:52.780
Dark Soccer.

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:53.780
You got anything?

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.780
Nope.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.780
All good.

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.780
All right.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:57.780
Well, then we're good.

01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.780
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you tonight.

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.300
I like these cookies.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.140
My final thought is penguins are cute.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.700
Loki.

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.780
This game filler is pretty fun.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.660
All right.

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:14.140
Thank you guys, everybody, for tuning into our program and downloading us this week.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.940
Remember, if you like Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word.

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.820
Tell two people you know about our show or leave us a positive review on iTunes.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:26.540
We haven't had a positive review post on iTunes in a long time, so please send us one of those

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:30.980
or just tell people you know because we have to rely on word of mouth to get the word out

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:34.860
about our show because we're not backed by any big corporate website or any of that stuff,

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:40.040
so it's really the fans that make this all possible, and to that we say thank you.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.580
Because we're so happy that you guys love us, we'll do this all again next week.

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.940
Sound like a plan?

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:45.940
Okay.

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.220
So next week, by the way, is a three-day weekend.

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:49.220
I know.

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:52.180
So you never know what kind of chaos might break out on a three-day weekend.

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.380
If I've got someone to come pick me up, oh hell yeah.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.380
Oh hell yeah.

01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:00.340
It's on next weekend and just in time for the return of the webcam, hopefully, too.

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.260
So all right.

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.380
Tune in next week.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.020
Same bat time, same bat channel.

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.020
See ya.

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.020
