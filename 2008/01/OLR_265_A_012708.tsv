17007	25460	Fox News ruffles the feathers of the gaming community Sega Master System games are poised to make a comeback and is the Gizmondo about to be revived?
31804	32184	I'm here!
52964	53824	DarkSakura.com
81411	82412	Hello, how are you?
83752	85233	I am fine, how are you doing, Chris?
86854	87294	I'm okay.
88314	100420	I'm now, I've had coffee with lots of sugar, and before that we had frozen yogurt with lots of sugar, so I'm getting ready to blow.
100540	101161	You're happy!
102057	107161	Now, if I'm not mistaking, this may very well be your last appearance on Orange Launch Radio for a little while.
107301	110163	I mean, not like ever, ever, but for a little while, right?
110183	121010	I'm going to desperately, desperately try to come back here because I've been in, for those of you who do not know, I've been going back and forth from L.A.
121150	127955	to my home in the South Bay, Los Gatos, because my grandfather was diagnosed with...
129974	135818	and I've been kind of being their chauffeur to whatever it is they need and stuff like that.
135858	139321	So I've kind of been their little slave, which I don't mind.
139561	142203	But sorry to hear about the family circumstance.
142263	143063	It's rough, I know.
143484	144484	It's hard, but you know what?
144584	146466	People are old and that kind of stuff happens.
146546	152049	So I've been going back and forth and I'm also moving to...
153798	160142	Madison, Wisconsin, and March, if all goes according to plan, for school, and I have a girlfriend there, so, pluses.
160242	169387	And it's gotta be someone very special to get you to move from sunny, warm, wonderful California to, oh my fucking lord, it's cold, Wisconsin.
170168	172809	No, no, the accent is kind of like this, you know.
172829	175431	Awesome.
175551	177372	Oh, you gotta get yourself one of those, that.
178621	179782	Well, you kids have fun.
180062	182063	I know you guys are going to have a lot of fun together.
182103	183964	But I'm going to be trying to come back more and more.
183984	184305	You better.
184425	187126	Because, actually, we got a new addition to the family.
188087	188207	Oh.
188727	189228	Oh, really?
189668	189788	Oh.
190088	192530	My dad's girlfriend gave birth to a little girl.
193210	193390	Oh.
193891	194631	On the 17th.
194691	196292	You've got to come visit your little sister once in a while.
196452	196733	Yeah.
197013	197273	All right.
197393	200975	So she's adorable and crying and driving her mother up the wall.
201536	203397	That takes a whole lot, doesn't it?
203477	203657	Yeah.
204241	209545	Going back to games and gaming type conventions for a little bit, are you going to be going to the Chicago convention this year, Asen?
209665	209925	I am.
209965	210626	I'm going, Asen.
210906	214509	You know, actually, some of our listeners are really trying to get us to go, and I'm going to try to make it happen.
214529	215369	Good!
215389	216930	Yeah, I definitely will come.
217051	218592	Well, I'll have an apartment, so you guys are willing to stay.
218612	219412	We'll have a pillow fight.
219592	219973	It'll be fun.
221753	222353	All right.
223313	224374	There you go.
224394	226674	The official OLR Battle Royale pillow fight.
226814	231375	I was actually going to try and get a press pass to see if I can do some interviews for you guys.
231395	233475	I had a really cool idea, which I want to discuss with you later.
233836	235956	But for those of you who are going to ASUN, I will be there.
235976	243978	I'll be at the art table with my girlfriend Megan and a bunch of other really awesome artists that are going to show up.
244358	244678	Awesome.
245038	245818	Yeah, so look for me.
245958	247218	I mean, I'll have blue hair and stuff.
247698	248499	I'm very easy to spot.
250874	252355	All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.
252375	257840	We haven't introduced the one and only, let me switch mics with him so he has his normal back, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
258361	258601	Hi.
259061	259662	How you doing, Loki?
259902	260142	Good.
260343	261203	I finished the sandwich.
261624	266628	Sorry I ignored you for a little bit there, but you know, lesbians cater a little more to our demographic than you do.
266668	266889	I know.
267969	268490	I'm just kidding.
269090	270432	Where would we be without Loki?
270492	270852	Come on.
271132	272514	Loki's a very important part of this show.
272614	273434	You having a good week, Loki?
274235	275036	I had an okay week.
275538	276778	Perfect World
305686	318796	Free play, free download, and according to her, it takes everything, and this is her perspective, took everything she hated about World of Warcraft and everything she hated about Guild Wars and removed them and combined the best parts.
318977	319437	Interesting.
319477	321018	Do you have any examples, like what types of things?
321839	322419	I don't know.
322499	323200	She was really drunk.
324421	324701	Okay.
325321	328864	Well, you'll know more about it when you're able to get in there.
328904	329625	It was really nice.
329685	334709	On top of that, you get certain wear classes, get like pets and like flying pets.
335302	336563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
363240	364221	Rob, you have to watch Torchwood.
364341	365942	It's the hottest show on TV.
389437	392319	Like, you realize that this is a Doctor Who spinoff, right?
392519	392799	No, I do.
392839	393280	That's what I said.
393320	394901	I was like, you know, it's like a Doctor Who spinoff, right?
395741	398463	I said, I said, one of my friend girls is like obsessed with this.
398483	400225	And they're like, oh, yeah, we like Doctor Who, too.
400505	401045	I was like, oh, cool.
401545	405148	If you take Torchwood and rearrange it, it spells Doctor Who.
406929	409211	Before we get to some more gaming weeks, I'm assuming you're all finished.
410191	410372	Yes.
410972	411272	All done.
411813	412013	Yes.
412253	413894	I just want to read some comments from the chat.
414394	414554	What?
414995	415395	Africa.
415955	417657	Chat.orangemonstradio.com.
420433	423255	TigerClaw asks, Sky, next week is the Super Bowl.
423995	425876	Will there be a show by then?
426817	428938	Damn right there's going to be a show during the Super Bowl.
429138	431520	I could care less about the Super Bowl.
431580	434402	So absolutely we'll be doing a show because you know what?
434502	437804	I think some folks out there would like to have some alternative programming to the Super Bowl.
437824	438584	So you know what?
438704	439104	There you go.
442306	443247	We have the Puppy Bowl.
443962	444863	Yes, we do have the Puppy Bowl.
444883	446264	And don't they have the Kitty Bowl usually, too?
446404	452467	They're doing a $25 sushi buffet at the place on that day, and I'm thinking about going.
452808	454128	Nice, nice.
454169	454729	Let's see.
455910	456270	What else?
456910	457671	Other comments from chat.
457711	457951	Let's see.
457971	461953	Tiger Claw, just heard that Black Wolf is going to do his show on Saturday next week to the Super Bowl.
461993	462714	Well, that's Black Wolf.
463074	463715	That's Bobby's project.
463735	464835	He likes sports, though.
464875	465676	Yeah, Bobby can watch it.
465696	466256	Just like my roommate.
466276	469158	I'm sure my roommate's going to have some guys over here watching the Super Bowl.
469198	470519	We'll be out here doing our nerdy show.
471147	471968	Alright, let's get back to games.
472728	473649	Loki, how was your gaming week?
474069	478091	My gaming week was pretty much just burnout paradise.
479532	481914	I played countless hours of it.
482034	488598	Actually, it's not countless because I took a look at my stats there and I actually have ten and a half hours put into it.
489198	490239	But it's awesome.
490459	492701	You keep finding new things in there.
492801	496343	Actually, I found quite a bit of the hidden stuff.
497464	498865	I have almost all the jumps done and
500438	519877	About half the billboards and half the smashes And I'm working to get my class A license And haven't played online yet Because the servers were giving me crap earlier this week So I just kind of avoided them But I may try some online stuff a little later Huh, it's fun though
520350	521611	Are you going to play me online?
521911	522772	Because I got my copy.
522972	523392	Yeah, sure.
523712	525113	You'll kill me, but that's alright.
525333	525914	No, it'll be fun.
526114	529396	There's a lot of stuff you can do, like co-op, challenges and stuff.
529856	531317	So, that might be fun.
531897	535399	And then I got a Vectrex.
535599	538341	That's right, you won the Vectrex that you were talking about last week, huh?
538401	538641	Yes.
538761	539342	How did that go?
539802	540362	It went okay.
541784	545106	I have it on my desk now, and people are like, oh my god, I remember that!
546567	550969	And, you know, to be honest, it's just kind of a desk piece, you know, I don't really play much on it.
551950	554791	I did try, you know, some of the games that came with it.
554931	561475	Star Trek, the game, I understand it about as much as I understood it before, which is not very much.
563096	564216	I don't like that game at all.
564377	566017	I did play Frenzy, though.
566818	567638	I think it's called Frenzy.
567738	568699	No, Berserk, I'm sorry.
569359	570000	Same game, though.
570020	570580	Berserk.
571826	572667	Hyperchase Space Mines
594545	598627	Just to leave it at my desk and people can come by and take a look at it and have some sort of demo loop.
598867	603148	But none of those games ever had a demo loop and it also makes a really annoying buzzing sound.
603549	605429	So I was like, crap, I can't do that.
605529	607590	So I just turned it on when people wanted to take a look at it.
607890	610211	Also, one of the controllers is broken so I had to fix that.
610851	614032	But I can get a new controller for like $10 if I really want to.
614292	615693	They actually make quite a few games.
616233	618214	People are still making games for that system.
618354	618674	Really?
618994	619494	I had no idea.
619794	620935	All homebrew stuff, of course.
622175	623816	I mean, there's new carts coming out
624841	628923	as of last year still, so, I mean, that's kind of neat, I guess.
630344	633305	A complete waste of money, but it's neat, you know, nonetheless.
633965	634986	It's nice to have.
636486	638587	And then, let's see, what else did I get?
640888	647011	I haven't gotten it yet, but I have a copy of, God, I don't remember what it's called now.
647331	651793	It's one of the bit generation titles, but that one's coming.
651993	653154	Hopefully I get to play that this week.
654252	655513	and, uh, what else?
655713	662235	Oh, I got, I'm actually planning on selling my Sega Saturns because I found an emulator that works perfectly on my computer.
662995	664435	I didn't even know you had a Sega Saturn.
664675	665156	I have two.
665636	665916	What?
666396	666656	Yeah.
667176	667476	Wow.
668096	680000	Well, I bought them at a garage, or not a garage sale, at a Denios flea market because for some reason I wanted to play Panzer Dragoons Wii because I thought, oh my god, it was so awesome, I love that game.
680240	682761	And I went back and played it and I'm like, wow, this wasn't very good at all.
683703	684163	I hate that.
686124	688344	I need to get a stall and some other stuff.
688464	690724	But yeah, it's okay.
690824	696505	But since now that I have something that will actually play them on the PC, I don't really need them anymore.
696585	701966	So there's this local game shop, which I've been meaning to go to for weeks now, called Fair Game.
702366	707927	They carry all the vintage stuff, everything from the Vectrex up through PlayStation 3 stuff.
708208	710108	So hopefully they will...
711533	713534	Be able to, uh, I don't know, buy that.
713894	715054	And I do have games with it.
715294	718555	I don't remember which games, so I have like two copies of Madden 97 for some reason.
718895	727957	Like Bug 2, a Knights demo, and like some other stuff, Machine Head, and I don't know.
728497	730498	But, uh, I don't know, maybe I can put it on eBay though.
732418	732918	Cool, cool.
734319	736859	And, um, Saints Row, as usual.
737079	739860	Oh, and, I think I mentioned it, but not during the show.
740573	742335	My another 360 died.
742895	745217	My another another one red ringed.
745437	747959	Apparently I had one that was starting to freeze up on me.
747999	754004	So I figured, OK, I'm going to cut it off the pass and just put a new heat sink on it so that it'll work better.
754745	756226	Well, put the new heat sink on it.
756306	757547	Didn't really fix anything.
758128	764593	And so I tried pulling the heat sink off again and maybe applying a little more thermal grease on spots that may have missed some.
765073	767255	And there was a big empty spot on there.
767375	769377	So I went ahead and put some thermal grease on there.
770273	771554	Reset it all back on there.
772495	774136	And sure enough, it three rings on me.
774156	775156	So I'm like, crap.
776237	777938	And now I can't fix that one.
778519	781140	So I'm going to hit it with blunt objects until it works.
781661	784543	Or it won't work, and who gives a crap because I still have five.
785383	787865	But I wanted six because my boss wants to play again.
787905	792909	And we had someone else join us up when he was busy doing something else.
793009	794550	So now someone's taking his place.
795330	796491	But he wants to play again.
797672	797972	All right.
798601	799501	Oh, well, soon as you lose.
799541	800862	You always have busy gaming weeks.
801022	801902	You manage to play a lot.
802323	803423	I try.
803443	804323	Well, we play at work.
804463	805284	We play Saints Row.
805464	806024	Lucky you.
806044	807285	I wish I could play Xbox at work.
807345	814288	Lots of Saints Row and lots of Burnout Paradise because that game, you know, it's really crazy.
814428	820430	I thought this week I would have been playing some No More Heroes, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.
821030	821711	Not yet, but soon.
822431	826833	No, I don't know if I'm going to get around to it anytime soon either because next week is Smash Bros.,
828027	829648	Oh, the Japanese one, yeah.
829708	831390	Hopefully we'll have that.
831710	832170	Hopefully.
832270	833371	You've got to give us your thoughts.
833391	834652	All right, well, let's keep it moving.
834912	835632	Let's go over to Chris.
835733	838695	I don't know, Chris, if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week, but let's hear it.
839615	843878	Well, aside from playing WoW, which I seem to be doing on a regular basis now.
843898	845199	Addict.
845940	846280	Shut up.
846320	847981	No, I have no room to talk whatsoever.
848021	852584	Yeah, I heard you just got a 70, so... I wouldn't say just got, but yeah.
852844	853265	Oh, okay.
853305	854786	Well, you know, I've been kind of out of it, so...
855273	856234	Playing World of Warcraft.
856414	858315	I have a character up to level 24 now.
858375	859875	Rock.
860596	861456	Hey, everybody start somewhere.
861476	862477	But you're a Draenei, huh?
863557	865458	No, I'm actually, I don't have.
866139	871601	I've just now started getting into, because Megan is starting to play, and she's got all of her friends playing.
871981	873882	And all of them have, like, epics.
874463	874663	Oh, wow.
874743	877424	And I'm learning now what they're learning.
877584	879505	So I'm, like, hearing all this shit, like, farm it.
879545	880606	It's like, oh, I'm farming.
880966	882627	I didn't know for the longest time what that meant.
883280	884962	That's all, you gotta start somewhere.
884982	887304	Yeah, I gotta, you know, because I was just a casual player.
887464	893309	I don't go, like, for hours on end, you know, just playing, and I'm like, shut up.
895071	906401	I don't need to look more like a noob than I already am, but it was, you know, so I just finally, you know, I'm starting to get more into it, but I don't have, like, a main.
906462	907843	So wait, do you hoarder alliance now?
908724	908984	Both.
909431	909691	Both?
909951	911732	I don't have a main, I just switch back and forth.
911772	912132	Horde is better.
912152	913473	You need to make your main a horde.
913793	917834	Well, Megzi's main is a gnome, so to play with her... Oh my god!
917854	918315	Shut up!
918375	933480	To play with her, I made a gnome, but the problem is that I'm like ten levels lower than her, so playing with her in that is kind of stupid, so I keep making more characters to try and play with her because she keeps making more characters and it's just not working.
934081	934641	But, um...
935526	941230	But yeah, aside from that, I did a lot of D&D stuff, so that makes me happy.
941871	942251	Cool.
942391	944613	Yeah, I have to... Old school kind of gaming.
945093	964348	Yeah, I've got like maybe four or five friends in LA that have always, have like, oh, we need to run a game, we need to run a game, and so I finally caved in and started making an adventure, because I don't like all the new, the pre-made ones, so I've been working on that a lot, and I freaking am annoyed at 4th edition that's coming out, but
964969	965389	I don't like it.
965489	966509	And people need to make me happy.
966529	967130	Because I'm important.
967150	967350	Thank you.
985928	986288	I hope so.
986428	988209	Yes, you may, Rob.
988330	991732	My gaming week, I actually took a little bit of a break from WoW.
991752	996194	I mean, I've been playing some, but I went back to another type of RPG that I just missed.
996254	1003179	I haven't touched it in a while, and I decided to go back and play some Oblivion because I love that game because you can just run around and do nothing.
1003479	1005060	It's the Seinfeld of video games.
1006040	1009863	I mean, if you want to ignore the main plot and just do whatever you want, you can.
1009923	1010623	It's beautiful.
1010763	1012104	I noticed you playing that this week.
1012184	1012404	Yes.
1012945	1023371	And I decided last time I did a fighter type, so this time I went like, I just went all out mage because I'm having a lot of fun summoning creatures to do my bidding and throwing fireballs at people.
1023431	1023772	It's great.
1023812	1026313	Even though I can't do damage for crap, so like if I get attacked, I'm screwed.
1026734	1028995	But, you know, I create an army to go after people.
1029055	1029495	It's awesome.
1029675	1030456	I love Oblivion.
1030756	1035119	I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V. I never get past the towns because I'm too busy, you know,
1035729	1039695	Violating the animals, punching the horses so they get pissed off.
1040596	1043360	Apparently the townsfolk don't look too kindly upon that.
1044608	1045288	It's still fun.
1045589	1046929	Otherwise, not a whole lot.
1046949	1049611	There's pretty much just been that has taken up a lot of my gaming week.
1049631	1052332	I just had this random oblivion splurge.
1052953	1055134	But I have been playing Burnout Paradise a little bit.
1055214	1062178	Not enough to give a full review on just yet, but I do notice it's kind of like Test Drive and Burnout mixed together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
1062478	1062958	It's different.
1063358	1063919	It's a little different.
1063979	1064259	I don't know.
1064279	1066400	I kind of like the structure of the old Burnout games.
1066440	1069161	I'm not sure how I feel about this whole open world thing.
1069202	1071763	It's a little weird, but I'm giving it a shot.
1072748	1075449	I haven't taken it online either, which I hear is the best part, so we'll wait.
1076390	1080031	I do find it interesting, though, that it interacts with the camera to, like, take your picture and stuff.
1080051	1081732	That's kind of strange.
1082512	1082752	All right.
1083373	1089315	Anyhow, let's talk a little bit about housekeeping, and then we are going to get into tonight's gaming news.
1090336	1095578	Tonight in housekeeping, just a reminder, we are now broadcasting simulcasting on Justin.TV.
1095938	1098619	So a big hello to all the people who are watching us right now on Justin.TV.
1098659	1099700	Our Justin.TV channel is...
1100400	1103863	www.justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio
1121906	1125610	But JustinTV is interesting because you can kind of see us even when the mics aren't hot, so it's kind of fun.
1126891	1128713	So there's that over at JustinTV.
1128873	1133138	Also, next week on the show, an Orange Lounge Radio first.
1133318	1140605	And actually, what may be, I'm not sure, I don't want to stake the claim to this, but what may be a video game podcast first, actually.
1141106	1142948	Next week on the show, we are going to have...
1143579	1146140	And killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire
1172851	1181416	So we found out she was local to us, so we sent her an email and said, Hey, this might seem a little random, but do you want to come on our little podcast and sing the song for us?
1181717	1182677	And she said, sure!
1183278	1186900	So she's going to be here next week doing her cover of Still Alive, live here in studio.
1186960	1189942	It's OLR first musical guest, and we're very excited.
1189982	1193504	She's going to be a guinea pig for that whole thing.
1193804	1195265	So it's cool, and we're very excited.
1195905	1199908	Alright, so she'll be here in studio next week, and...
1200809	1201929	and as will the rest of us here.
1201949	1203870	I don't know if we have any other guests scheduled for the next few weeks.
1203890	1206050	Are we going to get the chocolate rain guy at some point?
1206070	1207670	We're not going to get the chocolate rain guy.
1207690	1213351	She's the YouTube celeb we're going to get in the studio and then we've got to look for people from other places.
1213611	1214131	So there you have it.
1215131	1218012	Yeah, one day I want Dragon Force here in the studio.
1218392	1219432	That's the ultimate dream.
1222293	1222533	I will.
1222553	1225813	You'll fly in from... Yeah, that's right.
1227654	1229094	That would be so complete.
1229334	1229894	That's like a
1230302	1231743	See you at our Wayne's World right there.
1231823	1232323	For real.
1232423	1232884	For real.
1233364	1233684	All right.
1234545	1234825	Anyhow.
1234925	1238027	Now, why is the chat room saying they should get the Chocolate Rain guy?
1238087	1238247	Why?
1238487	1241129	What the hell does the Chocolate Rain guy have to do with video games?
1241169	1241609	I mean, come on.
1241629	1245371	Amixia sings about, you know, she does a cover of Still Alive.
1245411	1246492	She's video game related.
1246532	1248293	Chocolate Rain has nothing to do with video games.
1248833	1249193	Actually.
1249253	1249914	But it is funny.
1250254	1251695	I will say this, I will say this.
1252035	1259818	An old friend of Orange Lounge Radio is experiencing a little bit of internet fame of his own, I guess speaking of people who have said they will come on the show.
1260258	1263740	He did a remix of this guy from American Idol.
1264040	1265620	Rinaldo LaPaz was his name.
1265960	1268822	He did this song called We Are Brothers Forever, and it was kind of one of those things you laugh.
1269082	1273924	Well, this kid Justin, who we knew from like years ago playing DDR, he did a remix of it.
1274544	1276925	My father still be here.
1281721	1285903	This has nothing to do with video games, but you can't help but admit that thing's got to be DDR inspired.
1285943	1287984	Well, he did that, and I emailed him.
1288004	1289444	I'm like, dude, when are you going to come on the show again?
1289464	1290505	You're, like, famous and stuff.
1290525	1291165	You've got to come back.
1291445	1295667	He said he would come back and talk games with us and maybe show us some more remixes.
1295727	1296107	Who knows?
1296287	1298328	I ran into him in a line for a movie.
1298548	1298848	Really?
1298908	1299689	A few weeks ago.
1299889	1302290	No, like a couple months ago, but I don't remember what movie we were seeing.
1302790	1303030	Nice.
1305871	1306152	All right.
1306192	1309553	So anyhow, lots of things to look forward to on Orange Lounge Radio coming up.
1310962	1312543	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
1312623	1317126	Loki, please take us to video game chat, because obviously we're having problems with that tonight.
1317526	1325391	Alright, well, there's a big old stink this week having to do with Fox News and Mass Effect.
1325611	1338079	Apparently they aired a little segment called Sex Box, and they were talking about how Mass Effect featured full digital character nudity and had explicit sex and all this stuff.
1338499	1339740	And of course, you know,
1341304	1343785	Anyone that's played Mass Effect knows that that's completely false.
1344625	1347345	But nonetheless, though, they were on there.
1347686	1357908	They actually had a, I don't know, an expert, I'd say a psychology expert or something, who was kind of pimping out her book.
1358708	1366030	And at the same time, also in defense, they had Jeff Knightley, who was basically from EA.
1366070	1367070	Isn't it Jeff Keighley?
1367110	1368010	Keighley, Knightley, whatever.
1368030	1369171	Knightley is Kira Knightley.
1369251	1370351	She's Pirates of the Caribbean.
1370411	1370771	Jeff Keighley.
1371331	1373072	Caribbean, Caribbean, whatever.
1374853	1377134	Orange Lounge Radio, we pronounce stuff good.
1377154	1380155	I learned it how to read.
1380295	1381996	I learned it on Orange Lounge.
1383277	1392041	Anyways, so all you need to know is that basically they went back and forth for about 30 seconds talking about this game.
1392581	1399064	The psychologist and the host hadn't played the game, but yet they were still claiming all this stuff.
1399986	1406511	So anyways, as the week progressed, I went kind of crazy.
1406731	1410974	First, EA was saying they're pissed off that all this stuff was said.
1411294	1412976	This is complete outright lies.
1414057	1422883	They want a correction from Fox to basically fess up to not having played the game and just making up lies off the cuff.
1423484	1423804	So...
1424929	1434598	of course Fox said no we're not going to do a correction but hey you can come on to one of our shows again and to which basically they said fuck off
1436724	1444027	Anyways, apparently the woman, of course, the psychologist, she has a book called The Cult of Perfection, and it happened to be on Amazon.
1444348	1447929	Well, gamers got pissed off, and they, of course, realized, hey, her book's on there.
1448269	1456173	And so they left her a bunch of negative reviews, clearly stating that they had not read her book, but that it's inappropriate for minors.
1457174	1457934	Here's the thing that got me.
1460395	1461316	It's not that funny, Chris.
1462407	1465169	All those negative reviews have been removed, the ones that gamers left.
1465229	1465369	Right.
1486847	1488968	What's left, though, is still negative reviews.
1489288	1490589	They weren't good to begin with.
1490769	1492550	Well, here's the thing.
1492830	1499454	I actually started reading some of the book, and as I'm reading it, I'm going, why was she invited to talk about video games?
1499894	1502616	Her book has nothing to do.
1503056	1506318	I mean, if you're going to bring on someone to dog video games, fucking...
1506838	1513124	You know which attention whore whose initials start with J and T will be there at the drop of the hat to come talk about video games and bash them.
1513164	1513544	Come on.
1513965	1514925	At least call him.
1515306	1515646	I'm sorry.
1515966	1519870	He was too busy chasing an ambulance, you know, so... Apparently.
1519890	1520390	I don't know.
1520630	1522652	Anyways, so, you know, like I said...
1523893	1526614	They trashed her book on Amazon, or all of her books.
1526715	1528635	Apparently she has a few books, and they all suck.
1529156	1533458	Including, Ben there done that, kept the jewelry, and the fixer-upper man.
1533678	1536619	Which is talking about how all men are fixer-uppers.
1537960	1540481	Yeah, she's awesome.
1540581	1543923	I gotta wonder, I mean, don't get me wrong, she is pretty hot.
1544543	1545323	So I'll give you that.
1545724	1546344	She is pretty hot.
1547356	1547796	I'm sorry.
1548076	1548717	No, she's not.
1548857	1553659	She's got a fucked up nose, and she's got that pose that looks like it's post-metapause.
1554960	1555860	Okay, whatever, okay?
1555940	1558341	Well, she's a deranged woman.
1559102	1562883	Anyways, so... She clearly sounds retarded.
1563004	1564844	To be fair, I don't know if you're going to cover this.
1565005	1566105	Maybe I'm cutting you off.
1566145	1566505	I don't care.
1567146	1568586	She retracted her statement.
1568626	1570427	She retracted... I was just getting there.
1571568	1576450	Anyways, the author, Cooper Lawrence, did retract her statement saying that
1577200	1591888	Uh, you know, I, she really regrets that, seeing that, and now seeing, seeing the game's, uh, sex scenes, seeing it's kind of a joke, you know, she's seeing more explicit sexual content on Lost than, um, you know, this game, so.
1592068	1597811	Or other Fox programming, such as 24, Family Guy, which had a whole thing about side boob, if I remember right.
1597871	1600072	I mean, I, it's my side boob.
1600713	1601433	Anyways, um.
1602301	1604602	That's all you see in Mass Effect is a little side boob.
1604662	1605062	Come on.
1605282	1612624	And then, of course, not to be left out, Adam Sessler actually gave his opinion on the whole thing, and I thought he actually phrased it quite well.
1613945	1618346	Plus one respect from me for him.
1618566	1620026	From one nerdy white guy to another.
1620266	1620827	Exactly.
1623707	1627409	Usually I think he's kind of a tool, but actually, he wasn't bad.
1629349	1629669	I don't know.
1629729	1631930	I think he made his point quite nicely, and
1632520	1633621	and DarkSakura.com.
1656451	1658934	Fair and balanced, my big fat ass.
1659114	1660015	I mean, come on.
1660195	1661456	This isn't even a political thing.
1661476	1663898	This has nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal.
1664119	1668203	This is just about, that was the most piss-poorly researched thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.
1668223	1669684	Did you see the roundtable discussion?
1669704	1670445	Oh, oh, oh my god.
1670565	1671225	Chris, any thoughts?
1674242	1676184	You know, I don't know if you'd already heard about this.
1676224	1677425	I posted this in my LJ.
1678046	1680268	And, you know, I posted the entire interview.
1680868	1685953	And it's just like the retardedness of these people just blew my head off.
1686073	1689416	You know, it's like they're like saying, God, I can't remember now.
1689816	1694540	You know, it's just like, you know, I don't want my child to have to be subject to this.
1694640	1698764	And like totally going off on, I don't remember what they said now.
1699264	1700085	But it was just like.
1700922	1707986	I just can't, I just, no, literally one of them was like, I just can't believe that we as parents have to monitor everything our children play.
1708506	1710447	Oh, God, yeah, exactly.
1710467	1717290	Here, I'll, I'll, I'll, I have this direct from my LJ, I'll just write, or I'll just read off kind of the part I said.
1719811	1727355	As for the Blom, Bimbo, I know being a parent is hard, and you just magically get pregnant and are forced to care for a baby that you had no responsibility in creating at all.
1728214	1756700	and there is all sorts of bad stuff coming from places like the interwebs and video games but do us all a favor and attempt to sound a little more mature when you say that simply monitoring what your child sees is a much harder job I know a lot of these adults are playing video games and stuff but you know when those adults are gone they're playing their parents' video games I'm like, why don't you fucking put the parental protection or codes and stuff on there
1757100	1757861	to fix that.
1758161	1763244	I mean, since you're aware that they're going to be playing your games, why don't you, I don't know, solve the problem?
1763325	1768328	It was just one of the most journalistically irresponsible things I've ever seen in my entire life.
1768508	1775193	And they should all be ashamed of themselves for having their names attached to that piece, except for Jeff Keighley, which, you know, obviously was the only one that knew what he was talking about.
1775493	1777254	The only one that knew anything about games, honestly.
1777274	1779616	I laugh when he's like, have you played this game?
1779876	1784920	Well, no, but I've watched videos on... He knew going in, he knew, well, to his credit...
1785360	1786442	Obviously, he's a smart guy.
1786742	1788785	He's a well-respected journalist in the industry and everything.
1788805	1793112	He probably knew going into this, he's like, Fox News wants me to talk about video games?
1793212	1794414	Yeah, I know what's going to happen.
1794774	1795135	He knew.
1795495	1797799	He knew somebody was going to come on there that didn't know their shit.
1797879	1798660	He had enough
1799170	1800390	Smart's to have the foresight.
1800410	1802891	I mean, you could tell that was his first question right out the gate.
1803351	1810853	Oh, and then my favorite, they're all, well, they're all, you know, finding the ratings is so hard, you know, you have to look on the back of the box and it's not there.
1811153	1812233	Actually, no, you're wrong.
1812573	1816354	It's on the front of the box and on the back of the box, so you're an idiot.
1817475	1822756	Whereas on a movie poster, it's a tiny little thing at the very bottom of the poster.
1822876	1823116	I mean...
1824273	1825774	And the ratings... But that's okay.
1825834	1827936	The ratings on movies are all on the back of the box.
1828276	1833380	Not one rating is on the front of the box unless it's, of course, pimping out that it's an unrated director's cut or something like that.
1833660	1840526	I think it's just disgusting and hypocritical when Fox Television runs all the stuff that's way more pornographic than Mass Effect could ever be.
1841487	1844269	Which is actually kind of a shame because Mass Effect should have been a little more pornographic.
1844509	1845510	But anyhow, it's beside the point.
1845830	1845950	But...
1847271	1850713	But Fox TV, like, you know, you see way worse things on there.
1851053	1858557	I swear to God, everybody involved from Fox News with that little piece needs to come on the TV and apologize for being an asshat.
1858657	1859698	I will accept nothing less.
1861479	1866201	I want that blondie to come out and say, I, blondie, apologize to the world for being an asshat.
1866882	1867502	That's what I want.
1869483	1870323	It'll never happen.
1870944	1871444	What was that, Chris?
1873223	1874885	I'm going to start studying psychology.
1874905	1876386	This is what I want to do with my life.
1876887	1879629	And I just love the psychologist that came on.
1879910	1882612	She was discussing the psychologies of...
1884570	1887652	All the, you know, children see this and they think it's real.
1887972	1888873	No, they don't.
1889794	1894536	Video games and any sort of entertainment, this does not count.
1894957	1902481	You know, if your child is going off and killing people because of video games, psychologically, that's not the video game's fault.
1902541	1904783	It's because your child is mentally unstable.
1905023	1906704	And guess whose fucking fault that is?
1907244	1907965	Your fault.
1908465	1909486	The parents' fault.
1909826	1911287	It all stems back from the parents.
1911647	1915050	You know, they were probably going through the first stage of development and they fucked up majorly.
1915690	1921175	So, you know, I just love it when these people sit there and tell you, it's like, you know, video games and all this stuff, it's...
1922701	1923602	It's hurting our children.
1924702	1930706	To be fair, there are mental conditions that could be, but that's usually outside the norm.
1931007	1935329	A lot of these kids on Maury Povich who are out of control and stuff, that's the parents.
1935509	1951520	That's again, if it is a psychological disorder that requires medication, again, I give that back to, yeah, that's not the parent's fault that their child is like that because there's a chemical imbalance that's going on, but the parent needs to be responsible enough
1952210	1957046	to understand that and take them to the proper doctors and explain to them the proper, you know...
1958136	1963781	It all stems back to your responsibility as a parent of what you want your child to see and do.
1964161	1967124	Alright, we've got to stop giving Fox News so much attention here on this program.
1967364	1969185	But I do want to respond to some stuff in chat here.
1969946	1971668	Chat.orangehauntradio.com, some comments.
1971708	1977252	Ross DLUT says, Sky, you have to understand that Fox News is struggling to get beyond its little niche of right-wing shitheads.
1977633	1980295	They're nothing more than a bottom-run cable networks.
1980615	1983157	Their ratings are probably lower than Lifetime and Spike.
1983758	1984038	I don't know.
1985739	1988740	Binary667 says, what do you have against Blondie?
1988760	1989881	That's some quality music.
1991201	1994683	Obviously when I say Blondie, I'm not saying Debra Harry has to come apologize.
1994703	1995423	She didn't do anything.
1996104	2000286	If Debra Harry has to apologize for anything, have her apologize for the Blondie Reunion album.
2000566	2001727	But anyway, that's besides the point.
2001747	2002547	You know who I'm talking about.
2002567	2003487	I'm not talking about Debra Harry.
2004328	2004708	Let's see.
2005348	2010491	Portal Combat says, Fox News, you are not the father.
2015888	2027932	Sadly enough, if there was an argument or something like on Springer or Moripovich or something like that, it would actually probably be more intelligent than what's on Fox News right now.
2029878	2035180	All right, we got to get back to some happier topics, things that won't make us so damn angry.
2035260	2040681	You know, if we hadn't have done this right out the gate, we'd probably be doing the FUs right about now, but we'll have to save those for later.
2040981	2042122	Let's talk about something happy.
2042342	2047343	Let's get some happy news here to make us forget this whole Fox debacle.
2047763	2050584	Rez HD, that's a nice happy subject, right?
2050604	2051424	You know what's even better?
2051864	2054805	Is that it is very possible this game is coming out this week.
2055125	2057406	Especially a lot of people seem to think so, are convinced.
2057933	2061034	I said it's going to come out this month, and I think this is the last week left.
2061134	2064775	There is that, and then also there was a quote from Q Entertainment.
2065075	2068096	Quote, the game is being prepped, and it's just waiting for the green light.
2068416	2069176	Maybe next week?
2069776	2073537	So in other words, basically, Q Entertainment is just saying, we're done.
2073978	2075538	It's there, waiting to go.
2075618	2077759	We're just waiting for someone at Microsoft to push the button.
2079164	2107445	that will be very happy when Rez HD I'll just, you know, I'll have that on my TV all the time and we'll never have a need to put my TV on Fox News ever again well I was reading, they had an interview with Mizuguchi about how to play it with the other controllers and stuff they said put one on your feet, put one on your back or something like that and I don't know what to do with the third one put it in a happy place put it in the spot that most suits you
2107967	2108828	Let's just leave it at that.
2108888	2109328	Right, Jamie?
2110829	2111690	I guess so.
2111910	2113171	Man, some people are desperate.
2113972	2118455	Anyway, there is a contest going on in the UK.
2119056	2126422	Microsoft is having some Halo fans to make videos about Master Chief in everyday situations that do not involve Halo.
2128564	2131666	And if they win, then they will be accepted.
2132367	2136350	Well, they will get to go to a film school for a month in L.A.,
2137045	2139486	for special lessons.
2141346	2149029	You can use a video camera, you can use the game itself, animation, however you want to do it.
2149149	2155331	It just has to be Master Chief in a situation apart from the Halo universe.
2156231	2157692	It's for European gamers over 18.
2158372	2162994	Submissions are to be in between January 31st and March 21st this year.
2164963	2166024	Here's an idea, kids.
2166324	2170145	And if you win with this idea, you only have to, you know, credit me.
2170826	2174087	Master Chief responding to this Fox News story.
2174888	2175348	Think about it.
2175388	2181431	Well, for anyone who's interested in it, it's Halo Recut is what the contest is called.
2182611	2187374	It's at xbox.com slash en-gb slash halorecut, all one word.
2188174	2189014	So if you want to check it out.
2189295	2190775	Well, I hope somebody we know wins it.
2191276	2192176	So good luck to all of you.
2192196	2193677	If you win it, send us an email.
2194037	2194217	Yes.
2196286	2197086	We'll interview you.
2198267	2207031	Another first-person shooter game that's pretty fun, Team Fortress 2 is going to be getting some unlockable weapons and new game modes pretty soon, which is pretty awesome.
2207891	2222957	One of the first earned weapons, I guess, is going to be for the medic, and it's an overhealer, which apparently I believe is a tool you can use to give a temporary boost to your other player's health up to 150%.
2224998	2230542	and this is also part of the balancing that Valve is doing.
2230922	2238527	They're also going to be talking about some other unlockable weapons, including a healing ray and some other stuff.
2239187	2246591	Also, they were going to be introducing a new map, Gold Rush, and there's going to be another one coming out as well called Badlands.
2246792	2250574	It's a remake, I guess, of an older map called Badlands.
2251327	2263836	and basically in Gold Rush the blue team must escort a mining cart through tunnels and the cart moves faster with the more blue team members nearby but stops completely if a red player gets near.
2265036	2265697	So that's kind of neat.
2265757	2269659	I like how they're mixing it up and supporting the game well after it's come out.
2271160	2271881	Looking forward to it.
2272882	2274803	That's always good to see a game get a lot of love and
2275222	2275642	Don't Laugh
2294842	2298764	But so when you actually point at the skeleton, it says Bunny's Skeleton.
2299084	2303266	Like almost like it was built so that at one point it was going to have a multiplayer environment.
2303366	2303806	You know what I mean?
2304187	2305827	Like why would it need to say it's my skeleton?
2305907	2307968	Couldn't it just say your skeleton or Conjured's skeleton?
2308008	2311230	Hell, they could just re-release the game with multiplayer built into it.
2311250	2312090	They probably will.
2312110	2315612	Kind of like how they do with like Twisted Metal, Black Online or something like that.
2315752	2321135	That might be how they try to hold us over for Elder Scrolls V. That'd be cool.
2321215	2321555	Who knows?
2322455	2322815	www.ihalostats.com
2352264	2355290	think of how awesome I'll be in bed think about it
2357466	2357926	Exactly.
2358206	2360227	But there's a little disclaimer right there on the website.
2360628	2365050	ihalostats.com is not affiliated with Bungie, LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2365070	2366611	So it is something completely fan-made.
2367151	2378677	And to their credit, you know what, even if I think this is a little, I don't know, useless, it's kind of cool in that, you know, hey, somebody had a weird idea and kind of built this whole thing, and it seems to run pretty well.
2378797	2384060	So props to them for seeing their strange idea through to completion, if that makes any sense at all.
2385081	2385361	I don't know.
2387424	2402693	Well, for more gaming news, for anyone who is a fan of Condemned, Condemned 2 comes out on March 11th, according to Sega, and it's gory and violent and weird.
2403073	2405695	Which means I'm going to go pre-order down right now, right?
2407436	2407716	I won't.
2408129	2410811	Actually, the first one was kind of, it was just freaky.
2410871	2413152	It's like a serial killer type game, you know?
2413332	2419636	Now that I think about it, we did start Condemned, but I don't think that after a little bit of it, I was too much into it afterwards.
2419776	2423339	All you need to know about Condemned 2, and I can sell it to you in one sentence.
2423419	2423939	Meat hooks.
2424519	2426441	It has exploding babies.
2430123	2430823	You know what, Loki?
2430843	2432104	That might have done it, actually.
2432144	2433305	That's pretty awesome.
2433345	2434226	Exploding babies?
2434406	2436427	I'm just looking at this picture of a guy with a meat hook.
2438888	2439829	Why is it a boom?
2442551	2443672	Why are they exploding?
2444773	2445354	I don't know.
2445734	2447595	Somebody exploded them?
2447696	2447956	I don't know.
2447996	2448716	How old are they?
2449337	2450678	Well, they're babies, I mean.
2451359	2451899	Chris.
2451919	2453981	I'm sorry.
2454281	2463129	I just came from a household where there was just a weak old infant in my arms holding these exploding babies.
2463709	2464090	Shut up.
2464130	2464670	Don't judge me.
2464690	2466191	Well, at least it wasn't ticking.
2466432	2466612	Here's...
2468137	2469097	Here's my advice, Chris.
2469177	2470178	Don't play Condemned 2.
2470218	2472519	There's plenty of other video games out there for your enjoyment.
2472779	2474920	Why don't you play?
2474980	2476321	Here, Chris, I want you to go get a game.
2476381	2478141	It's called Imagine Babies.
2478341	2479582	I have it in my backpack.
2481183	2486645	It's nothing but happy babies, rainbows, diaper changing.
2486765	2487806	I don't know.
2490147	2491687	It's all the glory of having babies.
2491707	2495249	That's the first time I changed a diaper in my life and I really enjoyed it.
2496129	2497750	That's a different type of exploding baby.
2498769	2499990	I'm breaking out the DS right now.
2500010	2501010	Yeah, it's not like that.
2503071	2505032	All right, Condemned 2, now with exploding babies.
2505112	2505952	Enjoy, March 11th.
2506732	2511034	Well, there's another game I'm looking forward to, far more than Condemned 2.
2511374	2524520	Of course, that would be Grand Theft Auto 4, and the announcement that it was actually coming out this spring instead of the end of this year, or possibly not this year, that's just all sorts of awesome.
2525320	2526761	It's dated now for April 29th.
2528233	2535840	and it will be coming out of course on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well as a special edition which I already have pre-ordered and I can't wait.
2536601	2550073	The other thing though, Rockstar was commenting on why it's been delayed and they said of course one of the contributing factors was that they had some technical challenges with the PlayStation 3 version.
2550854	2553555	and of course they wouldn't go into what the challenges were.
2554096	2558798	They said it's not an issue anymore because both versions are now neck and neck in their development phases.
2558878	2563340	We were just having problems getting the hookers just right in the PlayStation 3 version.
2565982	2572525	They basically said it's really no surprise to anyone that the PS3 was definitely a contributing factor to the delay.
2573625	2575767	I have to go back to the last story because this is too good.
2575827	2582552	In our chat room, Ekam, which is just Mike spelled backwards, says, Imagine Exploding Babies coming to a DS near you.
2584474	2587577	By the way, Exploding Babies are in the trailer for the game.
2587737	2591640	So watch the trailer for the game and you will see the Exploding Babies.
2592200	2593942	Chris, don't watch the trailer for Condemned 2, please.
2594062	2595463	Oh my god, this is too cute.
2596284	2598405	You're actually playing Imagine Babies here in studio?
2598625	2599026	Yeah.
2599206	2600927	Oh my god, get that filth out of my house.
2602709	2602969	All right.
2603120	2604761	You need to play Loki.
2604801	2605441	He gave it to me.
2605721	2606942	You know what you should be playing?
2607002	2612245	DarkSakura is a wonderful game on Xbox Live called Every Extend to Extra Extreme.
2612705	2615027	That game is pretty awesome, and it's on PSP as well.
2615287	2623091	The only gripe I have with the Xbox Live one is that the game doesn't get a whole lot of variety in it in the basic modes.
2623451	2627954	It doesn't have quite the same hypnotic backgrounds that the PSP one had in the...
2628294	2629775	The skins don't change that much.
2629915	2636039	But to make up for that lack of variety, to Q Entertainment's credit, they have the custom tracks mode in the game.
2636059	2637300	And I think a lot of people forget about this.
2637320	2640742	You can actually play Every Extent Extra Extreme with your own custom tracks.
2641542	2644885	And, well, the problem with the mode this week is that it wasn't perfect.
2645225	2651969	You can either manually put in the BPM or you can tap it out to get the beats per second or beats per minute or what have you.
2652389	2654751	But you couldn't exactly fine-tune it.
2655271	2661632	Until now, Q Entertainment has released a code that will allow you to make a fine adjustment to your custom music.
2661692	2663713	And you better write this one down because it's very complicated.
2663733	2665193	It's a very complicated code to remember.
2665233	2665933	Okay, here you go.
2666293	2667094	So this is the code.
2667394	2671434	At the start menu, you're going to use the left and right triggers to put in this code.
2671475	2671815	Here it is.
2671875	2672595	Get your pencils ready.
2673255	2673595	Here it is.
2674215	2683157	Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.
2684330	2685111	Think you can handle that?
2685831	2686392	Alright, there you go.
2686412	2686732	Wait, wait, wait.
2687553	2688354	What was after left?
2689214	2689494	Right.
2689775	2690015	Okay.
2692057	2692657	So there it is.
2693758	2703586	So you can just have a Q Entertainment overload this week if you want to do this fine-tuning mode and then res HD and hell, you can play 99 Nights while you're at it if you want to play a bad Q Entertainment game.
2704878	2706039	Night and Nights wasn't that bad.
2723635	2726657	They need to stick to the puzzle music games.
2727017	2728738	Do not deviate from the puzzle music games.
2729018	2733200	Although, can you imagine if 99 Nights had some sort of musical beat thing to it?
2733220	2735861	Just like, you know, Rez?
2736101	2741184	All you had to do, yeah, seriously, to make 99 Nights cooler, all you had to do was be slashing people to techno music.
2741204	2742464	And that would have been the coolest game ever.
2743565	2745546	Who wouldn't want to kill people to bad techno music?
2745586	2745846	Come on.
2745926	2747087	That would be pretty awesome.
2747127	2748948	Something mixing Dynasty Warriors with Rez.
2750467	2753250	Hello, I would totally play that.
2753490	2755752	Exploding babies in time with the music?
2755832	2757494	Come on, be fun.
2757534	2765622	That would be kind of wrong, but you know, if you want to be abstract, then sure, go the space draft route, you know.
2766564	2768105	They could do weasel stomping mode.
2768225	2770387	Son of Dad says, Gunpei is god.
2770487	2772909	That's one of the few Q Entertainment games I haven't played is Gunpei.
2772929	2773630	Gunpei is great.
2773690	2774571	I've heard it's pretty good.
2775031	2777873	Gerardimo says, Rob, don't forget Meteos Disney Magic.
2777913	2779234	That's worse than 99 Nights.
2779615	2782017	I enjoyed the original Meteos actually quite a bit.
2783298	2784158	I didn't play the Disney one.
2784179	2785119	Did you play Disney Meteos?
2785820	2790063	I've seen it been played before, but I thought it was cute.
2790103	2794347	But I'm a Disney freak, so look at my online screen named Disney Punk 10.
2795228	2795588	Shut up.
2797890	2798230	Nerd.
2798591	2798851	All right.
2799411	2800592	How about some release dates?
2800612	2803774	Let's travel the globe and find out what's coming soon to a retail store near you.
2803814	2804455	We'll start with Europe.
2804715	2807537	Do you need release, Rob?
2808518	2809499	I don't know how to answer that.
2811020	2821347	How about on the 30th we get Chess Master Live on Xbox 360 and Rez HD given a date of the 30th in the UK.
2821367	2823369	The first is Bomberman Land on Wii.
2823929	2825070	Try saying that three times fast.
2825854	2839538	FlatOutHeadOn on PSP, Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom, Yay, Lineage 2, The Camel on PC, PDC World Championship Darts 2008 on DS, which is really exciting, isn't it?
2840779	2840999	Yeah.
2841779	2848341	Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords on Wii, Sims 2 Castaway Stories on PC, and Zoo Hospital on DS.
2849202	2850162	Zoo Hospital?
2850302	2850962	Oh boy!
2852803	2853643	Isn't that exciting?
2855465	2857106	Zoo Host-able.
2858087	2860889	I would like to know how many people have pre-orders on Zoo Hospital.
2861890	2862931	I've got mine in there.
2863111	2863371	Do you?
2863891	2865993	Just making sure I don't want to miss out on Zoo Hospital.
2867754	2875980	You know, I was hoping that Chess Master Live was actually Chess Master Live, you know, like a pornographic version of it or something.
2876340	2878842	That'd be kind of cool, but no.
2881324	2882125	Let's see, the...
2884040	2888102	US isn't that busy this week, actually.
2888142	2889202	It's pretty scarce.
2889863	2894065	And there's not going to be much that you're going to be interested in unless you love Bomberman.
2894705	2896265	In which case, there's a couple games for you.
2896346	2899727	Bomberman Land for the Wii and the PSP coming out.
2899767	2902608	A little mini-game with some adventure stuff in there as well.
2902788	2905029	And it's Bomberman, so there you go.
2905570	2909271	Bomberman Land Touch 2 for the DS is coming out.
2910011	2912953	Pursuit Force Extreme Justice on the PSP.
2914533	2918115	and The Sims Cast Away Stories on the PC.
2919195	2921076	What kind of stories do they have to tell?
2922257	2926979	Help, I'm trapped in a knockoff game of a once popular franchise.
2927659	2929420	Help, I'm lost on an island.
2931201	2932001	Anything else to note?
2932021	2935783	I was just seeing if there was anything else that's funny.
2936143	2938384	Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.
2940723	2942324	Wait, say that one more time.
2942565	2947289	Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.
2947469	2950011	So we have Zoo Hospital coming out in Europe.
2951852	2953994	Is it the same game, which is a different name or something?
2954495	2958798	Or is there really that big of a demand out there in the game marketplace for Zoo Hospital?
2958858	2962421	Dude, there's a lot of freaking Pet Vet games.
2962622	2964984	There's actually one that's kind of neat.
2965204	2969047	It's a little different than your usual pet the animals and they are better type game.
2969642	2972223	They actually have one that's done like Phoenix Wright.
2972303	2973464	That's a pet hospital game.
2973924	2975524	That's kind of neat.
2975645	2978646	I guess it's cute because it's a good game for kids.
2978786	2982787	It's a good game for kids, I'm sure, because how many... Objection!
2982827	2983608	You're not sick.
2983648	2985388	You're fake eating.
2985428	2987029	Damn, dog.
2987049	2993132	There's tons of eight and nine-year-olds that want to be veterinarians when they grow up.
2993872	2995693	If you want, I can go even more obscure here.
2995733	2996153	We've got...
2998186	3005490	Pacific Storm Allies, AGEODs, American Civil War, 1861-1865 Woo!
3005510	3010213	That's awesome!
3011374	3011814	And that's it.
3012635	3019619	Really, I don't want to go into any more details unless there's another tycoon game because, you know, every week there's got to be a tycoon game.
3020519	3021520	Oh, here's the one I was talking about.
3021560	3023041	Paws and Claws Pet Resort.
3023461	3024382	But that's not for this week.
3024442	3025242	Pet Resort?
3025643	3026143	Pet Resort.
3028073	3030795	It used to be Paws and Claws Pet Resort Tycoon.
3047063	3051750	It'll have little hats and sunglasses on and shirts.
3051830	3052991	That's so cute.
3053072	3056777	Like really cute as in like a Scholastic Weekly type cute.
3057810	3059371	Highlights for children type queue.
3059431	3060071	Yeah, exactly.
3060131	3060571	Exactly.
3061072	3070096	All right, let's go to Japanese release dates because this is one of the fun parts of the show is getting to hear me horribly butcher the pronunciation of Japanese titles coming soon to Japan.
3070436	3072437	But we'll start with easy ones on the Xbox 360.
3072517	3074778	Devil May Cry 4 on January 31st.
3075158	3080801	Need for Speed Pro Street also hitting January 31st as well as Sega Rally Revo also hitting as well.
3080821	3082882	By the way, there is a Xbox 360 Plus release
3083962	3084643	Devil May Cry 4
3103162	3108269	as well as Assassin's Creed makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
3108349	3111454	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, not a whole lot.
3111694	3115940	There's a game called Family Ski coming out from Namco Bandai on the 31st.
3116020	3119385	And I believe that uses the Wii Fit balance board if you have it.
3119955	3120576	and DarkSakura.com
3134338	3139479	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, another version of Need for Speed Pro Street.
3139900	3144401	Also, Tales of Destiny, the director's cut, makes its way out on the PlayStation 2.
3145361	3149222	Cyanide, with an X, I guess maybe that's Shyanide, is coming out as well.
3149722	3151403	Is that on the PS2?
3151903	3152563	On the PS2.
3152803	3153963	That's a pretty cool game, actually.
3154043	3155964	It's like a shoot-em-up.
3156690	3157791	Game, Bullet Hill
3177435	3178536	But I don't know.
3178636	3184961	Also coming out, Izumo 2 Double Tact comes out from GN Software on the PlayStation 2 this week.
3185442	3188164	Moving to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.
3189025	3191066	Loopop Cube Loop Salad.
3191667	3192528	I'm not making that up.
3192768	3193448	Loop Salad?
3193589	3196571	Loop Salad comes out on the DS this week.
3197272	3197752	What the fuck?
3198012	3199834	Loopop Cube Loop Salad.
3199874	3200614	I'm not even kidding.
3200654	3201215	That's what it is.
3201255	3202776	There's a little penguin on the cover.
3202796	3203317	It looks cute.
3203557	3204258	Weird looking thing.
3204678	3204778	Yep.
3205655	3207276	Hero Michi Oni-san no Ayako Taisu Navi
3231650	3234373	Because, yeah, I don't know, he's very happy.
3234673	3235874	He's like Richard Simmons happy.
3235914	3238757	You should get a t-shirt with that on the front there.
3238817	3240399	That would be, yeah.
3241159	3242881	He's like the Japanese Ronald McDonald.
3242901	3244683	That's 4chan.
3244703	3245243	Yeah, I know.
3245263	3248486	That picture is waiting to be 4chan'd into something.
3248647	3249568	Seriously.
3250228	3251309	Seriously, chat.
3251590	3252751	Look this game up if you...
3254188	3257451	If you're listening on the podcast and didn't get a chance to get the link in chat.
3258131	3264977	Lastly, let's go to the Sony PSP where there's a game called Patapon coming out on January 1st.
3264997	3266978	I have that on my PSP right now.
3267118	3267539	You like that?
3267679	3267999	Is it good?
3268019	3269300	Yeah, I haven't played it yet.
3270321	3270921	Well, Jesus.
3271382	3272462	That's the eyeball one.
3273844	3278247	And lastly, but not leastly, Sega Rally Revo also coming out on the Sony PSP.
3278267	3280789	I'll tell you what, I'll play it during break and then I'll tell you how it is.
3281089	3281890	Yeah, you should tell us.
3282611	3283932	Alright, let's move on.
3283992	3284973	Back to the gaming news!
3285433	3293320	Well, to move even further over to the UK, there was the drama going on regarding the release of Manhunt 2.
3295001	3299165	And they had said that, yeah, it would be okay, there would be no harm in the game.
3299245	3304149	Well, the high court has said, nah, it's going to be harmful, so we don't want it.
3304776	3305897	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3333147	3337229	and there's no telling if it will be in any incarnation released.
3339309	3345131	You know, just a message to our friends over there in the UK who might be legally involved in all this.
3345532	3348833	Just release the damn game because seriously, it's not going to sell anyway.
3348913	3350873	They've all heard from us that the game sucks.
3351334	3352334	So, you know, just...
3353288	3355669	Stop wasting the dollars, you know, getting the court orders.
3355689	3356850	It's not that good anymore.
3356870	3357470	Just let them sell it.
3357510	3358290	No one's going to buy it.
3358591	3359431	You know, it sucks.
3359511	3362612	It was good when, you know, we didn't know what the game was going to be like.
3362652	3368315	But now that it's been out and we've seen the reviews and we've played it and we've kind of gotten over the, oh, wow, this was violent.
3368455	3368795	Okay.
3368955	3374618	You know, if the British board wants to look at something, I mean, Condemned 2, hello, exploding babies.
3375518	3378060	I mean, that might necessitate a ban or something.
3378080	3379740	Wait, you don't understand, though, Rob.
3379760	3380841	What?
3381906	3390751	Exploding Babies, I mean, that has nothing to do with sexual stuff, so that's also another reason why we... Oh, I'm so sorry.
3390771	3394113	Exploding Babies, that's not as offensive as ripping off someone's testicles with pliers.
3398236	3399756	Alright, let's keep moving with the gaming news.
3401377	3403939	So, let's see here.
3405114	3406897	This isn't really a big surprise.
3407258	3415092	Ubisoft has confirmed that there's going to be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming in their next fiscal year, which 2008, I guess that starts in March.
3419039	3419579	Big whoop.
3419619	3422441	I mean, we already knew this was kind of rumored to be coming out anyways.
3423282	3426984	And I see some, you know, artwork here that they were showing off.
3428185	3436911	No word, though, on when exactly it's going to be out because their fiscal year runs from basically March of this year through April of 2009.
3437431	3440313	So somewhere in between there, we're going to get a new Prince of Persia game.
3441414	3446357	And hopefully it looks like this, you know, piece of artwork that they have because it looks like Strider.
3446678	3447358	But, you know.
3449127	3449827	Not a big surprise.
3452089	3454210	I'm going to the chat room and looking at some comments.
3454250	3458132	If you want to go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com and leave some comments.
3460493	3465476	Going back to the last story, Ross Steel UT says, No more Manhunt 2, angry face.
3466817	3470539	Frisbee says, Come on guys, Manhunt 2 is not a game to get locked up in the government.
3471998	3476020	SonOfDad says, Manhunt 2, no plastic knife attachment for the Wiimote yet?
3476060	3476640	They have those.
3477321	3477741	Shut up.
3477821	3486565	It's not a plastic knife, but it's a plastic sword, and then they've got stuff like that, but I don't know.
3486645	3487045	Let's see.
3488666	3491527	GS68 says, I should maybe take a break from game politics.
3491567	3492508	The story they've been running...
3492884	3496286	make me want to stab random people, I guess, in response.
3496446	3497266	Well, see, wait a minute.
3497286	3500528	Now, I see your displaced anger there is part of the problem.
3500808	3503550	You know, video games making you want to stab random people.
3503870	3504330	No, I'm kidding.
3504370	3505150	I know that's just an expression.
3505170	3510693	I'm sure in Japan, though, they probably have a knife attachment for, you know, the Wii Remote.
3510713	3517096	I mean, they have attachments for all the different weapons in Ghost Squad in there, so a knife, maybe.
3517437	3518037	That'd be kind of neat.
3519161	3520742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3540143	3541704	Some people have a lot of free time on their hands.
3588356	3589456	Hello, I'm Tom Brady.
3589516	3590917	I'm so excited to be on the show.
3608624	3614510	Anyhow, so no news yet on when this will be coming out for sure, but we imagine the delay is not going to be that long.
3614530	3617033	But I imagine there's going to be third-party microphones and stuff like that.
3617053	3622818	I know there's headsets already for some of the SOCOM games, which I imagine you can probably use those for Skype.
3623119	3625001	I don't understand why they're delaying all this stuff.
3625101	3629265	Oh, I'm probably guessing because everything that's Sony-related seems to be delayed one time or another.
3629645	3635249	Yeah, it's kind of funny because, you know, of course, all the Sony haters came out and said, here we go again, Delay Station 3.
3636450	3637170	Like all the cool stuff.
3637190	3638851	That is the Delay Station Portable, okay.
3638951	3639832	Yeah, that's true, that's true.
3640232	3640492	All right.
3641333	3644675	Really quick, some comments from chat, and then we'll get to the next story Jamie's going to do for us.
3644895	3650099	Actdeft says in chat, yes, if you sell something with the Skype name, you have to be certified by them.
3650139	3653261	So that is, you know, part of the point is that, you know, the microphones are chatter juice.
3653281	3655082	They get it, you know, Best Buy, Circuit City, whatever.
3655102	3656183	It's just some random mic technology.
3656303	3662346	That happens to be a USB mic, but if you're going to sell something with a Skype name on it, like the PSP is going to do, it has to be Skype certified, which makes sense.
3663246	3668248	And Tiger Claw says pretty soon the Skype calls on OLR are going to be done by people using Skype on their PSP.
3668908	3675011	I don't think that's actually going to be a bad thing at all because, hey, if the mics are certified and everything's been tested, you know it's going to work.
3675631	3677632	So I look forward to that day, actually.
3677672	3679653	I don't know about you guys, but I'll be good.
3679913	3680433	I'll cry.
3681294	3681914	Why would you cry?
3682554	3684675	Because... Cry tears of joy or tears of pain?
3685385	3686425	Cry tears of apathy.
3686765	3691307	I can't wait to talk on my PSP out in public looking like a complete douche.
3691787	3692327	Exactly.
3693687	3695068	Yo, what's up, man?
3695148	3695908	I'm totally on my PSP.
3695928	3697048	You know what it is?
3697108	3698609	It's the N-Gage all over again.
3700349	3702570	You don't have to side talk on it because it has a microphone.
3702810	3706211	Although the microphone that they're going to have plugs into the USB thing on the front.
3707291	3710452	I think on the top of the actual system.
3710782	3711642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3736620	3737500	I gotta say this.
3737600	3741662	There's JustinTVChat and there's our chat at OrangeLaunchRadio.
3741702	3743622	MacMan's making smart-ass comments in both.
3743662	3747243	He says in the JustinTVChat, Echo123 is for wussies.
3747604	3749424	Call in with no sure quality test.
3749464	3750885	Hell, don't even buy a microphone.
3751325	3752345	You, sir, are part of the problem.
3752965	3756686	But he says in chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, Yo, I'm on my PSP.
3756746	3757327	Wanna pick me up?
3757347	3757947	Wanna pick me up?
3761448	3761948	Sorry, I just
3763340	3764201	No, I don't want to pick you up.
3764221	3764921	Can I do my story now?
3764941	3765461	Yes, you may.
3765481	3768023	Because it's about something that's even more retarded than Skype.
3768123	3768423	Uh-oh.
3768824	3770044	Well, than that microphone anyway.
3770885	3776989	Someone made an eye of judgment table to make up for the fact that the camera is easily bumped into poor lighting.
3777489	3783113	So he takes this little table and builds a custom hardwood replica of the mat.
3784194	3786155	And apparently it works just fine.
3787576	3790938	But I was like, people like this game enough to care.
3792113	3793493	has that sold any more copies?
3793673	3797034	oh no, I don't think it has what is the latest update on the Eye of Judgment numbers?
3797114	3803436	still hasn't broke another 100,000 or even 10,000 can we count table sales as part of the million?
3803456	3815300	honestly, if you want to, go right ahead before I mentioned it in that thread because I was egging on people in there I said I'd be surprised if it surpassed 300,000 units
3817322	3820184	But like right now, it's really starting to flatten off.
3820284	3823787	I mean, it's sold 4,000 units in the U.S.
3823967	3826989	only in the last week or so.
3827209	3829631	All right, since now we are going to add table counts.
3829671	3830551	What were we at, 160,000?
3830832	3831252	Yeah.
3832153	3833574	Adding the tables, we're now up to 160,001.
3833914	3839197	Because that's how many of these tables we'll probably sell.
3839498	3841339	Well, it's just this guy that made it.
3841699	3843140	He doesn't say anything about it being retailed.
3843460	3843901	Oh, okay.
3843961	3844181	Okay.
3845409	3849591	There's a comment on there that it would be retail ready if they add a cup holder.
3850091	3852532	But he just made this for himself.
3852792	3854032	So this is unacceptable.
3854172	3855753	Where am I going to put my drink on this table?
3855893	3858093	This guy's pretty hardcore to do something like that.
3858113	3859774	You've got to be a pretty hardcore Eye of Judgment fan.
3859794	3862275	This guy's name is Matt and he plays as Havoc.
3864596	3865776	Watch out for Havoc.
3868597	3870318	And I'm just still boggled.
3870838	3871478	You know, because like
3872176	3872296	Nerd.
3872416	3872536	Nerd.
3902256	3903116	It used to be the shit.
3903176	3904077	Now it's the crap.
3905477	3906378	All right, let's move on.
3906658	3909799	Please, before we get into Magic the Gathering talk, please let us see the show.
3910639	3919243	Anyways, Sony's really trying to catch up with the whole Nintendo fad of releasing consoles in different colors.
3919763	3925125	Now in Asia, you will be able to pick up a red PS2 system.
3925725	3927526	Also, what's kind of neat is...
3928609	3929249	and DarkSakura.com
3959790	3960991	Dot, dot, dot.
3961111	3963232	I am inching away from Loki slowly.
3963292	3970656	Well, you know, they could also use the Saturn argument, because the Japanese Saturn was white, and over here it was... Yeah.
3971357	3973998	Okay, that was kind of dumb.
3974018	3975039	I can't get behind that argument.
3975059	3983484	But they're set to come out in Asia February 4th, so if you really need to get your hands on a red PS2... I don't know.
3983504	3985765	There's other console sites out there that will sell colored...
3986223	3991846	PS2 systems in almost any color of the rainbow that you want, so do you really need to wait for this shit to import it?
3992146	3994207	And my god, seriously, it's the color of a console.
3994407	3998449	If you don't have a PS2 already, it's like, oh damn, I was really hoping for a red one.
3998969	4001991	Now my dreams can be realized at the end of the console cycle.
4002491	4005052	Portal Combat said a clear PS3 would be sweet.
4007073	4009374	It doesn't matter how many colors of these consoles you're going to release.
4009475	4012256	Okay, so the PS2's selling lots and lots and lots of consoles.
4012636	4014397	PS3, not so much, you know, but
4015515	4015815	I don't know.
4016015	4018916	It's just going to confuse people even more with the white console now.
4019776	4020696	Yet another skew.
4021116	4024657	Why does it matter what it looks like as long as it's still the same piece of shit inside?
4025197	4027777	This one's white, but guess what it won't do this time?
4027897	4031678	Play Blu-ray movies or do something that's important.
4031758	4032598	It has no left.
4033878	4038699	I've never been more happy that we got our first day release than I am now.
4042200	4042360	Wow.
4044591	4050112	Sorry, I was looking for the clip on YouTube of the kid from Wonder Shows and going, that's racist, but I couldn't find it.
4050752	4052353	So you'll just have to imagine it in your head.
4054173	4059274	I was able to find the white people song, but if you... White people having fun.
4059294	4064955	Seriously, I love... Wonder Shows is so fucking hilarious.
4064995	4066315	Why did they stop doing that show?
4066855	4068756	Nelly still sings the white people song.
4071116	4072257	I don't know, she likes the songs.
4073677	4074297	Animal Dance
4074799	4075559	Animal Dance.
4077300	4078020	That's great.
4081082	4085083	I like the one where they show the tour of the hot dog factory.
4086464	4088945	I don't think this is the Wonder Shows and Podcast, is it?
4089505	4091906	It's not, but I couldn't resist.
4091926	4092526	Patience!
4093046	4093667	Patience!
4094447	4094887	Patience!
4095167	4095748	Patience!
4096088	4096508	Patience!
4096748	4097348	Patience!
4097708	4098149	Patience!
4098469	4099069	Patience!
4100629	4102590	Rob, insert, you know, train wrecks.
4102830	4103431	All right!
4103491	4104171	God damn.
4104211	4104851	All right, I'll get to it.
4107353	4107713	I'll get to it.
4107733	4109714	We need, like, an off-topic alarm.
4109734	4110414	I know, seriously.
4110635	4112155	We need an off-topic alarm.
4112996	4126563	I'm looking at this picture that someone in the chatroom linked from, um, it was Actdeft that linked it in the chatroom, and it's from, um, Gakuten Saiban, which is, uh, you know, Phoenix Wright.
4127484	4127804	And it's,
4128314	4130737	and two oranges with a banana sticking out of the middle.
4133900	4137043	Oh yeah, DarkSakura, because you're so good at getting this show back on track.
4137503	4138825	I'm talking about a game.
4139546	4141447	I don't see what's so funny about citrus roots.
4142449	4143930	It's our chatroom that linked it, not me.
4145872	4147714	That means we have pervs in our chatroom.
4149836	4150597	I like pervs.
4151378	4152639	There need to be more of them in the world.
4153715	4154515	Pervs are awesome.
4154975	4157016	Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news.
4157036	4158797	Hey, I did not derail the show.
4158877	4161697	They derailed it with Wonder Shows and whatever.
4162238	4164158	Look, Metal Gear Solid.
4164198	4165719	That'll always save a day, right?
4166379	4167119	Here's the thing, though.
4167159	4169420	It's actually the same old shit, but all over again.
4169440	4178363	And that is because, apparently, PlayAsia is taking pre-orders for a brand new Metal Gear Solid collection.
4178723	4181504	That's right, it's the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection.
4181944	4182664	It'll set you back...
4184066	4187248	34.90 and also $4 shipping and handling.
4187648	4194453	You will get with it Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 Substance, and Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence.
4195493	4196194	Woohoo!
4196394	4199176	Or you can just wait and get it at any retail store for $29.99.
4200117	4203659	Or you could just, you know, borrow your friend's copy that they're not playing anymore.
4203719	4206441	It does have new artwork.
4206841	4207902	That's the only difference.
4208983	4210824	And of course it all looks like the old artwork.
4212247	4213768	because this style never changes.
4215909	4221231	So if you were waiting all this time to get Metal Gear Solid, now's your chance.
4221711	4223712	Now's your chance to get it in a couple months.
4226033	4227094	All right, let's move on.
4228074	4228774	Can I really?
4228894	4231976	And are you going to bring up things that have absolutely nothing to do with video games this time?
4232296	4232856	I don't know.
4232896	4233316	We'll see.
4233757	4234857	Soul Calibur 4!
4236698	4239079	They're bringing back three characters.
4239799	4240099	Yay.
4240199	4241120	We get Maxie.
4241894	4242174	IceCave
4267532	4270038	Dude, YoungSong or whatever his name is, is a pirate.
4270218	4271040	That's pretty awesome.
4271220	4271842	So is Maxie.
4271942	4272824	I like playing with him.
4272864	4273305	He's cool.
4273947	4274929	Maxie's also a pirate.
4276041	4277742	You know what else I have to say about this story, Jamie?
4305673	4324223	Animal Dance, Animal Dance Look, everybody's doing the Animal Dance Animal Dance, Animal Dance Animal Dance That's the wonders of Wondershowsin.
4325703	4325963	Rob.
4326484	4326764	Yes?
4326924	4327184	Rob.
4327664	4327964	Yes?
4328765	4330846	You don't even get the full slew of Rob.
4332007	4332647	You just get two.
4333968	4335369	and Chris threw something at you for me.
4335669	4337369	Can we do another story now?
4338069	4339050	I'd like to apologize.
4339070	4341911	In other news, Rob is random and he's red now.
4342311	4346172	To everybody who's tuning in to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, I'd like to apologize.
4346832	4348073	Did my roommate bring us food?
4348693	4349493	You're awesome!
4349753	4350574	Do I have to share it?
4351514	4352995	You can have two of them.
4353055	4354635	I don't want one because I'm full already.
4354755	4356256	I ate a whole sandwich.
4356356	4356896	Thank you, though.
4357156	4357296	Then...
4361468	4363370	Okay, hello, we're on the air.
4363410	4368433	No, I'm just kidding.
4368554	4371776	If you had seen how off-topic we were, you would not be bored.
4372016	4373678	We were talking about animal dancing.
4373938	4374999	Okay.
4376159	4377400	Rob, pass it over.
4377420	4377941	Yes, all right.
4378461	4381824	Loki, please, a video game subject, or nobody's ever going to listen to the show again.
4381844	4382324	All right.
4382705	4388669	Well, the Final Fantasy XIII designer promises a demo for the game and promises that the game will be out in 2008.
4390509	4396992	which means that we'll have it sometime possibly before January 1st of 2009.
4398353	4403616	Unless, of course, they're going to renege on the whole thing and say, you know what, yeah, we ran into some delays.
4404376	4405617	So they can tell us whatever we want.
4405857	4409759	And each copy is going to come in case with gold and free women.
4411620	4412560	But, you know.
4414241	4415662	Never mind, I don't want it anymore.
4415862	4416923	How about just loose women?
4418023	4418944	Yes, definitely don't want it.
4418964	4419684	Free loose women.
4421854	4435240	That'll be with the Fabula Nova Crystallis Collection, which has the dumbest name of the series.
4435260	4436381	It's called Final Fantasy XIII.
4436881	4439022	Do we need to go crazier with the name?
4439902	4441363	It's worked for Final Fantasy VII.
4441583	4444765	It's worked for Final Fantasy X. It's worked for Final Fantasy X-2.
4446883	4455065	The only thing is, even if this does come out in 2008, which I highly doubt a creator is promising it or not, it'll come out in 2008 in Japan.
4455605	4456225	Oh, yes, yes.
4456265	4458265	It'll take them nine months to translate it for us.
4461226	4462346	What good is this going to do me?
4462486	4463186	But that's okay, though.
4463206	4470608	I'm sure this is all the news that Sony needs to start playing it in their commercials for the PS3 to get people hyped up to buy their system.
4473365	4483990	Although, to their credit though, they did remove Haze from there now, and they still have Metal Gear Solid, which doesn't look like it's coming out in the spring anymore.
4485951	4486311	I don't know.
4488212	4500137	All right, let's move on so we can try and put this whole segment behind us and get out the last few stories here, including speaking of the PlayStation 3, Best Buy is clearing out the 80 gigabytes.
4500157	4500477	Yes.
4501024	4507529	That's right, there is an internal memo going around, quote, the 80 gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3 is going close out and won't be replaced at this time.
4507869	4510071	It will come off the planogram on January 28th.
4510131	4513393	The 60 gigabyte version should already be gone from stores.
4513613	4517236	Only the 40 gigabyte version of PS3 will be sold in Best Buy stores at this time.
4517676	4520959	This means that there currently isn't a version that is PS2 compatible.
4521319	4524642	At this time, Sony hasn't made any announcements about new products.
4524702	4527824	And I think as of this recording right now, they have sold out of the
4529229	4529689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4557119	4560226	Maybe they're phasing out the 8 gig systems for that.
4560687	4563353	Also, maybe they're going to stop offering Motorstorm for free.
4564235	4564636	I don't know.
4567049	4570792	And even Microsoft's to blame for having a ton of different SKUs for their products.
4570832	4575755	But seriously, the PlayStation 3 has been very confusing with what's available.
4576015	4577176	First it's the 60 and the 20.
4577376	4579558	And then the 20 goes away.
4580058	4582180	And then it's the 60 and the 80.
4582780	4585402	They show absolutely no confidence in their product.
4585582	4587263	And then the 60 goes away.
4587283	4588244	And now it's the 80 and the 40.
4588744	4590125	And then the 80's going away.
4590225	4592107	And now it's the 40 and God knows what.
4593288	4593648	We'll see.
4593973	4594213	DarkSakura
4622296	4623937	So what game this week, DarkSakura?
4624917	4630861	The game of the week is Akumajou Dracula X Chino Rondo, which is Dracula X Rondo of Blood.
4633062	4633322	Nice.
4633882	4641026	As a lot of people know, it was recently re-released for the PSP, but I'm not talking about PSP ones.
4644308	4646909	And actually, the other clip that I liked had the better music.
4647350	4647750	Oh, sorry.
4647770	4648650	This one loaded first.
4648690	4649191	I played this.
4649751	4649931	Yeah.
4651096	4678989	the other one in particular because it was new music that was for that game it was the theme Bloodlines which was the theme of Richter Belmont which is the character that they brought in this who was also in Symphony of the Night which came out in Japan as Nocturne and the Moonlight this is the predecessor to that game because you actually start off Symphony of the Night as Richter at what's supposed to be the end of this game when he fights Dracula so and of course the uh
4679770	4687132	The music I have linked is from the PC Engine Duo disc, which was all Redbook audio.
4687412	4689272	You could actually put it in your CD player and listen to it.
4689592	4696454	Although, just the cool thing, because I don't know if anyone ever did this with Symphony of the Night, if you put it in your disc and try to listen to it, you get a warning.
4697154	4700315	This is a PlayStation Black disc.
4700495	4703856	If you listen to the game track, it will block speakers.
4704096	4706056	I had the same thing on the Japanese one, too.
4706316	4709237	On the PC Engine one.
4710103	4712705	Which I thought was really cool.
4713085	4717768	But anyway, the game had little animated cutscenes.
4717828	4719529	I should say poorly animated cutscenes.
4720269	4724052	And also the intro of it was done in German.
4725072	4731316	And for old listeners of our show, I've actually brought in my TurboGrafx.
4731636	4733618	Because you can play it on the US TurboGrafx.
4733638	4734858	There's no country lockout.
4735179	4735779	This is classic Castlevania.
4737762	4739123	That was a long time ago.
4739363	4747886	In fact, if I do remember right, this is Super Castlevania 4, or the last traditional Castlevania games that have come out.
4748286	4752688	All the rest of them have had that sort of Metroidvania format.
4752728	4754108	I love that term, Metroidvania.
4756349	4763692	This particular one, because of how, I guess, relatively rare it was on PC Engine...
4764625	4766126	It's really hard to find it for less than $150.
4766486	4767867	And I have an original.
4768067	4770349	I had burdens for a long time because my friend had an original.
4770969	4774232	We got ours because someone owed us $100 and came back from Japan with the game.
4775593	4776993	Which I thought was pretty freaking cool.
4779755	4787801	It also had... And now this did have a version of it on the Super Nintendo that was not...
4788542	4790023	And a lot of people said, oh, it wasn't all that great.
4790063	4791784	I actually enjoyed the Super Nintendo one.
4792385	4793365	Not me, I didn't like it.
4793666	4797608	Not compared to the TurboGrafx, or, you know what I mean, this first version, PC.
4797648	4802652	This one, the cool thing about it is that as you went through, you had different routes that your story would take.
4803212	4806254	Like, if you rescued Maria, you can play as her.
4807015	4808236	And, um, this...
4809944	4815748	As I understand, she was supposed to be playable in Symphony of the Night, as well as two other levels that they never completed.
4816168	4817970	But on the Saturn version, you can play as her.
4818750	4820211	And all of her attacks are there.
4820251	4821672	She threw birds for her attack.
4822473	4838704	And her special weapons were a dragon, a kitten, a turtle shell, and another type of bird that came out, which translated actually to the...
4839969	4845192	I guess four major gods in the Saturn version that came out later.
4848053	4852235	Also, she gets this uber cutesy ending, and it was crazy.
4853276	4869364	The other funny thing about this is that because it had to run on the Arcade Card 3, if you didn't have an Arcade Card 3 in, it actually had Dracula X Stage X, which was done in really bad sort of rendered-looking bubble figures.
4870525	4874408	and, um, I went through all this, um, that way.
4874869	4881194	Also, a lot of the, uh, enemies in this game were original for this one and showed up in a lot of the later series, too.
4881994	4886858	Um, we had, like, the Pikemen, which were, I think, the most single annoying characters ever.
4886878	4891582	They're the ones who stay on the ledge and, like, drop a, a pike down on you and they were hard to get past.
4892583	4898768	Um, it was, this is, to me, this game right here, to me, is the top, um,
4905737	4911119	I'd agree.
4911960	4912520	To a point.
4912680	4916882	I think Symphony of the Night exceeded it a little bit, but we wouldn't have Symphony of the Night if it weren't for this.
4917182	4918403	So you have to respect the elders.
4918683	4925306	And of all of the series, as far as I'm aware, well, these two are...
4925862	4926462	LinkTogether.
4926502	4932125	This one and Symphony of the Night are the only games to carry the actual Dracula X logo.
4934206	4935827	I love this from Actdeft in chat.
4936367	4937628	What is a podcast?
4937968	4939509	A miserable little pile of hosts.
4939869	4940509	But enough of that.
4940829	4941489	Have at you.
4942470	4942690	Winner.
4942730	4946892	It was... What was that?
4946912	4948793	There's actually... I dropped the mic.
4950894	4954055	Several remixes that were in this one from some of the previous games, too.
4954075	4954115	Um...
4956585	4960287	Some of the little music clips carried over.
4960307	4966910	And yeah, this one, if you can find an original, good luck.
4967670	4968051	Good luck.
4969651	4977575	But other than that... This is probably... That's a scary little noise that thing makes.
4978616	4985119	But I'd have to say of all of the... This is probably one of my top five games.
4986169	4986630	Evar.
4988071	4997379	All right, well, there you have it, your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, Dracula X. I also think the bad guy is funny because his name is Shaft.
5000041	5000822	What you talking about?
5001643	5001883	All right.
5002575	5003275	I'll see you next time.
5020829	5022270	Thanks for sticking with us in the craziness.
5022590	5025772	We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
