7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Lowkey
14000	20000	Tonight, January 27th, 2008, Fox News ruffles the feathers of the gaming community,
20000	26000	Sega Master System games are poised to make a comeback, and is the Gizmondo about to be revived?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'm here with you every week, and also here with you every week, usually.
47000	50000	Usually she's punctual. It's the one and only...
50000	52000	I'm here early, Rob.
52000	56000	DarkSakura, she was actually here very early tonight.
56000	58000	I wasn't very early, but I was on time.
58000	61000	She was very punctual. She was quite punctual.
61000	64000	She gets an A for her attendance tonight.
64000	66000	And I brought specials.
66000	68000	You did. You brought specials.
68000	71000	And we'll go ahead and introduce specials.
71000	74000	She's very special to us, actually, here at Orange Lounge Radio.
74000	79000	It's one of our official Orange Lounge Radio lesbians.
79000	81000	Give it up for Chris.
81000	83000	Hello, how are you?
83000	86000	I am fine. How are you doing, Chris?
86000	88000	I'm okay.
88000	96000	I've had coffee with lots of sugar, and before that we had frozen yogurt with lots of sugar.
96000	100000	So I'm getting ready to blow.
100000	102000	You're happy!
102000	107000	Now, if I'm not mistaken, this may very well be your last appearance on Orange Lounge Radio for a little while.
107000	110000	I mean, not like ever, ever, but for a little while, right?
110000	113000	I'm going to desperately, desperately try.
113000	118000	But to come back here, because I've been in, for those of you who do not know,
118000	126000	I've been going back and forth from LA to my home in the South Bay, Los Gatos,
126000	130000	because my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer.
130000	136000	And I've been kind of being their chauffeur to whatever it is they need and stuff like that.
136000	139000	So I've kind of been their little slave, which I don't mind.
139000	143000	But sorry to hear about the family circumstance. It's rough, I know.
143000	146000	It's hard, but you know what, people are old, and that kind of stuff happens.
146000	155000	So I've been going back and forth, and I'm also moving to Madison, Wisconsin in March,
155000	160000	if all goes according to plan for school, and I have a girlfriend there, so pluses.
160000	166000	And it's got to be someone very special to get you to move from sunny, warm, wonderful California to,
166000	170000	oh my fucking lord, it's cold, Wisconsin.
170000	175000	No, no, the accent is kind of like this, you know.
175000	176000	Awesome.
176000	179000	Oh, you've got to get yourself one of those. That's all feel nice.
179000	182000	Well, you kids have fun. I know you guys are going to have a lot of fun together, living together and stuff.
182000	184000	But I'm going to be trying to come back more and more.
184000	185000	You better.
185000	188000	Because I actually, we got a new addition to the family.
188000	189000	Oh. Oh, really?
189000	190000	Yeah.
190000	191000	Oh.
191000	193000	My dad's girlfriend gave birth to a little girl.
193000	194000	Aw.
194000	195000	On the 17th.
195000	196000	And you're going to visit your little sister once in a while.
196000	197000	Yeah.
197000	198000	All right.
198000	201000	So she's adorable and crying and driving her mother up the wall.
201000	202000	Well, on a more, on a...
202000	203000	That takes a whole lot, doesn't it?
203000	204000	Uh-huh.
204000	207000	Going back to games and gaming type like conventions for a little bit,
207000	209000	are you going to be going to the Chicago convention this year, Ayson?
209000	210000	I am. I'm going to Ayson.
210000	211000	You are.
211000	214000	You know, actually, some of our listeners are really trying to get us to go, and I'm going to try to make it happen.
214000	215000	So...
215000	216000	Good.
216000	217000	Yeah, I definitely will come.
217000	218000	Well, I'll have an apartment, so you guys are willing to sit.
218000	220000	We'll have a pillow fight. It'll be fun.
220000	222000	Oh, boy.
222000	225000	Well, for those...
225000	226000	There you go, the official OLR battle royale pillow fight.
226000	227000	That's what we need to do.
227000	231000	I was actually going to try and get a press pass to see if I can do some interviews for you guys.
231000	233000	I had a really cool idea, which I want to discuss with you later.
233000	235000	But for those of you who are going to Ayson, I will be there.
235000	243000	I'll be at the art table with my girlfriend, Megan, and a bunch of other really awesome artists that are going to show up.
243000	244000	Awesome.
244000	245000	Yeah, so look for me.
245000	247000	I mean, I'll have blue hair and stuff.
247000	249000	I'm very easy to spot.
249000	252000	All right, well, let's go ahead and move on.
252000	253000	We haven't introduced the one and only...
253000	255000	Let me switch mics for you so he has his normal back.
255000	257000	The one and only tech master, Loki.
257000	258000	Hi.
258000	259000	How you doing, Loki?
259000	260000	Good.
260000	261000	I finished the sandwich.
261000	266000	Sorry I ignored you for a little bit there, but, you know, lesbians cater a little more to our demographic than you do.
266000	267000	I know.
267000	268000	I'm just kidding.
268000	269000	How...
269000	270000	Where would we be without Loki?
270000	271000	Come on.
271000	272000	Loki's a very important part of this show.
272000	273000	You having a good week, Loki?
273000	275000	I had an okay week.
275000	276000	Yeah?
276000	277000	Yeah.
277000	278000	All right.
278000	279000	Let's go ahead and move on just a little bit.
279000	282000	But it's tradition to let the ladies go first.
282000	285000	So, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
285000	288000	It involved some cooking mama.
288000	294000	It involved a lot of burnout because I had to watch Dan play it and crash a bunch of stuff.
294000	298000	And it involved a whole crap ton of Ragnarok Online.
298000	299000	Of course.
299000	303000	And I found another game that I'm thinking about checking out, thanks to Heather.
303000	304000	What's that?
304000	305000	Perfect World.
305000	309000	Free play, free download, and according to her, it takes everything...
309000	311000	Well, and this is her perspective.
311000	316560	Took everything she hated about World of Warcraft and everything she hated about Guild Wars
316560	319000	and removed them and combined the best parts.
319000	320000	Interesting.
320000	321000	Do you have any examples?
321000	322000	Like, what types of things?
322000	323000	Or...
323000	324000	I don't know.
324000	325000	She was really drunk.
325000	326000	Okay.
326000	327160	Well, you'll know more...
327160	328920	You'll know more about it when you're able to get in there.
328920	329920	It was really nice.
329920	335200	On top of that, certain wear classes get, like, flying pets.
335200	337760	They look like gigantic manta rays.
337760	338760	And you get your...
338760	341280	You can get the nether rays in World of Warcraft, to be fair.
341280	343040	And you get your mounts at level 40.
343040	345040	That's not bad.
345040	346040	What was it called again?
346040	347040	Perfect World.
347040	348040	Perfect World.
348040	349040	It's a Malaysian MMO.
349040	350040	But it's free.
350040	351040	Completely free.
351040	352040	Download.
352040	353040	Free everything.
353040	360600	In this world, the Erwin family is writhing because of the thought of flying rays.
360600	362240	You're horrible.
362240	368160	Actually, that also kind of brings me back to, was it, if you're living in Las Vegas...
368160	370760	We can't stop here.
370760	373760	This is backcountry.
373760	377720	DarkSakura, anything else you'd like to share about your gaming week?
377720	381120	It wasn't a game, but we watched Torchwood, and it was hot.
381120	382720	I found some other friends of mine.
382720	384360	I would have never guessed.
384360	387600	They were talking to me, and they're like, Rob, you have to watch Torchwood.
387600	390040	It's the hottest show on TV.
390040	392160	You realize that this is a Doctor Who spin-off, right?
392160	393160	No, I do.
393160	394160	That's what I said.
394160	395160	I was like, you know it's a Doctor Who spin-off, right?
395160	398640	I said, one of my friend girls is obsessed with this series.
398640	399640	And they're like, oh yeah.
399640	400640	We like Doctor Who, too.
400640	401640	I was like, oh, cool.
401640	406920	If you take Torchwood and rearrange it, it spells Doctor Who.
406920	409720	Before we get to some more gaming weeks, I'm assuming you're all finished.
409720	410720	Yes?
410720	411720	All done?
411720	412720	Yes.
412720	415000	I just want to read some comments from the chat.
415000	416000	What?
416000	417000	Africa.
417000	418000	Chat.orangemunchradio.com.
418000	419000	Let's see.
419000	420000	What was this?
420000	424160	Oh, Tiger Claw asks, Skye, next week is the Super Bowl.
424160	427080	Will there be a show by then?
427080	428960	Damn right there's going to be a show during the Super Bowl.
428960	433960	I could care less about the Super Bowl, so absolutely we'll be doing a show, because
433960	434960	you know what?
434960	437460	I think some folks out there would like to have some alternative programming to the Super
437460	438460	Bowl.
438460	439460	So you know what?
439460	443360	We have the Puppy Bowl.
443360	446520	Yes, we do have the Puppy Bowl, and don't they have the Kitty Bowl usually, too?
446520	451640	They're doing it, and they're doing a $25 sushi buffet at the place on that day, and
451640	453640	I'm thinking about going.
453640	454640	Nice.
454640	455640	Nice.
455640	456640	Let's see.
456640	457640	What else?
457640	458640	Other comments from chat.
458640	459640	Let's see.
459640	461320	Tiger Claw just heard that Black Wolf is going to do a show on Saturday next week to the
461320	462320	Super Bowl.
462320	463320	Well, that's Black Wolf.
463320	464320	That's Bobby's project.
464320	465320	He likes sports, though, see?
465320	466320	Yeah, Bobby can watch it.
466320	467320	Just like my roommate.
467320	469240	I'm sure my roommate's going to have some guys over here watching the Super Bowl.
469240	470600	We'll be out here doing our nerdy show.
470600	471600	All right.
471600	472600	Let's get back to games.
472600	474120	Loki, how was your gaming week?
474120	479360	My gaming week was pretty much just Burnout Paradise.
479360	482080	I played countless hours of it.
482080	486320	Actually, it's not countless because I took a look at my stats there, and I actually have
486320	490480	ten and a half hours put into it, but it's awesome.
490480	496080	You keep finding new things in there, and actually, I found quite a bit of the hidden
496080	497080	stuff.
497080	504880	I have almost all the jumps done, and about half the billboards and half the smashes,
504880	509760	and I'm working to get my Class A license, and haven't played online yet, because the
509760	515880	servers were giving me crap earlier this week, so I just kind of avoided them, but I may
515880	519440	try some online stuff a little later.
519440	520440	It's fun, though.
520440	522040	Are you going to play me online?
522040	525320	Because I got my copy, so you'll kill me, but that's all right.
525320	526320	No, it'll be fun.
526320	531960	There's a lot of stuff you can do, like co-op, challenges and stuff, so that might be fun.
531960	535760	And then I got a Vectrex.
535760	538440	That's right, you won the Vectrex that you were talking about last week, huh?
538440	539440	Yes.
539440	540440	How did that go?
540440	541680	It went okay.
541680	546680	I have it on my desk now, and people are like, oh my god, I remember that!
546680	550520	And to be honest, it's just kind of a desk piece, you know, I don't really play much
550520	551760	on it.
551760	557560	I did try some of the games that came with it, Star Trek, the game.
557560	562960	I understand it about as much as I understood it before, which is not very much.
562960	564280	I don't like that game at all.
564280	569480	I did play Frenzy, though, I think it's called Frenzy, no, Berserk, I'm sorry.
569480	572000	Same game, though.
572000	573520	But that was pretty fun.
573520	580680	And then there was this game, Hyperchase, it might not have been Hyperchase, but it
580680	583280	was some sort of racing game, and that was kind of fun.
583280	587760	And then they had, of course, the one that's built into it, which is Space Minds, and it
587760	589840	was pretty cool.
589840	595360	But the only thing is, originally I had planned on leaving it on all day long, just to leave
595360	598940	it at my desk and people can come by and take a look at it and have some sort of demo loop,
598940	602840	but none of those games ever had a demo loop, and it also makes a really annoying buzzing
602840	605600	sound, so I was like, crap, I can't do that.
605600	608020	So I just turned it on when people wanted to take a look at it.
608020	610960	Also one of the controllers is broken, so I had to fix that.
610960	614120	But I can get a new controller for like ten bucks if I really want to.
614120	616440	They actually make quite a few games.
616440	618360	People are still making games for that system.
618360	619360	Really?
619360	620360	I had no idea.
620360	626220	All homebrew stuff, of course, but there's new carts coming out as of last year still,
626220	630200	so that's kind of neat, I guess.
630200	634040	A complete waste of money, but it's neat, nonetheless.
634040	636560	It's nice to have.
636560	640440	And then, let's see, what else did I get?
640440	646840	I haven't gotten it yet, but I have a copy of, God, I don't remember what it's called
646840	647840	now.
647840	652560	It's one of the bit generation titles, but that one's coming, hopefully I get to play
652560	653560	that this week.
653560	660160	And, what else, oh, I got, I'm actually planning on selling my Sega Saturns, because I found
660160	662160	an emulator that works perfectly on my computer.
662160	664600	I didn't even know you had a Sega Saturn.
664600	665600	I have two.
665600	666600	What?
666600	667600	Yeah.
667600	668600	Wow.
668600	673240	Well, I bought them at a garage sale, not a garage sale, at a Danayo's flea market,
673240	678160	because for some reason I wanted to play Panzer Dragoon Zui, because I thought, oh my God,
678160	681560	it was so awesome, I love that game, and I went back and played it, and I'm like, wow,
681560	686040	this wasn't very good at all, but I hate that.
686040	692000	I need to get a stall and some other stuff, but yeah, it's okay, but since now that I
692000	696640	have something that will actually play them on the PC, I don't really need them anymore,
696640	701480	so there's this local game shop, which I've been meaning to go to for weeks now, called
701480	707480	Fairgame, and they carry all the vintage stuff, everything from the Vectrex up through Playstation
707480	713920	3 stuff, so hopefully they will be able to buy that.
713920	717120	And I do have games with it, I don't remember which games, so I have like two copies of
717120	725000	Madden 97 for some reason, like Bug 2, a Knight's Demo, and like some other stuff, Machine Head,
725000	734480	and I don't know, but I don't know, maybe I can put it on eBay though, cool cool.
734480	741200	And Saints Row, as usual, oh and, I think I meant, but not during the show, another
741200	747840	360 died, another one red ringed, apparently I had one that was starting to freeze up on
747840	752640	me, so I figured, okay, I'm going to cut it off the pass and just put a new heat sink
752640	754440	on it so that it will work better.
754440	759360	Well, put the new heat sink on it, didn't really fix anything, and so I tried pulling
759360	763760	the heat sink off again and maybe applying a little more thermal grease on spots that
763760	768200	may have missed some, and there was a big empty spot on there, so I went ahead and put
768200	773800	some thermal grease on there, reset it all back on there, and sure enough it three rings
773800	779520	on me, so I'm like, crap, and now I can't fix that one, so I'm going to hit it with
779520	783880	blunt objects until it works, or it won't work and who gives a crap because I still
783880	788600	have five, but I wanted six because my boss wants to play again and we had someone else
788600	795440	join us up when he was busy doing something else, so now someone's taken his place, but
795440	797440	he wants to play again.
797440	798440	Alright.
798440	799560	Oh well, soon you lose.
799560	802080	You always have busy gaming weeks, you can manage to play a lot.
802080	808600	I try, well we play at work, we play Saints Row, we play lots of Saints Row, lots of Saints
808600	814680	Row and lots of Burnout Paradise because that game, you know, it's really crazy, I thought
814680	819960	this week I would have been playing some No More Heroes, but I haven't gotten around
819960	820960	to that yet.
820960	821960	Not yet, but soon.
821960	826020	No, I don't know if I'm going to get around to it anytime soon either because next week
826020	832080	is Smash Bros. coming out in Japan, so hopefully we'll have that soon.
832080	833560	Hopefully, you've got to give us your thoughts.
833560	835000	Alright, well let's keep them moving.
835000	836000	Let's go over to Chris.
836000	837920	I don't know, Chris, if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week,
837920	839240	but let's hear it.
839240	844200	Well, aside from playing WoW, which I seem to be doing on a regular basis now.
844200	845200	Addict.
845200	846200	Shut up.
846200	848200	No, I have no room to talk whatsoever, seriously.
848200	851080	Yeah, I heard you just got a 70, so.
851080	852720	I wouldn't say just got, but yeah.
852720	855480	Oh, okay, well you know, I've been kind of out of it, so.
855480	856480	Gaming World of Warcraft.
856480	858760	I have a character up to level 24 now.
858760	859760	Rock.
859760	863000	Hey, everybody start somewhere, but you're a Draenei, huh?
863000	869480	No, I'm actually, I don't have, I've just now started getting into, because Megan is
869480	873200	starting to play, and she's got all of her friends playing, and all of them have like
873200	874200	epics.
874200	875200	Oh, wow.
875200	879640	And I'm learning now what they're learning, so I'm like hearing all this shit, like farm,
879640	880920	it's like, oh, I'm farming.
880920	882840	I didn't know for the longest time what that meant.
882840	885040	That's, oh, you got to start something.
885040	889040	Yeah, I got to, you know, because I was just a casual player, I don't go like for hours
889040	896360	on end, you know, just playing, and I'm like, shut up, and I don't need to look more like
896360	903320	a noob than I already am, but it was, you know, so I just finally, you know, I'm starting
903320	906520	to get more into it, but I don't have like a main.
906520	908520	So wait, do you horde or alliance now?
908520	909520	Both.
909520	910520	Both?
910520	912240	I don't have a main, I just switch back and forth.
912240	914240	You need to make your main a horde, for the horde.
914240	920680	But Megzi's main is a gnome, so to play with her, shut up, to play with her, I made a gnome,
920680	926960	but the problem is that I'm like 10 levels lower than her, so playing with her in that
926960	931940	is kind of stupid, so I keep making more characters to try and play with her, because she keeps
931940	938680	making more characters, and it's just not working, but yeah, aside from that, I did
938680	941800	a lot of D&D stuff, so that makes me happy.
941800	942800	Cool.
942800	943800	Yeah, I have to.
943800	945200	What's your school kind of gaming?
945200	950720	Yeah, I've got like maybe four or five friends in LA that have always, have like, oh, we
950720	955440	need to run a game, we need to run a game, and so I finally caved in and started making
955440	959400	an adventure, because I don't like all the new, the pre-made ones, so I've been working
959400	965840	on that a lot, and I freaking am annoyed at fourth edition that's coming out, but apparently
965840	970480	everybody does that with every edition that comes out, so no room to talk.
970480	973920	They're never going to make everybody happy, sadly.
973920	975920	I don't like it.
975920	976920	All right.
976920	980040	And people need to make me happy, because I'm important.
980040	981040	You are important.
981040	982040	Thank you.
982040	983040	All right.
983040	984040	We're going to move on, though, with gaming weeks now, if I can.
984040	985040	May I have permission?
985040	986040	I hope so.
986040	987040	Yes.
987040	988040	All right.
988040	989040	You may, Rob.
989040	991600	My gaming week, I actually took a little bit of a break from WoW.
991600	996200	I mean, I've been playing some, but I went back to another type of RPG that I just missed.
996200	1000560	I haven't touched it in a while, and I decided to go back and play some Oblivion, because
1000560	1003560	I love that game, because you can just run around and do nothing.
1003560	1005280	It's the Seinfeld of video games.
1005280	1010040	I mean, if you want to ignore the main plot and just do whatever you want, you can.
1010040	1011040	It's beautiful.
1011040	1012440	I noticed you playing that this week.
1012440	1013440	Yes.
1013440	1018280	And I decided last time I did a fighter type, so this time I just went all out mage, because
1018280	1023360	I'm having a lot of fun summoning creatures to do my bidding and throwing fireballs at
1023360	1024360	people.
1024360	1025360	It's great.
1025360	1026360	I don't know why I get attacked.
1026360	1027360	I'm screwed.
1027360	1029120	But I create an army to go after people.
1029120	1030120	It's awesome.
1030120	1031120	I love Oblivion.
1031120	1032120	I can't wait for Elder Scrolls V.
1032120	1038560	I never get past the towns, because I'm too busy violating the animals, punching the horses
1038560	1043600	so they get pissed off, and apparently the townsfolk don't look too kindly upon that,
1043600	1045680	but it's still fun.
1045680	1047080	Otherwise, not a whole lot.
1047080	1049680	There's pretty much just been that has taken up a lot of my gaming week.
1049680	1054880	I just had this random Oblivion splurge, but I have been playing Burnout Paradise a little
1054880	1055880	bit.
1055880	1059800	Not enough to give a full review on just yet, but I do notice it's kind of like Test Drive
1059800	1062520	and Burnout mixed together, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
1062520	1063520	It's different.
1063520	1064520	It's a little different.
1064520	1065520	I don't know.
1065520	1066520	I kind of like the structure of the old Burnout games.
1066520	1069240	I'm not sure how I feel about this whole open world thing.
1069240	1072680	It's a little weird, but I'm giving it a shot.
1072680	1076280	I haven't taken it online either, which I hear is the best part, so we'll wait.
1076280	1079560	I do find it interesting, though, that it interacts with the camera to take your picture
1079560	1080560	and stuff.
1080560	1081560	That's kind of strange.
1081560	1087000	All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about housekeeping, and then we are going
1087000	1090520	to get into tonight's gaming news.
1090520	1094520	Tonight in housekeeping, just a reminder, we are now broadcasting, simulcasting on
1094520	1098680	Justin TV, so a big hello to all the people who are watching us right now on Justin TV.
1098680	1104760	Our Justin TV channel is www.Justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio, and the other cool thing
1104760	1108520	about Justin TV is that people can create their own highlights of the show.
1108520	1113720	So some people went in and made a highlight of, I don't know, me yelling no like Darth
1113720	1114720	Vader last week.
1114720	1115720	I don't know why that was so funny.
1115720	1116720	So I made that a highlight.
1116720	1117720	Okay, here's the one that got me, though.
1117720	1121960	Somebody made a highlight of the pie eating during the break.
1121960	1125080	But Justin TV is interesting because you can kind of see us even when the mics aren't hot,
1125080	1126920	so it's kind of fun.
1126920	1128920	So there's that over at Justin TV.
1128920	1134800	Also, next week on the show, an Orange Lounge radio first, and actually what may be, I'm
1134800	1139640	not sure, I don't want to stake the claim to this, but what may be a video game podcast
1139640	1141320	first, actually.
1141320	1145240	Next week on the show, we are going to have a musical guest.
1145240	1150080	That's right, we're going to have a musical guest here in studio, and her name on YouTube
1150080	1156440	is Amyxia is her name, and she is fairly well known, at least 28,000 people and counting
1156440	1159440	know her, for her cover of Still Alive.
1159440	1177400	So we found out she was local to us, so we sent her an email and said, hey, this might
1177400	1181360	seem a little random, but do you want to come on our little podcast and sing the song for
1181360	1182360	us?
1182360	1183360	And she said, sure.
1183360	1187040	So she's going to be here next week doing her cover of Still Alive, live here in studio.
1187040	1190120	It's an OLR first musical guest, and we're very excited.
1190120	1193840	She's going to be a guinea pig for that whole thing.
1193840	1194840	So it's cool.
1194840	1195840	We're very excited.
1195840	1201960	All right, so she'll be here in studio next week, as will the rest of us here.
1201960	1203920	I don't know if we have any other guests scheduled for the next few weeks.
1203920	1206120	Are we going to get the chocolate rain guy at some point?
1206120	1209160	We're not going to get the chocolate rain guy.
1209160	1210160	She's the YouTube celeb.
1210160	1213680	We're going to get in the studio, and then we've got to look for people from other places.
1213680	1214880	So there you have it.
1214880	1217960	Yeah, one day I want Dragon Force here in studio.
1217960	1221720	That's the ultimate dream.
1221720	1222720	I will.
1222720	1223720	You'll fly in from...
1223720	1224720	Yeah, that's right.
1224720	1225720	All right.
1225720	1229600	That would be so complete.
1229600	1231840	That's like a scene out of Wayne's World right there.
1231840	1232840	For real.
1232840	1233840	For real.
1233840	1234840	All right.
1234840	1238160	Anyhow, now why is the chat room saying they should get the chocolate rain guy?
1238160	1239160	Why?
1239160	1241160	What the hell does the chocolate rain guy have to do with video games?
1241160	1242160	I mean, come on.
1242160	1245560	But Amixia sings about, you know, she does a cover of Still Alive.
1245560	1246560	She's video game related.
1246560	1248520	Chocolate rain has nothing to do with video games.
1248520	1249520	Actually...
1249520	1250520	But it is funny.
1250520	1251520	I will say this.
1251520	1252520	I will say this.
1252520	1257440	An old friend of Orange Lounge Radio is experiencing a little bit of internet fame of his own,
1257440	1260320	I guess, speaking of people who have said they will come on the show.
1260320	1264120	He did a remix of this guy from American Idol.
1264120	1266000	Rinaldo LaPaz was his name.
1266000	1268880	He did this song called We Are Brothers Forever, and it was kind of one of those things you
1268880	1269880	laugh.
1269880	1281800	And Justin, who we knew from, like, years ago playing DDR, he did a remix of it.
1281800	1284900	This has nothing to do with video games, but you can't help but admit that thing's gotta
1284900	1285900	be DDR-inspired.
1285900	1288760	Well, he did that, and he said, I emailed him, I'm like, dude, when are you gonna come
1288760	1289760	on the show again?
1289760	1290760	You're, like, famous and stuff.
1290760	1291760	You gotta come back.
1291760	1295760	He said he would come back and talk games with us and maybe show us some more remixes.
1295760	1296760	Who knows?
1296760	1298440	I ran into him in a line for a movie.
1298440	1299440	Really?
1299440	1300440	A couple months ago.
1300440	1304680	No, like, a couple months ago, but I don't remember what movie we were seeing.
1304680	1305680	Nice.
1305680	1309800	All right, so anyhow, lots of things to look forward to on Orange Launch Radio coming up.
1309800	1312840	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1312840	1316800	Loki, please take us to video game chat, because obviously we're having problems with that
1316800	1317800	tonight.
1317800	1324780	All right, well, there is a big old stink this week having to do with Fox News and Mass
1324780	1325780	Effect.
1325780	1331960	Apparently, they aired a little segment called Sex Box, and they were talking about how Mass
1331960	1338280	Effect featured a full digital character nudity and had explicit sex and all this stuff.
1338280	1344760	And, of course, anyone that's played Mass Effect knows that that's completely false.
1344760	1347720	But nonetheless, though, they were on there.
1347720	1357080	They actually had an expert, I'd say a psychology expert or something, who was kind of pimping
1357080	1358840	out her book.
1358840	1365560	And at the same time, also in defense, they had Jeff Knightley, who was basically from
1365560	1366560	EA.
1366560	1367560	Isn't it Jeff Keighley?
1367560	1368560	Keighley Knightley.
1368560	1369560	Knightley is Kira Knightley.
1369560	1370560	She's Pirates of the Caribbean.
1370560	1371560	Jeff Keighley.
1371560	1372560	Caribbean.
1372560	1373560	Caribbean.
1373560	1374560	Whatever.
1374560	1378000	So, Orange Lounge Radio, we pronounce stuff good.
1378000	1380200	I learned it how to read.
1380200	1383000	I learned it on Orange Lounge.
1383000	1389440	Anyways, so, all you need to know, okay, is that basically they went back and forth for
1389440	1392600	about 30 seconds talking about this game.
1392600	1398460	The psychologist and, you know, the host hadn't played the game, but yet they were still claiming
1398460	1400000	all this stuff.
1400000	1407040	So anyways, as the week progressed, I went kind of crazy.
1407040	1411360	First EA was saying, you know, they're pissed off that all this stuff was said.
1411360	1414080	This is complete outright lies.
1414080	1420560	They want a correction from Fox to basically fess up to not having played the game and
1420560	1423520	just making up lies off the cuff.
1423520	1428640	So of course Fox said, no, we're not going to do a correction, but hey, you can come
1428640	1430960	on to one of our shows again.
1430960	1435600	And to which, you know, basically they said fuck off.
1435600	1441600	Anyways, apparently the woman, of course, the psychologist, she has a book called The
1441600	1444120	Cult of Perfection and it happened to be on Amazon.
1444120	1448320	Well, gamers got pissed off and they, of course, you know, realized, hey, her book's on there.
1448320	1452480	And so they left her a bunch of negative reviews clearly stating that they have not read her
1452480	1457360	book but that it's, you know, inappropriate for minors and that it's like, here's the
1457360	1460440	thing that got me...
1460440	1461440	It's not that funny, Chris.
1461440	1464240	But it's the exact same thing she was doing.
1464240	1470320	Yeah, it was, which is ironic, but the internet is LOL like that, I mean, seriously.
1470320	1473480	But here's the thing, I don't know how many of you actually went on to Amazon and started
1473480	1474480	reading the book.
1474480	1476720	It's like, you know, it's a self-help book for women.
1476720	1479040	It's like something they give out to young women.
1479040	1483840	Here's the best part, by now when we're talking about this, all those negative reviews have
1483840	1487320	been removed, the ones that gamers left.
1487320	1489320	What's left, though, is still negative reviews.
1489320	1491560	They weren't good to begin with, I mean, so...
1491560	1495000	Well, here's the thing is that I actually started reading some of the book, and I'm
1495000	1499920	thinking, as I'm reading it, I'm going, why was she invited to talk about video games?
1499920	1502920	Her book has nothing to do.
1502920	1507380	I mean, if you're going to bring on someone to dog video games, fucking, you know which
1507380	1511400	attention whore whose initials start with J and T will be there at the drop of the hat
1511400	1513960	to come talk about video games and bash them, come on.
1513960	1514960	At least call him.
1514960	1515960	I'm sorry.
1515960	1519800	She's too busy chasing an ambulance, you know, so...
1519800	1520800	Apparently.
1520800	1527000	Anyways, so, you know, like I said, they trashed her book on Amazon, or all of her books, apparently
1527000	1532360	she has a few books, and they all suck, including Ben-There-Done-That-Kept-The-Jewelry and The
1532360	1538320	Fixer-Upper-Man, which is talking about how all men are fixer-uppers, so, yeah, she's
1538320	1539320	awesome.
1539320	1544600	I hope, you know, I gotta wonder, I mean, don't get me wrong, she is pretty hot, okay,
1544600	1545600	so I'll give you that.
1545600	1546600	She's pretty hot.
1546600	1547600	I'm sorry.
1547600	1552720	No, she's not, she's got a fucked up nose, and she's got that pose that looks like it's
1552720	1553720	post-metapause.
1553720	1558920	Okay, whatever, okay, well, she's a deranged woman.
1558920	1561360	Anyways, so, to be fair-
1561360	1563040	She clearly sounds retarded.
1563040	1567200	To be fair, I don't know if you're gonna cover this, maybe I'm cutting you off, I don't care,
1567200	1572320	she retracted her statement, she retracted, I was just getting there, anyways, I just
1572320	1573320	got served.
1573320	1579440	I remember Cooper Lawrence did retract her statement, saying that, you know, she really
1579440	1585640	regrets saying that, and now seeing the game's sex scenes, seeing it's kind of a joke, you
1585640	1592080	know, she's seen more explicit sexual content on Lost than, you know, this game, so.
1592080	1596960	Or other Fox programming, such as 24, Family Guy, which had a whole thing about side boob,
1596960	1598560	if I remember right, I mean, I-
1598560	1600560	It's my side boob.
1600560	1605340	Anyways, that's all you see in Mass Effect, is a little side boob, come on.
1605340	1610200	And then, of course, not to be left out, Adam Sessler actually gave his opinion on the whole
1610200	1615200	thing, and I thought he actually phrased it quite well, you know, plus one respect from
1615200	1618640	me, for him, but, you know.
1618640	1620560	From one nerdy white guy to another.
1620560	1621560	Exactly, you know.
1621560	1622560	Congrats.
1622560	1626900	But, you know, because usually I think he's kind of a tool, but, you know, actually, he
1626900	1633120	wasn't bad, you know, I don't know, I think he made his point quite nicely, and, you know,
1633120	1637680	basically this whole thing is ridiculous, and he also dogged her book without reading
1637680	1638680	it, so.
1638680	1644000	Okay, internets, I, I lolled at the whole, you know, bashing her book when you hadn't
1644000	1649160	read it, just doing the same thing she did, however, she did apologize, people screw up,
1649160	1653220	she made a mistake, I say leave her alone, you need to fight the real enemy.
1653220	1654640	Who is the real enemy in this case?
1654640	1655640	Fox News.
1655640	1656640	Fox News.
1656640	1661440	I dare and balance my big fat ass, I mean, come on, this isn't even a political thing,
1661440	1664920	this is nothing to do with Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, this is just about,
1664920	1668120	that was the most piss poorly researched thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.
1668120	1670400	Did you see the round table discussion that came afterwards?
1670400	1674320	Oh, oh, oh my God, I wanted to barf, Chris, any thoughts?
1674320	1678360	You know, I don't know if you'd already heard about this, I posted this in my LJ, and, you
1678360	1684640	know, I posted the entire interview, and it's just like, the retardedness of these people
1684640	1689600	just blew my head off, you know, it's like they're like saying, God, I can't even remember
1689600	1694040	now, you know, it's just like, you know, I don't want my child to have to be subject
1694040	1699600	to this, and like totally going off on, I don't remember what they said, no, but it
1699600	1700760	was just like.
1700760	1705060	I just can't, I didn't know, literally one of them was like, I just can't believe that
1705060	1708520	we as parents have to monitor everything our children play.
1708520	1714280	Oh God, yeah, exactly, here, here, I'll, I'll, I have this direct from my LJ, I'll just
1714280	1719840	write what, or I'll just read off kind of the part I said.
1719840	1723840	As to the blonde bimbo, I know being a parent is hard, and you just magically get pregnant
1723840	1727760	and are forced to care for a baby that you had no responsibility in creating it all,
1727760	1731760	but there is all sorts, and there is all sorts of bad stuff coming from places like the interwebs
1731760	1735600	and video games, but do us all a favor and attempt to sound a little more mature when
1735600	1740280	you say that simply monitoring what your child sees is a much, is a much harder job.
1740280	1744520	Now here's even better, Daryl, you know, you know, I know a lot of these, um, you know,
1744520	1747800	adults are playing video games and stuff, but you know when those adults are gone, you
1747800	1751640	know their kids are, they're playing, they're playing their parents' video games, I'm like,
1751640	1756520	well then why don't you fucking put the parental, you know, protection or codes and stuff on
1756520	1761200	there to fix that, I mean, since you're aware that they're going to be playing your games,
1761200	1763320	why don't you, I don't know, solve the problem?
1763320	1767000	It was just one of the most journalistically irresponsible things I've ever seen in my
1767000	1771760	entire life, and they should all be ashamed of themselves for having their names attached
1771760	1774280	to that piece, except for Jeff Keighley, which, you know, obviously was the only one that
1774280	1777040	knew what he was talking about, the only one that knew anything about games, honestly.
1777040	1779880	I laugh when he's like, have you played this game?
1779880	1782560	Well, no, but I've watched videos on it.
1782560	1787000	He knew, going in, he knew, well, to his credit, obviously he's a smart guy, you know, he's
1787000	1791740	a well-respected journalist, he probably knew going into this, he's like, Fox News wants
1791740	1794680	me to talk about video games, yeah, I know what's going to happen.
1794680	1797880	Like he knew, he knew somebody was going to come on there that didn't know their shit,
1797880	1801960	he had enough smarts to have the foresight, I mean, you could tell that was his first
1801960	1803280	question right out of the gate, you know.
1803280	1807760	Oh, oh, and then my favorite, Darryl, well, Darryl, you know, finding the ratings is so
1807760	1811760	hard, you know, you have to look on the back of the box and it's not there, actually, no,
1811760	1817600	you're wrong, it's on the front of the box, and on the back of the box, so you're an idiot.
1817600	1822840	Whereas on a movie poster, it's a tiny little thing at the very bottom of the poster, I
1822840	1827320	mean, you know, and the ratings, it's okay, the ratings on movies are all on the back
1827320	1830800	of the box, not one rating is on the front of the box unless it's, of course, you know,
1830800	1833520	pimping out that it's an unrated director's cut or something like that.
1833520	1838060	I think it's just disgusting and hypocritical when Fox Television runs all the stuff that's
1838060	1842400	way more pornographic than Mass Effect could ever be, which is actually kind of a shame
1842400	1845200	because Mass Effect should have been a little more pornographic, but anyhow, it's beside
1845200	1851480	the point, but Fox TV, like, you know, you see way worse things on there, I swear to
1851480	1856440	God everybody involved from Fox News with that little piece needs to come on the TV
1856440	1861360	and apologize for being an asshat, I will accept nothing less.
1861360	1865520	I want that blondie to come out and say, I, blondie, apologize to the world for being
1865520	1869480	an asshat, that's what I want.
1869480	1870480	It'll never happen.
1870480	1871480	When was that, Chris?
1871480	1875880	Well, I mean, I'm going to start studying psychology, this is what I want to do with
1875880	1881320	my life, and I just love the psychologist that came on, she was like, you know, discussing
1881320	1887040	the psychologies of, you know, all the, you know, children see this and they think it's
1887040	1888040	real.
1888040	1890000	No, they don't.
1890000	1896680	Video games and any sort of entertainment, this does not count, you know, if your child
1896680	1901760	is going off and killing people because of video games, psychologically, that's not the
1901760	1905880	video game's fault, it's because your child is mentally unstable, and guess whose fucking
1905880	1907400	fault that is?
1907400	1908400	Your fault.
1908400	1909800	The parent's fault.
1909800	1913320	It all stems back from the parents, you know, they're probably going through the first stage
1913320	1917120	of development and they fucked up majorly, so, you know, I just love it when these people
1917120	1923040	sit there and tell you, it's like, you know, video games and all this stuff, it's hurting
1923040	1924740	our children, they're, you know.
1924740	1930220	To be fair, there are mental conditions that, you know, could be, but that's usually outside
1930220	1934480	the norm, you know, a lot of these kids on Maury Povich who are out of control and stuff,
1934480	1935480	that's the parents.
1935480	1941360	That's again, well, if it is a psychological disorder that requires medication, again,
1941360	1945720	I give that back to, yeah, that's not the parent's fault that their child is like that
1945720	1951080	because there's a chemical imbalance that's going on, but the parent needs to be responsible
1951080	1955800	enough to understand that and take them to the proper doctors and explain to them the
1955800	1962840	proper, you know, it all stems back to your responsibility as a parent of what you want
1962840	1964040	your child to see and do.
1964040	1967440	Alright, we've got to stop giving Fox News so much attention here on this program, but
1967440	1970120	I do want to respond to some stuff in chat here.
1970120	1973600	Chat at orangehonestradio.com, some comments, rostielut says, Sky, you have to understand
1973600	1977720	that Fox News is struggling to get beyond its little niche of right-wing shitheads.
1977720	1980720	They're nothing more than a bottom-run cable networks.
1980720	1983640	Their ratings are probably lower than Lifetime and Spike.
1983640	1985040	I don't know.
1985040	1988960	Let's see, binary667 says, what do you have against Blondie?
1988960	1990280	That's some quality music.
1990280	1994760	Obviously, when I say Blondie, I'm not saying Debra Harry has to come apologize.
1994760	1995760	She didn't do anything.
1995760	2000000	If Debra Harry has to apologize for anything, have her apologize for the Blondie reunion
2000000	2001000	album.
2001000	2002000	But, anyway, that's besides the point.
2002000	2003000	You know who I'm talking about.
2003000	2004000	I'm not talking about Debra Harry.
2004000	2013000	Let's see, Porto Combat says, Fox News, you are not the father.
2013000	2024040	Sadly enough, if there was an argument or something like Springer or Maury Povich or
2024040	2027560	something like that, it would actually probably be more intelligent than what's on Fox News
2027560	2028560	right now.
2028560	2033600	Alright, we've got to get back to some happier topics.
2033600	2036400	Things that won't make us so damn angry.
2036400	2039400	If we hadn't done this right out the gate, we'd probably be doing the FUs right about
2039400	2041080	now, but we'll have to save those for later.
2041080	2042840	Let's talk about something happy.
2042840	2047800	Let's get some happy news here to make us forget this whole Fox debacle.
2047800	2050640	Res HD, that's a nice happy subject, right?
2050640	2051880	You know what's even better?
2051880	2055960	Is that it is very possible this game is coming out this week, especially a lot of people
2055960	2057280	seem to think so are convinced.
2057280	2061240	Well, you said it's going to come out this month, and I think this is the last week left.
2061240	2062240	There is that.
2062240	2066800	And then also, there was a quote from Q Entertainment, quote, the game is being prepped and it's
2066800	2068600	just waiting for the green light.
2068600	2069600	Maybe next week?
2069600	2075200	So, in other words, basically, Q Entertainment is just saying, we're done, it's there, waiting
2075200	2078640	to go, we're just waiting for someone at Microsoft to push the button.
2078640	2084160	So that will be very happy when Res HD, I'll have that on my TV all the time, and we'll
2084160	2086360	never have a need to put my TV on Fox News ever again.
2086360	2092460	Well, I was reading, they had an interview with Mizuguchi about how to play it with the
2092460	2096440	other controllers and stuff, they said put one on your feet, put one on your back or
2096440	2100000	something like that, and I don't know what to do with the third one.
2100000	2103480	Put it in a happy place.
2103480	2108040	Put it in the spot that most suits you.
2108040	2110680	Let's just leave it at that, right, Jamie?
2110680	2111800	I guess so.
2111800	2115080	Man, some people are desperate.
2115080	2119080	Anyway, there is a contest going on in the UK.
2119080	2125360	Microsoft is having some Halo fans to make videos about Master Chief in everyday situations
2125360	2128660	that do not involve Halo.
2128660	2135020	And if they win, then they will be accepted, well, they will get to go to a film school
2135020	2142840	for a month in LA for, I guess, special lessons, but they said you can use a video camera,
2142840	2151000	you can use the game itself, animation, however you want to do it, it just has to, you know,
2151000	2155320	be Master Chief in a situation apart from the Halo universe.
2155320	2163200	And it's for European gamers over 18, submissions are to be in between January 31st and March
2163200	2165040	21st this year.
2165040	2169200	Here's an idea, kids, and if you win with this idea, you only have to, you know, credit
2169200	2170840	me.
2170840	2175000	Master Chief responding to this Fox News story.
2175000	2176000	Think about it.
2176000	2182720	Well, for anyone who's interested in it, it's Halo Re-Cut, is what the contest is called.
2182720	2188240	It's at xbox.com slash en dash gb slash Halo Re-Cut, all one word.
2188240	2189240	So if you want to check it out.
2189240	2192240	Well, I hope somebody we know wins it, so good luck to all of you.
2192240	2195320	If you win it, send us an email.
2195320	2196320	Yes.
2196320	2198520	We'll interview you.
2198520	2202480	Another first person shooter game that's pretty fun, Team Fortress 2 is going to be getting
2202480	2207280	some unlockable weapons and new game modes pretty soon, which is pretty awesome.
2207280	2211960	They're one of the first earned weapons, I guess, that's going to be for the medic, and
2211960	2218040	it's an over-healer, which apparently I believe is a tool you can use to give a temporary
2218040	2225160	boost to your other player's health up to 150%.
2225160	2231000	And this is also part of the balancing that Valve is doing.
2231000	2235440	They're also going to be talking about some other unlockable weapons, including a healing
2235440	2239400	ray and some other stuff.
2239400	2244480	Also they were going to be introducing a new map, Gold Rush, and there's going to be another
2244480	2251920	one coming out as well, it's a remake, I guess, of an older map called Badlands, and basically
2251920	2258100	in Gold Rush the blue team must escort a mining cart through tunnels, and the cart moves faster
2258100	2265080	with the more blue team members nearby, but stops completely if a red player gets near.
2265080	2268640	So that's kind of neat, I like how they're mixing it up and supporting the game well
2268640	2273000	after it's come out, so looking forward to it.
2273000	2277360	That's always good to see a game get a lot of lovin' after it's still out, which is yet
2277360	2280680	another reason, going back to what I said earlier in the show, why I love Oblivion.
2280680	2282840	They were coming out with new shit for that game for a long time, and granted they're
2282840	2283840	done now, but...
2283840	2286560	I wish they had multiplayer in that, or at least co-op or something like that.
2286560	2290200	It's almost like they built the game to have that at one point, because when you conjure
2290200	2295000	things, like let's say I conjure a skeleton, my character's name is Bunny, don't laugh,
2295000	2299520	but when you actually point at the skeleton it says, Bunny's Skeleton.
2299520	2303440	Almost like it was built so that at one point it was going to have a multiplayer environment,
2303440	2304440	you know what I mean?
2304440	2308120	Like why would it need to say it's my skeleton, couldn't it just say your skeleton, or conjured
2308120	2309120	skeleton?
2309120	2311320	Hell, they could just re-release the game with multiplayer built into it.
2311320	2312320	They probably will.
2312320	2315880	Kind of like how they do it with Twisted Metal, Black Online, or something like that.
2315880	2320280	That might be how they try to hold this over for Elder Scrolls V.
2320280	2321280	That'd be cool.
2321280	2322280	Who knows?
2322280	2326520	Well, another game that continues to get some love after it's out is Halo 3, but this isn't
2326520	2327640	anything official.
2327640	2331640	This is actually something that's been put together for your iPhone.
2331640	2338060	It's a website called www.ihalostats.com, and it's a website that's built specifically
2338060	2342320	for your iPhone that will allow you to check your Halo stats from anywhere.
2342320	2347320	Why you'd want to do that, I don't really know, but hey, you have that option.
2347320	2349420	It's for picking up chicks, of course.
2349420	2352400	It's like, dude, look how awesome I am in Halo 3.
2352400	2354880	Think of how awesome I'll be in bed.
2354880	2355880	Think about it.
2355880	2356880	Exactly.
2356880	2362820	But there's a little disclaimer right there on the website, iHaloStats.com is not affiliated
2362820	2365140	with Bungie LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2365140	2368980	So it is something completely fan-made, and to their credit, you know what, even if I
2368980	2374600	think this is a little, I don't know, useless, it's kind of cool in that, you know, hey,
2374600	2378520	somebody had a weird idea and kind of built this whole thing, and it seems to run pretty
2378520	2379520	well.
2379520	2383240	So, you know, props to them for seeing their strange idea through to completion, if that
2383240	2385000	makes any sense at all.
2385000	2387440	I don't know.
2387440	2395640	Well, for more gaming news, for anyone who is a fan of Condemned, Condemned 2 comes out
2395640	2403180	on March 11th, according to Sega, and it's gory and violent and weird.
2403180	2407200	Which means I'm going to go put a pre-order down right now, right?
2407200	2408200	I won't.
2408200	2412280	Well, actually, the first one was kind of, it was just freaky, it's like a serial killer
2412280	2413280	type game, you know?
2413280	2417360	Now that I think about it, we did start Condemned, but I don't think that after a little bit
2417360	2419820	of it, I was too much into it afterwards.
2419820	2425000	All you need to know about Condemned 2, and I can sell it to you in one sentence, it has
2425000	2430160	exploding babies.
2430160	2433740	You know what, Loki, that might have done it, actually, that's pretty awesome.
2433740	2434740	Exploding babies?
2434740	2438960	I'm looking at this picture of a guy with a meat hook.
2438960	2440960	Why does it go boom?
2440960	2443760	Why are they exploding?
2443760	2445960	I don't know.
2445960	2447640	Somebody exploded them?
2447640	2448640	I don't know.
2448640	2449640	How old are they?
2449640	2450640	Well, they're babies!
2450640	2451640	I mean, Chris!
2451640	2460340	I'm sorry, I just came from a household where there was just a week-old infant in my arms
2460340	2463440	holding just sort of exploding babies, sad me.
2463440	2464440	Shut up!
2464440	2468240	Well, at least it wasn't ticking.
2468240	2469320	Here's my advice, Chris.
2469320	2470320	Don't play Condemned 2.
2470320	2472840	There's plenty of other video games out there for your enjoyment.
2472840	2473840	Why don't you play?
2473840	2476440	Here, Chris, I want you to go get a game.
2476440	2478280	It's called Imagine Babies.
2478280	2481280	I have it in my backpack.
2481280	2487800	It's nothing but happy babies, rainbows, diaper changing, I don't know.
2487800	2491960	It's all the glory of having babies.
2491960	2496280	That's the first time I changed a diaper in my life, and I really enjoyed it.
2496280	2498720	That's a different type of exploding baby.
2498720	2500160	I'm breaking out the DS right now.
2500160	2501880	Yeah, it's not like that.
2501880	2506320	All right, Condemned 2, now with exploding babies, enjoy, March 11th.
2506320	2511360	Well, there's another game I'm looking forward to, far more than Condemned 2.
2511360	2516480	Of course, that would be Grand Theft Auto IV, and the announcement that it was actually
2516480	2522640	coming out this spring instead of the end of this year, or possibly not this year.
2522640	2525440	That's just all sorts of awesome.
2525440	2530840	It's dated now for April 29th, and it will be coming out, of course, on PlayStation 3
2530840	2535720	and Xbox 360, as well as a special edition, which I already have preordered, and I can't
2535720	2536720	wait.
2536720	2542200	The other thing, though, Rockstar was commenting on why it's been delayed, and they said, of
2542200	2548680	course, one of the contributing factors was that they had some technical challenges with
2548680	2553360	the PlayStation 3 version, and, of course, they wouldn't go into what the challenges
2553360	2554360	were.
2554360	2557960	They said it's not an issue anymore because both versions are now neck and neck in their
2557960	2558960	development phases.
2558960	2564440	We were just having problems getting the hookers just right in the PlayStation 3 version.
2564440	2570560	Yeah, so they basically said it's really no surprise to anyone that the PS3 was definitely
2570560	2573560	a contributing factor to the delay.
2573560	2575840	I have to go back to the last story because this is too good.
2575840	2581400	In our chat room, Ekum, which is just Mike spelled backwards, says, imagine exploding
2581400	2584480	babies coming to a DS near you.
2584480	2589300	By the way, exploding babies are in the trailer for the game, so watch the trailer for the
2589300	2591720	game and you will see the exploding babies.
2591720	2593960	Chris, don't watch the trailer for Gundam 2, please.
2593960	2596360	Oh my god, this is too cute.
2596360	2598800	You're actually playing Imagine Babies here in the studio?
2598800	2599800	Yeah.
2599800	2603160	Get that filth out of my house.
2603160	2605800	You need to blame Loki, he gave it to me.
2605800	2610360	You know what you should be playing, Dark Sakura, is a wonderful game on Xbox Live called
2610360	2612820	Every Extend Extra Extreme.
2612820	2615320	That game is pretty awesome and it's on PSP as well.
2615320	2620840	The only gripe I have with the Xbox Live one is that the game doesn't get a whole lot of
2620840	2623480	variety in it in the basic modes.
2623480	2629160	It doesn't have quite the same hypnotic backgrounds that the PSP one had and the skins don't change
2629160	2633260	that much, but to make up for that lack of variety, to Q Entertainment's credit, they
2633260	2637360	have the custom tracks mode in the game and I think a lot of people forget about this.
2637360	2642240	You can actually play Every Extend Extra Extreme with your own custom tracks.
2642240	2645280	The problem with the mode this week is that it wasn't perfect.
2645280	2650260	You can either manually put in the BPM or you can tap it out to get the beats per second
2650260	2656120	or beats per minute or what have you, but you couldn't exactly fine tune it until now.
2656120	2660840	Q Entertainment has released a code that will allow you to make a fine adjustment to your
2660840	2661840	custom music.
2661840	2663800	You better write this one down because it's very complicated.
2663800	2665580	Very complicated code to remember.
2665580	2666580	Here you go.
2666580	2667580	This is the code.
2667580	2671560	At the start menu, you're going to use the left and right triggers to put in this code.
2671560	2672560	Here it is.
2672560	2673560	Get your pencils ready.
2673560	2674560	Here it is.
2674560	2675560	Left.
2675560	2676560	Right.
2676560	2677560	Left.
2677560	2678560	Right.
2678560	2679560	Left.
2679560	2680560	Right.
2680560	2681560	Left.
2681560	2682560	Right.
2682560	2683560	Left.
2683560	2684560	Right.
2684560	2685560	Left.
2685560	2686560	Left.
2686560	2687560	Left.
2687560	2688560	Ok, right.
2688560	2689560	Alright, there you go.
2689560	2691300	Wait, wait, wait, what was after left?
2691300	2692300	Ah, right.
2692300	2693300	Ok.
2693300	2694300	So there it is.
2694300	2698400	So you can just have a Q Entertainment overload this week if you want to do this fine tuning
2698400	2702460	mode and then Res HD and hell you could play 99 Nights if you're at it if you want to play
2702460	2703600	a bad Q Entertainment game.
2703600	2705680	emotion It wasn't that bad.
2705680	2706460	It wasn't that bad.
2706460	2709560	It just wasn't that good either.
2709560	2710560	It was ok.
2710560	2713760	It was better than probably Kingdom Under Fire Circles.
2713760	2718360	Well, here's the thing. I have Q Entertainment up on a pedestal. I mean, seriously. Luminous, every extent.
2718360	2722460	Actually, you know I love my puzzle games. I have Q Entertainment up on a very high pedestal.
2722460	2724360	I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi a lot.
2724360	2728860	They need to stick to the puzzle music games. Do not deviate from the puzzle music games.
2728860	2734660	Although, can you imagine if 99 Nights had, like, some sort of musical beat thing to it, just like, you know...
2734660	2735460	Oh my god, okay.
2735460	2735960	Rez?
2735960	2741160	All you had to do, yeah, seriously, to make 99 Nights cooler, all you had to do was be slashing people to techno music,
2741160	2743460	and that would have been the coolest game ever.
2743460	2745860	Who wouldn't want to kill people to bad techno music? Come on.
2745860	2750360	That would be pretty awesome, like, something mixing, like, Dynasty Warriors with, like, Rez.
2750360	2750860	Hello?
2750860	2751560	I'd dig a- Hey!
2751560	2752460	I would totally play that.
2752460	2753360	Get on the ball, people!
2753360	2756860	Exploding babies in time with the music? Come on.
2756860	2757460	It'd be fun.
2757460	2761960	That would be kind of... wrong, but, you know, um...
2761960	2766460	If you want to be abstract, then sure, go the space draft route, you know?
2766460	2767960	They could do weasel stomping mode.
2767960	2770360	Son of Dad says Gunpei is God.
2770360	2772760	That's one of the few Q Entertainment games I haven't played is Gunpei.
2772760	2773560	Gunpei is great.
2773560	2774660	I've heard it's pretty good.
2774660	2779360	Uh, Gerardimo says, Rob, don't forget Meteos Disney Magic. That's worse than 99 Nights.
2779360	2783060	I enjoyed the original Meteos, actually, quite a bit, but...
2783060	2785360	I didn't play the Disney one. Did you play Disney Meteos?
2785360	2789960	Um, I've seen... I've seen it been played before, but I thought it was cute.
2789960	2794960	But I'm a Disney freak, so, you know, look at my online screen name, Disney Funk 10, so...
2794960	2795760	Shut up!
2797660	2798460	Nerd.
2798460	2803760	All right. How about some release dates? Let's travel the globe and find out what's coming soon to a retail store near you.
2803760	2804660	We'll start with Europe.
2804660	2807160	Do you need release, Rob?
2807160	2810860	Um, I don't know how to answer that.
2810860	2821060	How about on the 30th we get Chestmaster Live on Xbox 360 and ResHD given a date of the 30th in the UK.
2821060	2825760	On the first is Bombermanland on Wii. Try saying that three times fast.
2825760	2830760	Flat Out Head On on PSP, Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom, yay.
2830760	2834460	Lineage 2, The Camel on PC.
2834460	2840560	Um, PDC World Championship Darts 2008 on DS, which is really exciting, isn't it?
2840560	2841660	Yeah.
2841660	2849060	Puzzle Quest, Challenger of the Warlords on Wii, Sims 2 Castaway Stories on PC, and Zoo Hospital on DS.
2849060	2852660	Zoo Hospital? Oh boy!
2852660	2855260	Isn't that exciting?
2855260	2857760	Zoo Host-able.
2857760	2861860	I would like to know how many people have pre-orders on Zoo Hospital.
2861860	2863860	I've got mine in there. Do you?
2863860	2867660	Just making sure I don't want to miss out on Zoo Hospital.
2867660	2876260	You know, I was hoping that Chestmaster Live was actually Chestmaster Live, you know, like a pornographic version of it or something.
2876260	2881260	That'd be kind of cool, but no.
2881260	2889660	Let's see, the US isn't, you know, that busy this week, actually. It's pretty scarce.
2889660	2894460	And there's not going to be much that you're going to be interested in unless you love Bomberman.
2894460	2896260	In which case, there's a couple games for you.
2896260	2899760	Bomberman Land for the Wii and the PSP coming out.
2899760	2902660	A little mini-game with some adventure stuff in there as well.
2902660	2905560	And it's Bomberman, so there you go.
2905560	2909960	Bomberman Land Touch 2 for the DS is coming out.
2909960	2913960	Pursuit Force Xtreme Justice on the PSP.
2913960	2919160	And The Sims Castaway Stories on the PC.
2919160	2922160	What kind of stories do they have to tell?
2922160	2927660	Help! I'm trapped in a knock-off game of a once-popular franchise.
2927660	2931160	Help! I'm lost on an island.
2931160	2932660	Anything else to note?
2932660	2936060	I was just seeing if there's anything else that's funny.
2936060	2940660	Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.
2940660	2942460	Wait, say that one more time.
2942460	2947360	Pet Vet 3D Animal Hospital Down Under.
2947360	2951260	So we have Zoo Hospital coming out in Europe, and we have...
2951260	2954260	Is it the same game with just a different name or something?
2954260	2958760	Or is there really that big of a demand out there in the game marketplace for Zoo Hospital?
2958760	2962560	Dude, there's a lot of freaking Pet Vet games.
2962560	2969360	There's actually one that's kind of neat. It's a little different than your usual pet-the-animals-and-they-are-better type game.
2969360	2973760	They actually have one that's done like Phoenix Wright, that's a pet hospital game.
2973760	2975560	That's kind of neat.
2975560	2978760	I guess it's cute because it's a good game for kids.
2978760	2981760	It's a good game for kids, I'm sure, because how many...
2981760	2986460	Objection! You're not sick! You're faking any damn dog!
2986460	2990760	There's tons of eight- and nine-year-olds that want to be veterinarians when they grow up, you know?
2990760	2993760	So, I mean, I can...
2993760	2997260	If you want, I can go even more obscure here. We've got...
2997260	3007760	What is it? Pacific Storm Allies, AGEOD's American Civil War, 1861 through 1865.
3007760	3011260	Whoo! That's awesome!
3011260	3012560	And that's it.
3012560	3016960	Really, I don't want to go into any more details unless there's another Tycoon game,
3016960	3020360	because, you know, every week there's got to be a Tycoon game.
3020360	3023360	Oh, here's the one I was talking about, Paws and Claws Pet Resort.
3023360	3024360	But that's not for this week.
3024360	3025560	Pet Resort?
3025560	3026660	Pet Resort.
3026660	3027860	Awesome.
3027860	3032160	It used to be Paws and Claws Pet Resort Tycoon, so...
3032160	3035160	All right, let's head over to Japanese release dates.
3035160	3038560	Oh my god, this is so... You guys, seriously, look at this.
3038560	3040360	How ridiculous-looking is that?
3040360	3042460	You get to pamper the pets.
3042460	3046560	It does look kind of cute in a really, like, excess kind of way.
3046560	3052960	All the animals have little hats and sunglasses on and shirts. That's so cute.
3052960	3057660	Like, really cute, as in, like, a Scholastic Weekly type cute.
3057660	3059360	Highlights for children type cute.
3059360	3060060	Yeah, exactly.
3060060	3060960	Exactly.
3060960	3064560	All right, let's go to Japanese release dates, because this is one of the fun parts of the show,
3064560	3070360	is getting to hear me horribly butcher the pronunciation of Japanese titles coming soon to Japan.
3070360	3075060	But we'll start with easy ones on the Xbox 360 Devil May Cry 4 on January 31st.
3075060	3080760	Need for Speed Pro Street also hitting January 31st, as well as Sega Rally Revo also hitting as well.
3080760	3084660	By the way, there is a Xbox 360 Plus Devil May Cry.
3084660	3088760	It's a bundle pack, also comes out in Japan on the 31st of this month.
3088760	3091560	Traveling over to some other systems, taking a look at the PlayStation 3.
3091560	3094560	Of course, they're getting Devil May Cry 4 on that system as well.
3094560	3099860	They're also getting Disgaea Hour of Darkness 3 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 on the 31st.
3099860	3108260	Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, as well as Assassin's Creed makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
3108260	3111660	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii, not a whole lot.
3111660	3115960	There's a game called Family Ski coming out from Namco Bandai on the 31st.
3115960	3119660	And I believe that uses the Wii Fit Balance Board, if you have it.
3119660	3121060	Oh, yes, that one. That's right.
3121060	3125860	We heard about that earlier, that Namco was putting that together for use with the Wii Fit.
3125860	3128360	So that's coming out this week, for those of you guys that bought Wii Fit over there.
3128360	3134260	Also another version of Need for Speed Pro Street, because you know Need for Speed has to come out everywhere.
3134260	3139760	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, another version of Need for Speed Pro Street.
3139760	3145160	Also, Tales of Destiny, the Director's Cut makes its way out on the PlayStation 2.
3145160	3149960	Cyanide with an X, I guess maybe that's Cyanide is coming out as well.
3149960	3151760	Is that on the PS2?
3151760	3152760	On the PS2.
3152760	3157260	That's a pretty cool game, actually. It's like a shoot-em-up game.
3157260	3158060	Bullet Hill.
3158060	3164460	This game is called, also coming out on the 31st, is called Your, Memories Off, Girls Style.
3164460	3166160	That's not one sentence, it's split up.
3166160	3171060	It's Your, Memories Off, Girls Style comes out as well.
3171060	3175360	I don't know quite what that is, but it's probably yet another game that's like, you know, I don't know.
3175360	3178460	It sounds like a dating sim for some reason, but I don't know.
3178460	3185360	Also coming out, Izumo II, Double Tacked comes out from GN Software on the PlayStation 2 this week.
3185360	3188860	Moving to some of the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS.
3188860	3191560	Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad.
3191560	3192560	I'm not making that up.
3192560	3193560	Loop Salad?
3193560	3197160	Loop Salad comes out on the DS this week.
3197160	3197960	What the fuck?
3197960	3201460	Loop Pop Cube, Loop Salad. I'm not even kidding, that's what it is.
3201460	3203560	There's a little penguin on the cover, it looks cute.
3203560	3205560	Weird looking thing.
3205560	3208160	That comes out on the Nintendo DS as well as
3208160	3215160	Hiromichi Onisan no Ayako Taisunavi comes out from Dorasu this week on the Nintendo DS.
3215160	3221460	And I love the cover, it's this very, very happy Japanese man standing in front of a rainbow.
3221460	3224160	Not that I'm sure it's insinuating anything, I'm just saying.
3224160	3227560	Is that like, you know, the Japanese version of the Wiggles over there or something like that?
3227560	3230260	It could be, actually, that's a very distinct thought.
3230260	3234360	So I linked that in chat, because, yeah, I don't know, he's very happy.
3234360	3235860	He's like Richard Simmons happy.
3235860	3238760	You should get a t-shirt with that on the front there.
3238760	3241060	Ah, it would be, yeah.
3241060	3244460	He's like the Japanese Ronald McDonald.
3244460	3245460	Yeah, I know that.
3245460	3250060	That picture is waiting to be 4chan'd into something, seriously.
3250060	3251460	Seriously, chat.
3251460	3258060	Look this game up if you're listening on the podcast and didn't get a chance to get the link in chat.
3258060	3264860	Lastly, let's go to Sony PSP, where there's a game called Patapon coming out on January 1st.
3264860	3267060	I have that on my PSP right now.
3267060	3267960	You like that? Is it good?
3267960	3270260	Yeah, I haven't played it yet.
3270260	3271360	Well, Jesus.
3271360	3273560	That's the eye of all one.
3273560	3278360	And lastly but not least, Sega Rally Revo also coming out on the Sony PSP.
3278360	3280960	I'll tell you what, I'll play it during break, and then I'll tell you how it is.
3280960	3282460	Yeah, you should tell us.
3282460	3285360	Alright, let's move on. Back to the gaming news.
3285360	3294860	Well, to move even further over to the UK, you know, there was the drama going on regarding the release of Manhunt 2.
3294860	3299160	And they had said that, yeah, it would be okay, there would be no harm in the game.
3299160	3304360	Well, the High Court has said, nah, it's gonna be harmful, so we don't want it.
3304360	3314160	Actually even stating that the Video Appeals Committee misinterpreted the term of actual harm,
3314160	3318460	and that they should have considered a wider realm of harm.
3318460	3332260	So, it will not be released in its current incarnation, because it will not be rated by the BBFC, which is the British form of film classification.
3332260	3337460	And there's no telling if it will be in any incarnation released.
3337460	3345260	You know, just a message to our friends over there in the UK who might be, you know, legally involved in all this.
3345260	3348760	Just release the damn game, because seriously, it's not gonna sell anyway.
3348760	3351060	They've all heard from us that the game sucks.
3351060	3355660	So, you know, just stop wasting the dollars, you know, getting the court order.
3355660	3356760	It's not that good anymore.
3356760	3359360	Just let them sell it, no one's gonna buy it. It sucks.
3359360	3362560	It was good when, you know, we didn't know what the game was gonna be like,
3362560	3366760	but now that it's been out, and we've seen the reviews, and we've played it, and we've kind of gotten over the,
3366760	3369560	oh wow, this was violent, okay, let's move along.
3369560	3373060	You know, if the British board wants to look at something, I mean, condemn 2.
3373060	3375260	Hello, exploding babies?
3375260	3378260	I mean, that might necessitate a ban or something.
3378260	3381760	But you don't understand, though, Rob.
3381760	3386060	Exploding babies, I mean, that has nothing to do with, like, sexual stuff.
3386060	3388260	So, you know, that's also another reason why we...
3388260	3390760	Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
3390760	3394960	Exploding babies, that's not as offensive as ripping off someone's testicles with pliers.
3394960	3398060	What?
3398060	3401160	Alright, let's keep moving with the gaming news.
3401160	3404160	So, let's see here.
3404160	3407160	This isn't really a big surprise.
3407160	3413860	Ubisoft has confirmed that there's gonna be a new Prince of Persia franchise coming in their next fiscal year,
3413860	3416560	which, you know, 2008, I guess that starts in March.
3416560	3419560	Big whoop.
3419560	3422560	I mean, we already knew this was kind of rumored to be coming out anyways,
3422560	3427060	and I see some, you know, artwork here that they were showing off.
3427060	3437260	No word, though, on when exactly it's gonna be out, because their fiscal year runs from basically March of this year through April of 2009.
3437260	3441260	So, somewhere in between there, we're gonna get a new Prince of Persia game.
3441260	3446560	And hopefully it looks like this, you know, piece of artwork that they have, because it looks like Strider.
3446560	3451060	But, you know, not a big surprise.
3451060	3452060	Hmm.
3452060	3454260	I'm going to the chat room and looking at some comments.
3454260	3458260	If you want to go to chat.orangelaungeradio.com and leave some comments.
3458260	3463260	Going back to the last story, RawstealUT says,
3463260	3466260	No more Manhunt 2, angry face.
3466260	3471260	Frisbee says, Come on, guys, Manhunt 2 is not a game to get locked up in the government.
3471260	3476260	Sonofdad says, Manhunt 2, no plastic knife attachment for the Wiimote yet?
3476260	3477260	They have those.
3477260	3478260	Shut up.
3478260	3483260	It's not a plastic knife, but it's a plastic sword, and then they've got, you know, stuff like that.
3483260	3485260	But, I don't know.
3485260	3487260	Let's see.
3487260	3491260	GS68 says, I should maybe take a break from game politics.
3491260	3496260	The story they've been running make me want to stab random people, I guess, in response.
3496260	3497260	Well, see, wait a minute.
3497260	3500260	Now, see, you're displaced anger there is part of the problem.
3500260	3503260	You know, video games make you want to stab random people.
3503260	3504260	No, I'm kidding.
3504260	3505260	I know that's just a question.
3505260	3510260	I'm sure in Japan, though, they probably have a knife attachment for, you know, the Wiimote.
3510260	3515260	I mean, they have attachments for all the different weapons in Ghost Squad in there,
3515260	3517260	so a knife maybe.
3517260	3519260	That'd be kind of neat.
3519260	3521260	You could pretend that the shark gun's a knife.
3521260	3524260	That's just, yeah, I mean, do you really need that?
3524260	3525260	I mean, come on.
3525260	3526260	It's a little strange.
3526260	3528260	Well, did you ever see the, did you see that story this week?
3528260	3532260	Someone made a replica energy sword.
3532260	3533260	No.
3533260	3538260	They made, it's an actual sword, but they made it, you know, look like the energy sword from Halo 3.
3538260	3539260	Interesting.
3539260	3541260	Some people have a lot of free time on their hands.
3541260	3547260	All right, well, let's move over to the PSP, and unfortunately, Sony needs a little more time on their hands
3547260	3549260	because Skype was announced for the PSP.
3549260	3551260	Remember, we talked about Skype a couple weeks ago on the show.
3551260	3554260	It's going to be coming to the PSP if you own a PSP Lite, that is,
3554260	3558260	because the lights have more memories on board, but they've been delayed.
3558260	3563260	Skype was supposed to hit the PSP on the 24th along with some companion microphones.
3563260	3566260	However, Sony had to come out with a press release that says in part,
3566260	3573260	quote, it was found that the microphone did not meet the Skype specifications, in part, to obtain certification.
3573260	3575260	Sorry, you still sound like a douche.
3575260	3577260	That is unacceptable.
3577260	3579260	If you've been listening to this show for any length of time,
3579260	3584260	there's a lot of people on Skype whose microphones have probably failed a lot of types of certifications.
3584260	3588260	I know that.
3588260	3589260	I know what you're doing.
3589260	3592260	I'm so excited to be honest with you.
3592260	3595260	Yeah, it sounds like it works to me because that's how all the Skype calls sound like.
3595260	3596260	I know.
3596260	3600260	Can we have Skype certify all our listeners' microphones or something?
3600260	3601260	Just kidding.
3601260	3603260	We heart the listeners and the ones that call in on Skype,
3603260	3606260	but just don't forget to call Echo 1-2-3 before you call our show.
3606260	3608260	That's all we ask, okay?
3608260	3612260	Anyhow, so no news yet on when this will be coming out for sure,
3612260	3614260	but we imagine the delay is not going to be that long.
3614260	3617260	I could imagine there's going to be third-party microphones and stuff like that.
3617260	3620260	I know there's headsets already for some of the SOCOM games,
3620260	3623260	which I imagine you could probably use those for Skype.
3623260	3624260	I don't understand why they're delaying all this stuff.
3624260	3627260	Oh, I'm probably guessing because everything that's Sony-related
3627260	3629260	seems to be delayed one time or another.
3629260	3632260	Yeah, it's kind of funny because, of course, all the Sony haters came out and said,
3632260	3635260	here we go again, delay station 3.
3635260	3636260	Like all the cool stuff.
3636260	3638260	Except this is a delay station portable, okay?
3638260	3639260	That's true, that's true.
3639260	3642260	All right, really quick, some comments from chat,
3642260	3644260	and then we'll get to the next story Jamie's going to do for us.
3644260	3648260	ActDef says in chat, yes, if you sell something with the Skype name,
3648260	3649260	you have to be certified by them.
3649260	3652260	So that is part of the point is that the microphones are chatted to you
3652260	3654260	as they get it, you know, Best Buy, Circuit City, whatever.
3654260	3657260	It's just some random mic that happens to be a USB mic.
3657260	3659260	But if you're going to sell something with the Skype name on it,
3659260	3662260	like the PSP's going to do, it has to be Skype certified, which makes sense.
3662260	3665260	And Tiger Claw says pretty soon the Skype calls on OLR
3665260	3668260	are going to be done by people using Skype on their PSP.
3668260	3671260	I don't think that's actually going to be a bad thing at all because, hey,
3671260	3673260	if the mics are certified and everything's been tested,
3673260	3675260	you know it's going to work.
3675260	3677260	So I look forward to that day actually.
3677260	3679260	I don't know about you guys, but that'll be good.
3679260	3680260	I'll cry.
3680260	3681260	Why would you cry?
3681260	3682260	Because...
3682260	3684260	Cry tears of joy or tears of pain?
3684260	3686260	Cry tears of apathy.
3686260	3691260	I can't wait to talk on my PSP out in public looking like a complete douche.
3691260	3692260	Exactly.
3692260	3694260	Yo, what's up, man?
3694260	3696260	I'm totally on my PSP.
3696260	3697260	You know what it is?
3697260	3698260	It's the N-Gage all over again.
3698260	3702260	You don't have to side talk on it because it has a microphone.
3702260	3704260	Although the microphone that they're going to have is like
3704260	3706260	plugs into the USB thing on the front,
3706260	3710260	I think on the top of the actual system,
3710260	3712260	which doesn't make any sense to me when you think about it
3712260	3715260	because why won't they just have a headset or something they can plug in?
3715260	3716260	I know.
3716260	3718260	So instead you're just like, hello?
3718260	3719260	Hello?
3719260	3722260	Talking with the PSP in front of you and be like, hi.
3722260	3723260	How's it going?
3723260	3725260	Yeah, totally.
3725260	3727260	Or do like they have with the iPhone.
3727260	3729260	Their headphones are so smart.
3729260	3731260	They've got just a little tiny microphone,
3731260	3734260	but I was outside in the wind talking to my mom on it
3734260	3736260	and she heard me just fine.
3736260	3737260	I've got to say this.
3737260	3741260	There's Justin TV chat and there's our chat at Orange Laundry Radio.
3741260	3743260	Mac Man's making smart ass comments in both.
3743260	3747260	He says in the Justin TV chat, echo 123 is for wussies.
3747260	3749260	Call in with no sure quality test.
3749260	3751260	Hell, don't even buy a microphone.
3751260	3752260	You, sir, are part of the problem.
3752260	3755260	But he says in chat at orangelaundryradio.com,
3755260	3756260	yo, I'm on my PSP.
3756260	3757260	Want to pick me up?
3757260	3761260	Want to pick me up?
3761260	3762260	Sorry, I just.
3762260	3763260	No.
3763260	3764260	No, I don't want to pick you up.
3764260	3765260	Can I do my story now?
3765260	3766260	Yes, you may.
3766260	3768260	Something that's even more retarded than Skype.
3768260	3769260	Uh-oh.
3769260	3770260	Well, then that microphone anyway.
3770260	3772260	Someone made an eye of judgment table
3772260	3777260	to make up for the fact that the camera is easily bumped into poor lighting.
3777260	3783260	So he takes this little table and builds a custom hardwood replica of the mat
3783260	3786260	and apparently it works just fine,
3786260	3791260	but I was like, people like this game enough to care?
3791260	3793260	Has that sold any more copies?
3793260	3795260	Oh, no, I don't think it has.
3795260	3797260	What is the latest update on the eye of judgment numbers?
3797260	3801260	Still hasn't broke another 100,000 or even 10,000.
3801260	3804260	Can we count table sales as part of the million?
3804260	3808260	Honestly, if you want to, go right ahead.
3808260	3812260	Before, I mentioned it in that thread because I was egging on people in there.
3812260	3817260	I said I'd be surprised if it surpassed 300,000 units.
3817260	3820260	But right now, it's really starting to flatten off.
3820260	3827260	I mean, it sold 4,000 units in the U.S. only in the last week or so.
3827260	3829260	All right, since now we are going to add table counts,
3829260	3831260	what were we at, 160,000?
3831260	3836260	Adding the tables, we're now up to 160,001
3836260	3839260	because that's how many of these tables will probably sell.
3839260	3841260	Well, it's just this guy that made it.
3841260	3843260	It doesn't say anything about it being retailed.
3843260	3844260	Oh, okay.
3844260	3847260	I mean, there's a comment on there that it would be retail ready
3847260	3849260	if they add like a cup holder,
3849260	3852260	but he just made this for himself.
3852260	3853260	So this is unacceptable.
3853260	3855260	Where am I going to put my drink on this table?
3855260	3857260	This guy's pretty hardcore to do something like that.
3857260	3859260	You've got to be a pretty hardcore Eye of Judgment fan.
3859260	3863260	This guy's name is Matt, and he plays as Havok.
3863260	3866260	Watch out for Havok.
3866260	3870260	And I'm just still boggled.
3870260	3874260	I guess if you like it enough and you want to do that,
3874260	3876260	I guess kudos to you.
3876260	3879260	But from my perspective, since I don't really care for Eye of Judgment,
3879260	3883260	I'm just like, okay.
3883260	3884260	I know, I'm always kind of like,
3884260	3887260	you could have built like a house for a cat or a dog.
3887260	3893260	But then I think about that I did actually have my place mat
3893260	3896260	that I made when I played Magic back in the day.
3896260	3898260	It wasn't a table.
3898260	3901260	It was a plastic mat.
3901260	3905260	It used to be the shit, now it's the crap.
3905260	3906260	All right, let's move on.
3906260	3908260	Please, before we get into Magic the Gathering talk,
3908260	3910260	please look at the same show.
3910260	3917260	Anyways, Sony's really trying to catch up with the whole Nintendo fad
3917260	3919260	of releasing consoles in different colors.
3919260	3925260	Now in Asia, you will be able to pick up a red PS2 system.
3925260	3930260	Also, what's kind of neat is, according to some FCC filings,
3930260	3935260	we're going to be seeing a white PS3 coming to the U.S. as well.
3935260	3937260	So, new colors, yay.
3937260	3940260	Because that's why people weren't buying your PS3.
3940260	3942260	It's because it wasn't white.
3942260	3945260	Because everyone knows that white consoles sell better, right?
3945260	3949260	That's why the 360 and the Wii are outselling the PS3.
3949260	3951260	It's all that black hate.
3951260	3952260	That's what it is.
3952260	3955260	People getting down on black consoles.
3955260	3961260	Wow. Dot, dot, dot.
3961260	3963260	I am inching away from Loki slowly.
3963260	3966260	Well, you know, they could also use the Saturn argument
3966260	3970260	because the Japanese Saturn was white and over here it was.
3970260	3971260	Yeah.
3971260	3973260	Okay, that was kind of dumb.
3973260	3975260	I can't get behind that argument.
3975260	3978260	But they're set to come out in Asia February 4th,
3978260	3983260	so if you really need to get your hands on a red PS2, I don't know.
3983260	3986260	There's other console sites out there that will sell colored PS2 systems
3986260	3988260	in almost any color of the rainbow that you want,
3988260	3991260	so do you really need to wait for this shit to import it?
3991260	3994260	And my God, seriously, it's the color of a console.
3994260	3996260	If you don't have a PS2 already, it's like, oh, damn,
3996260	3998260	I was really hoping for a red one.
3998260	4002260	Now my dreams can be realized at the end of the console cycle.
4002260	4006260	Portal Combat said a clear PS3 would be sweet.
4006260	4009260	It doesn't matter how many colors of these consoles you're going to release.
4009260	4012260	Okay, so the PS2 is selling lots and lots and lots of consoles.
4012260	4016260	PS3, not so much, you know, but I don't know.
4016260	4019260	It's just going to confuse people even more with the white console now.
4019260	4021260	Yet another skew.
4021260	4025260	What does it matter what it looks like as long as it's still the same piece of shit inside?
4025260	4028260	This one's white, but guess what it won't do this time?
4028260	4031260	Play Blu-ray movies or do something that's important.
4031260	4033260	It has no lefts.
4033260	4039260	I've never been more happy that we got our first day release than I am now.
4039260	4044260	Wow.
4044260	4048260	Sorry, I was looking for the clip on YouTube of the kid from Wondershosen going,
4048260	4050260	that's racist, but I couldn't find it.
4050260	4054260	So you'll just have to imagine it in your head.
4054260	4057260	I was able to find the white people song, but if you...
4057260	4059260	White people having fun.
4059260	4061260	Total domination.
4061260	4063260	Or global domination over everyone.
4063260	4065260	Wondershosen is so fucking hilarious.
4065260	4067260	Why did they stop doing that show?
4067260	4071260	She still sings the white people song.
4071260	4073260	I don't know, she likes the songs on it.
4073260	4077260	Animal dance, animal dance.
4077260	4081260	This is great.
4081260	4086260	I like the one where they show the tour of the hot dog factory.
4086260	4089260	I don't think this is the Wondershosen podcast, is it?
4089260	4092260	It's not, but I couldn't resist.
4092260	4100260	Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience. Patience.
4100260	4102260	Rob, insert, you know, train wrecks.
4102260	4107260	Alright, god damn. Alright, I'll get to it.
4107260	4109260	I'll get to it.
4109260	4112260	I know, seriously, we need an off-topic alarm.
4112260	4116260	I'm looking at this picture that someone in the chat room linked.
4116260	4121260	It was actdeft that linked it in the chat room.
4121260	4127260	And it's from Gyakuten Saiban, which is, you know, Phoenix Wright.
4127260	4133260	And it's two oranges with a banana sticking out of the middle.
4133260	4137260	Oh yeah, dark soccer, because you're so good at getting this show back on track.
4137260	4139260	I'm talking about a game.
4139260	4141260	I don't see what's so funny about citrus roots.
4141260	4145260	And it's our chat room that linked it, not me.
4145260	4149260	That means we have pervs in our chat room.
4149260	4151260	I like pervs.
4151260	4153260	There need to be more of them in the world.
4153260	4155260	Pervs are awesome.
4155260	4157260	Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news.
4157260	4159260	Hey, I did not derail the show.
4159260	4162260	They derailed it with wonder shows and whatever.
4162260	4164260	Look, Metal Gear Solid.
4164260	4166260	That'll always save a day, right?
4166260	4167260	Here's the thing, though.
4167260	4169260	It's actually the same old shit, but all over again.
4169260	4178260	And that is because, apparently, Playasia is taking preorders for a brand new Metal Gear Solid collection.
4178260	4181260	That's right, it's the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection.
4181260	4187260	It'll set you back $34.90, and also $4 shipping and handling.
4187260	4194260	You will get with it Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 substance, and Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence.
4194260	4196260	Woohoo!
4196260	4199260	Or you can just wait and get it at any retail store for $29.99.
4199260	4203260	Or you could just, you know, borrow your friend's copy that they're not playing anymore.
4203260	4206260	It has new artwork.
4206260	4208260	That's the only difference.
4208260	4211260	And, of course, it all looks like the old artwork.
4211260	4215260	Because this style never changes.
4215260	4221260	So if you were waiting all this time to get Metal Gear Solid, now's your chance.
4221260	4225260	Now's your chance to get it in a couple months.
4225260	4227260	Alright, let's move on.
4227260	4228260	Can I really?
4228260	4231260	And are you going to bring up things that have absolutely nothing to do with video games this time?
4231260	4233260	I don't know, we'll see.
4233260	4236260	Soul Calibur 4!
4236260	4239260	They're bringing back three characters.
4239260	4241260	Yay, we get Maxie.
4241260	4245260	Who is cool, but I wish that he'd have his voice actor from the Dreamcast one.
4245260	4248260	Because he's actually one of my favorite voice actors.
4248260	4252260	And they're bringing back Sungmina and Yunsung.
4252260	4254260	So they're all back.
4254260	4256260	And two new stages, which one of them is a pirate ship.
4256260	4262260	Which, I wanted to say there was already a pirate ship in one of the earlier ones, but then it was just piratey music for Cervantes.
4262260	4266260	And an ice cave.
4266260	4270260	Dude, Yunsung or whatever his name is is a pirate. That's pretty awesome.
4270260	4271260	So is Maxie.
4271260	4273260	I like playing this and he's cool.
4273260	4275260	Maxie's also a pirate.
4275260	4277260	You know what else I have to say about this story, Jamie?
4277260	4278260	What?
4278260	4279260	Animal Dance!
4279260	4282260	All the animals are doing the Animal Dance!
4282260	4283260	Animal Dance!
4283260	4284260	Animal Dance!
4284260	4286260	Animals everywhere!
4286260	4287260	Animal Dance!
4287260	4288260	Animal Dance!
4288260	4289260	Animal Dance!
4289260	4290260	Animal Dance!
4290260	4292260	Animal Dance!
4306260	4307260	Animal Dance!
4307260	4310260	Look! Everybody's doing the Animal Dance!
4310260	4324260	That's the wonders of Wonderschosen.
4324260	4325260	Rob.
4325260	4326260	Yes.
4326260	4327260	Rob.
4327260	4328260	Yes.
4328260	4332060	You don't even get the full slew of Rob.
4332060	4334020	You just get two.
4334020	4335780	And Chris threw something at you for me.
4335780	4337980	Can we do another story now?
4337980	4338980	I'd like to apologize.
4338980	4342340	In other news, Rob is random and he's red now.
4342340	4346900	To everybody who's tuning into Orange Launch Radio for the first time, I'd like to apologize.
4346900	4348820	Did my roommate bring us food?
4348820	4349820	You're awesome.
4349820	4351560	Do I have to share it?
4351560	4353020	You can have two of them.
4353020	4354660	I don't want one because I'm full already.
4354660	4355660	I ate a whole sandwich.
4355660	4356660	Rob.
4356660	4357660	All right.
4357660	4358660	Thank you, though.
4358660	4359660	Then...
4359660	4360660	Then...
4360660	4361660	Okay.
4361660	4362660	Hello.
4362660	4363660	We're on the air.
4363660	4364660	No, I'm just kidding.
4364660	4365660	Hey.
4365660	4372060	If you hadn't seen how off topic we were, you would not be bored.
4372060	4374100	We were talking about animal dancing.
4374100	4375100	Okay.
4375100	4376100	Rob.
4376100	4377100	Pass it over.
4377100	4378100	Yes.
4378100	4379100	All right.
4379100	4380100	I'm...
4380100	4381100	Low key, please.
4381100	4382100	A video game subject or nobody's ever going to listen to the show again.
4382100	4383100	All right.
4383100	4387900	Well, a Final Fantasy 13 designer promises a demo for the game and promises that the
4387900	4390600	game will be out in 2008.
4390600	4398980	Which means that we'll have it sometime possibly before January 1st of 2009 unless of course
4398980	4402660	they're going to renege on the whole thing and say, you know what, yeah, we ran into
4402660	4404420	some delays.
4404420	4408620	So they can tell us whatever we want and that each copy's going to come in case with gold
4408620	4410460	and free women.
4410460	4414380	But, you know.
4414380	4415380	Never mind.
4415380	4416380	I don't want it anymore.
4416380	4417380	How about just loose women?
4417380	4419020	Yeah, I definitely don't want it.
4419020	4422020	Free Loose Women.
4422020	4433140	That'll be with the, what was it, the Fabula Nova Crystalis collection, which has the dumbest
4433140	4435300	name of the series.
4435300	4436920	It's called Final Fantasy 13.
4436920	4439940	Do we need to go crazier with the name?
4439940	4444180	It's worked for Final Fantasy 7, it's worked for Final Fantasy 10, it's worked for Final
4444180	4446920	Fantasy 10-2.
4446920	4451980	The only thing is, even if this does come out in 2008, which I highly doubt a creator
4451980	4457140	is promising it or not, it'll come out in 2008 in Japan and it'll take them nine months
4457140	4461320	to translate it for us.
4461320	4462700	What good is this going to do me?
4462700	4463700	That's okay though.
4463700	4464700	This is all about me.
4464700	4468180	I'm sure this is all the news that Sony needs to start playing it in their commercials for
4468180	4473380	the PS3 to get people hyped up to buy their system.
4473380	4479500	Although, to their credit though, they did remove Haze from there now and they still
4479500	4485860	have Metal Gear Solid, which doesn't look like it's coming out in the spring anymore,
4485860	4487860	I don't know.
4487860	4492680	Alright, let's move on so we can try and put this whole segment behind us and get out the
4492680	4498260	last few stories here, including, speaking of the PlayStation 3, Best Buy is clearing
4498260	4501180	out the 80 gigabytes.
4501180	4504500	That's right, there is an internal memo going around, quote, the 80 gigabyte version of
4504500	4507580	the PlayStation 3 is going closed out and won't be replaced at this time.
4507580	4510820	It will come off the planogram on January 28th.
4510820	4513760	The 60 gigabyte version should already be gone from stores.
4513760	4517760	Only the 40 gigabyte version of PS3 will be sold in Best Buy stores at this time.
4517760	4521340	This means that there currently isn't a version that is PS2 compatible.
4521340	4524740	At this time, Sony hasn't made any announcements about new products.
4524740	4530140	And I think as of this recording right now, they have sold out of the 80 gig system.
4530140	4532060	It's not even on their website anymore.
4532060	4535940	So are they going to, what, is Sony planning to put out a 120 gigabyte version?
4535940	4540020	How much you want to bet that they're phasing it out and the white PS3 is going to be another
4540020	4544100	40 gig and then they're going to make a black something or other that's, you know, another
4544100	4545100	system.
4545100	4546100	Or maybe they're phasing out...
4546100	4549280	Does this have to do with the whole thing on a somewhat related note about the cheaper
4549280	4550960	Blu-ray lasers now?
4550960	4556220	Maybe it might also have to do with the new systems going to have DualShock 3 controllers
4556220	4557280	in them now.
4557280	4560860	Maybe they're, you know, phasing out the 80 gig systems for that.
4560860	4565660	Also maybe they're going to stop offering MotorStorm for free, you know, I don't know.
4565660	4570180	I mean, you know, and even Microsoft's to blame for having a ton of different skews
4570180	4571180	for their products.
4571180	4576220	But seriously, the PlayStation 3 has been very confusing with what's available.
4576220	4578160	First it's the 60 and the 20.
4578160	4580140	And then the 20 goes away.
4580140	4582700	And then it's the 60 and the 80.
4582700	4583700	And then, you know...
4583700	4585660	They show absolutely no confidence in their product.
4585660	4587340	And then the 60 goes away.
4587340	4588900	And now it's the 80 and the 40.
4588900	4589900	And then the 80's going away.
4589900	4592620	And now it's the 40 and God knows what.
4592620	4593620	We'll see.
4593620	4594620	All right.
4594620	4599700	Well, anyhow, we're going to bring this Segment A to a close very soon.
4599700	4603180	I know it probably couldn't have come at a better time, honestly.
4603180	4608020	But first, we're going to take a trip down memory lane and close out Part A in a dignified
4608020	4609020	manner.
4609020	4610020	Because that's what we need to do.
4610020	4613940	And we're going to do that by paying a little bit of respect to our elders by taking a moment
4613940	4615980	to acknowledge a classic game of the week.
4615980	4622320	And it comes to us from the one and only, Dark Sakura.
4622320	4624940	So what game this week, Dark Sakura?
4624940	4632380	The game of the week is Akumajo Dracula X Chi No Rondo, which is Dracula X Rondo of Blood.
4632380	4633380	And um...
4633380	4634380	Nice.
4634380	4639140	As a lot of people know, it was recently re-released for the PSP.
4639140	4644340	But I'm not talking about the PSP one.
4644340	4647220	And actually, the other clip that I liked had the better music.
4647220	4648220	Oh, sorry.
4648220	4649220	This one loaded first.
4649220	4650220	I played this.
4650220	4651220	Yeah.
4651220	4654540	The other one in particular, because it was new music that was for that game.
4654540	4659340	It was the theme Bloodlines, which was the theme of Richter Belmont, which is the character
4659340	4664020	that they brought in this, who was also in Symphony of the Night, which came out in Japan
4664020	4666060	as Nocturne in the Moonlight.
4666060	4670740	This is the predecessor to that game, because you actually start off Symphony of the Night
4670740	4678220	as Richter at what's supposed to be the end of this game, when he fights Dracula.
4678220	4686460	And of course, the music I have linked is from the PC Engine Duo Disc, which was all
4686460	4687460	Redbook audio.
4687460	4690220	You can actually put it in your CD player and listen to it, although it's just the cool
4690220	4691220	thing where if you put it...
4691220	4693940	Because I don't know if anyone ever did this with Symphony of the Night.
4693940	4697220	If you put it in your disc and try to listen to it, you get a warning.
4697220	4700500	This is a PlayStation Black disc.
4700500	4703860	If you listen to the game track, it will blow up speakers.
4703860	4710460	I had the same thing on the Japanese one, too, on the PC Engine one, which I thought
4710460	4712460	was really cool.
4712460	4717780	But anyway, the game had little animated cut scenes.
4717780	4720380	I should say poorly animated cut scenes.
4720380	4727100	And also, the intro of it was done in German, and for old Listeners Reverse Show, I've actually
4727100	4734420	brought in my TurboGrafx, because you can play it on the US TurboGrafx, there's no country
4734420	4735420	you'd lock out.
4735420	4736420	But you can play...
4736420	4737420	This is classic Castlevania.
4737420	4739180	That was a long time ago.
4739180	4746860	In fact, if I do remember right, this is Super Castlevania IV, or the last traditional Castlevania
4746860	4748340	games that have come out.
4748340	4752620	All the rest of them have had that sort of Metroidvania format.
4752620	4756420	I love that term, Metroidvania.
4756420	4764740	This particular one, because of how, I guess, relatively rare it was on PC Engine, it's
4764740	4766980	really hard to find it for less than 150.
4766980	4767980	I have an original.
4767980	4770980	I had burdens for a long time, because my friend had an original.
4770980	4775660	We got ours because someone owed us 100 bucks and came back from the family game, which
4775660	4779780	I thought was pretty freaking cool.
4779780	4787900	It also had, and now this did have a version of it on the Super Nintendo that was not...
4787900	4790020	And a lot of people said, oh, it wasn't all that great.
4790020	4792500	I actually enjoyed the Super Nintendo one.
4792500	4793760	Not me, I don't like it.
4793760	4797780	Not compared to the TurboGrafx, or, you know what I mean, this first version, PC Engine.
4797780	4801540	This one, the cool thing about it is that as you went through, you had different routes
4801540	4803300	that your story would take.
4803300	4809980	Like if you rescued Maria, you can play as her.
4809980	4814380	As I understand, she was supposed to be playable in Symphony of the Night, as well as two other
4814380	4818820	levels that they never completed, but on the Saturn version, you can play as her.
4818820	4820320	And all of her attacks are there.
4820320	4830580	She threw birds for her attack, and her special weapons were a dragon, a kitten, a turtle
4830580	4840580	shell, and another type of bird that came out, which translated actually to the, I guess,
4840580	4846300	four major gods in the Saturn version that came out later.
4846300	4853300	But also she gets this uber cutesy ending, and it was crazy.
4853300	4859060	The other funny thing about this is that because it had to run on the arcade card 3, if you
4859060	4865960	didn't have an arcade card 3 in, it actually had Dracula X Stage X, which was done in really
4865960	4875060	bad sort of rendered looking bubble figures, and it went through all this that way.
4875060	4879800	Also a lot of the enemies in this game were original for this one and showed up in a lot
4879800	4882820	of the later series too.
4882820	4886700	You had the Pikemen, which were I think the most single annoying characters ever.
4886700	4890940	They're the ones who stand on the ledge and drop a pike down on you, and they were hard
4890940	4895180	to get past.
4895180	4900820	This game right here to me is the top of the series.
4900820	4907120	And I think that Symphony of the Night, or not Turn in the Moonlight, it expanded on
4907120	4910540	what this game started.
4910540	4911540	I'd agree.
4911540	4912540	To a point.
4912540	4915820	I think Symphony of the Night exceeded it a little bit, but we wouldn't have Symphony
4915820	4918740	of the Night if it weren't for this, so you have to respect the elders.
4918740	4927640	And of all of the series, as far as I'm aware, well these two are linked together.
4927640	4934140	This one and Symphony of the Night are the only games to carry the actual Dracula X logo.
4934140	4936460	I love this from actdeft in chat.
4936460	4937860	What is a podcast?
4937860	4939940	A miserable little pile of hosts.
4939940	4940940	But enough of that.
4940940	4941940	Have at you.
4941940	4942940	Winner.
4942940	4953340	And it was, there's actually several remixes that were in this one from some of the previous
4953340	4956700	games too.
4956700	4962860	Some of the little music clips carried over.
4962860	4969860	And yeah, this one, if you can find an original, good luck.
4969860	4978660	But other than that, this is probably, that's a scary little noise that thing makes.
4978660	4985900	But I'd have to say of all of the, this is probably one of my top five games.
4985900	4986900	F.R.
4986900	4987900	F.R.
4987900	4993380	Alright, well, there you have it, your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, Dracula
4993380	4994620	X.
4994620	5000100	I also think the bad guy is funny because his name is Shaft.
5000100	5001100	What you talking about?
5001100	5002100	Alright.
5002100	5004620	He wears a bonnet in Symphony of the Night.
5004620	5006640	I think now is a good time for us to take a break.
5006640	5008020	So we're going to do that.
5008020	5010500	Try to get past a little bit of the randomness we've had this segment.
5010500	5011980	Although a little randomness is healthy.
5011980	5012980	Come on.
5012980	5015700	If we didn't have the randomness, we'd be just another boring old podcast.
5015700	5016700	Same old thing.
5016700	5018800	Same old news you can read on the blogs, right?
5018800	5020020	Randomness is what makes us us.
5020020	5022700	So thanks for sticking with us and the craziness.
5022700	5026420	We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5026420	5030820	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
