Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for part B of our program.
and if you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Bros.
delay.
We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.
So let's get back into some regular gaming news.
Start off with Loki.
Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.
This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN, and basically they gave the time frame.
Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.
And...
I don't know, I'll believe it when I see it type thing.
If it is, they may show it at like E3 or something like that because it'd have to be kind of done, but I don't, you know, it's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of, um,
Release dates, because, you know... Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever, right?
Exactly.
I really hope this rumor is true, though, because I... Oh, I love me some... I love me some Duke Nukem, too.
It would be even better if some of the expansions and the whole made stuff come out as, you know, downloadable stuff.
I hope the build editor comes with it, because that would be awesome.
I love the voice macros.
Oh, yes.
Being able to make your own voice macros, that'd be awesome.
Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C.
mod or something?
I still remember having that on CD at one point.
Yeah.
I love Duke Nukem.
Duke Nukem's great.
I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.
Oh, yeah.
That was awesome.
You're laughing, Nathan.
Did that inspire... What's a modem?
What are you, 12?
I'm just kidding.
They let you...
All right.
So, yeah, Duke Nukem.
I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.
But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem forever, damn it.
No, no, this I'll allow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great.
At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.
But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.
Yeah, like the day it came out.
So, alright, well, um, let's move on with some other gaming news.
Talking about Xbox Live still, but this time, talking about...
Rock Band, and Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.
The last segment we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs, because, you know, unlike last year, EA Harmonix has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.
They also retracted them after they announced them.
Did they?
Yeah.
Yeah, but still.
Don't look back in anger, live forever in Wonderwall
I'd rather not, thank you.
On January 29th, the Progressive Pack comes out.
Both packs will set you back 400 points, or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive Pack.
Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.
Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed.
That's also a cover.
Smashing Pumpkins with Siva.
Not a cover.
Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s.
That was like their first single ever.
So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.
and that's all we know until February.
So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.
Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.
We get Foreigner.
Ooh.
Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.
And Journey's Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.
Yes!
Journey!
Now, I'm more about Boston right now.
But, I don't know, they did
There's better songs.
Why those?
At least we're not getting hot-blooded.
But it's Journey.
It's awesome.
I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and Rock Band because their music wasn't showing up.
And I was like, where's the Journey?
And now it's coming out, and that makes me very happy.
I think that all three of these songs are also in Rock Band, I want to say.
I know Jukebox Hero is.
Jukebox Hero is, yeah.
And I know that there's another Boston song that's in...
and Rock Band.
I don't think this is it.
Anyway.
So, we're getting old rock.
Yay.
You know, if you play Boston Backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.
That is not true.
That's from Little Nicky.
Stop spreading lies on the internet.
You're one of those.
Yeah, that's my job.
So, speaking of another, well,
Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the U.S.
The first machine, apparently, is at In The Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at start.
All the other fun stuff.
No EMUs support that.
I don't know.
I'm excited that there's new DDR.
Although it's not near us, so... I don't know.
You know, I already told you how I feel about DDR, and I got in a little trouble for it.
But, you know, I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2, and I'm just kind of like...
It's just the same thing with some new songs.
It needs to be another Max 2.
They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.
It's, you know, where they have, like, remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the Oni courses and stuff like that, and that was exciting, you know, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, you know, that kind of thing, and the way they tease that.
With these, like, DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.
It's just kind of like, DDR, here you go, enjoy.
Oh, another DDR, enjoy.
They don't
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, you know, the younger kids that were, you know, our age when we started.
Maybe they'll get into it.
Stop dating me and yourself.
But Rob, I love you.
Not that, you know what I mean.
No, I know, but I mean, like, I'd have to play it.
I don't know, I'm not as excited.
I was excited probably when 4th Plus came out and 5th Mix.
That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know, I just don't care anymore.
Let's see.
I'm looking at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.
DJ Janai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.
Ross Steel UT says, DDR Star Wars edition.
That would work.
No.
Forget it.
No, and see, that's partially, I think, why DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap like Hottest Party and all this stuff that's just absolute shit.
They should make a 12-player mode with peripherals.
That'd be great.
I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.
No, but seriously, they could do, like, you know, make some really elaborate cabinet that was 4-player, have, like, a quad mode or something like that that's in the arcade.
That would be different.
You know, and...
Like, even Animero gets behind Pump It Up, and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.
You know, Konami doesn't do anything.
It's just like, oh, look, it's DR. Yes.
I mean, even with, like, Beatmania, it's like, what's it matter?
I mean, we're gonna release another one in a few months anyway, so, I mean, it's... I know, it's like they think it's some kind of a self-advertising franchise, like, we already have a fanbase built in, we don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah, but, like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing, like, excite us about it, otherwise why should we give a shit, so... Alright.
Like I said, just reinvent DDR, make it competitive, I'll be all over that game again, just, you know, just
Start from scratch.
You know what DDR needs?
A new producer.
I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some... I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there, because obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.
That's what it needs.
Some new blood.
We are starting over, right?
Alright, anyhow.
Something else so you can get your music fixed through.
Not DDR, but the other type.
The
Thanks for watching!
They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.
They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.
You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.
Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.
They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.
Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.
The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert.
That's kind of cool.
As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal, February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California, at the Knob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.
So if you want to catch that.
and if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.
And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet, including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.
Dude, Jamie, Anaheim, California?
Disneyland.
Disneyland slash Video Games Live.
Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?
Let's go.
Let's do it.
I'd rather go to E3.
I would like to go to E3.
We'll see.
Anyhow, so there you have it.
Video games live.
That'll be fun.
I have not been yet.
Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwolf at all games.
He goes, he enjoys the show.
I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show, and he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.
Disney World!
I know!
It's even better!
God, guys.
So one-track-minded.
Disney Land, Disney Land, Disney Land
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
God, would it be Space Mountain again in California?
Space Mountain and California Screamin'.
Rawr, that sounds great.
Anyway, sorry, we turned into the Disney cast for a minute.
Jamie, please take the show back on track.
Okay, so Devil May Cry 4, there is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.
And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on that was actually removed from the downloadable version that was saying it would be out.
And of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st and out a week later in North America and Europe.
But is it going to happen?
And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.
So is it true?
Is it not?
Did someone just screw up?
It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.
It makes sense.
Jinx.
Your mom.
Oh, you showed me.
She wins, Rob.
She said your mom.
What are you going to do now?
I like how Jamie said that off the mic.
I'm going to refuse.
She goes, I like your mom.
Just to clarify, I do like your mom.
Your mom's cool.
My mom is cool.
She'd bake pies too.
Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.
You guys can make me Easter cookies together.
Alright, forget it.
Anyway, let's move on.
More game news, please.
Well, something else is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N+.
If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.
And it's very fucking hard.
Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be, I think, on both Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer, as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.
Doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon, because apparently it's already, I guess, past their certification.
So, hooray!
Oh, that's a pretty fun game.
It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon, too.
Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to www.harveycartel.org That's H-A-R-V-E-Y Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano?
Well, it's Cartel.
Okay, never mind.
h-a-r-v-e-y c-a-r-t-e-l dot org slash metanet slash downloads.html and you can play the full game there.
It's pretty fun.
Lots of challenge, though.
Yay!
So is it going to be worth it?
Because N right now is free, right?
Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?
I think it'll be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in there.
and they're going to have new levels.
There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.
So I know those are going to be in there and you get achievements.
All right.
Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.
That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers sucked during Christmas.
Apparently they're not that sorry.
Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.
Not a new game, a game that was already out.
But you will be able to download it for a limited time for free.
I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.
So you have about a three-day period roughly to get the game.
And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800-FOR-MY-XBOX, they're supposed to be able to do something for you.
Like maybe give you the points back?
Maybe.
They won't say, will they?
Yeah.
Because they don't want everybody to rush them.
That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary, but whatever.
I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.
But it's just...
It's kind of fucked up.
I'd rather have, like, you know, a free month of live or something.
It would have been a lot cheaper for them, too, but... The demo was kind of fun.
I'll look at it.
I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.
You're right.
I'll grab it while it's free.
Why not?
Add it to my collection.
You know, it's on the hard drive.
And quite frankly, they didn't really owe us anything to begin with, I don't think.
I think this whole thing got blown way out of proportion.
So it's kind of like, you know what?
If you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.
It was still kind of spotty.
Like, I...
I guess I hadn't played on live since like New Year's or something because I had to recover my gamer tag from I think year 360 and it had trouble doing that.
I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked which sucks because for whatever reason to download that like six megs as your gamer tag it takes like a half an hour.
It's crazy.
It's fucking slow but yeah.
I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.
Son of Dad, I wanted Rez.
Actdeft seems to think that Rez will be up this week.
I hope that's true.
Actually, that may be true because I think they said Rez was coming out in January and there's only one more week in January, right?
No, two more.
Oh, two more.
All right.
So in the next couple weeks.
We'll see.
I thought this week was... Didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought, already?
I don't know.
Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it was?
It looks stupid.
It was okay.
It's pretty much... There's a game just like it, Magical Drop, on the Neo Geo.
It's almost just like Magical Drop, but with bunnies, and you can run up the sides, too.
That was the other little innovation, is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.
It adds a new element to it.
But, I don't know.
Anyway, sorry, I got a little off track, but I realized I never talked about it during my game.
I was going to check out Omega 5, maybe, but... Omega 5's awesome.
You've got to check that out.
That's definitely worth a look.
If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron, or if you like the newer ones or whatever, check it out.
Do it.
Alright, so Undertow for free.
Be sure to take a look this week.
Another game, and actually I'm sort of interested in, is the Highlander game that's coming out.
You play as Owen MacLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.
Go fig.
Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day, and you've got a lot of people that you meet, and a lot of people you kill, and it's supposed to be really, really gory.
But part of it is...
Act as a Conductor for High Voltage Electrical Current
So it's pretty cool.
You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions, and full cities, and you can use zip wires and that type of thing.
And did I say gory?
Because it's supposed to be gory.
This game sounds epic.
Like, you just know something's going to go wrong, though.
Like, it's too good on paper.
Well, it's PS3, 360, and PC.
And it's made by Eidos.
It did give us Tomb Raider.
Ah, exactly.
Exactly.
Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.
The second one was the best because you could make her explode.
I do agree.
You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.
Now, Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?
That's what I just said.
Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob
Sure, they were.
I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, the new one.
But, you know, different strokes for different folks, right?
Everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.
Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.
Spore, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous release on the PC.
So, awesome.
They can...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008.
And somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which, you know, the marketing probably just hasn't kicked in yet.
I'm sure there'll be more later on.
But that Spore was overhyped.
And I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough, in my opinion.
Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but, I mean, I don't know if our poster, you know, everybody's welcome to their own opinion.
I don't know if the poster saw what I saw at E3 and stuff, but...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin but has no sort of optical drive on it at all.
It has one USB port.
And so if you want to actually use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked.
You have to buy a $99 drive for it.
Or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck probably and use its optical drive.
I'm sorry, but that's... Oh, and $1,700.
Awesome!
Good job!
Good job, Steve Jones.
You really know what the consumer wants.
Crap for lots of money.
Hooray!
But I'm sure all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.
Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen.
He can send those cards and letters...

DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Street Fighter Online.
There's some more news coming out about this.
Remember, they licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online.
But it's mouse controlled.
Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that were going to be in an MMO.
Right, no, this is a whole other thing.
I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses in certain combinations and click, you do the special attacks.
That's dumb.
That could be very interesting.
I have no idea how that's going to be.
But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about this game.
Like what?
Like the ability to, like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.
That's pretty awesome.
A little taunts with your cat.
You know, you can have, like, ceiling cat, you know, and stuff like that.
Ceiling cat is watching you lose.
I don't know.
Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltech toys.
That is an actual line of toys.
And they have the toys for this, too, that you can buy.
Nice.
So I can get my very own Chun-Li doll?
Yes.
Awesome.
Well, the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.
The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.
For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet.
There's no news.
We'll see you next time.
Hello, DarkSakura, Skye, and OtherDude.
Poor OtherDude.
That's fine, I'm OtherDude.
Nathan, you're already getting mails.
What do you think?
Hey, OtherDude, good job.
Welcome to the show.
Forget it.
I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot in my human growth class stole my PSP Slim, which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on it.
It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen, and it had my podcast for OLR.
Okay, this person doesn't use any punctuation, so sorry.
One of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you to people who steal and bully people, plus the stupid kid.
His name is, I'm not going to say his name.
It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook this kid had weed in his bag along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.
Kids today!
Jesus!
But get this, I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website worthy of going to all geeky things for girls and guys.
It's ofthinkgeek.com.
Okay.
Well, the background video for Potsilvania Dances and Chorus is like seen from Advent Children.
I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have...
Every title made, but did you know that Konami had Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?
Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.
I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game Boy, which sucked, by the way.
I love the portable aspect of this, but Stepmania has recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution, but that's how much...
I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.
Okay.
Is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist is going downhill to the mainstream crowd.
Okay, only our emails would go from cocaine in somebody's underwear to DDR Disney Channel.
What the... WTF, LOL.
There's no punctuation.
The only periods in this are used in a URL.
Don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.
Thank you.
Thank you for our lesson of the week.
And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in boredom and says help.
Well, I would say if your, you know, PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross because that was a good game.
Orange Lounge Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.
That's not a nice thing to do.
Or pick cocaine in your underwear.
Yes.
Everybody knows you put it in your jacket, in the inside liner, you've got to...
Just kidding.
You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.
Okay.
Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn how to put it in your body cavity.
So there you go.
Oh, and this person was called... As soon as... Email servers are tuning up.
Punctuation man.
DSMaster25.
Which is like... It sounds like an old AOL screen name.
Wait, wait, wait.
DSMaster...
So the guy had his PSP, I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand, this story is completely crazy.
Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.
He talks about how much he misses his PSP, and he's DS fan.
But I'm bum.
Okay, next email.
Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.
Oh, okay, okay, there it is.
No, that can't be it.
Whatever.
Can I read the next email, Rob?
Yes, you may.
Okay, stop.
Love you.
Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give you a copy of Super Stardust HD.
How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?
It's a relatively easy process, and I'd be happy to share my games with you.
So add Resumo to your friends list and we'll talk.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the iCamera and in the process help Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.
Never gonna happen.
Never gonna happen.
I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other game in all our history.
Great, and it's still under cheese big time.
We've had guests on to promote, you know, Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote, you know, and, you know, I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought...
24 of the game because you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.
No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a tingle suit if you can tell a million of your friends to buy this game.
It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.
It's starting to flat out.
And in fact, in Japan, they only sold like a couple hundred units the other week.
So it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one millionth.
DJ Janai now calls it the brown eye of fudgement.
Can I finish reading this email, please?
Yes, you may.
Sorry.
The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.
I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.
I can store as much as 5 gigs of video on the hard drive.
Attached is a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1,000 mile rally arcade machine that I recorded with the iCamera.
And I'll watch it later.
It's an MP4.
Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter 2 machine that I just bought.
She loves my Pac-Man the most.
Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to this show on my PSP.
I made the mistake of listening to this show last week while drinking coffee and ringing up a customer.
Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow-cooking George Foreman girl and I laughed and spat coffee at my customer's face.
Not good for business.
Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't have to pay for his merchandise.
Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.
I love that.
It's so strange to me the effect this show has.
Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a BART ride home from San Francisco or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.
It's amazing what you can achieve.
Yeah, that's mostly Loki's fault.
I'll give him that.
Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.
It's not nice.
Yeah, really.
Oh, yeah, it's my fault.
and just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting so that we can see your daughter play a video game.
Sorry, was it goddaughter?
Yeah.
Play a video game.
Next email.
Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorse DS piracy.
I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.
500 games in total.
I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.
Crack firmware on iPod games.
Should you really read this on the air?
From Ryan.
You know, here's the thing.
Here's the thing about that.
Like, I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.
You know, it's just like,
I could pirate all these games.
As the FBI is coming to Ryan's house right now.
Oh, yeah.
We've narrowed it down to Ryan.
Let's find Ryan.
How many Ryans are there?
Oh, only a couple billion.
Oh, wait a minute.
Ryan's not listening to this program.
There's probably only one.
We don't have that many listeners.
He emailed.
He didn't say he listened to the program.
He just emailed us.
IP tracking.
Let me see.
But anyway, the only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all the games I don't want to import.
That's why I have it.
Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.
My husband, you know, manages a game crazy.
By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.
That game sucks.
It's not good at all.
Didn't you say that last week?
Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing.
Okay.
It's A-M-A-Z-I-Z-I-N-G.
You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news that we all want.
You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with any... I feel... I don't know.
I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other publishers.
Hey, we'll promote your stuff.
No thanks.
I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.
Sorry, Jamie.
Okay.
Blame him.
I am.
Can I read now?
Yes.
Okay.
I love how the mailbag segment always turns into, how many times can we cut off Jamie with a random tangent?
How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?
Sorry, go ahead.
Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd only listened to before on my PSP, even though I live overseas.
I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.
Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stories.
DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem to have anything special
Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a Worst Game of the Week segment or something like that?
Loki is special.
It would give him a chance to blow off some steam, LOL.
I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a Worst Game of the Week.
That's kind of stupid.
That's the worst idea of the week.
Poor listener.
Can I finish?
Yes.
Thank you.
Well, that's about it.
Again, an ego plug...
Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.
I'm sorry.
You're like, can I finish?
Well, that's just about it.
I hate you guys.
Anyway, well that's about it.
Again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being, and being 15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.
Keep up the awesome work.
Wow, this person writes a very freaking good, you know, email for being 15.
And this is from TheFlawlessBoltX.
PS, I bought myself an Eye of Judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.
PSS, put more crap on the PSP website.
I never get tired of that.
No!
I will never!
It will stay the way it is.
It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.
Which I think we finally let expire.
Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.
So, to keep on reading.
Dear OLR crew, this is Ranma from Indonesia.
I think, yeah, you've written to us.
Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.
It's been a while since my last email.
I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.
To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments about game-related contents.
Keep getting crazy then.
to Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game-related content in your mocking style.
I love that.
Nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.
To DarkSakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week, as I am blind, so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.
Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.
By the way, guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.
I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.
Yes, I love playing recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.
And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.
Everyone sent us movies this week.
Yeah, there's links on here.
These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments and I will add more songs to play.
Perhaps Dragon Force.
It did Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok.
Hey, I love Ragnarok.
More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.
That's kind of old school.
That's pretty cool.
Last email, dun dun dun.
Back then it was your abbreviated Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the podcasts I was getting, and yours was one of the longest, but recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors don't notice me on it all day, or call me on it, and have me subscribe.
Now I listen to your show every week.
Anywho, for starters, you'll notice that I've included an attachment.
God, we've been getting attachments all...
I'm trying to blow up our email box.
I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare to Be Stupid as the background music for your Stupid Awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your dialogue on top of it.
I've included an instrumental version of the song taken from the Amish Paradise single.
I ripped the file myself, so I know it's legit, in case you want to use it in future segments.
That's cool.
The background vocals on the chorus are still there, so it's still relevant.
Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played during last week's FU segment?
I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others.
And I was wondering if you could hook me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.
It's on the Advent Children soundtrack.
But I'll take care of this later.
Stay tuned.
How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?
Anyway.
So, if I may continue.
Finally, the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.
I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney World.
I'll leave it at that.
Well, nice.
We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.
Keep up the great work and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as I can get away with it.
Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.
Sincerely, Justin the Claw.
P.S.
On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to a game as addicting.
When did that word become an adjective?
According to Merian Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.
Addictive would be the proper adjective form.
You're not the only one to do this.
It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.
I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.
I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?
No offense, of course.
I'm just making an observation.
Yes, but it could also be an understood object.
Whatever, dude.
Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.
I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.
Don't hate.
See, the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.
He learns something new every week here on Orange Lines Radio.
And FreezePop emailed us.
Really?
I'm like, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?
Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of weeks.
The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.
I'm so excited.
I will tell you who it is next week.
No, I won't.
Well, I'll tell you later.
Yes, I will.
In a private room.
Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow up and self-destruct.
So please don't do that.
And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.
All right, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we haven't even touched, right, Loki?
Definitely.
The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced.
Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version, and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network as Bionic Commando Rearmed.
Looks fucking awesome.
It's going to have two-player co-op in the game.
It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.
New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses.
But it's basically going to follow the original game.
This game looks so hot.
I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go seek out the video for this.
Everybody has it, right?
Yeah, pretty much everyone.
Every big video game site has it.
It looks so hot.
That is the way you redo an old game.
I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.
Me too, me too.
But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy.
He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.
That's cool.
That is great.
Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?
As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.
Well, I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right?
To be politically correct?
Well, they could still be... His name is now Hyler.
I don't know, it's just like
I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, just... It's the claw.
The claw.
See, just in the claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?
Alright, anyway.
If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking game that kind of moves like an M.C.
Escher piece.
Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to be making its way to the PlayStation 3.
You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.
This was one of their kind of like
and more.
Check this out on March 19th, which coincidentally is the same day that you can actually check out the PSP version.
And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.
If I had a PS3, I'd check it out.
But since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and check it out there.
Sound good, Loki?
Sure.
I'm crashing your party.
All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.
Very cool.
Well, in other news, crap.
Really?
What kind of crap?
No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.
So I have to reload show roll.
Oh, that's okay.
We can wait.
You know what?
Give me a second.
I just bit on a Vetrix, by the way.
Cool!
You're going to buy a Vectrex?
Why?
Because someone in Stockton is selling one and right now the bidding is up to $50 and it comes with like 10 games.
But what do you want it for?
Just to see how... I want a Vectrex.
Put it in my desk at work.
DarkSakura is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.
I don't care.
You better watch it.
I'll do it too.
Whatever.
If I don't win, I don't win.
I'm not like that dead set on getting it.
I bought, like I said, that Bit Generations game.
What's it called?
DotStream.
It's up, by the way.
All right.
It will be.
Okay.
Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.
It has 16 games on it.
It will be on PS2 and PSP.
And it's going to be... Let's see what's on here.
We have...
Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku, Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician Lord, but they're not on there.
Actually, yes.
Yes, they are on there, sorry.
We just can't make up our mind.
There's so many SNK classics to choose from.
No, they are on there.
Excellent.
Guitar Hero 3
They're going to be doing a little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say, on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.
You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live.
on Guitar03, where you can possibly win a LG 50-inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and a Boomchair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.
A Boomchair?
Yes, Boomchair.
Also, you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller faceplate signed by Slash, and some other crap, including, I think, some points and
So that should be cool.
Actually, it looks like the event is going to go from February 1st through the 3rd.
So, yeah, it's 72 hours.
But I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12 to 4, isn't a big deal there.
Oh, and it's for US and Canada only.
So, sorry everybody else.
Sorry, international people.
Apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.
No, just kidding.
There's probably laws or something.
I don't know.
If you want to find out more information on us, go to xbox.com slash rockyourparty.
We're going to rock your party.
All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we are going to get to the Skype line, where you can call us and interact with us.
You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give us a call toll-free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.
It's one we don't talk about.
It's not really World of Warcraft.
We don't talk about this game very much, but it is, I believe, the most popular MMO in the world, even above World of Warcraft.
It's a game called Lineage 2.
and, yeah, you know Lineage 2?
Have you played Lineage 2?
No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2.
I'm like, hey, I've heard of that before.
I have a Coke can.
I do too.
I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.
Lineage 2 Lineage 2
A Russian man has been charged with murder.
It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.
There were these two clans.
There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.
It's the Ku Klux Klan.
That's, yeah, wow, that's all I can say on that one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Plotanium were people over 30.
And the guy who was killed here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer.
And he had a clan.
There were warriors in the clan.
And just before New Year, there was a big old battle with the Ku Klux.
And for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face-to-face in the real world.
Sign of trouble right there.
And when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.
Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, Amazing.
Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?
Like, is this like a satire website or whatever?
But I think it's real.
That's kind of, wow, sad.
Sad, sad, sad.
That was awful.
No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?
Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3 and apparently someone found Goatse in Zelda 3.
It was ridiculous, but funny.
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness or anything else we've talked about tonight.
You can go ahead and give us a call right now.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
You there?
Caller?
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello.
Okay, apparently our caller's not there.
Make sure you always check your connection with Echo 123.
Let's try this one instead.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, this is ION671.
Hello, ION671.
What's on your mind?
Well, I just want to say that
I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that, like, you know, parents don't understand games.
Because I'm a kid, you know, 16, and both my parents are really into video games and anime.
Like, my dad just was saying, like, how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.
You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns, and you're very lucky to have them, right?
Yes.
because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games and think that they are the devil's creation.
What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?
Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?
I really don't know.
I may have just been lucky.
Actually, Rice Princess is asking a question here.
Hold on.
I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were younger?
Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games, but then they grow up for quotation fingers.
And there's some people who see it as childish, so they disregard it.
or Discard.
It's late.
I would assume that in your household, you sound pretty well off for 16.
You sound like you're a smart kid.
Obviously, you're smart because you're listening to this show.
Video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've turned out okay.
Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?
No.
Then you probably turned out A-okay.
What do you think other families can learn from yours?
Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because every so often they mention a game called Granddad's Otter, so I'm wondering why parents are still buying it for their kids.
That's a good question.
Hey, I got another question for you.
Do your parents play the games with you?
Oh, yeah.
Well, of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually kick my ass
at Burnout.
He is a Burnout machine.
It's just the next generation.
Well, I wouldn't support it, so good luck at that.
One last thing?
I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all this PSP stuff.
And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.
Okay, well, I'm very sorry.
So look, we disavow all knowledge of that email and anything that was ever said.
Okay.
Why would he sue?
I mean, seriously.
He's the one breaking the law.
And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.
See, we didn't know that before.
So we ought to sue you.
Okay.
I just said I know him.
I don't say I know him personally.
Oh, okay.
Oh, snap.
See how I flipped that right back at you?
Aha.
In your face, Rob.
Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?
You did.
Rob got majorly pwned.
That was indeed a zing, Rob.
You got a zing.
All right.
For that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.
Bye.
Okay, bye.
All right.
Have a good week.
That was a good call.
That was a really good call.
That was a very good call.
One of our better calls.
I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.
Invite yourself, Rob.
My parents will buy beer.
I hope they buy good beer.
All right.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Is Justin TV fucking up Skype tonight?
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
Hi, hi.
Hello?
Oh, okay.
Sorry about that.
I have a microphone.
Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.
You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.
What's up?
How's that?
Ah, much better.
What's on your mind?
Introduce yourself.
Yes.
Introduce yourself.
Oh, by the way... Okay, sorry.
Sorry, dude.
Um...
Okay, um, I don't know, I'm just hanging out and, you know, listening on the East Coast, I guess.
What's your name?
Or you have an online name, or?
Uh, yeah, Banjo, in the chat room.
Okay, cool.
Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?
Was there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?
I was... I don't...
I don't know, I just wanted to say... Oh, oh, what?
Sorry.
I'm sorry, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
Oh, oh, do you mind if I... I got Akula in the same room, do you want to talk to him?
Uh, sure, okay.
Okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Hi, identify yourself.
Hello.
Hi, who's this?
This is Okuda.
Hello, Okuda.
Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.
I mean, we're just an internet radio show.
Nothing to be scared of, right?
Right, Okuda?
Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.
Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.
What's on your mind?
I was wondering, I play World of Warcraft a lot, I was wondering, do you like private servers?
What's your opinion on private servers?
I'm sorry, on crowded servers?
Private servers.
Oh, private servers.
Oh.
I don't know much about them.
I mean, I know they're out there.
I've understood it's kind of a risky thing, because once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?
Right.
I don't know.
But private servers are kind of corny.
I mean, like, yeah, you can do... I was into a cash file.
Oh.
You can dump a cash file.
Oh.
I guess.
But anyway, sorry, go ahead.
No, I'm just saying, like, you can mod it to be, like, super strong or, like, make all this money and stuff, but that makes the game boring to me.
Like, I don't know.
You can have the nude patch.
You can have the nude patch.
I'm there.
Only on the private servers.
Really?
I have three characters on... Oh my god, you pervert!
Get away from me!
Stop sitting next to me!
They're all...
Oh my... Get especially away from me.
That doesn't even make sense.
Ew.
Well, okay.
But private servers, I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.
I mean you need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at 2 in the morning on a private server.
So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, there's not – you can't really progress very far I would think.
I don't know.
Do you have a difference of opinion?
Akuta, do you play on a private server?
and how do you like it?
Yeah, I'd play in a private server.
Yeah.
Sorry, there's a huge lag.
It's probably Justin TV screwing everything up.
That's alright.
Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous.
Hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?
Thanks for having me.
No problemo.
I think they're handing the phone back.
I'm not sure.
Okay.
All right.
Have a good one, you guys.
All right.
Okay, thanks for having us.
You're welcome.
You too.
Smoke another bud.
All right.
That's terrible.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
They're just nervous.
God, come on.
But if they do smoke a bud, they'll relax.
Not that I would know.
No, we're not encouraging that, though.
We would never.
No.
That's wrong.
But if you feel so inclined, it would...
Hope you relax.
All right, look, we give people shit.
That's what we do.
Like, we're going to give our next caller.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's me, Ranma.
What's up, everyone?
Hello, Ranma.
Hello, Ranjan.
What is up, Ranma?
Speaking of giving people shit.
Not mine.
No, that was me.
I called the first set, but my headset was acting really retarded.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, echo 123 next time.
Yeah, that was the headset.
I think that was user error, Ranma.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, that.
Oh, not too much.
I want to talk about that whole PlayStation Dusty article you talked about earlier.
Dust Cap 3.
What about it?
Pretty much.
Check this out.
I mean, I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now off the consumers.com.
I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.
As somebody who's been in the technical field for about ten years...
Even in the worst conditions, I've never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty.
So obviously this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.
Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website.
Supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.
It's coming from Consumerist.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.
They're both in that same thing.
Their blogs are also very similar looking.
I actually kind of like Consumerist.
They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.
But anyhow, sorry.
I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.
That's fine.
So we're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation, and
Was this person smoking right in front of it?
Was it just poorly ventilated?
I look at Loki's house and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that.
DarkSakura's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that.
I don't think it's the machine.
I think there's something the person is doing.
That's what it is.
Is the cat sleeping on it at night?
I don't know, he's just stuck in somewhere to easily collect dust in a basement or something.
Now, the next link I posted off the consumer is, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.
If you read the comments, you find out that the guy that complained about this is an actor.
And now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.
And I also posted a link from playtime.net about it.
The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?
Yeah.
Why?
Supposedly, this guy is a paid... He was paid to do this.
This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?
PS3, you're so dirty.
You've been very naughty, Sony PlayStation.
You're a naughty play... What the crap?
Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3... Who paid him to... Oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.
It wasn't Sony that did it.
Somebody paid him to do it.
He's... Okay.
Okay.
I'm reading this from Play3.net.
End of the story?
No, it only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.
Now, it is possible this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.
These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career or paid as part of the much-cited Microsoft Dirty Tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.
What the hell?
That seems kind of low.
I mean, I don't think, you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da, this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.
So I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.
Oh, yes, sure, Nathan.
I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.
You know what?
It's not supposed to be an act on the news.
Oh, it was Fox News.
That could be... Yeah, fair and balanced.
Well, you know what?
When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?
Even porno?
Yeah, sure, porno.
Skinamax.
I don't know.
Why do people do Skinamax films?
I don't know.
Well, Ranma, I don't know.
What do you think of this?
Who do you think did the set-up?
I honestly don't know because I read all the comments.
He claims that this is legit.
To be perfectly honest, I don't know.
But I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.
I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.
That's what I honestly think.
That's kind of a mental problem.
It gets dusty, but we've had stuff sit out for like three, four months.
We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months, and it's not even that dirty.
It looks like it's nearly new, and we don't even touch it.
I think he just has issues.
I think that's what it boils down to.
Cleaning issues.
Yeah, cleaning issues.
Maybe he lives in a toilet.
Who knows?
Where it would get especially dusty.
That makes a lot of sense, Rob.
Shut up.
I hate you.
You shut up, you m'lady.
I hate you.
Children, children, behave.
That's what I get for reading fast.
All right.
Anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?
All right, we'll be making a trip out to the West Coast.
When?
Yay.
Looking at Fourth of July weekend.
Awesome.
Well, we will be seeing you then.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And all time.
All right.
All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.
One last question, I'll get out of here.
Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?
Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?
I will give you three guesses.
It starts with a J. I love you.
All right.
Take care, Ranma.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
I'd like to point out it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager, too.
Just so you know.
Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager.
Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hi there, this is RawSteelUT Hello RawSteelUT, what is on your mind?
Not much, you know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO podcast
I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.
I mean, it was that unreal.
Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight?
Or a clan fight or whatever?
I would not want to meet... Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.
I guess.
Anyway, that reminds me of a...
Recent post on Kotaku, apparently the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on internet cafes and stuff like that.
Let me put a link on the chat.
Basically what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming cafes because, like you know, China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.
Well... Hello?
Yeah, no, no, no, sorry, I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.
Let's see, it looks like you're linking us to Kotaku, who ran this report.
Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal internet cafes, Xinhua said.
The crackdown netted 1407 computers while 7 people were arrested and nearly 5000 internet accounts closed.
Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.
Wow.
Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.
I mean, normally I'm not for forcing limits on internet time, but damn it, it really sounds like China's got a real problem.
Most of Asia, really.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, I was about to say that.
That sounds like people are really crammed in there.
That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.
I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.
That's an interesting image right there.
For real.
That's a very interesting image.
That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.
All right, go ahead.
Sorry, anyway.
Anyway, there's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the...
Xbox 360 failures.
Give me a second.
I'll pop up another link.
The guy's saying that they're... I think I heard about this.
This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this is why they're paying for it, right?
Well, I'm posting the link now.
It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually.
You know, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.
So, you know, it sort of makes me wonder, you know, the legitimacy of it.
You know, I don't know if you're reading it now, but... Yeah, it's kind of a lengthy article.
It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site that ran this, it looks like.
A story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about the Xbox 360 Red Ring of Death failures.
And it was an interview conducted via email.
Yeah, exactly.
That's already a big red flag.
I don't know.
I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.
Maybe it's the same guy who's doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.
Who knows?
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, it's funny you mention that because Ranma was just talking about that.
It could just be mudslinging on both sides.
It's Reggie.
Reggie Fils-Aimé is doing it all, apparently.
No, I don't know.
I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.
I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article because, honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 Red Rings of Death are caused because Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's not really news to me.
I was about to say, yeah.
I mean, that's been everybody's known about the X-Clamps for some time.
So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners to save money?
Not really.
That's no surprise.
Does it make it right?
No.
But I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.
I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of...
of trying to correct the issue, really.
They made a boo-boo.
They're fessing up to it.
I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.
He's got an Instagram.
Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.
I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.
I suppose that's true.
So, yeah, I don't know.
I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but, you know, I guess...
As long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.
And there are some people who still do have working ones.
But honestly, you tell me the failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?
It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, the problem is when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.
They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system worked.
Good point.
You're right.
You're right.
I've never seen that happen.
People don't complain when things are working.
You're right.
That's a good point.
Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.
We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.
Apparently, and here's one more link, Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable content.
Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice, you know?
Yeah, you know what?
Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.
You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe since we have some new people, thanks to Justin.TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I think if Capcom's taking a stand going, you know what, this game is too complex, we can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock content, then I say, applause!
I think they're just, you know... Hello?
Yeah, go ahead.
I think it's just that, you know, this is their game, you know, and personally, I applaud them for it.
Because you do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content to Hello Horse Armor.
and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.
And it's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game and this is what it's going to be.
You don't see enough of that nowadays.
I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.
It's a good one.
Ross Dio, we've got to let you go because we've got to wrap up the show.
But thank you so much for calling.
We'd love to hear from you.
Okay.
Have a good one, buddy.
DarkSakra, Loki, I have nothing.
Do you guys?
Nope.
Loki.
Uh, yeah.
Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff.
Um, one of which is this game that I just found called Line Golfer.
Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses, almost.
And it's actually pretty fun.
Uh, you can find it at, uh, let's see here, this website called CandyStand.com.
And you can, uh, check it out there.
Wait, isn't that, like, Lifesavers and stuff?
Isn't that their website?
CandyStand?
I don't know.
Or am I crazy?
Maybe.
But, um...
Well, no, it is Wrigley'sCandyStand.com The hottest games online, they say.
And it's pretty fun.
You can create your own courses and you can upload them and play all these different courses and stuff.
Let's see here.
Then, other stuff that's kind of funny.
Apparently, GameGirl.com ran a Top 7 Geek Panties for Girls.
Oh God, I heard about this.
How many does Irene own?
That's what I want to know.
Eight.
Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone on there or not.
I don't think so.
Number six would be the password protection panties.
It says username and password.
That's kind of funny.
Wow.
Bonus stage panties.
I agree with Halo Master in chat.
Best radio show ever.
Space Invader Panties would be number four.
Number three is Achievement Unlocked Panties.
Number two, Classic Nintendo Panties.
Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?
I don't think so.
These can't be legitimate.
And then Mario Panties.
Hooray!
Other fun stuff, there's a rumor that when Smash Bros.
Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that
Super Smash Bros.
Brawl
Hillary Clinton is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto 4.
Bullshit.
No, hold on, hold on, hold on.
It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her.
Kind of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.
Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.
I know, why would you want that prostitute?
That doesn't make sense.
I don't know.
Whatever.
Guys, whatever.
Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.
The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me?
And after being killed with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.
That's fucked up.
That's gotta be a lie.
That's some stupid kid's idea of a funny.
But you know what?
Ranma in chat at chat.org sums up my thoughts perfectly.
Do not want...
Um, and then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.
That's it?
I found something pretty.
Alright, what's that?
Um, Eurogamer, which is one of the places I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out.
And Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.
You know, Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chatroom.
Alright.
It's very, very pretty.
even though they're getting the most awful person in the world to play them but oh well alright well it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up this show Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess thank you guys for coming to the show we haven't had guests here in forever even though you guys didn't talk much but maybe it's because we have a mic shortage I don't know but I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless and thank you for the pie that was much appreciated do you have any final thoughts Sir Nathan?
no alright Rice Princess any final thoughts?
Yes.
All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?
My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what my computer can actually do.
Yay.
And so I... My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now on JustinTV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take a couple weeks to work out the bumps.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Well, someone in our chat room said...
The pie is true.
The pie is true.
The pie is delicious.
That's what it really boils down to.
At the end of Orange Launch Radio, there will be pie.
Wow.
All right.
Thank you so much for tuning in.
All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.
That's how we slowly spread the word.
If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Dig, whatever.
Or even if you do tell two people, you can also leave a five-star review.
It's okay.
I want to thank – we had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people that put those very kind reviews.
We really appreciate it.
Until next time.
I'm Rob Roberts, that's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
