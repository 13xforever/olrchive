00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:14,735
[SPEAKER_08]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:19,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for part B of our program.

5
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:35,480
[SPEAKER_10]: and if you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Bros.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,981
[SPEAKER_10]: delay.

7
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:51,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.

8
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:54,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get back into some regular gaming news.

9
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:55,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Start off with Loki.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:08,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.

11
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:16,013
[SPEAKER_11]: This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN, and basically they gave the time frame.

12
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:23,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.

13
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:24,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'll believe it when I see it type thing.

15
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:42,815
[SPEAKER_11]: If it is, they may show it at like E3 or something like that because it'd have to be kind of done, but I don't, you know, it's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of, um,

16
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:48,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Release dates, because, you know... Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever, right?

17
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

18
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:54,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope this rumor is true, though, because I... Oh, I love me some... I love me some Duke Nukem, too.

19
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:59,763
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be even better if some of the expansions and the whole made stuff come out as, you know, downloadable stuff.

20
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:03,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope the build editor comes with it, because that would be awesome.

21
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:04,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the voice macros.

22
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:05,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

23
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Being able to make your own voice macros, that'd be awesome.

24
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:11,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C.

25
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:12,219
[SPEAKER_10]: mod or something?

26
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I still remember having that on CD at one point.

27
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:15,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

28
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:17,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Duke Nukem.

29
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem's great.

30
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:21,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.

31
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:22,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:23,628
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.

33
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,049
[SPEAKER_10]: You're laughing, Nathan.

34
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Did that inspire... What's a modem?

35
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:28,572
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you, 12?

36
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

37
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,235
[SPEAKER_10]: They let you...

38
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:34,509
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

39
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, Duke Nukem.

40
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:41,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.

41
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:46,262
[SPEAKER_10]: But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem forever, damn it.

42
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,284
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, this I'll allow.

43
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:49,998
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great.

45
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:19,762
[SPEAKER_10]: At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.

46
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:23,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.

47
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like the day it came out.

48
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:30,172
[SPEAKER_10]: So, alright, well, um, let's move on with some other gaming news.

49
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:34,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking about Xbox Live still, but this time, talking about...

50
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band, and Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.

51
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:57,821
[SPEAKER_10]: The last segment we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs, because, you know, unlike last year, EA Harmonix has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.

52
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,281
[SPEAKER_10]: They also retracted them after they announced them.

53
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:00,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they?

54
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:01,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

55
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:01,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but still.

56
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't look back in anger, live forever in Wonderwall

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather not, thank you.

58
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,531
[SPEAKER_10]: On January 29th, the Progressive Pack comes out.

59
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:34,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Both packs will set you back 400 points, or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive Pack.

60
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.

61
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed.

62
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,413
[SPEAKER_10]: That's also a cover.

63
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Smashing Pumpkins with Siva.

64
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:43,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a cover.

65
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s.

66
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:46,874
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like their first single ever.

67
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:52,655
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.

68
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,356
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's all we know until February.

69
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.

70
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:03,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.

71
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: We get Foreigner.

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:06,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

73
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.

74
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:13,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And Journey's Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.

75
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

76
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Journey!

77
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:18,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm more about Boston right now.

78
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:22,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know, they did

79
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: There's better songs.

80
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:24,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Why those?

81
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:27,016
[SPEAKER_05]: At least we're not getting hot-blooded.

82
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,577
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's Journey.

83
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:29,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

84
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:35,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and Rock Band because their music wasn't showing up.

85
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, where's the Journey?

86
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's coming out, and that makes me very happy.

87
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:44,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that all three of these songs are also in Rock Band, I want to say.

88
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Jukebox Hero is.

89
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Jukebox Hero is, yeah.

90
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there's another Boston song that's in...

91
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:53,958
[SPEAKER_05]: and Rock Band.

92
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this is it.

93
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

94
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're getting old rock.

95
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:01,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

96
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:05,686
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you play Boston Backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.

97
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:06,727
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not true.

98
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:08,729
[SPEAKER_10]: That's from Little Nicky.

99
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop spreading lies on the internet.

100
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:12,912
[SPEAKER_10]: You're one of those.

101
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:13,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's my job.

102
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:20,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So, speaking of another, well,

103
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:27,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the U.S.

104
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:35,272
[SPEAKER_11]: The first machine, apparently, is at In The Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

105
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:44,597
[SPEAKER_11]: According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at start.

106
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:47,999
[SPEAKER_11]: All the other fun stuff.

107
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,900
[SPEAKER_11]: No EMUs support that.

108
00:06:50,387 --> 00:07:01,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

109
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited that there's new DDR.

110
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Although it's not near us, so... I don't know.

111
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:11,345
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I already told you how I feel about DDR, and I got in a little trouble for it.

112
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:15,889
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2, and I'm just kind of like...

113
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,354
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the same thing with some new songs.

114
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,715
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to be another Max 2.

115
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:23,236
[SPEAKER_11]: They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.

116
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:34,982
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, where they have, like, remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the Oni courses and stuff like that, and that was exciting, you know, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, you know, that kind of thing, and the way they tease that.

117
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:39,624
[SPEAKER_11]: With these, like, DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.

118
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:43,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just kind of like, DDR, here you go, enjoy.

119
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:45,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, another DDR, enjoy.

120
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:46,027
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't

121
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,126
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:23,806
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, you know, the younger kids that were, you know, our age when we started.

123
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll get into it.

124
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop dating me and yourself.

125
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,330
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rob, I love you.

126
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that, you know what I mean.

127
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:34,914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, but I mean, like, I'd have to play it.

128
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm not as excited.

129
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:41,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I was excited probably when 4th Plus came out and 5th Mix.

130
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:45,941
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know, I just don't care anymore.

131
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:47,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

132
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

133
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:53,415
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.

134
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,637
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Janai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.

135
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Steel UT says, DDR Star Wars edition.

136
00:08:59,478 --> 00:08:59,958
[SPEAKER_10]: That would work.

137
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:00,879
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

138
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:02,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

139
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:18,905
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and see, that's partially, I think, why DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap like Hottest Party and all this stuff that's just absolute shit.

140
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,446
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make a 12-player mode with peripherals.

141
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:23,647
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

142
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.

143
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:35,350
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but seriously, they could do, like, you know, make some really elaborate cabinet that was 4-player, have, like, a quad mode or something like that that's in the arcade.

144
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,290
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be different.

145
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,071
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and...

146
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:44,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, even Animero gets behind Pump It Up, and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.

147
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,025
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Konami doesn't do anything.

148
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,545
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, oh, look, it's DR. Yes.

149
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even with, like, Beatmania, it's like, what's it matter?

150
00:09:52,323 --> 00:10:11,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're gonna release another one in a few months anyway, so, I mean, it's... I know, it's like they think it's some kind of a self-advertising franchise, like, we already have a fanbase built in, we don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah, but, like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing, like, excite us about it, otherwise why should we give a shit, so... Alright.

151
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:17,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, just reinvent DDR, make it competitive, I'll be all over that game again, just, you know, just

152
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:19,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Start from scratch.

153
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what DDR needs?

154
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,429
[SPEAKER_10]: A new producer.

155
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:30,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some... I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there, because obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.

156
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:31,391
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it needs.

157
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:32,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Some new blood.

158
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,532
[SPEAKER_10]: We are starting over, right?

159
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:35,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow.

160
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Something else so you can get your music fixed through.

161
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Not DDR, but the other type.

162
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:40,253
[SPEAKER_10]: The

163
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

164
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:06,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.

165
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:09,537
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.

166
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:16,782
[SPEAKER_10]: You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.

167
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.

168
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,162
[SPEAKER_10]: They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.

169
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.

170
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:30,887
[SPEAKER_10]: The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert.

171
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:31,588
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of cool.

172
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:43,877
[SPEAKER_10]: As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal, February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California, at the Knob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.

173
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,458
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to catch that.

174
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:51,877
[SPEAKER_10]: and if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.

175
00:11:53,017 --> 00:12:00,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet, including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.

176
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, Jamie, Anaheim, California?

177
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Disneyland.

178
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Disneyland slash Video Games Live.

179
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?

180
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:06,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it.

182
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather go to E3.

183
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to go to E3.

184
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:12,761
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

185
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:14,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, so there you have it.

186
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:15,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Video games live.

187
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:15,587
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be fun.

188
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not been yet.

189
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:21,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwolf at all games.

190
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,436
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, he enjoys the show.

191
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:27,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show, and he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.

192
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney World!

193
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:29,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I know!

194
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:30,624
[SPEAKER_10]: It's even better!

195
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:31,725
[SPEAKER_10]: God, guys.

196
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So one-track-minded.

197
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney Land, Disney Land, Disney Land

198
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:01,542
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

199
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,312
[SPEAKER_10]: God, would it be Space Mountain again in California?

200
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Mountain and California Screamin'.

201
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:28,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Rawr, that sounds great.

202
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry, we turned into the Disney cast for a minute.

203
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, please take the show back on track.

204
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:44,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Devil May Cry 4, there is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.

205
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:57,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on that was actually removed from the downloadable version that was saying it would be out.

206
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st and out a week later in North America and Europe.

207
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,027
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it going to happen?

208
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:09,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.

209
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:13,089
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it true?

210
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it not?

211
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:14,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Did someone just screw up?

212
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:18,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.

213
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes sense.

214
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Jinx.

215
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:24,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom.

216
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:27,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you showed me.

217
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,556
[SPEAKER_11]: She wins, Rob.

218
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:30,556
[SPEAKER_11]: She said your mom.

219
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,677
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to do now?

220
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:35,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how Jamie said that off the mic.

221
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:36,079
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to refuse.

222
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:36,979
[SPEAKER_10]: She goes, I like your mom.

223
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to clarify, I do like your mom.

224
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom's cool.

225
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:41,381
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom is cool.

226
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,202
[SPEAKER_10]: She'd bake pies too.

227
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:46,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.

228
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,556
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys can make me Easter cookies together.

229
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:52,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, forget it.

230
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:53,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on.

231
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:54,459
[SPEAKER_10]: More game news, please.

232
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, something else is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N+.

233
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:10,250
[SPEAKER_11]: If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.

234
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very fucking hard.

235
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:23,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be, I think, on both Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer, as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.

236
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:32,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon, because apparently it's already, I guess, past their certification.

237
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,230
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hooray!

238
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's a pretty fun game.

239
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon, too.

240
00:15:44,491 --> 00:16:04,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to www.harveycartel.org That's H-A-R-V-E-Y Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano?

241
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's Cartel.

242
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, never mind.

243
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:21,318
[SPEAKER_11]: h-a-r-v-e-y c-a-r-t-e-l dot org slash metanet slash downloads.html and you can play the full game there.

244
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,079
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty fun.

245
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of challenge, though.

246
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:28,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

247
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it going to be worth it?

248
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Because N right now is free, right?

249
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?

250
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it'll be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in there.

251
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,219
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're going to have new levels.

252
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:45,280
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.

253
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know those are going to be in there and you get achievements.

254
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:50,342
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

255
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.

256
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:59,345
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers sucked during Christmas.

257
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently they're not that sorry.

258
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.

259
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a new game, a game that was already out.

260
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,456
[SPEAKER_10]: But you will be able to download it for a limited time for free.

261
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:14,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.

262
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:17,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have about a three-day period roughly to get the game.

263
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:25,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800-FOR-MY-XBOX, they're supposed to be able to do something for you.

264
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Like maybe give you the points back?

265
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:27,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

266
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:28,864
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't say, will they?

267
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

268
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:30,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they don't want everybody to rush them.

269
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:40,150
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary, but whatever.

270
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.

271
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:45,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just...

272
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:47,461
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of fucked up.

273
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:49,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather have, like, you know, a free month of live or something.

274
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,525
[SPEAKER_10]: It would have been a lot cheaper for them, too, but... The demo was kind of fun.

275
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:54,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll look at it.

276
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:57,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.

277
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:57,768
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

278
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:58,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll grab it while it's free.

279
00:17:58,908 --> 00:17:59,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

280
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Add it to my collection.

281
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:01,410
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's on the hard drive.

282
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And quite frankly, they didn't really owe us anything to begin with, I don't think.

283
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:07,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this whole thing got blown way out of proportion.

284
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of like, you know what?

285
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,595
[SPEAKER_10]: If you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.

286
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:11,876
[SPEAKER_10]: It was still kind of spotty.

287
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:12,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I...

288
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:24,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I hadn't played on live since like New Year's or something because I had to recover my gamer tag from I think year 360 and it had trouble doing that.

289
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:34,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked which sucks because for whatever reason to download that like six megs as your gamer tag it takes like a half an hour.

290
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,400
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.

291
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:38,381
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking slow but yeah.

292
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:44,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.

293
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Son of Dad, I wanted Rez.

294
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft seems to think that Rez will be up this week.

295
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:49,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that's true.

296
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:54,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, that may be true because I think they said Rez was coming out in January and there's only one more week in January, right?

297
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:55,588
[SPEAKER_10]: No, two more.

298
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, two more.

299
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:56,629
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

300
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:57,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the next couple weeks.

301
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:00,753
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

302
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:05,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought this week was... Didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought, already?

303
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:06,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

304
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:10,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it was?

305
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,320
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks stupid.

306
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:12,621
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay.

307
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:17,444
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much... There's a game just like it, Magical Drop, on the Neo Geo.

308
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:21,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost just like Magical Drop, but with bunnies, and you can run up the sides, too.

309
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:27,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the other little innovation, is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.

310
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:29,092
[SPEAKER_10]: It adds a new element to it.

311
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:30,333
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I don't know.

312
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:33,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry, I got a little off track, but I realized I never talked about it during my game.

313
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to check out Omega 5, maybe, but... Omega 5's awesome.

314
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,057
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to check that out.

315
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,078
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely worth a look.

316
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:45,243
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron, or if you like the newer ones or whatever, check it out.

317
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:46,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it.

318
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Undertow for free.

319
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:49,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Be sure to take a look this week.

320
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:56,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game, and actually I'm sort of interested in, is the Highlander game that's coming out.

321
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You play as Owen MacLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.

322
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:03,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Go fig.

323
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:15,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day, and you've got a lot of people that you meet, and a lot of people you kill, and it's supposed to be really, really gory.

324
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But part of it is...

325
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Act as a Conductor for High Voltage Electrical Current

326
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty cool.

327
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:54,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions, and full cities, and you can use zip wires and that type of thing.

328
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And did I say gory?

329
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's supposed to be gory.

330
00:20:58,272 --> 00:20:59,673
[SPEAKER_10]: This game sounds epic.

331
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you just know something's going to go wrong, though.

332
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's too good on paper.

333
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's PS3, 360, and PC.

334
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's made by Eidos.

335
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It did give us Tomb Raider.

336
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:13,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, exactly.

337
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:14,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

338
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:16,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.

339
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:20,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one was the best because you could make her explode.

340
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:21,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I do agree.

341
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:26,396
[SPEAKER_05]: You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.

342
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?

343
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,217
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I just said.

344
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:34,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.

345
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:35,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

346
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:37,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

347
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:45,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob

348
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:09,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, they were.

349
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:12,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, the new one.

350
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, different strokes for different folks, right?

351
00:22:17,326 --> 00:22:19,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.

352
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:22,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.

353
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:31,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Spore, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous release on the PC.

354
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:34,054
[SPEAKER_11]: So, awesome.

355
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:34,434
[SPEAKER_11]: They can...

356
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:36,436
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

357
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008.

358
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:09,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which, you know, the marketing probably just hasn't kicked in yet.

359
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there'll be more later on.

360
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,049
[SPEAKER_10]: But that Spore was overhyped.

361
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:15,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough, in my opinion.

362
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:24,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but, I mean, I don't know if our poster, you know, everybody's welcome to their own opinion.

363
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:27,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the poster saw what I saw at E3 and stuff, but...

364
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:28,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

365
00:23:53,877 --> 00:24:02,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin but has no sort of optical drive on it at all.

366
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It has one USB port.

367
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:10,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if you want to actually use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked.

368
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:14,865
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to buy a $99 drive for it.

369
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:21,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck probably and use its optical drive.

370
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:25,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, but that's... Oh, and $1,700.

371
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:26,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome!

372
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:27,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job!

373
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:28,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Steve Jones.

374
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:30,544
[SPEAKER_11]: You really know what the consumer wants.

375
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:32,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Crap for lots of money.

376
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:33,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray!

377
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:40,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm sure all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.

378
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen.

379
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,315
[SPEAKER_10]: He can send those cards and letters...

380
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:46,950
[SPEAKER_10]: to Loki at OrangeSongTrader.com

381
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,055
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

382
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Street Fighter Online.

383
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some more news coming out about this.

384
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:39,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, they licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online.

385
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,185
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's mouse controlled.

386
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:45,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that were going to be in an MMO.

387
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:47,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, no, this is a whole other thing.

388
00:25:48,071 --> 00:26:05,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses in certain combinations and click, you do the special attacks.

389
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:06,625
[SPEAKER_10]: That's dumb.

390
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,426
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be very interesting.

391
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea how that's going to be.

392
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about this game.

393
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what?

394
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the ability to, like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.

395
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,668
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

396
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:27,150
[SPEAKER_11]: A little taunts with your cat.

397
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you can have, like, ceiling cat, you know, and stuff like that.

398
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:34,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Ceiling cat is watching you lose.

399
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:34,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

400
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:39,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltech toys.

401
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,609
[SPEAKER_10]: That is an actual line of toys.

402
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have the toys for this, too, that you can buy.

403
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:45,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

404
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:47,311
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can get my very own Chun-Li doll?

405
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:47,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

406
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:48,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

407
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:53,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.

408
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:58,115
[SPEAKER_10]: The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.

409
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,777
[SPEAKER_10]: For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet.

410
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:02,377
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no news.

411
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:04,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next time.

412
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, DarkSakura, Skye, and OtherDude.

413
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:46,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor OtherDude.

414
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,250
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, I'm OtherDude.

415
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Nathan, you're already getting mails.

416
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:50,473
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

417
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, OtherDude, good job.

418
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:53,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the show.

419
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:55,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

420
00:27:55,535 --> 00:28:05,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot in my human growth class stole my PSP Slim, which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on it.

421
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:12,308
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen, and it had my podcast for OLR.

422
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this person doesn't use any punctuation, so sorry.

423
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:23,076
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you to people who steal and bully people, plus the stupid kid.

424
00:28:23,517 --> 00:28:25,338
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is, I'm not going to say his name.

425
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:33,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook this kid had weed in his bag along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.

426
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids today!

427
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:35,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus!

428
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:44,678
[SPEAKER_05]: But get this, I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website worthy of going to all geeky things for girls and guys.

429
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ofthinkgeek.com.

430
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

431
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:53,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the background video for Potsilvania Dances and Chorus is like seen from Advent Children.

432
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have...

433
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:01,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Every title made, but did you know that Konami had Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?

434
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.

435
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:16,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game Boy, which sucked, by the way.

436
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:23,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the portable aspect of this, but Stepmania has recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution, but that's how much...

437
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.

438
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:28,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

439
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:35,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist is going downhill to the mainstream crowd.

440
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:39,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, only our emails would go from cocaine in somebody's underwear to DDR Disney Channel.

441
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,090
[SPEAKER_10]: What the... WTF, LOL.

442
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,591
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no punctuation.

443
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The only periods in this are used in a URL.

444
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.

445
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:18,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

446
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for our lesson of the week.

447
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:24,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in boredom and says help.

448
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:31,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would say if your, you know, PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross because that was a good game.

449
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:36,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.

450
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:38,579
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a nice thing to do.

451
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Or pick cocaine in your underwear.

452
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:40,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

453
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:44,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody knows you put it in your jacket, in the inside liner, you've got to...

454
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:45,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

455
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:48,371
[SPEAKER_05]: You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.

456
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:51,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

457
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:56,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn how to put it in your body cavity.

458
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

459
00:30:58,036 --> 00:31:03,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and this person was called... As soon as... Email servers are tuning up.

460
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Punctuation man.

461
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,281
[SPEAKER_05]: DSMaster25.

462
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:10,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like... It sounds like an old AOL screen name.

463
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:11,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

464
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:12,564
[SPEAKER_10]: DSMaster...

465
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:19,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So the guy had his PSP, I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand, this story is completely crazy.

466
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.

467
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:25,938
[SPEAKER_10]: He talks about how much he misses his PSP, and he's DS fan.

468
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:27,899
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm bum.

469
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next email.

470
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.

471
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:34,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, okay, there it is.

472
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:35,203
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that can't be it.

473
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:37,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

474
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:39,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I read the next email, Rob?

475
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you may.

476
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:40,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, stop.

477
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:41,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Love you.

478
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give you a copy of Super Stardust HD.

479
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:14,092
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?

480
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:17,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a relatively easy process, and I'd be happy to share my games with you.

481
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:21,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So add Resumo to your friends list and we'll talk.

482
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,265
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:52,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the iCamera and in the process help Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.

484
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:53,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna happen.

485
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:54,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Never gonna happen.

486
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:59,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other game in all our history.

487
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:01,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, and it's still under cheese big time.

488
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:10,002
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had guests on to promote, you know, Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote, you know, and, you know, I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought...

489
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:14,245
[SPEAKER_10]: 24 of the game because you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.

490
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:23,991
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a tingle suit if you can tell a million of your friends to buy this game.

491
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,734
[SPEAKER_11]: It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.

492
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:29,915
[SPEAKER_11]: It's starting to flat out.

493
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:34,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, in Japan, they only sold like a couple hundred units the other week.

494
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:39,181
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one millionth.

495
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:42,140
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Janai now calls it the brown eye of fudgement.

496
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I finish reading this email, please?

497
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:46,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you may.

498
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

499
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.

500
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:55,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.

501
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I can store as much as 5 gigs of video on the hard drive.

502
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:05,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Attached is a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1,000 mile rally arcade machine that I recorded with the iCamera.

503
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll watch it later.

504
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an MP4.

505
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:13,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter 2 machine that I just bought.

506
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,999
[SPEAKER_05]: She loves my Pac-Man the most.

507
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:19,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to this show on my PSP.

508
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I made the mistake of listening to this show last week while drinking coffee and ringing up a customer.

509
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:28,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow-cooking George Foreman girl and I laughed and spat coffee at my customer's face.

510
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:30,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good for business.

511
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:35,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't have to pay for his merchandise.

512
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.

513
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:41,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.

514
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so strange to me the effect this show has.

515
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:54,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a BART ride home from San Francisco or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.

516
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing what you can achieve.

517
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:58,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's mostly Loki's fault.

518
00:34:58,985 --> 00:34:59,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give him that.

519
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:03,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.

520
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:03,907
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not nice.

521
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:04,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really.

522
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:05,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, it's my fault.

523
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:15,223
[SPEAKER_05]: and just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting so that we can see your daughter play a video game.

524
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, was it goddaughter?

525
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:17,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

526
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:18,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Play a video game.

527
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:21,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

528
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:27,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorse DS piracy.

529
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.

530
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,182
[SPEAKER_05]: 500 games in total.

531
00:35:34,643 --> 00:35:36,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.

532
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:38,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Crack firmware on iPod games.

533
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Should you really read this on the air?

534
00:35:39,488 --> 00:35:40,108
[SPEAKER_05]: From Ryan.

535
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:43,532
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, here's the thing.

536
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:44,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing about that.

537
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:51,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.

538
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's just like,

539
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I could pirate all these games.

540
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,575
[SPEAKER_10]: As the FBI is coming to Ryan's house right now.

541
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:58,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

542
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:01,316
[SPEAKER_10]: We've narrowed it down to Ryan.

543
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's find Ryan.

544
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:03,517
[SPEAKER_10]: How many Ryans are there?

545
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, only a couple billion.

546
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:05,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait a minute.

547
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:07,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Ryan's not listening to this program.

548
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,078
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably only one.

549
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,239
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have that many listeners.

550
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:12,279
[SPEAKER_11]: He emailed.

551
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:13,820
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't say he listened to the program.

552
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,920
[SPEAKER_11]: He just emailed us.

553
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,180
[SPEAKER_05]: IP tracking.

554
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see.

555
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, the only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all the games I don't want to import.

556
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:23,727
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have it.

557
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.

558
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:29,190
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband, you know, manages a game crazy.

559
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:36,533
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.

560
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:37,874
[SPEAKER_11]: That game sucks.

561
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:40,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not good at all.

562
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't you say that last week?

563
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing.

564
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

565
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's A-M-A-Z-I-Z-I-N-G.

566
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:22,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news that we all want.

567
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,905
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with any... I feel... I don't know.

568
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:33,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other publishers.

569
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:35,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, we'll promote your stuff.

570
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:36,870
[SPEAKER_10]: No thanks.

571
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.

572
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Jamie.

573
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:42,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

574
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:43,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Blame him.

575
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:45,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

576
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I read now?

577
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

578
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,441
Okay.

579
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:52,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how the mailbag segment always turns into, how many times can we cut off Jamie with a random tangent?

580
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:55,384
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?

581
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, go ahead.

582
00:37:57,305 --> 00:38:04,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd only listened to before on my PSP, even though I live overseas.

583
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:07,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.

584
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stories.

585
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem to have anything special

586
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:38,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a Worst Game of the Week segment or something like that?

587
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:40,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki is special.

588
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It would give him a chance to blow off some steam, LOL.

589
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:47,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a Worst Game of the Week.

590
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,348
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of stupid.

591
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,470
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the worst idea of the week.

592
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor listener.

593
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:55,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I finish?

594
00:38:55,573 --> 00:38:55,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

595
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:56,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

596
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:57,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's about it.

597
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:58,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, an ego plug...

598
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.

599
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

600
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like, can I finish?

601
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's just about it.

602
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:21,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you guys.

603
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:24,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, well that's about it.

604
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:32,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being, and being 15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.

605
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:33,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the awesome work.

606
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this person writes a very freaking good, you know, email for being 15.

607
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from TheFlawlessBoltX.

608
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:48,628
[SPEAKER_05]: PS, I bought myself an Eye of Judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.

609
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,228
[SPEAKER_05]: PSS, put more crap on the PSP website.

610
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I never get tired of that.

611
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

612
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:53,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I will never!

613
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It will stay the way it is.

614
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,291
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.

615
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:03,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I think we finally let expire.

616
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:09,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.

617
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to keep on reading.

618
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR crew, this is Ranma from Indonesia.

619
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, yeah, you've written to us.

620
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.

621
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since my last email.

622
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.

623
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:30,080
[SPEAKER_05]: To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments about game-related contents.

624
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep getting crazy then.

625
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: to Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game-related content in your mocking style.

626
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

627
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.

628
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:51,108
[SPEAKER_05]: To DarkSakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week, as I am blind, so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.

629
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:54,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.

630
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,932
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.

631
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:01,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.

632
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:04,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I love playing recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.

633
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.

634
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone sent us movies this week.

635
00:41:10,953 --> 00:41:11,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's links on here.

636
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:20,038
[SPEAKER_05]: These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments and I will add more songs to play.

637
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps Dragon Force.

638
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:25,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It did Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok.

639
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I love Ragnarok.

640
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,041
[SPEAKER_05]: More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.

641
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of old school.

642
00:41:30,503 --> 00:41:31,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

643
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:33,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email, dun dun dun.

644
00:41:50,953 --> 00:41:54,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then it was your abbreviated Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

645
00:41:55,014 --> 00:42:10,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the podcasts I was getting, and yours was one of the longest, but recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors don't notice me on it all day, or call me on it, and have me subscribe.

646
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:11,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I listen to your show every week.

647
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, for starters, you'll notice that I've included an attachment.

648
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:19,980
[SPEAKER_05]: God, we've been getting attachments all...

649
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:24,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to blow up our email box.

650
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:33,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare to Be Stupid as the background music for your Stupid Awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your dialogue on top of it.

651
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I've included an instrumental version of the song taken from the Amish Paradise single.

652
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:42,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I ripped the file myself, so I know it's legit, in case you want to use it in future segments.

653
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:43,759
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

654
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:48,723
[SPEAKER_05]: The background vocals on the chorus are still there, so it's still relevant.

655
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:54,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played during last week's FU segment?

656
00:42:55,024 --> 00:43:02,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others.

657
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:06,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was wondering if you could hook me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.

658
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:08,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the Advent Children soundtrack.

659
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:12,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll take care of this later.

660
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:13,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned.

661
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:24,478
[SPEAKER_10]: How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?

662
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:26,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

663
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if I may continue.

664
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.

665
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:40,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney World.

666
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:42,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave it at that.

667
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, nice.

668
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:46,913
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.

669
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as I can get away with it.

670
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:55,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.

671
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:57,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Justin the Claw.

672
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

673
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:06,352
[SPEAKER_05]: On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to a game as addicting.

674
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:08,252
[SPEAKER_05]: When did that word become an adjective?

675
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:11,713
[SPEAKER_05]: According to Merian Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.

676
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:13,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Addictive would be the proper adjective form.

677
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:15,354
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not the only one to do this.

678
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:18,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.

679
00:44:18,515 --> 00:44:19,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.

680
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:23,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?

681
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: No offense, of course.

682
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:25,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just making an observation.

683
00:44:25,737 --> 00:44:27,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but it could also be an understood object.

684
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:30,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, dude.

685
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:33,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.

686
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:38,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.

687
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:40,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hate.

688
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,532
[SPEAKER_05]: See, the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.

689
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:49,557
[SPEAKER_10]: He learns something new every week here on Orange Lines Radio.

690
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And FreezePop emailed us.

691
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:55,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

692
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:59,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?

693
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of weeks.

694
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:05,251
[SPEAKER_10]: The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.

695
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:06,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so excited.

696
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:07,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell you who it is next week.

697
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:09,753
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I won't.

698
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:10,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll tell you later.

699
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:13,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I will.

700
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:14,294
[SPEAKER_10]: In a private room.

701
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:19,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.

702
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:24,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

703
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:31,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow up and self-destruct.

704
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:32,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So please don't do that.

705
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.

706
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:40,197
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we haven't even touched, right, Loki?

707
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:41,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

708
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:45,560
[SPEAKER_11]: The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced.

709
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:59,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version, and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network as Bionic Commando Rearmed.

710
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks fucking awesome.

711
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have two-player co-op in the game.

712
00:46:04,673 --> 00:46:11,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.

713
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses.

714
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:19,296
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's basically going to follow the original game.

715
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:20,877
[SPEAKER_10]: This game looks so hot.

716
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:25,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go seek out the video for this.

717
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:27,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody has it, right?

718
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:28,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, pretty much everyone.

719
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Every big video game site has it.

720
00:46:30,484 --> 00:46:31,525
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks so hot.

721
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:33,086
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the way you redo an old game.

722
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:34,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.

723
00:46:34,847 --> 00:46:35,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too, me too.

724
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:46,866
[SPEAKER_10]: But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy.

725
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:49,949
[SPEAKER_10]: He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.

726
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:50,709
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

727
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:51,950
[SPEAKER_10]: That is great.

728
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?

729
00:46:55,453 --> 00:46:56,974
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.

730
00:46:57,935 --> 00:46:59,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right?

731
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:00,798
[SPEAKER_10]: To be politically correct?

732
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:03,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they could still be... His name is now Hyler.

733
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's just like

734
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, just... It's the claw.

735
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,041
[SPEAKER_10]: The claw.

736
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,783
[SPEAKER_10]: See, just in the claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?

737
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyway.

738
00:47:47,105 --> 00:47:54,270
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking game that kind of moves like an M.C.

739
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Escher piece.

740
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to be making its way to the PlayStation 3.

741
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:02,855
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.

742
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:03,856
[SPEAKER_10]: This was one of their kind of like

743
00:48:04,412 --> 00:48:04,673
[SPEAKER_10]: and more.

744
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Check this out on March 19th, which coincidentally is the same day that you can actually check out the PSP version.

745
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.

746
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:33,103
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a PS3, I'd check it out.

747
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:35,265
[SPEAKER_10]: But since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and check it out there.

748
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:37,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Sound good, Loki?

749
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:38,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

750
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:40,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm crashing your party.

751
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,132
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.

752
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

753
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news, crap.

754
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:52,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

755
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,175
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of crap?

756
00:48:53,315 --> 00:48:58,099
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.

757
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to reload show roll.

758
00:49:02,263 --> 00:49:02,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's okay.

759
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:03,204
[SPEAKER_10]: We can wait.

760
00:49:05,346 --> 00:49:05,846
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

761
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:09,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a second.

762
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I just bit on a Vetrix, by the way.

763
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:11,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool!

764
00:49:11,964 --> 00:49:13,025
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to buy a Vectrex?

765
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:13,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

766
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:18,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Because someone in Stockton is selling one and right now the bidding is up to $50 and it comes with like 10 games.

767
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:20,127
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do you want it for?

768
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:20,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to see how... I want a Vectrex.

769
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Put it in my desk at work.

770
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.

771
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:26,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

772
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:26,510
[SPEAKER_05]: You better watch it.

773
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do it too.

774
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:28,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

775
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,851
[SPEAKER_11]: If I don't win, I don't win.

776
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:32,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not like that dead set on getting it.

777
00:49:32,192 --> 00:49:34,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought, like I said, that Bit Generations game.

778
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,334
[SPEAKER_11]: What's it called?

779
00:49:37,594 --> 00:49:38,214
[SPEAKER_11]: DotStream.

780
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:40,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up, by the way.

781
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:40,975
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

782
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be.

783
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:45,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

784
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.

785
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 16 games on it.

786
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be on PS2 and PSP.

787
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:03,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be... Let's see what's on here.

788
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,089
[SPEAKER_05]: We have...

789
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:22,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku, Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician Lord, but they're not on there.

790
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:26,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yes.

791
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:28,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are on there, sorry.

792
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,114
[SPEAKER_10]: We just can't make up our mind.

793
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:33,875
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many SNK classics to choose from.

794
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:34,955
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they are on there.

795
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:36,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

796
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:37,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero 3

797
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:18,867
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be doing a little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say, on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.

798
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:25,273
[SPEAKER_11]: You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live.

799
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:40,003
[SPEAKER_11]: on Guitar03, where you can possibly win a LG 50-inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and a Boomchair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.

800
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:40,863
[SPEAKER_10]: A Boomchair?

801
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:41,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Boomchair.

802
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:54,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller faceplate signed by Slash, and some other crap, including, I think, some points and

803
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:00,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So that should be cool.

804
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:07,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it looks like the event is going to go from February 1st through the 3rd.

805
00:52:07,243 --> 00:52:09,384
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, it's 72 hours.

806
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:19,106
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12 to 4, isn't a big deal there.

807
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:23,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and it's for US and Canada only.

808
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:24,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So, sorry everybody else.

809
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, international people.

810
00:52:27,695 --> 00:52:31,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.

811
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:33,296
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just kidding.

812
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:35,337
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably laws or something.

813
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:35,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

814
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:40,018
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to find out more information on us, go to xbox.com slash rockyourparty.

815
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:42,059
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to rock your party.

816
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:50,191
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we are going to get to the Skype line, where you can call us and interact with us.

817
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:59,354
[SPEAKER_10]: You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give us a call toll-free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

818
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:03,835
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.

819
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:04,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one we don't talk about.

820
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:05,936
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really World of Warcraft.

821
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:11,518
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't talk about this game very much, but it is, I believe, the most popular MMO in the world, even above World of Warcraft.

822
00:53:11,578 --> 00:53:12,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game called Lineage 2.

823
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:15,688
[SPEAKER_10]: and, yeah, you know Lineage 2?

824
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:16,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Lineage 2?

825
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,994
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2.

826
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, hey, I've heard of that before.

827
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Coke can.

828
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:23,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I do too.

829
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:25,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.

830
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Lineage 2 Lineage 2

831
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:48,031
[SPEAKER_10]: A Russian man has been charged with murder.

832
00:53:49,012 --> 00:53:53,117
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.

833
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,600
[SPEAKER_10]: There were these two clans.

834
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,403
[SPEAKER_10]: There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.

835
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,525
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Ku Klux Klan.

836
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:04,630
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, yeah, wow, that's all I can say on that one.

837
00:54:04,997 --> 00:54:06,359
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

838
00:54:17,774 --> 00:54:19,254
[SPEAKER_10]: and Plotanium were people over 30.

839
00:54:20,315 --> 00:54:27,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy who was killed here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer.

840
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had a clan.

841
00:54:29,037 --> 00:54:30,178
[SPEAKER_10]: There were warriors in the clan.

842
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:33,939
[SPEAKER_10]: And just before New Year, there was a big old battle with the Ku Klux.

843
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:38,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face-to-face in the real world.

844
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Sign of trouble right there.

845
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:46,136
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.

846
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:51,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, Amazing.

847
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:10,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?

848
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:14,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, is this like a satire website or whatever?

849
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,671
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's real.

850
00:55:18,493 --> 00:55:21,055
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of, wow, sad.

851
00:55:23,376 --> 00:55:24,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad, sad, sad.

852
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:25,778
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awful.

853
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:28,660
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?

854
00:55:30,305 --> 00:55:37,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3 and apparently someone found Goatse in Zelda 3.

855
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It was ridiculous, but funny.

856
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:50,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness or anything else we've talked about tonight.

857
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,395
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go ahead and give us a call right now.

858
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:56,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_10]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, apparently our caller's not there.

869
00:56:14,136 --> 00:56:17,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you always check your connection with Echo 123.

[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

872
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

873
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, this is ION671.

874
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:27,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, ION671.

875
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:27,683
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

876
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:32,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I just want to say that

877
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:38,789
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that, like, you know, parents don't understand games.

878
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:46,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm a kid, you know, 16, and both my parents are really into video games and anime.

879
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:54,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, my dad just was saying, like, how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.

880
00:56:55,719 --> 00:57:01,101
[SPEAKER_10]: You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns, and you're very lucky to have them, right?

881
00:57:01,362 --> 00:57:01,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

882
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:12,607
[SPEAKER_12]: because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games and think that they are the devil's creation.

883
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:16,610
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?

884
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:20,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?

885
00:57:22,735 --> 00:57:23,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't know.

886
00:57:23,756 --> 00:57:25,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I may have just been lucky.

887
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Rice Princess is asking a question here.

888
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:30,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

889
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were younger?

890
00:57:37,898 --> 00:57:51,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games, but then they grow up for quotation fingers.

891
00:57:54,665 --> 00:58:00,488
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's some people who see it as childish, so they disregard it.

892
00:58:01,674 --> 00:58:04,796
[SPEAKER_12]: or Discard.

893
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:05,717
[SPEAKER_10]: It's late.

894
00:58:06,377 --> 00:58:11,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I would assume that in your household, you sound pretty well off for 16.

895
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,582
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound like you're a smart kid.

896
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, you're smart because you're listening to this show.

897
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:20,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've turned out okay.

898
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:22,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?

899
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:24,109
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

900
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:26,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you probably turned out A-okay.

901
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:29,593
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think other families can learn from yours?

902
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:45,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because every so often they mention a game called Granddad's Otter, so I'm wondering why parents are still buying it for their kids.

903
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,040
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.

904
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got another question for you.

905
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:50,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Do your parents play the games with you?

906
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:53,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

907
00:58:54,842 --> 00:59:00,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually kick my ass

908
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:02,068
[SPEAKER_12]: at Burnout.

909
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:03,449
[SPEAKER_12]: He is a Burnout machine.

910
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the next generation.

911
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:26,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I wouldn't support it, so good luck at that.

912
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:26,649
[SPEAKER_10]: One last thing?

913
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:28,631
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all this PSP stuff.

914
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:30,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.

915
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:53,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, I'm very sorry.

916
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:58,686
[SPEAKER_10]: So look, we disavow all knowledge of that email and anything that was ever said.

917
00:59:59,486 --> 00:59:59,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

918
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:01,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would he sue?

919
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:01,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously.

920
01:00:02,627 --> 01:00:03,767
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the one breaking the law.

921
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:09,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.

922
01:00:09,749 --> 01:00:10,849
[SPEAKER_10]: See, we didn't know that before.

923
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:12,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So we ought to sue you.

924
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

925
01:00:13,846 --> 01:00:15,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I just said I know him.

926
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:17,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't say I know him personally.

927
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:18,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

928
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, snap.

929
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:21,232
[SPEAKER_10]: See how I flipped that right back at you?

930
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:22,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Aha.

931
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: In your face, Rob.

932
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:25,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?

933
01:00:25,675 --> 01:00:26,656
[SPEAKER_10]: You did.

934
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:27,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob got majorly pwned.

935
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:30,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That was indeed a zing, Rob.

936
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,821
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a zing.

937
01:00:34,162 --> 01:00:34,422
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

938
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:35,983
[SPEAKER_10]: For that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.

939
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:37,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

940
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:38,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, bye.

941
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:38,505
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

942
01:00:38,525 --> 01:00:39,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good week.

943
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:40,887
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a good call.

944
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:42,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really good call.

945
01:00:42,194 --> 01:00:43,195
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a very good call.

946
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:45,216
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our better calls.

947
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:50,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.

948
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Invite yourself, Rob.

949
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:53,599
[SPEAKER_10]: My parents will buy beer.

950
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:57,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they buy good beer.

951
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:58,502
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

952
01:00:58,542 --> 01:00:59,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

953
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:04,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

954
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:06,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Justin TV fucking up Skype tonight?

955
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:07,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

956
01:01:07,285 --> 01:01:07,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

957
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:10,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

958
01:01:10,387 --> 01:01:10,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, hi.

959
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:12,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

960
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:15,350
Oh, okay.

961
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,230
Sorry about that.

962
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:16,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a microphone.

963
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:19,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.

964
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:21,154
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.

965
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:21,494
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

966
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:26,679
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that?

967
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:27,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, much better.

968
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,440
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

969
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce yourself.

970
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:29,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

971
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:30,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce yourself.

972
01:01:34,225 --> 01:01:36,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way... Okay, sorry.

973
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:37,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, dude.

974
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:37,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

975
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:45,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, um, I don't know, I'm just hanging out and, you know, listening on the East Coast, I guess.

976
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:47,927
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your name?

977
01:01:48,407 --> 01:01:49,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you have an online name, or?

978
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:55,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, Banjo, in the chat room.

979
01:01:56,389 --> 01:01:57,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

980
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?

981
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?

982
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:08,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I was... I don't...

983
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:13,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I just wanted to say... Oh, oh, what?

984
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:17,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

985
01:02:17,874 --> 01:02:19,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

986
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:24,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, do you mind if I... I got Akula in the same room, do you want to talk to him?

987
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:25,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, sure, okay.

988
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:30,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

989
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:35,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

990
01:02:36,046 --> 01:02:36,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

991
01:02:37,427 --> 01:02:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

992
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:38,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, identify yourself.

993
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:40,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

994
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:42,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

995
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:43,923
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Okuda.

996
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:44,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Okuda.

997
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:47,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.

998
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:49,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're just an internet radio show.

999
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:50,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing to be scared of, right?

1000
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:51,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Okuda?

1001
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:57,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.

1002
01:02:57,476 --> 01:03:00,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.

1003
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:01,260
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1004
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:12,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering, I play World of Warcraft a lot, I was wondering, do you like private servers?

1005
01:03:12,681 --> 01:03:14,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion on private servers?

1006
01:03:15,864 --> 01:03:17,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, on crowded servers?

1007
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:18,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Private servers.

1008
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, private servers.

1009
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:19,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1010
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:21,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know much about them.

1011
01:03:21,348 --> 01:03:22,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know they're out there.

1012
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:30,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I've understood it's kind of a risky thing, because once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?

1013
01:03:30,176 --> 01:03:30,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1014
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:31,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1015
01:03:31,761 --> 01:03:33,742
[SPEAKER_04]: But private servers are kind of corny.

1016
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, yeah, you can do... I was into a cash file.

1017
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:38,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1018
01:03:38,804 --> 01:03:39,644
[SPEAKER_10]: You can dump a cash file.

1019
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:40,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1020
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:40,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

1021
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:41,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, sorry, go ahead.

1022
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:47,186
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just saying, like, you can mod it to be, like, super strong or, like, make all this money and stuff, but that makes the game boring to me.

1023
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:48,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.

1024
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,007
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have the nude patch.

1025
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:50,767
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the nude patch.

1026
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there.

1027
01:03:52,608 --> 01:03:53,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Only on the private servers.

1028
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:54,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1029
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:56,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three characters on... Oh my god, you pervert!

1030
01:03:56,669 --> 01:03:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Get away from me!

1031
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop sitting next to me!

1032
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:58,830
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all...

1033
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:04,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my... Get especially away from me.

1034
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:05,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't even make sense.

1035
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:07,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

1036
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:09,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

1037
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:15,059
[SPEAKER_10]: But private servers, I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.

1038
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:23,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean you need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at 2 in the morning on a private server.

1039
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:32,264
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, there's not – you can't really progress very far I would think.

1040
01:04:32,624 --> 01:04:32,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1041
01:04:32,904 --> 01:04:34,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a difference of opinion?

1042
01:04:34,325 --> 01:04:35,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Akuta, do you play on a private server?

1043
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:38,458
[SPEAKER_10]: and how do you like it?

1044
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:41,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd play in a private server.

1045
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1046
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, there's a huge lag.

1047
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:49,864
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably Justin TV screwing everything up.

1048
01:04:49,884 --> 01:04:50,304
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

1049
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:55,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous.

1050
01:04:55,886 --> 01:04:57,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?

1051
01:04:58,467 --> 01:04:59,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having me.

1052
01:05:01,089 --> 01:05:01,949
[SPEAKER_10]: No problemo.

1053
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:05,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're handing the phone back.

1054
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:06,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

1055
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:07,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1056
01:05:07,716 --> 01:05:08,016
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1057
01:05:08,857 --> 01:05:09,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, you guys.

1058
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,018
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1059
01:05:11,438 --> 01:05:12,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thanks for having us.

1060
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:13,299
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1061
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:14,040
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

1062
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoke another bud.

1063
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:16,101
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1064
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,621
[SPEAKER_10]: That's terrible.

1065
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:18,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1066
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:19,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1067
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:20,323
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just nervous.

1068
01:05:20,403 --> 01:05:21,043
[SPEAKER_10]: God, come on.

1069
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they do smoke a bud, they'll relax.

1070
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:26,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I would know.

1071
01:05:26,946 --> 01:05:28,387
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we're not encouraging that, though.

1072
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:28,887
[SPEAKER_10]: We would never.

1073
01:05:29,287 --> 01:05:29,508
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1074
01:05:29,568 --> 01:05:29,888
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wrong.

1075
01:05:29,908 --> 01:05:32,129
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you feel so inclined, it would...

1076
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:33,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you relax.

1077
01:05:33,157 --> 01:05:34,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, look, we give people shit.

1078
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:35,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we do.

1079
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:36,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, we're going to give our next caller.

1080
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1081
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:38,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1082
01:05:39,462 --> 01:05:40,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's me, Ranma.

1083
01:05:40,163 --> 01:05:40,783
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, everyone?

1084
01:05:40,823 --> 01:05:41,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Ranma.

1085
01:05:41,544 --> 01:05:42,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Ranjan.

1086
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,685
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up, Ranma?

1087
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:45,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of giving people shit.

1088
01:05:45,427 --> 01:05:45,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Not mine.

1089
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,009
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was me.

1090
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:50,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I called the first set, but my headset was acting really retarded.

1091
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:52,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

1092
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:53,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, echo 123 next time.

1093
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:54,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was the headset.

1094
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:55,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was user error, Ranma.

1095
01:05:55,855 --> 01:05:56,435
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1096
01:05:57,456 --> 01:05:57,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that.

1097
01:05:58,257 --> 01:05:58,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, not too much.

1098
01:05:59,017 --> 01:06:04,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about that whole PlayStation Dusty article you talked about earlier.

1099
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:04,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Dust Cap 3.

1100
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:08,662
[SPEAKER_06]: What about it?

1101
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:09,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

1102
01:06:10,463 --> 01:06:11,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this out.

1103
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:15,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now off the consumers.com.

1104
01:06:16,446 --> 01:06:20,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.

1105
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:23,830
[SPEAKER_06]: As somebody who's been in the technical field for about ten years...

1106
01:06:24,844 --> 01:06:31,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in the worst conditions, I've never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty.

1107
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:37,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.

1108
01:06:37,574 --> 01:06:41,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website.

1109
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:46,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.

1110
01:06:49,295 --> 01:06:54,317
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming from Consumerist.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.

1111
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:55,697
[SPEAKER_10]: They're both in that same thing.

1112
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Their blogs are also very similar looking.

1113
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually kind of like Consumerist.

1114
01:06:59,799 --> 01:07:05,921
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.

1115
01:07:05,941 --> 01:07:06,641
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyhow, sorry.

1116
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:08,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.

1117
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:08,982
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1118
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:13,083
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation, and

1119
01:07:14,157 --> 01:07:17,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this person smoking right in front of it?

1120
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:19,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it just poorly ventilated?

1121
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:25,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at Loki's house and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that.

1122
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:27,605
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that.

1123
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's the machine.

1124
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:31,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's something the person is doing.

1125
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:33,188
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

1126
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:35,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the cat sleeping on it at night?

1127
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:39,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, he's just stuck in somewhere to easily collect dust in a basement or something.

1128
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:45,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the next link I posted off the consumer is, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.

1129
01:07:45,624 --> 01:07:50,185
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read the comments, you find out that the guy that complained about this is an actor.

1130
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:54,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.

1131
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:57,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also posted a link from playtime.net about it.

1132
01:07:57,547 --> 01:07:59,848
[SPEAKER_10]: The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?

1133
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1134
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:02,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1135
01:08:02,648 --> 01:08:05,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposedly, this guy is a paid... He was paid to do this.

1136
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:12,815
[SPEAKER_10]: This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?

1137
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,816
[SPEAKER_10]: PS3, you're so dirty.

1138
01:08:15,497 --> 01:08:17,759
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been very naughty, Sony PlayStation.

1139
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a naughty play... What the crap?

1140
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:31,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3... Who paid him to... Oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.

1141
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,031
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't Sony that did it.

1142
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:34,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody paid him to do it.

1143
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:35,653
[SPEAKER_10]: He's... Okay.

1144
01:08:35,673 --> 01:08:35,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1145
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:37,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm reading this from Play3.net.

1146
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:38,382
[SPEAKER_10]: End of the story?

1147
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:44,206
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.

1148
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:48,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, it is possible this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.

1149
01:08:48,948 --> 01:09:00,535
[SPEAKER_10]: These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career or paid as part of the much-cited Microsoft Dirty Tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.

1150
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,259
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

1151
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,440
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems kind of low.

1152
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:18,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't think, you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da, this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.

1153
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:23,383
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.

1154
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:25,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, sure, Nathan.

1155
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:33,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.

1156
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:34,385
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1157
01:09:35,535 --> 01:09:38,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not supposed to be an act on the news.

1158
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:40,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was Fox News.

1159
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:44,244
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be... Yeah, fair and balanced.

1160
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:44,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

1161
01:09:44,964 --> 01:09:47,827
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?

1162
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:50,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Even porno?

1163
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure, porno.

1164
01:09:52,572 --> 01:09:53,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Skinamax.

1165
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:53,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1166
01:09:53,813 --> 01:09:55,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do people do Skinamax films?

1167
01:09:55,135 --> 01:09:55,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1168
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:57,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ranma, I don't know.

1169
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:57,977
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of this?

1170
01:09:58,057 --> 01:09:59,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do you think did the set-up?

1171
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:02,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't know because I read all the comments.

1172
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:04,763
[SPEAKER_06]: He claims that this is legit.

1173
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,806
[SPEAKER_06]: To be perfectly honest, I don't know.

1174
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:11,730
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.

1175
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:18,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.

1176
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:19,559
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I honestly think.

1177
01:10:20,034 --> 01:10:21,415
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a mental problem.

1178
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:24,918
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets dusty, but we've had stuff sit out for like three, four months.

1179
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:28,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months, and it's not even that dirty.

1180
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's nearly new, and we don't even touch it.

1181
01:10:31,964 --> 01:10:33,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he just has issues.

1182
01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:34,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what it boils down to.

1183
01:10:35,747 --> 01:10:36,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleaning issues.

1184
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:38,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, cleaning issues.

1185
01:10:38,429 --> 01:10:39,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he lives in a toilet.

1186
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1187
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:42,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it would get especially dusty.

1188
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes a lot of sense, Rob.

1189
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:46,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1190
01:10:46,415 --> 01:10:46,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

1191
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:48,457
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut up, you m'lady.

1192
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:50,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

1193
01:10:50,338 --> 01:10:51,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Children, children, behave.

1194
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,139
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I get for reading fast.

1195
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:53,760
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1196
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:58,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?

1197
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,262
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll be making a trip out to the West Coast.

1198
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:01,842
[SPEAKER_10]: When?

1199
01:11:02,303 --> 01:11:02,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1200
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:06,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at Fourth of July weekend.

1201
01:11:07,124 --> 01:11:07,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1202
01:11:07,484 --> 01:11:09,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we will be seeing you then.

1203
01:11:10,745 --> 01:11:11,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1204
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1205
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:14,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And all time.

1206
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:15,267
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1207
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:16,487
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.

1208
01:11:16,507 --> 01:11:18,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.

1209
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:20,817
[SPEAKER_06]: One last question, I'll get out of here.

1210
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:23,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?

1211
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?

1212
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:27,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I will give you three guesses.

1213
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:32,807
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts with a J. I love you.

1214
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:33,748
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1215
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:35,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, Ranma.

1216
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:36,471
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1217
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:37,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1218
01:11:37,371 --> 01:11:38,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1219
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:40,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to point out it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager, too.

1220
01:11:40,674 --> 01:11:41,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know.

1221
01:11:41,175 --> 01:11:44,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager.

1222
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:51,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1223
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:57,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi there, this is RawSteelUT Hello RawSteelUT, what is on your mind?

1224
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:06,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Not much, you know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO podcast

1225
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:12,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.

1226
01:12:12,566 --> 01:12:14,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was that unreal.

1227
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:18,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight?

1228
01:12:19,012 --> 01:12:20,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a clan fight or whatever?

1229
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:25,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not want to meet... Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.

1230
01:12:25,638 --> 01:12:26,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

1231
01:12:28,161 --> 01:12:30,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, that reminds me of a...

1232
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:38,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Recent post on Kotaku, apparently the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on internet cafes and stuff like that.

1233
01:12:38,462 --> 01:12:40,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me put a link on the chat.

1234
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:53,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming cafes because, like you know, China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.

1235
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:57,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Well... Hello?

1236
01:12:57,935 --> 01:13:01,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, no, no, sorry, I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.

1237
01:13:01,537 --> 01:13:04,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, it looks like you're linking us to Kotaku, who ran this report.

1238
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:19,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal internet cafes, Xinhua said.

1239
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:26,035
[SPEAKER_10]: The crackdown netted 1407 computers while 7 people were arrested and nearly 5000 internet accounts closed.

1240
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:30,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.

1241
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:31,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1242
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:35,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.

1243
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:42,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, normally I'm not for forcing limits on internet time, but damn it, it really sounds like China's got a real problem.

1244
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:44,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of Asia, really.

1245
01:14:09,918 --> 01:14:12,882
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1246
01:14:25,071 --> 01:14:26,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was about to say that.

1247
01:14:26,312 --> 01:14:28,553
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds like people are really crammed in there.

1248
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:31,254
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.

1249
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:34,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.

1250
01:14:34,415 --> 01:14:36,196
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an interesting image right there.

1251
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:37,897
[SPEAKER_13]: For real.

1252
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:39,837
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a very interesting image.

1253
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:42,539
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.

1254
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:43,099
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, go ahead.

1255
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:43,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, anyway.

1256
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:54,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, there's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the...

1257
01:14:55,217 --> 01:14:56,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox 360 failures.

1258
01:14:56,818 --> 01:14:57,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a second.

1259
01:14:57,398 --> 01:14:58,519
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll pop up another link.

1260
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:03,581
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy's saying that they're... I think I heard about this.

1261
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:08,603
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this is why they're paying for it, right?

1262
01:15:09,783 --> 01:15:11,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm posting the link now.

1263
01:15:12,985 --> 01:15:15,326
[SPEAKER_13]: It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually.

1264
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:24,630
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.

1265
01:15:25,598 --> 01:15:31,080
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, it sort of makes me wonder, you know, the legitimacy of it.

1266
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,702
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't know if you're reading it now, but... Yeah, it's kind of a lengthy article.

1267
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,903
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site that ran this, it looks like.

1268
01:15:40,263 --> 01:15:48,467
[SPEAKER_10]: A story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about the Xbox 360 Red Ring of Death failures.

1269
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:51,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was an interview conducted via email.

1270
01:15:52,168 --> 01:15:53,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

1271
01:15:53,228 --> 01:15:54,929
[SPEAKER_10]: That's already a big red flag.

1272
01:15:55,849 --> 01:16:00,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1273
01:16:00,212 --> 01:16:07,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.

1274
01:16:07,858 --> 01:16:11,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's the same guy who's doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.

1275
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:11,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1276
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

1277
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:16,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's funny you mention that because Ranma was just talking about that.

1278
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:20,347
[SPEAKER_13]: It could just be mudslinging on both sides.

1279
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:21,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Reggie.

1280
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:23,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggie Fils-Aimé is doing it all, apparently.

1281
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:25,218
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know.

1282
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:29,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.

1283
01:16:29,379 --> 01:16:45,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article because, honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 Red Rings of Death are caused because Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's not really news to me.

1284
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:49,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I was about to say, yeah.

1285
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:52,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's been everybody's known about the X-Clamps for some time.

1286
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:58,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners to save money?

1287
01:16:59,221 --> 01:16:59,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

1288
01:16:59,662 --> 01:17:00,402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's no surprise.

1289
01:17:00,623 --> 01:17:01,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it make it right?

1290
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:01,904
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1291
01:17:02,004 --> 01:17:05,107
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.

1292
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:08,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of...

1293
01:17:09,255 --> 01:17:10,715
[SPEAKER_13]: of trying to correct the issue, really.

1294
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:11,836
[SPEAKER_10]: They made a boo-boo.

1295
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:12,856
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fessing up to it.

1296
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:14,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.

1297
01:17:14,857 --> 01:17:15,977
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got an Instagram.

1298
01:17:15,997 --> 01:17:18,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.

1299
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:20,318
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.

1300
01:17:20,558 --> 01:17:21,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I suppose that's true.

1301
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:23,900
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I don't know.

1302
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:31,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but, you know, I guess...

1303
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:36,414
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.

1304
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are some people who still do have working ones.

1305
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:42,157
[SPEAKER_10]: But honestly, you tell me the failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?

1306
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.

1307
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:46,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1308
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1309
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:54,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the problem is when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.

1310
01:17:54,764 --> 01:17:57,065
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system worked.

1311
01:17:57,432 --> 01:17:57,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Good point.

1312
01:17:57,952 --> 01:17:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

1313
01:17:58,933 --> 01:17:59,814
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

1314
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:00,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never seen that happen.

1315
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:02,876
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't complain when things are working.

1316
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:03,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

1317
01:18:03,356 --> 01:18:03,936
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good point.

1318
01:18:06,038 --> 01:18:07,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.

1319
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:18,366
[SPEAKER_13]: We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.

1320
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:26,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, and here's one more link, Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable content.

1321
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:34,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice, you know?

1322
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know what?

1323
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:49,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.

1324
01:18:49,241 --> 01:19:04,206
[SPEAKER_10]: You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe since we have some new people, thanks to Justin.TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content

1325
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:05,848
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1326
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:34,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think if Capcom's taking a stand going, you know what, this game is too complex, we can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock content, then I say, applause!

1327
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:36,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they're just, you know... Hello?

1328
01:19:37,597 --> 01:19:37,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, go ahead.

1329
01:19:39,058 --> 01:19:45,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just that, you know, this is their game, you know, and personally, I applaud them for it.

1330
01:19:46,204 --> 01:19:51,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content to Hello Horse Armor.

1331
01:19:54,346 --> 01:19:57,549
[SPEAKER_13]: and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.

1332
01:19:57,649 --> 01:20:02,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game and this is what it's going to be.

1333
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:04,374
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't see enough of that nowadays.

1334
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:07,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.

1335
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:07,636
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good one.

1336
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:10,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Dio, we've got to let you go because we've got to wrap up the show.

1337
01:20:10,498 --> 01:20:11,819
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you so much for calling.

1338
01:20:11,999 --> 01:20:12,740
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to hear from you.

1339
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1340
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one, buddy.

1341
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakra, Loki, I have nothing.

1342
01:20:17,529 --> 01:20:17,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you guys?

1343
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:17,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1344
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1345
01:20:44,203 --> 01:20:44,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah.

1346
01:20:44,984 --> 01:20:46,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff.

1347
01:20:47,085 --> 01:20:51,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, one of which is this game that I just found called Line Golfer.

1348
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:56,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses, almost.

1349
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:57,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's actually pretty fun.

1350
01:20:57,432 --> 01:21:03,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, you can find it at, uh, let's see here, this website called CandyStand.com.

1351
01:21:03,896 --> 01:21:05,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can, uh, check it out there.

1352
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:07,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, isn't that, like, Lifesavers and stuff?

1353
01:21:07,638 --> 01:21:08,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that their website?

1354
01:21:08,499 --> 01:21:09,039
[SPEAKER_10]: CandyStand?

1355
01:21:09,059 --> 01:21:09,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1356
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:10,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Or am I crazy?

1357
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1358
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:11,821
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um...

1359
01:21:13,796 --> 01:21:19,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, it is Wrigley'sCandyStand.com The hottest games online, they say.

1360
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:21,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's pretty fun.

1361
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:28,682
[SPEAKER_11]: You can create your own courses and you can upload them and play all these different courses and stuff.

1362
01:21:29,923 --> 01:21:30,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1363
01:21:31,443 --> 01:21:34,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Then, other stuff that's kind of funny.

1364
01:21:35,025 --> 01:21:42,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, GameGirl.com ran a Top 7 Geek Panties for Girls.

1365
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:44,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh God, I heard about this.

1366
01:21:44,423 --> 01:21:46,484
[SPEAKER_10]: How many does Irene own?

1367
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:47,144
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

1368
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:50,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight.

1369
01:21:50,265 --> 01:21:55,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone on there or not.

1370
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:56,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

1371
01:21:57,666 --> 01:22:00,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Number six would be the password protection panties.

1372
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:02,147
[SPEAKER_11]: It says username and password.

1373
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:03,348
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of funny.

1374
01:22:03,528 --> 01:22:04,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1375
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:05,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonus stage panties.

1376
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with Halo Master in chat.

1377
01:22:08,169 --> 01:22:09,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Best radio show ever.

1378
01:22:10,499 --> 01:22:13,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Space Invader Panties would be number four.

1379
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:16,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three is Achievement Unlocked Panties.

1380
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:20,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, Classic Nintendo Panties.

1381
01:22:20,548 --> 01:22:23,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?

1382
01:22:24,251 --> 01:22:24,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

1383
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: These can't be legitimate.

1384
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:26,473
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Mario Panties.

1385
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:28,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray!

1386
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:32,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Other fun stuff, there's a rumor that when Smash Bros.

1387
01:22:32,118 --> 01:22:36,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that

1388
01:22:37,355 --> 01:22:38,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Smash Bros.

1389
01:22:38,236 --> 01:22:38,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl

1390
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:59,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Hillary Clinton is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto 4.

1391
01:22:59,619 --> 01:23:00,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullshit.

1392
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:01,700
[SPEAKER_11]: No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1393
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,363
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her.

1394
01:23:05,643 --> 01:23:09,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.

1395
01:23:10,106 --> 01:23:14,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.

1396
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:19,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, why would you want that prostitute?

1397
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:20,554
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't make sense.

1398
01:23:20,714 --> 01:23:21,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1399
01:23:22,219 --> 01:23:22,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1400
01:23:23,139 --> 01:23:24,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, whatever.

1401
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:28,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.

1402
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:32,244
[SPEAKER_11]: The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me?

1403
01:23:32,544 --> 01:23:36,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And after being killed with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.

1404
01:23:36,967 --> 01:23:37,907
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fucked up.

1405
01:23:37,947 --> 01:23:39,188
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gotta be a lie.

1406
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:42,429
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some stupid kid's idea of a funny.

1407
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,050
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

1408
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:47,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma in chat at chat.org sums up my thoughts perfectly.

1409
01:23:48,492 --> 01:23:49,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not want...

1410
01:23:52,397 --> 01:23:55,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.

1411
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:56,520
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

1412
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I found something pretty.

1413
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what's that?

1414
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:09,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Eurogamer, which is one of the places I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out.

1415
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:11,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.

1416
01:24:11,969 --> 01:24:15,651
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chatroom.

1417
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:16,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1418
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very pretty.

1419
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:43,186
[SPEAKER_10]: even though they're getting the most awful person in the world to play them but oh well alright well it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up this show Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess thank you guys for coming to the show we haven't had guests here in forever even though you guys didn't talk much but maybe it's because we have a mic shortage I don't know but I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless and thank you for the pie that was much appreciated do you have any final thoughts Sir Nathan?

1420
01:24:44,307 --> 01:24:47,949
[SPEAKER_10]: no alright Rice Princess any final thoughts?

1421
01:24:48,772 --> 01:24:49,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1422
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,154
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?

1423
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:58,037
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what my computer can actually do.

1424
01:24:58,838 --> 01:24:59,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1425
01:25:00,299 --> 01:25:12,786
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I... My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now on JustinTV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take a couple weeks to work out the bumps.

1426
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:14,427
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1427
01:25:15,988 --> 01:25:18,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, someone in our chat room said...

1428
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:22,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The pie is true.

1429
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:24,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The pie is true.

1430
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,400
[SPEAKER_10]: The pie is delicious.

1431
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,441
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it really boils down to.

1432
01:25:28,382 --> 01:25:30,403
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of Orange Launch Radio, there will be pie.

1433
01:25:31,883 --> 01:25:32,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1434
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:32,884
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1435
01:25:33,614 --> 01:25:36,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for tuning in.

1436
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:54,070
[SPEAKER_10]: All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.

1437
01:25:54,351 --> 01:25:55,691
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how we slowly spread the word.

1438
01:25:55,751 --> 01:26:03,652
[SPEAKER_10]: If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Dig, whatever.

1439
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:07,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even if you do tell two people, you can also leave a five-star review.

1440
01:26:07,773 --> 01:26:08,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

1441
01:26:08,473 --> 01:26:13,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank – we had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people that put those very kind reviews.

1442
01:26:13,154 --> 01:26:13,855
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate it.

1443
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:15,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Until next time.

1444
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:22,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Rob Roberts, that's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1445
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:28,396
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1446
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:31,517
