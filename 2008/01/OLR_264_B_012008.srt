3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for Part B of our program.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Brothers delay.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's get back into some regular gaming news. Start off with Loki.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN and basically they gave the timeframe.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't know. I'll believe it when I see it type thing.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If it is, they may show it at E3 or something like that because it would have to be kind of done.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of release dates because Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I really hope this rumor is true, though. I love me some Duke Nukem, too.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It would be even better if some of the expansions and the homemade stuff come out as downloadable stuff.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I hope the build editor comes with it because that would be awesome.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wasn't there voice macros?

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, yes. Being able to make your own voice macros would be awesome.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C. mod or something? I still remember having that on CD at one point.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah. I love Duke Nukem.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dunu is great. I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, yeah.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That was awesome. You're laughing, Nathan. Did that inspire what's a modem?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you, 12?

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm just kidding. No. They let you...

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right. So, yeah. Duke Nukem. I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem Forever, dammit.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No. No. This will all allow.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
As long as they don't screw it up. If it's just like a boring old port...

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's going to be a boring old port. It's going to look just like Doom.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Remember how awesome Doom was when it came out? We're like, ooh, Doom. Ooh, we can play Deathmatch on Doom.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then something else came out and we completely forgot about Doom?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Seriously, is anyone still playing Doom? I don't think so.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great. At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, like the day it came out.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right. Well, let's move on with some other gaming news, talking about Xbox Live still.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But this time, talking about Rock Band. And Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The last segment, we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because unlike last year, EA Harmonics has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They also retracted them after they announced them.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Did they?

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, but still. If Xbox.com posted it, I would think there's some type of legitimacy to that.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, they took it down because it was OMG Spoilers. That's what it was.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But anyway, on January 22nd, an Oasis pack is coming out with the songs Don't Look Back in Anger, Live Forever, and Wonderwall.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That would make you relive the 90s all over again, getting to play Wonderwall.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'd rather not, thank you.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
On January 29th, the Progressive pack comes out. Both packs will set you back 400 points.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive pack.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed, that's also a cover.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Smashing Pumpkins with Seva, not a cover.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s. That was like their first single ever.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And that's all we know until February. So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We get Foreigner. Ooh.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And Journey is Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes! Journey!

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm more about Boston right now, but I don't know. There's better songs! Why those?

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
At least we're not getting hot-blooded.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But it's Journey. It's awesome. I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and rock band because their music wasn't showing up.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I was like, where's the Journey? And now it's coming out and that makes me very happy.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, I think that all three of these songs are also in rock band, I want to say. I know Jukebox Hero is.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jukebox Hero is, yeah.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I know that there's another Boston song that's in rock band. I don't think this is it. Anyway.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, we're getting old rock.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know, if you play Boston backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That is not true.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's from Little Nicky. Stop spreading lies on the internet.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're one of those, but yeah, that's my job.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So, speaking of another, well, more music-related stuff.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the US.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The first machine, apparently, is at In the Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at the start.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know, all the other fun stuff. No EMUs support right now.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And also, I guess when you play the nonce upcourses, you can put your name and state in there and record all the information.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know. I'm excited that there's a new DDR, although it's not near us.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know. I already told you how I feel about DDR and I got in a little trouble for it,

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2 and I'm just kind of like,

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it's just the same thing with some new songs.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It needs to be another Max 2. They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the ONI courses and stuff like that,

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and that was exciting, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, and that kind of thing, and the way they teased that.

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
With these DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just kind of like, DDR, here we go, enjoy.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, another DDR. Enjoy. They don't hype it up any.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like, ah, no one cares anymore, so we don't either. Just throw it out.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They need to give DDR a swift kick in the booty and put something new in it to make me want to go back to the arcades.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Irene, I know you've been a long-time DDR fan. What do you think of where the series is going?

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know. It's kind of dropped off the face of the earth. It's kind of like, I don't know, Debbie Gibson or something.

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's just like, oh, hey, there's DDR. I mean, I'd play it if it came here just to try it out, but that was kind of,

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I stopped playing DDR years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, the younger kids that were our age when we started.

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe they'll get into it.

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Stop dating me and yourself.

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But Rob, I love you.

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Not that. You know what I mean.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, I know, but I mean, I'd have to play it. I don't know. I'm not as excited.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was excited probably when Fourth Plus came out and Fifth Mix.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know. I just don't care anymore.

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's see. I'm looking at our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
DJ Genai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
RosteelUT says, DDR Star Wars edition. That would work.

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No.

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
See, that's partially why I think DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap, like hottest party and all this stuff.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's just absolute shit.

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They should make a 12 player mode with peripherals.

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That'd be great. I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, but seriously, they could make some really elaborate cabinet that was four player, have a quad mode or something like that in the arcade.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That would be different.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Even Animaro gets behind Pump It Up and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Konami doesn't do anything. It's just like, oh look, it's DDR.

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Even with BeatMania, it's like, what's it matter? We're going to release another one in a few months anyway.

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I know. It's like they think it's some kind of self advertising franchise.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Like, we already have a fan base built in. We don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing. Excite us about it. Otherwise, why should we give a shit?

120
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright. Like I said, just reinvent DDR. Make it competitive. I'll be all over that game again.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Just, you know, just start from scratch.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know what DDR needs? A new producer.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like, I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some fr- I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because, you know, obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's what it needs. Some new blood.

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We are starting over, right?

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Alright, anyhow, something else that you can get your music fixed through, not DDR, but the other type.

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The orchestral. Nice, live, take in the music type thing.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like, remember Dear Friends, the Final Fantasy concert?

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, of course, one of the other big tours that goes around is Tommy Tallarico's Video Games Live.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And Video Games Live has been going for, like, two years straight.

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They ain't stopping anytime soon. They've added 40 shows throughout the globe this year.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert. That's kind of cool.

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal.

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California at the Nob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if you want to catch that.

143
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24th, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet,

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Dude, Jamie. Anaheim, California.

147
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Disneyland.

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Disneyland slash Video Games Live.

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's go.

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's do it.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'd rather go to E3.

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I would like to go to E3, but we'll see.

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Anyhow, so there you have it. Video Games Live. That'll be fun.

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have not been yet.

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwell at all games.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He goes, he enjoys the show.

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Disney World!

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, I know! It's even better!

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
God, guys. So one-track minded.

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, you know what? Disneyland's fun.

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Loki, you need to come to Disneyland with us sometime.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I've been to Disneyland and it's just like, ooh, yay!

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Did you go to Disneyland in the 90s, though?

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because it was kind of junky.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That was before they started doing all the renovation.

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I went there when they were building California.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So you went during the days of Suck.

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, I went there when they had the rocket rods and I got to ride them before they ripped them out

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
because some idiot jumped off the rocket rods and killed themselves

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the same way they killed themselves.

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That never made any sense to me whatsoever.

175
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, well, we'll get rid of the people movers because someone fell out of it and died.

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's put something faster there instead.

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That'll be better.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The rumor is rocket riders are coming back.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We'll see.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The rocket rides are awesome.

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've also been hearing a rumor that the next rock in the parks they're doing is Aerosmith.

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Nice.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Would it be Space Mountain again in California?

184
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Space Mountain and California Screamin'.

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Rawr! That sounds great.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Anyway, sorry. We turned it into the Disney cast for a minute.

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jamie, please take the show back on track.

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, so Devil May Cry 4.

189
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that was actually removed from the downloadable version

192
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that was saying it would be out, and of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and out a week later in North America and Europe.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But is it going to happen?

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So is it true? Is it not?

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Did someone just screw up?

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It makes sense.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Jinx.

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Your mom.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, you showed me.

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
She wins, Rob. She said your mom.

204
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Aw, damn. All right.

205
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you going to do now?

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I like how Jamie said that off the mic.

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going to repeat. She goes, I like your mom.

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I do.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Just to clarify, I do like your mom.

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your mom's cool.

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
My mom is cool.

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She'd make pies too.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You guys can make me Easter cookies together.

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
All right, forget it.

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Anyway, let's move on.

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
More game news, please.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, something else that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N Plus.

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And it's very fucking hard.

222
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be I think on both Xbox Live Arcade and

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon because apparently it's

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
already, I guess, passed their certification.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So, hooray.

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, that's a pretty fun game.

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon too.

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to, this

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is kind of funny, www.harveycartel.org, that's H-A-R-V-E-Y...

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano and...

232
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, it's Cartel.

233
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, never mind.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
H-A-R-V-E-Y-C-A-R-T-E-L dot org slash meta net slash downloads dot HTML.

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And you complete the full game there.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's pretty fun.

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Lots of challenge though, so.

238
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yay.

239
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So is it going to be worth, because N right now is free, right?

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?

241
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think it's going to be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
there.

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And they're going to have new levels.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So, no, those are going to be in there and you get achievements.

246
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Alright.

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers suck during

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Christmas.

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Apparently they're not that sorry.

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Please don't sue us.

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not a new game, a game that was already out, but you will be able to download it for a

254
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
limited time for free.

255
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,000
I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So you have about a three day period, roughly, to get the game.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800 for my Xbox,

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they're supposed to be able to do something for you.

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like maybe give you the points back or they won't say, will they?

260
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because they don't want everybody to rush them.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne

262
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary,

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but whatever.

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I, you know, I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.

266
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But it's just, it's kind of fucked up.

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'd rather have like, you know, a free month of Live or something.

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It would have been a lot cheaper for them too, but.

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The demo was kind of fun.

270
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll look at it.

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.

272
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're right.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll grab it while it's free.

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why not?

275
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, it's on the hard drive.

276
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And, quite frankly, they didn't really OS anything to begin with, I don't think.

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No.

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think this little thing got blown way out of proportion.

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, it's kind of like, you know what, if you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It was still kind of spotty.

281
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,500
Like, I guess I hadn't played on Live since like New Year's or something because I had

282
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,000
to recover my gamer tag from, I think, year 360.

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And, it had trouble doing that.

284
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked, which sucks because for

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
whatever reason, the download that like six megs is your gamer tag, it takes like a half

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
an hour.

287
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That is crazy.

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not fucking slow, but yeah.

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangelountradio.com.

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's see, Son of Dad.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I wanted Res.

292
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
Act Def seems to think that Res will be up this week.

293
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I hope that's true.

294
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Actually, that may be true because I think they said Res was coming out in January and

295
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
there's only one more week in January, right?

296
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No, two more.

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, two more.

298
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
All right.

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So.

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We'll see.

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I thought this week was, didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought,

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
already?

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know.

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
was?

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It looks stupid.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It was okay.

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,900
It's pretty much, there's a game just like it, Magical Drop on the Neo Geo.

309
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,860
It's almost just like Magical Drop but with bunnies and you can run up the sides too.

310
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,440
That was the other little innovation is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from

311
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,000
the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,880
It adds a new element to it but, I don't know, anyway, sorry, I got a little off track but

313
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I realize I never talked about it during my game.

314
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,920
I was going to check out Omega 5 maybe but Omega 5 is awesome.

315
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
You got to check that out.

316
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
That's definitely worth a look.

317
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,500
If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron or if you like the

318
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,640
newer ones or whatever, check it out.

319
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Do it.

320
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
All right.

321
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,880
So, Undertow for free.

322
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,240
Be sure to take a look this week.

323
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,940
Highlander game, actually I'm sort of interested in is the Highlander game that's coming out

324
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,760
that you play as Owen McLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.

325
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,660
Go fig.

326
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,600
Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day and got a lot of people

327
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,440
that you meet and a lot of people you kill and it's supposed to be really, really gory.

328
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:26,600
But part of it is that you're using his ability to not die and to regrow and regenerate bits

329
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,320
and pieces so you can stab yourself to kill someone behind you.

330
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,960
That sounds actually kind of cool.

331
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,360
Jump off buildings.

332
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,480
One of the things mentioned on here is act as a conductor for high voltage electrical

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
current.

334
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,000
So, it's pretty cool.

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,400
You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions and full cities and you can use zip wires

336
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
and that type of thing.

337
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
And did I say gory?

338
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
Because it's supposed to be gory.

339
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,480
This game sounds epic.

340
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,300
You just know something's going to go wrong though.

341
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,480
It's too good on paper.

342
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,340
Well, it's PS3, 360 and PC.

343
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,840
And it's made by Eidos.

344
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,360
They did give us Tomb Raider.

345
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
Exactly.

346
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Exactly.

347
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.

348
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,800
The second one was the best because you could make her explode.

349
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I do agree.

350
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
The second one was the best.

351
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,640
You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.

352
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,560
Now Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?

353
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
That's what I just said.

354
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,920
Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.

355
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Rob.

356
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Rob.

357
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Rob.

358
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Rob.

359
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,600
If you like that joke, you can PayPal me some money.

360
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Rob.

361
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Rob.

362
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Rob.

363
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Rob.

364
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Good.

365
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Alright.

366
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
This game sounds epic.

367
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,080
Again, I hope it's as cool as it sounds.

368
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
That's all I can say.

369
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
We'll see.

370
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,000
Anyways, it doesn't sound very cool to me.

371
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Prototype.

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Now that sounds like a cool game.

373
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,640
It's like Grand Theft Auto and Mutants.

374
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,280
RasteelUT in our chat room would like to point out, hey, Tomb Raider Legend and Anniversary

375
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
were awesome.

376
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Sure, they were.

377
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,840
I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, a new one, but you know, different strokes

378
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,880
for different folks, right?

379
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,320
You could, everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.

380
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.

381
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,780
Spore is, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous

382
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,120
release on the PC, so awesome.

383
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,880
They can get to play that game, at least, whenever the hell it decides to come out.

384
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,240
I think second quarter, hopefully no later than that.

385
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm excited for Spore, yes.

386
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,400
I hope no later than second quarter, either.

387
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I will be creating the Urken Empire.

388
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
You know what's interesting?

389
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,600
There's a thread going on in our forums, if you go to our website, www.orensonshortradio.com,

390
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,600
there's a thread in our forums for the most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008,

391
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,160
and somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which the marketing

392
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,320
probably just hasn't kicked in yet, I'm sure there'll be more later on, but that Spore

393
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,920
was overhyped, and I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough,

394
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
in my opinion.

395
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:22,280
Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but I mean, I don't know if our

396
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,400
poster, everybody's welcome to their own opinion, I don't know if the poster saw what I saw

397
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,520
at E3 and stuff, but the game looks amazing.

398
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,680
I think it's going to be deserving of the hype.

399
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,480
I hope so, but the problem is that now my bar is set really high for the game, so if

400
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,560
it isn't that good, I'm going to be disappointed, which kind of sucks for EA and the people

401
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,560
who made Spore, but I guess it's kind of cool, it's going to be a hybrid game, you know,

402
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,240
Mac people complain they don't get enough games, so there you go, EA loves you, so there

403
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
you have it.

404
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,400
So, by the way, Loki, I find it interesting that you're doing a report on Macworld, did

405
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,640
you keep tabs on what happened at Macworld?

406
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,720
Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin, but has no

407
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,880
sort of optical drive on it at all, it has one USB port, and so if you want to actually

408
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,400
use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked, you have to buy a $99

409
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,080
drive for it, or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck, probably,

410
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,960
and use its optical drive, I'm sorry, but that's, oh, and $1700, awesome, good job,

411
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,200
Steve, you really know what the consumer wants, crap for lots of money, hooray, but I'm sure

412
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,320
all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit

413
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,760
and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.

414
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,140
Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen, he can send those cards and letters to loki at

415
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
orangeontrader.com.

416
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,460
I mean, it's cool that it's really thin and it has a long battery life on it, but

417
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,680
okay, so, like, crap, that whole thing in the envelope, like, putting it in an interoffice

418
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,960
envelope, that's kind of rad, that's like Mission Impossible right there, is what that

419
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
is.

420
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,120
That's cool, okay, granted, I know it's cool and I know that they're really pushing

421
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,400
for e-distribution stuff in the iTunes and all that kind of stuff, but as a consumer,

422
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,100
say you want to play Spore, you can't install it because there's no optical drive, what

423
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,800
the fuck, I mean, come on, create some really thin optical drive for it, make it a little

424
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
bit thicker.

425
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Alright, I'm turning this car around, we've got to get back to the gaming news before

426
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,600
the Apple fans bombard us with their hate mail, I love you, Apple fans.

427
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,280
Street Fighter Online, there's some more news coming out about this, remember, they

428
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,800
licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online,

429
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
but it's mouse-controlled.

430
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,080
Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that

431
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,280
were going to be in an MMO.

432
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,000
Right, no, yeah, this is a whole other thing.

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,500
I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company

434
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,560
that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse

435
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,460
controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click

436
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,560
to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses and certain combinations and

437
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,320
click you do the special attacks.

438
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
That's dumb.

439
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,960
That could be very interesting, I have no idea how that's going to be.

440
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,520
But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about

441
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
this game.

442
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Like what?

443
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,920
You really need to like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.

444
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
That's pretty awesome.

445
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,840
Little taunts with your cat, you know, you can have like ceiling cat, you know, and stuff

446
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
like that.

447
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,040
Ceiling cat is watching you lose a fight, I don't know.

448
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,200
Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltec toys.

449
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,400
That is an actual line of toys, so.

450
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,400
And they have the toys for this too, that you can buy.

451
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Nice.

452
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
Is that your very own Chun-Li doll?

453
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Yes.

454
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Awesome.

455
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,640
Well the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.

456
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,800
The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.

457
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,840
For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet, there's no news.

458
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,760
But what we do have some news on is the mailbag.

459
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,580
Every week you guys send us your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and lovely

460
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,600
Dark Sakura rips open the mailbag, picks a few of her favorite emails and reads them

461
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,280
right here on the air.

462
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,000
So for you Justin TV folk that can't see Dark Sakura, she's the mysterious woman off-camera.

463
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,660
We have our element of mystery here on the program.

464
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,680
She's the voice for Justin TV.

465
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay.

466
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Alright, anyhow.

467
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Here it is, the mailbag.

468
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

469
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:37,240
I can't read the whole track.

470
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,440
So uh, hello Dark Sakura, Skye, and other dude.

471
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,280
Haha, poor other dude.

472
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
That's fine, I'm other dude.

473
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,960
Nathan, you're already getting mails.

474
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
What do you think?

475
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Hey, other dude.

476
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Good job.

477
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Welcome to the show.

478
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Forget it.

479
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,360
I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot

480
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,440
in my human growth class stole my PSP slim which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on

481
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
it.

482
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,040
It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen and it had my podcast

483
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:20,320
for OLR, one of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you

484
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,720
to people who steal and bullying people, plus the stupid kid, his name is, I'm not gonna

485
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
say his name.

486
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,040
It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook, this kid had weed in his bag

487
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,560
along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.

488
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Kids today?

489
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Jesus.

490
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website

491
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,840
worthy of going to geeky things for girls and guys.

492
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
It's ThinkGeek.com.

493
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Okay.

494
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, the background video for Potsylvania Dances and Choruses is like seen from Advent

495
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Children.

496
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,460
I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have every title made, but did you know that Konami had

497
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,600
Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?

498
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the

499
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,120
stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.

500
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,320
I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game

501
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,760
Boy, which sucked, by the way.

502
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,220
I love the portable aspect of this, but StepMania has a recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution,

503
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,920
but that's how much I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.

504
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Okay.

505
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,720
This is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist

506
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,520
is going downhill to the mainstream crap.

507
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,040
Okay, only our emails would go from Cocaine in Somebody's Underwear to DDR Disney Channel.

508
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
What the...

509
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
WTF?

510
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
LOL.

511
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
There's no punctuation.

512
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,640
The only periods in this are used in a URL.

513
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,020
It's like the run-on sentence that doesn't die.

514
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,240
Maybe he wrote it on his PS...

515
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,840
No, his PSP got stolen.

516
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I don't know.

517
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
They had to have found it.

518
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
They found it in the guy's underwear.

519
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,000
They found crack in his crack.

520
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,520
Like Hilary Duff in Fallout Boy, that I don't keep it go...

521
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,680
Okay, I'm saying put in a song like...

522
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Okay, okay, whatever.

523
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
You know what?

524
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,860
The point of this letter is to say don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.

526
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Thank you.

527
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,360
Thank you for our lesson of the week.

528
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,480
And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in Boredom and says help.

529
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,560
Well, I would say if your PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross, because

530
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,120
that was a good game.

531
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,240
Orange Launch Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.

532
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
That's not a nice thing to do for you.

533
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Or put cocaine in your underwear.

534
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Yes.

535
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,800
Everybody knows you put it in your jacket in the inside liner.

536
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
You gotta...

537
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm just kidding.

538
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,920
You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.

539
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Okay.

540
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,080
Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn

541
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,460
how to put it in your body cavity.

542
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,640
So there you go.

543
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,560
Oh, and this person was called, um, as soon as kind of the email server was acting up.

544
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Punctuation Man.

545
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,160
DS Master 25.

546
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,240
Which is like, it sounds like an old AOL screen name.

547
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Wait, wait, wait.

548
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
DS Master?

549
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Uh-huh.

550
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
So the guy had his PSP...

551
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand,

552
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
the story is like completely crazy.

553
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,320
Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.

554
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,360
He talks about how much he misses his PSP and he's DS fan.

555
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
But I'm bummed.

556
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Okay.

557
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Next email.

558
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.

559
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Oh, okay.

560
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Okay.

561
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Okay.

562
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
There it is.

563
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
No, that's not going to be it.

564
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
No, that can't be it.

565
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
Whatever.

566
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,640
Can I read the next email, Rob?

567
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Yes, you may.

568
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Okay, stop.

569
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Love you.

570
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Stop it.

571
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,040
You're all red in the face and you look scary.

572
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,520
This is from Recimo.

573
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,400
Hey, guys!

574
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Hi.

575
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,840
I've emailed before regarding the PSN.

576
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,040
I've heard Lucky say that he's waiting for the PSN cards because he doesn't like the

577
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
idea of using his debit account to buy games.

578
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,540
I personally like the option because it's more convenient since you don't buy the games.

579
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,600
How about game sharing?

580
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,160
Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give

581
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,180
you a copy of Super Stardust HD.

582
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,760
How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?

583
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,800
It's a relatively easy process and I'd be happy to share my games with you.

584
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
So add Recimo to your friends list and we'll talk.

585
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,680
Now, basically, here's why I don't want to...

586
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm waiting for those cards is because I'm cheap and I just use a lot...

587
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,480
I get a lot of free games that I turn in the GameStop and get store credit, so I buy those

588
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,480
points cards with store credit and that's why, so I don't actually spend money on it.

589
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
That's a good idea.

590
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
All right.

591
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,440
Also, I just asked my sister to buy me the Eye of Judgment for Christmas.

592
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the eye camera and in the process

593
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,520
helped Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.

594
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
Never going to happen.

595
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Never going to happen.

596
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,760
I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other

597
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
game in all our history.

598
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Great.

599
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
It's still under cheese big time.

600
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,560
We've had guests on to promote Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote...

601
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,800
I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought the 24 of the game because

602
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,440
you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.

603
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,220
No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that

604
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,840
will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a Tingle suit if you can tell a million

605
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
of your friends to buy this game.

606
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,920
It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.

607
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,120
It's starting to flat out and in fact in Japan, they only sold a couple hundred units the

608
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,400
other week so it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one million.

609
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,240
DJ Genai now calls it the Brown Eye of Fudgement.

610
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,880
Can I finish reading this email please?

611
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Yes, you may.

612
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
Sorry.

613
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,280
The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.

614
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,640
I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.

615
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I can store as much as five gigs of video on the hard drive.

616
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,520
I attached a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1000 mile rally arcade machine

617
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,720
that I recorded with the iCamera.

618
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,760
Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter II machine that I just bought.

619
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,360
She loves my Pac-Man the most.

620
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to the show on my PSP.

621
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,040
I made the mistake of listening to the show last week while drinking coffee and ringing

622
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
up a customer.

623
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,480
Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow cooking George Foreman grill and I laughed and spat

624
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,360
coffee at my customer's face.

625
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,880
Not good for business.

626
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,640
Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't

627
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,080
have to pay for his merchandise.

628
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,040
Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.

629
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,000
It's so strange to me the effect this show has.

630
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,640
Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a Bart ride home from San Francisco

631
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,200
or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.

632
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,960
It's amazing.

633
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
What you can achieve.

634
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Yeah, it's mostly Loki's fault.

635
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I'll give him that.

636
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,440
Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.

637
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
It's not nice.

638
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Yeah, really.

639
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,760
Oh yeah, it's my fault.

640
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,440
And just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting

641
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,640
so that we can see your daughter play a video game.

642
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,160
Or your, sorry, was it goddaughter?

643
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah.

644
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,680
Play video game.

645
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Next email.

646
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Dun dun dun.

647
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,560
Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorsed DS piracy.

648
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,560
I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.

649
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,520
500 games in total.

650
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,960
I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.

651
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,240
Crack firmware on iPod games.

652
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,640
Should you really read this on the air?

653
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
From Ryan.

654
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Oh, jeez.

655
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, here's the thing about that.

656
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,760
I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but

657
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,760
I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.

658
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,040
It's just like, ooh, I could pirate all these games as the FBI is coming to Ryan's house

659
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
right now.

660
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Oh, yeah.

661
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,560
We've narrowed it down to Ryan.

662
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Let's find Ryan.

663
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
How many Ryans are there?

664
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,040
Oh, only a couple billion.

665
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Well, wait a minute.

666
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,160
Ryan's not listening to this program.

667
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
There's probably only one.

668
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,480
We don't have that many listeners.

669
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Well.

670
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
He emailed.

671
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,880
He didn't say he listened to the program.

672
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
He just emailed us.

673
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,280
IP tracking.

674
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Let me see.

675
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
No.

676
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
But anyway, no.

677
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,360
The only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all of the games I don't want to import,

678
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,920
so that's why I have it.

679
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,140
Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.

680
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,280
My husband manages a game crazy.

681
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,960
By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.

682
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
That game sucks.

683
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,600
It's not good at all.

684
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,800
Didn't you say that last week?

685
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
No, I bought Drawn to Life last week.

686
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,720
No, I'm pretty sure you reviewed it last week and said it sucked last week.

687
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,120
Well, it sucks.

688
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
It still sucks.

689
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
It still sucks.

690
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
News flash.

691
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,800
Here's your update on Drawn to Life.

692
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
Loki, what is the current update on Drawn to Life?

693
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
It sucks.

694
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
It stinks.

695
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
It stinks.

696
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Sorry, Jamie.

697
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Can I read?

698
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Yes.

699
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Please.

700
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Okay.

701
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:13,400
Hey Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing, okay?

702
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,280
It's A-M-A-Z-I dash Z-I-N-G.

703
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,400
You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news

704
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
that we all want.

705
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,960
You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with like any, like, I feel, I don't

706
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,360
know, I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other like publishers

707
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
out there.

708
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Hey, we'll promote your stuff.

709
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
And they listen to it.

710
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
No, thanks.

711
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.

712
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Yeah.

713
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Sorry, Jamie.

714
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Okay.

715
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Blame him.

716
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
I am.

717
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Can I read now?

718
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Yes.

719
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Okay.

720
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,000
I love how the mailbag segment always turns into how many times can we cut off Jamie with

721
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
a random tension?

722
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,480
How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?

723
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
All right.

724
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Sorry.

725
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Go ahead.

726
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,080
Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd

727
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,740
only listened to before my PSP, even though I live overseas.

728
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,560
I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.

729
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,600
Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stores.

730
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,640
In one of these in mid-November, I saw the orange box for PS3 on the shelves.

731
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,540
Not knowing the intended release date for this game at the time, I didn't know how big

732
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,320
of an opportunity this was since I can't find that friggin' game here anymore.

733
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,640
I wanted to know what you guys thought of that, and I had a little idea.

734
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,160
DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem

735
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
to have anything special.

736
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,960
Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a worsted game of the week segment

737
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
or something like that?

738
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
Loki is special.

739
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,200
It would give him a chance to blow off some steam lol.

740
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,480
I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a worsted game of the week.

741
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
That's kind of stupid.

742
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,920
That's the worst idea of the week.

743
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Poor listener.

744
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Can I finish?

745
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Yes.

746
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Thank you.

747
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,800
Well, that's about it, again, an ego- Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.

748
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm sorry.

749
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
You're like, can I finish?

750
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Well, that's just about it.

751
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Bob.

752
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I hate you guys.

753
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,960
Anyway, well, that's about it, again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being- and being

754
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,800
15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.

755
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Keep up the awesome work.

756
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,600
Wow, this person writes a very freaking good email for being 15, and this is from The Flawless

757
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Bolt X.

758
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
P.S.

759
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,480
I bought myself an eye of judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's

760
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,840
two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.

761
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
P.S.S.

762
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,760
Put more crap on the PSP website and never get tired of that-

763
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
No!

764
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,860
I will never!

765
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,800
It will stay the way it is.

766
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,040
It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.

767
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,440
Which I think we finally let expire.

768
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.

769
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
D'oh.

770
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,320
So, to keep on reading.

771
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,480
Dear OLR crew, this is Rama from Indonesia, I think- yeah, you've written to us.

772
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,040
Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.

773
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,880
It's been a while since my last email.

774
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,560
I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.

775
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,880
To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments

776
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,400
about game related content, keep getting crazy then.

777
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,320
To Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game related content and your

778
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
mocking style.

779
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,600
I love that nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.

780
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,400
To Dark Sakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week as I

781
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,800
am blind so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.

782
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,160
Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.

783
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,200
By the way guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.

784
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,720
I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.

785
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,240
Yes I love playing a recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.

786
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,480
And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.

787
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,120
Everyone sent us movies this week.

788
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,200
Yeah, there's links on here.

789
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,960
These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments

790
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,880
and I will add more songs to play, perhaps Dragon Force.

791
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,960
And Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok, hey I love Ragnarok.

792
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,800
More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.

793
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,600
That's kind of old school.

794
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
That's pretty cool.

795
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,760
Well I'll leave these active in the email box and we'll check them out.

796
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Last email, dun dun dun.

797
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,600
Dear Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki, I am a long time listener but first time writer slash

798
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
contributor.

799
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,040
I found your show when iTunes first started offering podcasts and OLR was one of my first.

800
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,880
Right then it was your abbreviated Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.

801
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,680
I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the

802
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,480
podcasts I was getting and yours was one of the longest.

803
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
But recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors

804
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,240
don't notice me on it all day and don't notice or call me on it and have resubscribed.

805
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
Now I listen to your show every week.

806
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,560
Anywho, for starters you'll notice that I've attached, I've included an attachment.

807
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:28,680
I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare To Be Stupid as the background music for your

808
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,520
stupid awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your

809
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,200
dialogue on top of it.

810
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,920
I've included an instrumental version of the song Taken from the Amish Paradise single

811
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,840
– I ripped the file myself so I know it's legit – in case you want to use it in future

812
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
segments.

813
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
That's cool.

814
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Aw, that's nice of you.

815
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Thank you.

816
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,200
It's still relevant.

817
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,120
Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played

818
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,960
during last week's A Few segment?

819
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,680
I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite

820
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,000
game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others, and I was wondering if you could hook

821
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,880
me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.

822
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,800
It's on the Advent Children soundtrack, but I'll take care of this later.

823
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Stay tuned.

824
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:27,760
How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?

825
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,720
So if I may continue.

826
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,200
Finally the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.

827
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,880
I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney

828
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
World.

829
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
I'll leave it at that.

830
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,920
Well, nice.

831
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,960
We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.

832
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,400
Keep up the great work, and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as

833
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,720
I can get away with it.

834
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,920
Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.

835
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Sincerely, Justin the Claw.

836
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
P.S.

837
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,960
On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to

838
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
a game as addicting.

839
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,600
When did that word become an adjective?

840
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,320
According to Merriam-Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.

841
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,480
Addictive would be the proper adjective form.

842
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
You're not the only one to do this.

843
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.

844
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.

845
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,640
I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?

846
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
No offense, of course.

847
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I'm just making an observation.

848
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,120
Yes, but it could also be an understood object.

849
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,520
Whatever, dude.

850
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,080
Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.

851
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,600
I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.

852
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Don't hate.

853
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:46,800
I'd say the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.

854
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,880
He learns something new every week here on Orange Lime's radio.

855
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,280
And Freeze Pop emailed us.

856
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
Really?

857
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,640
Just with updates to their shows.

858
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,760
Mike, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?

859
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
No.

860
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,320
Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of hours.

861
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,360
The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.

862
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm so excited.

863
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
That's cool.

864
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
I will tell you who it is next week.

865
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
No, I won't.

866
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,240
Well, I'll tell you later.

867
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,600
Yes, I will.

868
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
In a private room.

869
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:21,040
Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.

870
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,280
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

871
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,160
Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow

872
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,860
up and self-destruct.

873
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
So please don't do that.

874
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,680
And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.

875
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,280
Alright, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we

876
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
haven't even touched.

877
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
Right, Logie?

878
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Definitely.

879
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,880
The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced was announced this week.

880
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:54,780
Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version,

881
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,480
and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network as Bionic Commando

882
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Rearmed.

883
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,060
It looks fucking awesome.

884
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,780
It's going to have two player co-op in the game.

885
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,920
It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw

886
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,400
them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.

887
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,380
New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses, but it's basically

888
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,680
going to follow the original game.

889
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,040
This game looks so hot.

890
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,640
Like I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go

891
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,840
seek out the video for this.

892
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Everybody has it, right?

893
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,960
Yeah, pretty much everyone.

894
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,500
Every big video game site has it.

895
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
It looks so hot.

896
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,080
Like, that is the way you redo an old game.

897
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,040
I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.

898
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,280
Me too, me too.

899
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,640
But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock

900
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,920
the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy or what.

901
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,360
He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.

902
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,360
That's cool.

903
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
That is great.

904
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,480
Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?

905
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,920
As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.

906
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,040
I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right, to be politically correct?

907
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,720
Well, they could still be...

908
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,320
His name is now Heiler.

909
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
No.

910
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:11,600
Well, no, he was... he had a different name in the US one anyway, but it was still Hitler.

911
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,840
He looked like him.

912
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,440
They had Master... you know, Master D trying to...

913
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,440
Master D.

914
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Yeah.

915
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,360
I don't know.

916
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
I'm excited.

917
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,800
I cannot wait to play this game.

918
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,820
I love the whole idea about you can pick up somebody with your claw and throw them.

919
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,020
That is awesome.

920
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,020
Very awesome.

921
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,400
Still no ability to jump, though.

922
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,920
Why does that make you laugh?

923
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
I don't know.

924
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
It's just like...

925
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,360
I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, it's just...

926
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
It's the claw.

927
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,360
The claw.

928
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,400
See, Justin the Claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?

929
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
All right.

930
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
Anyway.

931
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,280
If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking

932
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,400
game that kind of moves like an M.C.

933
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Escher piece.

934
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,360
Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to

935
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,840
be making its way to the PlayStation 3.

936
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,960
You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.

937
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,200
This was one of their kind of, like, wow-em kind of games.

938
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,440
I don't remember if it was that or E3, but it was one of the games that people kind of

939
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,640
went and go, oh, Sony's kind of putting out some cool stuff.

940
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
It was E3.

941
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah.

942
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh, sorry.

943
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,760
Well, anyhow, it's going to be up, finally, on March 19th.

944
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,680
That's going to be a PlayStation Network download on March 19th.

945
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,800
Only the PSP version had been given a date previously, but you can finally check this

946
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,040
out on March 19th, which, coincidentally, is the same day that you can actually check

947
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
out the PSP version.

948
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,760
And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.

949
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,720
If I had a PS3, I'd check it out, but since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and

950
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,120
check it out there.

951
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Sound good, Loki?

952
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Sure.

953
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,520
I'm crashing your party.

954
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,000
All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.

955
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,840
Very cool.

956
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,720
Well, in other news, crap.

957
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Really?

958
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,360
What kind of crap?

959
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,720
No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.

960
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,880
So I have to reload show roll.

961
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,880
Oh, that's okay.

962
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
We can wait.

963
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,880
You know what?

964
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,880
Give me a second.

965
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,240
I just bid on a Vectrex, by the way.

966
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240
Cool.

967
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,240
You're going to buy a Vectrex?

968
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Why?

969
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,040
Because someone in Stockton is selling one, and right now the bidding is up to 50 bucks,

970
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,320
and it comes with, like, 10 games.

971
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,320
But what do you want it for?

972
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,600
Just say you have to put it in my desk at work.

973
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,680
Dark Soccer is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.

974
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,680
I don't care.

975
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,680
I'm going to watch it.

976
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,680
I'll do it, too.

977
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,680
I don't care if I win.

978
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,680
I don't win.

979
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,120
I'm not, like, that dead set on getting it.

980
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:39,600
I bought, like I said, that bit generations game, what's it called, Dot Stream.

981
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,600
It's up, by the way.

982
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,800
All right.

983
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,800
It will be.

984
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,320
Okay.

985
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,520
Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.

986
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,280
It has 16 games on it.

987
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:04,680
It will be on PS2 and PSP, and it's going to be, let's see what's on here.

988
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:14,080
We have Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo

989
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,540
Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician

990
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,680
Lord, but they're not on there.

991
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,560
Actually, yes.

992
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,120
Yes, they are on there, sorry.

993
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
We just can't make up our mind.

994
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,400
There are so many SNK classics to choose from.

995
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,440
They are all on there.

996
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Excellent.

997
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
What is this for again?

998
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
It's a PSP.

999
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
PS2 and PSP.

1000
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Oh, nice.

1001
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,240
That'll be fun to play on the PSP.

1002
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,640
It's nice to see them putting together nice compilations since, you know, SNK doesn't

1003
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
want to make any new games.

1004
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,840
They've never done a compilation before.

1005
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Yeah.

1006
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
They don't want to make new games.

1007
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,400
I mean, what's this, like the E compilation that Metal Slug's been in?

1008
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
SNK compilation?

1009
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Unheard of.

1010
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Unheard of.

1011
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:06,960
Well, this isn't really a compilation, but Guitar Hero 3, they're going to be doing a

1012
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:14,160
little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say,

1013
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,680
on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.

1014
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,020
You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live on Guitar Hero 3 where

1015
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:35,520
you can possibly win a LG 50 inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and

1016
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,080
a Boom Chair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.

1017
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
A Boom Chair?

1018
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,600
Yes, Boom Chair.

1019
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:52,440
Also you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller face plate signed by Slash and some other

1020
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,040
crap including, I think, some points and whatnot.

1021
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,080
But yeah, so that should be cool.

1022
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,360
Actually they're saying, it looks like the event's going to go from February 1st through

1023
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:15,960
the 3rd, so yeah, it's 72 hours, but I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12

1024
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,920
to 4 isn't a big deal there, whatever.

1025
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,160
Oh, and it's for US and Canada only, so sorry everybody else.

1026
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,960
Sorry international people, apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.

1027
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,160
No, just kidding.

1028
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,800
There's probably laws or something, I don't know.

1029
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,160
If you want to find out more information on us, go to Xbox.com slash rock your party.

1030
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,000
We're going to rock your party.

1031
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,880
All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype

1032
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,280
line where you can call us and interact with us.

1033
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,480
You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give

1034
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,440
us a call toll free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1035
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,940
We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.

1036
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,940
It's one we don't talk about.

1037
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,940
It's not really World of Warcraft.

1038
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,560
We don't talk about this game very much, but I believe the most popular MMO in the world,

1039
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,840
even above World of Warcraft, is a game called Lineage 2, and you know Lineage 2?

1040
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Have you played Lineage 2?

1041
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,200
No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2, and I'm like, hey, I've heard

1042
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
of that before.

1043
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
I have a Coke can.

1044
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
I do too.

1045
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,840
I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.

1046
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,800
I remember them giving that away or something.

1047
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,040
Well, anyway, Lineage 2 is one of the most popular MMOs anywhere, and unfortunately,

1048
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,120
there's always some tragedy that comes out of MMOs, and this tragedy comes out of Russia,

1049
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,120
where there is probably, you know, probably here in America, most people are playing Warcraft,

1050
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,160
but I suppose over in Russia, there's much more people playing Lineage 2.

1051
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,920
Not to say no one in America is playing it, but anyway.

1052
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,020
A Russian man has been charged with murder.

1053
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:54,400
It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.

1054
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,700
There were these two clans.

1055
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,880
There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.

1056
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,640
It's the Ku Klux Klan.

1057
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
Yes.

1058
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
Yeah, wow.

1059
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
That's all I can say about that one.

1060
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,440
There was this, I mean, that should have been the first sign that something was wrong.

1061
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,340
There was this clan, and then the Platinum Clan, they were just fighting each other consistently.

1062
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,920
The Ku Klux were mostly students, and Platinum were people over 30, and the guy who was killed

1063
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,140
here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer, and he had a clan.

1064
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,040
There were warriors in the clan, and just before New Year, there was a big old battle

1065
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,000
with the Ku Klux, and for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face to face in

1066
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,720
the real world.

1067
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,960
Sign of trouble right there, and when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten

1068
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,720
and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.

1069
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,960
Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, I think they have confused the

1070
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,400
game in reality, and after we buried him on December 31st, they continued to threaten

1071
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
us.

1072
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,360
The alleged murderer has not shown any regret, and has yet to justify himself.

1073
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,360
The alleged murderer, 22 years old.

1074
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Amazing.

1075
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,760
Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?

1076
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:18,680
Like is this like a satire website or whatever, but I think it's real.

1077
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,120
That's kind of, wow, sad, sad, sad, sad.

1078
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
That was awful.

1079
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,760
No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?

1080
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,920
Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3, and apparently someone found goat's say

1081
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,080
in Zelda 3.

1082
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,720
It was ridiculous, but funny.

1083
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,980
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness

1084
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,960
or anything else we've talked about tonight, you can go ahead and just call.

1085
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,560
Right now, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

1086
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
Let's go to the phones.

1087
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,880
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

1088
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,840
Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

1089
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
You there?

1090
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Caller?

1091
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Hola, bienvenidos a Orangelaunchradio.

1092
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,840
Hello.

1093
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:14,200
Okay, apparently our caller's not there.

1094
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,720
Make sure you always check your connection with Echo123.

1095
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,720
Let's try this one instead.

1096
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,720
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?

1097
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,440
Hello, this is Ion671.

1098
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,240
Hello, Ion671, what's on your mind?

1099
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:37,600
Well, I just want to say that I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that parents

1100
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:44,960
don't understand games, because I'm a kid, 16, and both my parents are really into video

1101
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,640
games and anime.

1102
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:55,780
My dad just was saying how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.

1103
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,280
You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns

1104
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,640
and you're very lucky to have them, right?

1105
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:10,760
Yes, because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games

1106
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,340
and think that they are the devil's creation.

1107
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,840
What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?

1108
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,560
Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?

1109
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,240
I really don't know, I may have just been lucky.

1110
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,000
Rice Princess is asking a question here, hold on.

1111
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,320
I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were

1112
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,320
younger.

1113
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:47,060
Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games,

1114
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:58,920
but then they grow up with quotation fingers, and there are some people who see a show so

1115
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,520
they disregard it or discard it, it's late.

1116
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:11,400
And I would assume that in your household you sound pretty well off for 16, you sound

1117
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,920
like you're a smart kid, and obviously you're smart because you're listening to this show,

1118
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,520
but video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've

1119
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
turned out okay.

1120
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,960
Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?

1121
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,360
No.

1122
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,080
Then you've probably turned out a-okay, so what do you think other families can learn

1123
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,800
from yours?

1124
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:39,360
Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because

1125
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:45,000
every time they mention a game called Grand Theft Auto, so I'm wondering why parents are

1126
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
buying it for their kids.

1127
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
That's a good question.

1128
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,680
Hey, I've got another question for you.

1129
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,280
Do your parents play the games with you?

1130
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:00,180
Oh yeah, well not of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually

1131
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,720
kick my ass at burnout, he is a burnout machine.

1132
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,520
That's kind of cool, like you guys have fun as a family together playing the games, right?

1133
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Mm-hmm.

1134
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,400
And how's that different from card game night or board game night or whatever, you know?

1135
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,240
I don't know, it's just kind of the new way of doing things.

1136
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,120
It's just way cooler, that's what it is.

1137
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,680
It's way cooler.

1138
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
We're all going to come over- It's just the next generation.

1139
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,280
We're all going to come over to your house someday and have a party, okay?

1140
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
Because your parents sound like they'd be cool with that.

1141
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,600
Well, I wouldn't afford it, so good luck at that.

1142
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,640
All right, well hey, you know, Jamie and I are in Disney World, so don't bite your tongue,

1143
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,640
sir.

1144
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,640
We might be in your neck in the woods.

1145
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Okay.

1146
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,640
One last thing?

1147
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,320
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

1148
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,200
I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all his PSP stuff.

1149
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
Really?

1150
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,360
And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.

1151
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:58,280
Okay, well I'm very sorry, so look, we disavowed all knowledge of that email and anything was

1152
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,280
ever said.

1153
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Okay.

1154
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,280
Why would he sue?

1155
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,640
I mean, seriously, I mean, he's the one breaking the law.

1156
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,640
It's a joke.

1157
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,840
And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.

1158
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,560
See, we didn't do that before, so we ought to sue you.

1159
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,560
Okay.

1160
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,840
I just said I know him.

1161
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,560
I don't say I know him personally.

1162
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,560
Oh, okay.

1163
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,560
Oh, snap.

1164
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,560
Here, I flipped that right back at you.

1165
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,440
Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?

1166
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,440
You did.

1167
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,280
Rob got majorly pwned.

1168
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,840
That was indeed a zing, Rob.

1169
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,840
You got a zing.

1170
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Alright, for that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.

1171
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
Bye.

1172
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Okay, bye.

1173
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
Alright, have a good week.

1174
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
That was a good call.

1175
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,080
That was a really good call.

1176
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,200
That was a very good call.

1177
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,240
One of our better calls.

1178
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,600
I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come

1179
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,960
to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.

1180
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,800
Invite yourself, Rob.

1181
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,280
My parents will buy beer.

1182
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,680
I hope they buy good beer.

1183
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,760
Alright, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1184
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,760
Who's this?

1185
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,880
Hello, hi, hi.

1186
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,880
Hello?

1187
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
Hello?

1188
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,880
Sorry about that.

1189
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
I'm going to make a phone.

1190
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.

1191
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,880
You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.

1192
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,880
What's up?

1193
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
How's that?

1194
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,880
Ah, much better.

1195
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,880
What's on your mind?

1196
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
Introduce yourself.

1197
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,880
Yes.

1198
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
Introduce yourself.

1199
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Hi, I'm Rob.

1200
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
I'm Rob.

1201
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Hey, Rob.

1202
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
I'm Rob.

1203
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
I'm Rob.

1204
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,880
Hi.

1205
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,880
I'm Rob.

1206
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,880
I'm Rob.

1207
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,880
I'm Rob.

1208
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,880
I'm Rob.

1209
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,880
I'm Rob.

1210
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,880
I'm Rob.

1211
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,880
I'm Rob.

1212
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,880
Hi, I'm Rob.

1213
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,880
I'm Rob.

1214
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Hi.

1215
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,880
How's Rob?

1216
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,880
I'm Rob.

1217
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,880
Hi, I'm Rob.

1218
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,880
Yes.

1219
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
Introduce yourself.

1220
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,940
Oh, by the way, sorry, dude.

1221
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,940
Okay, I don't know.

1222
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,460
I'm just hanging out and listening on the east coast, I guess.

1223
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,460
What's your name?

1224
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:53,600
Or you have an online name, or?

1225
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,220
I have an email in the chat room.

1226
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,220
Okay, cool.

1227
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,800
Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?

1228
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:18,400
Is there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?

1229
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,000
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

1230
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Oh, do you mind if I...

1231
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,720
I got a cool dad in the same room.

1232
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,720
Do you want to talk to him?

1233
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,720
Okay.

1234
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Hello?

1235
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Hello?

1236
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,720
Hello.

1237
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,720
Hi, identify yourself.

1238
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,720
Hello.

1239
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,720
Hi, who's this?

1240
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,720
This is Okuda.

1241
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Hello, Okuda!

1242
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,720
Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.

1243
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,720
I mean, we're just an internet radio show.

1244
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,720
Nothing to be scared of, right?

1245
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,720
Right, Okuda?

1246
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,720
Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.

1247
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,720
Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.

1248
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,720
What's on your mind?

1249
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,720
I was wondering...

1250
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,720
I play World of Warcraft a lot.

1251
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,720
I was wondering...

1252
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,720
Do you like private servers?

1253
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,720
What's your opinion on private servers?

1254
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,720
On crowded servers?

1255
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,720
Private servers.

1256
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,720
Oh, private servers.

1257
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,720
I don't know much about them.

1258
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,720
I know they're out there.

1259
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,720
I've understood it's kind of a risky thing to do.

1260
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,720
Once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?

1261
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,720
I don't know.

1262
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,720
But private servers are kind of corny.

1263
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,720
I mean, yeah, you can do...

1264
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,720
I wasn't there a cash file.

1265
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,720
Oh, you can dump a cash file.

1266
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,720
I guess.

1267
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,720
But anyway, sorry, go ahead.

1268
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,720
No, I'm just saying you can mod it to be super strong or make all this money and stuff.

1269
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,720
But that makes the game boring to me.

1270
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,720
I don't know.

1271
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,720
You can have the new patch.

1272
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,720
You can have the new patch.

1273
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
You can have the new patch. I'm there.

1274
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,720
Only on the private servers.

1275
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,720
Really?

1276
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,720
I have three characters.

1277
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,720
Oh my god, you're perfect. Get away from me.

1278
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,720
Stop sitting next to me.

1279
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,720
They're all female dwarves.

1280
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,720
Oh my...

1281
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Get especially away from me.

1282
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,720
That doesn't even make sense.

1283
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,720
But private servers...

1284
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,720
I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.

1285
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:23,720
You need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at two in the morning on a private server.

1286
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:31,720
So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, you can't really progress very far, I would think.

1287
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,720
I don't know. Do you have a difference of opinion?

1288
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,720
Akuda, do you play on a private server?

1289
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,720
Yeah.

1290
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,720
And how do you like it?

1291
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,720
Yeah, I play on a private server.

1292
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,720
Um, yeah...

1293
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,720
Sorry, there's a huge lag.

1294
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,720
Oh, it's probably JustinTV screwing everything up. That's alright.

1295
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:57,720
Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous, hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?

1296
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,720
Thanks for having me.

1297
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,720
No problemo.

1298
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,720
You got to say hi.

1299
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,720
I think they're handing the phone back. I'm not sure.

1300
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,720
Okay.

1301
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,720
Alright. Have a good one, you guys.

1302
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,720
Alright.

1303
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,720
Okay, thanks for having us. Have a good night.

1304
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,720
You too.

1305
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
Smoke another bud.

1306
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,720
That's terrible, Rob.

1307
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,720
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. They're just nervous. God, come on.

1308
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,720
No.

1309
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,720
But if they use smoke bud, they'll relax.

1310
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,720
No, we're not encouraging that, though. We would never...

1311
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,720
No, but if you feel so inclined, it would help you relax.

1312
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Alright, look, we give people shit, that's what we do.

1313
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Like, we're going to give our next caller.

1314
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,720
Who's this?

1315
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,720
It's me, Rama. What's up, everyone?

1316
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,720
Hello, Rama.

1317
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,720
What is up, Rama, speaking of giving people shit?

1318
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Not much.

1319
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,720
No, that was me that called the first time, but my headset was acting really retarded.

1320
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
Sorry about that.

1321
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,720
Yeah, echo 123 next time.

1322
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,720
That was the headset. I think that was user error, Rama.

1323
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,720
What's on your mind?

1324
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:04,720
Oh, not too much. I want to talk about the whole PlayStation Dusty article you told earlier.

1325
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,720
Dust Cap 3.

1326
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,720
What about it?

1327
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Pretty much.

1328
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,720
Check this out. I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now at theconsumers.com.

1329
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,720
I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.

1330
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:26,720
As somebody who's been in a technical field for about ten years, even in the worst conditions,

1331
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,720
I have never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty, okay?

1332
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,720
So, obviously, this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.

1333
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:48,720
Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website that supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.

1334
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,720
It's coming from consumers.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.

1335
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,720
They're both in that same thing.

1336
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,720
Their blogs are also very similar looking.

1337
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,720
I actually kind of like Consumerist.

1338
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,720
They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.

1339
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,720
But anyhow, sorry, I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.

1340
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,720
That's fine.

1341
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,720
We're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation.

1342
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,720
Was this person smoking right in front of it, or was it just poorly ventilated?

1343
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,720
Because I look at Loki's house, and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that,

1344
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,720
and Dark Soccer's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that, so I don't think it's the machine.

1345
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,720
I think there's something the person is doing.

1346
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,720
That's what it is.

1347
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,720
Is the cat sleeping on it at night?

1348
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,720
He's just stuck in somewhere where he could collect dust in the basement or something.

1349
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:44,720
Now, the next link I posted off the Consumerist, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.

1350
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,720
If you read the comments, you find that the guy that complained about this is an actor,

1351
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,720
and now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.

1352
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,720
And I also posted a link from PlayStation.net about it.

1353
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,720
The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?

1354
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,720
Yeah.

1355
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,720
Why?

1356
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,720
Supposedly this guy is a pay... he was paid to do this.

1357
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,720
This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?

1358
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,720
PS3, you're so dirty.

1359
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,720
You've been very naughty, Sony.

1360
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,720
You're a naughty person.

1361
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,720
I paid him to do it.

1362
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,720
What the crap?

1363
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,720
Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3...

1364
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,720
Who paid him to... oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.

1365
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,720
It wasn't Sony that did it.

1366
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
Somebody paid him to do it.

1367
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
He's... okay.

1368
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,720
I'm reading this from Play3.net.

1369
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,720
End of the story? No.

1370
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:44,720
It only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit-part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.

1371
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Now, it is possible that this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.

1372
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:55,720
These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career, or paid as part...

1373
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,720
I know, m'lady? M'lady?

1374
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,720
What a crappy word to use.

1375
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:04,720
Paid as a part of the much-cited Microsoft dirty tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.

1376
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,720
Ah, what the hell?

1377
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,720
I don't... that seems kind of low.

1378
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,720
I mean, I don't think... you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da,

1379
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,720
this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.

1380
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:23,720
So, I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.

1381
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Nathan has a question.

1382
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,720
Oh, yeah, sure, Nathan.

1383
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,720
I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.

1384
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:38,720
You're not... it's not supposed to be an act on the news.

1385
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Oh, it was Fox News.

1386
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,720
That could be...

1387
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,720
Yeah, fair and balanced.

1388
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,720
Well, you know what?

1389
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,720
When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?

1390
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,720
Even porno?

1391
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Yeah, sure, porno.

1392
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
Oh, Skinimax.

1393
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,720
I don't know. Why do people do Skinimax films?

1394
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,720
I don't know.

1395
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
Well, Rama, I don't know.

1396
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,720
What do you think of this?

1397
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,720
Who do you think did the setup?

1398
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,720
I honestly don't know because I read all of the comments.

1399
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,720
He claims that this is legit.

1400
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:11,720
To be perfectly honest, I don't know, but I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.

1401
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,720
I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.

1402
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,720
That's what I honestly think.

1403
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,720
That's kind of a mental problem.

1404
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,720
It gets dusty, but we've had stuff set up for like three, four months.

1405
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,720
We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months and it's not even that dirty.

1406
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,720
It looks like it's nearly new and we don't even touch it.

1407
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,720
I think he just has issues.

1408
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,720
I think that's what it boils down to.

1409
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,720
Cleaning issues.

1410
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,720
Yeah, cleaning issues.

1411
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,720
Maybe he lives in a toilet.

1412
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Who knows?

1413
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,720
Where it would get especially dusty.

1414
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,720
That makes a lot of sense, Rob.

1415
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,720
Shut up. I hate you.

1416
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,720
You shut up, you m'lady.

1417
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,720
I hate you.

1418
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,720
Children, children behave.

1419
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,720
So I get for reading fast.

1420
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,720
No.

1421
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
All right.

1422
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,720
Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

1423
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,720
I will be making a trip out to the West Coast.

1424
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,720
When?

1425
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,720
Yay.

1426
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,720
Looking at Fourth of July weekend.

1427
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,720
Awesome.

1428
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Woohoo.

1429
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Well, we will be seeing you then.

1430
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,720
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
Oh, yeah.

1432
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Clean the book hard.

1433
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,720
End all time.

1434
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,720
All right.

1435
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,720
All right, Rama.

1436
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,720
We got to let you go.

1437
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,720
We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.

1438
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,720
One last question.

1439
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,720
I'll get out of here.

1440
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?

1441
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,720
Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?

1442
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,720
I will give you three guesses.

1443
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,720
It starts with a J.

1444
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,720
I love you.

1445
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,720
All right.

1446
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,720
Take care, Rama.

1447
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
All right.

1448
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Bye.

1449
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
Bye.

1450
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,720
I like to point out it was an empty bottle of gold schlager, too.

1451
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,720
Just so you know.

1452
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,720
Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of gold schlager.

1453
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, Skype Line 1877, Game OLR.

1454
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,720
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1455
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,720
Who's this?

1456
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Hi, there.

1457
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,720
This is Ross Deal UT.

1458
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
Hello, Ross Deal UT.

1459
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,720
What is on your mind?

1460
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Not much.

1461
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:07,320
You know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO freaks who

1462
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,720
started fighting with each other.

1463
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,520
I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.

1464
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,160
I mean, it was that unreal.

1465
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:20,320
Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight or a clan fight or whatever?

1466
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,320
I would not want to meet in real life.

1467
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,520
Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.

1468
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,120
I guess, I don't know.

1469
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,320
Anyway, that reminds me of a recent post on Kotaku.

1470
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,320
Apparently, the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on Internet

1471
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,320
cafes and stuff like that.

1472
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,320
Let me put a link on the chat.

1473
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:49,820
Basically, what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming

1474
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,320
cafes because China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.

1475
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,320
Hello?

1476
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,320
Yeah, no, no, no.

1477
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,320
Sorry.

1478
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,520
I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.

1479
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
Let's see.

1480
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,120
It looks like you're linking us to Kotaku who ran this report.

1481
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,540
Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to

1482
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:13,360
clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city

1483
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,720
of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal Internet cafes, Xinhua said.

1484
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:25,020
The crackdown netted 1407 computers while seven people were arrested and nearly 5,000

1485
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,360
Internet accounts closed.

1486
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,680
Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.

1487
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,680
Wow.

1488
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,520
Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.

1489
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:41,920
Normally, I'm not forcing limits on Internet time, but damn, it really sounds like China

1490
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
has got a real problem.

1491
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,920
Well, most of Asia, really.

1492
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,000
Well, these cafes sound a little bit shady anyway.

1493
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,440
Even in the U.S., you have to register your business with the government.

1494
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,460
That's because we want taxes.

1495
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:59,120
Something similar could happen here.

1496
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,960
If the government found a business running illegally that was making all this money under

1497
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,960
the table, they'd send the IRS after their assets.

1498
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,960
They go about it a different way.

1499
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:15,520
You wouldn't see the SWAT team going in there, but it would be a civil crime.

1500
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,000
Kind of similar, I don't know, but yeah, it's very interesting that it's become that ramp.

1501
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,640
Thirty computers crammed into a 40 square meter room, that's not very big.

1502
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,400
Yeah, I was about to say that.

1503
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,520
That sounds like people are really crammed in there.

1504
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,320
That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.

1505
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,400
I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.

1506
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
That's an interesting image right there.

1507
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,400
For real.

1508
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,040
That's a very interesting image.

1509
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,680
That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.

1510
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,680
All right, go ahead.

1511
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,680
Sorry, anyway.

1512
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:56,920
There's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the Xbox 360 failures.

1513
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,920
Give me a second.

1514
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,920
I'll pop up another link.

1515
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,680
I think I heard about this.

1516
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,420
This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this

1517
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,440
is why they're paying for it, right?

1518
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,000
Well, I'm posting the link now.

1519
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,920
It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which

1520
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,660
is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.

1521
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:32,400
It sort of makes me wonder the legitimacy of it.

1522
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,680
I don't know if you're reading it now.

1523
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,820
It's kind of a lengthy article.

1524
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,360
It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site they ran this.

1525
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:45,480
It looks like a story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about

1526
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,120
the Xbox 360 red ring of death failures.

1527
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,400
It was an interview conducted via email.

1528
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:59,960
That's already a big red flag.

1529
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:05,840
I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set

1530
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,040
the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.

1531
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,320
He was the same guy who was doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.

1532
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,320
Who knows?

1533
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,320
Yeah, exactly.

1534
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,880
I mean, it's funny you mention that, because Rama was just talking about that.

1535
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,400
It could just be muddling on both sides.

1536
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,400
It's an attempt.

1537
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,400
It's Reggie.

1538
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,080
Reggie Fils-Aime is doing it all, apparently.

1539
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,560
No, I don't know.

1540
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,360
I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.

1541
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,120
I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article,

1542
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,920
because honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 red rings of death are caused because

1543
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:44,740
Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's

1544
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,400
not really news to me.

1545
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,920
I mean, to be honest.

1546
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,920
I think most of us...

1547
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,640
That's been everybody's note about the X-Climbs for some time.

1548
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,960
So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners

1549
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,960
to save money?

1550
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,960
Not really.

1551
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,960
That's no surprise.

1552
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
Does it make it right?

1553
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,120
I mean, but I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.

1554
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:11,040
I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of trying to correct the issue, really.

1555
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,200
They made a boo-boo.

1556
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,200
They're fessing up to it.

1557
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,080
I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.

1558
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
He's got an Instagram.

1559
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,600
Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.

1560
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,480
I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.

1561
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,480
I suppose that's true.

1562
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,480
So, yeah, I don't know.

1563
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,480
I'm sorry, what?

1564
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:31,440
I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but I

1565
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,480
guess as long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.

1566
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,040
And there are some people who still do have working ones, but honestly, you tell me the

1567
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,240
failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?

1568
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,040
It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.

1569
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,040
I don't know.

1570
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,040
I don't know.

1571
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:52,440
Well, the problem is with, when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have

1572
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,560
broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.

1573
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,560
They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system works.

1574
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Good point.

1575
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,560
You're right.

1576
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,560
You're right.

1577
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,000
People don't complain when things are working.

1578
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
You're right.

1579
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
That's a good point.

1580
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Yeah.

1581
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,360
Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.

1582
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:15,000
We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things

1583
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,560
in for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.

1584
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:26,000
Apparently, and here's one more link, the Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable

1585
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
content.

1586
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,120
Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, with Devil May Cry 4, we feel that we've created a game

1587
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,760
that has a huge amount of content right out of the box without the need to download extra

1588
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,760
content.

1589
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,720
I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice.

1590
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
Yeah.

1591
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,880
You know what?

1592
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,280
Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.

1593
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,520
You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe

1594
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:57,400
since we have some new people, thanks to Justin TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably

1595
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:04,440
take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content

1596
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,020
downloadable content.

1597
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,600
When you are unlocking something that was already on the disc that you paid for, that

1598
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,120
should be considered pay-to-unlock content, such as what the Stages and Beautiful Katamari

1599
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,120
write.

1600
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,120
Those are pay-to-unlock content.

1601
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,860
Whereas, when you download the Rock Band songs, that is true downloadable content.

1602
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,160
You're not unlocking something already on the disc.

1603
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,240
I think if Capcom is taking a stand going, you know what?

1604
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,840
This game is too complex.

1605
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,040
We can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock

1606
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,040
content.

1607
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,040
I say applause.

1608
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,040
I don't know if there's so much you can do, but I think that just, you know, hello?

1609
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,720
Yeah, go ahead.

1610
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:46,520
I think it's just that this is their game, and personally I applaud them for it, because

1611
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,880
we do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content,

1612
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:57,880
the Hello Horse Armor, and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.

1613
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,800
It's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game, and this is what it's

1614
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,800
going to be.

1615
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,480
You don't see enough of that nowadays.

1616
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,200
I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.

1617
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
It's a good one.

1618
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,880
Ross Dio, we've got to let you go, because we've got to wrap up the show, but thank you

1619
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,880
so much for calling.

1620
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,880
We'd love to hear from you.

1621
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,880
Okay.

1622
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,880
Have a good one, man.

1623
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,880
Have a good one, buddy.

1624
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,880
Take care.

1625
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,880
Bye-bye.

1626
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,880
Bye-bye.

1627
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,480
I like how Ross Dio kind of shared all the stories that we seem to miss otherwise on

1628
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,480
tonight's program.

1629
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Kind of interesting.

1630
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,480
It's really nice of him.

1631
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,480
It was.

1632
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,480
Anyway, sorry, guys.

1633
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,900
I know there were a ton of people still trying to get through, but we are just running along

1634
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,900
on time tonight.

1635
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,200
We want to get out of here at a decent hour, so we're going to go ahead and shut off the

1636
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,920
Skype line for tonight.

1637
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,600
We'll take more calls next week, though, as always, so please tune in live.

1638
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,280
Meanwhile, we're going to go around and see if there are any last-minute stories.

1639
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,000
Dark Sakura, Loki, I have nothing.

1640
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Do you guys?

1641
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Nope.

1642
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Loki?

1643
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Yeah.

1644
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah.

1645
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,580
Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff, one of which is this game that I just found

1646
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,880
called Line Golfer.

1647
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,120
Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses almost, and it's actually pretty

1648
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,120
fun.

1649
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:05,020
You can find it at, let's see here, this website called candystand.com, and you can check it

1650
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,020
out there.

1651
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,020
Wait.

1652
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,020
Isn't that Lifesavers and stuff?

1653
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:09,020
Isn't that their website, Candystand?

1654
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,020
I don't know.

1655
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,020
Or am I crazy?

1656
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,020
I don't know.

1657
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,020
I forget.

1658
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,020
Maybe.

1659
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,320
No, it is wrigleyscandystand.com, the hottest games online, they say.

1660
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,380
And it's pretty fun.

1661
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:27,320
You can create your own courses, and you can upload them and play all these different courses

1662
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,080
and stuff.

1663
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,800
Let's see here.

1664
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,040
Then other stuff that's kind of funny.

1665
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:42,680
Apparently, gamegirl.com ran a top seven geek panties for girls.

1666
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,480
Oh God, I heard about this.

1667
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,640
How many does Irene own?

1668
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,400
That's what I want to know.

1669
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,000
Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone

1670
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
on there or not.

1671
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,840
I don't think so.

1672
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,760
Number six would be the password protection panties.

1673
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,800
It says username and password.

1674
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,800
That's kind of funny.

1675
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,800
Wow.

1676
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,140
Bonus stage panties.

1677
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,380
I agree with the Halo Master in chat.

1678
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:10,720
Best radio show ever.

1679
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,060
Space Invader panties would be number four.

1680
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:17,880
Number three is achievement unlocked panties.

1681
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,560
Number two, classic Nintendo panties.

1682
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,120
Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?

1683
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,120
I don't think so.

1684
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,120
These can't be legitimate.

1685
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,120
And then Mario panties.

1686
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,120
Mario panties.

1687
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,280
Hooray.

1688
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,280
Other fun stuff.

1689
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:37,500
There's a rumor that when Smash Brothers Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that Super

1690
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,560
Smash Brothers Brawl will be released on the virtual console as well.

1691
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,560
Makes sense.

1692
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,280
So we'll see.

1693
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,840
I don't really know if there's much to that.

1694
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:56,640
Apparently there's a rumor from website gameeater.com or gameeater, whatever, that Hillary Clinton

1695
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,120
is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto IV.

1696
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,120
Bullshit.

1697
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,120
No, hold on, hold on.

1698
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,760
It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her, kind

1699
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,880
of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.

1700
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:17,280
Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.

1701
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,720
Why would you want that prostitute?

1702
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,280
That doesn't make sense.

1703
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,240
Whatever, guys, whatever.

1704
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:29,280
Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.

1705
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,400
The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me, and after being killed

1706
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,160
with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.

1707
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,160
That's fucked up.

1708
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,160
That's got to be a lie.

1709
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,160
That would be funny.

1710
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,520
That has some stupid kid's idea of the funny.

1711
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
But you know what?

1712
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,520
Rama in chat at chat.org.trader.com sums up my thoughts perfectly.

1713
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:53,200
Do not want.

1714
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,280
And then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.

1715
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,280
That's it?

1716
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,280
I found something pretty.

1717
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,280
All right, what's that?

1718
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,960
Eurogamer, which is one of the places that I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures

1719
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:12,280
of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out, and Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.

1720
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,840
Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chat room.

1721
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
All right.

1722
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,480
It's very, very pretty, even though they're getting the most awful person in the world

1723
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,440
to play them, but oh well.

1724
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,440
All right.

1725
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,840
Well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so we can wrap up this show.

1726
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,520
Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming to the show.

1727
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,520
We haven't had guests here in forever, even though you guys didn't talk much, but maybe

1728
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,520
it's because we have a mic shortage.

1729
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
I don't know.

1730
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,420
But I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless, and thank you for the pie.

1731
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,420
That was much appreciated.

1732
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,560
Do you have any final thoughts, Sir Nathan?

1733
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,560
No.

1734
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,400
All right, Rice Princess, any final thoughts?

1735
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,400
Yes.

1736
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:53,140
All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?

1737
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,920
My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what

1738
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,080
my computer can actually do.

1739
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,080
Yay.

1740
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,680
An SLI.

1741
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:06,240
My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now

1742
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:11,340
on Justin TV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take

1743
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,040
a couple weeks to work out the bumps.

1744
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,960
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1745
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:23,940
Well, someone in our chat room said the pie is true.

1746
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,940
The pie is true.

1747
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,940
The pie is delicious.

1748
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,400
That's what it really boils down to.

1749
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,960
At the end of Orange Lawn's radio, there will be pie.

1750
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,960
Wow.

1751
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,000
All right, forget it.

1752
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,880
All right, thank you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading and supporting independent

1753
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,880
podcasting.

1754
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,360
We wouldn't be here without you guys because we have no big magazine supporting us or any

1755
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:49,900
big gaming company, so this truly is an independent effort, and we appreciate it.

1756
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,720
If you like what you hear, it's free.

1757
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,520
All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.

1758
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,760
That's how we slowly spread the word.

1759
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,920
If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes

1760
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,960
or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Digg, whatever, or even if you do tell two

1761
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,840
people, you can also leave a five-star review.

1762
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,840
It's okay.

1763
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,720
I want to thank... We had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people

1764
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,360
that put those very kind reviews.

1765
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,080
Really appreciate it.

1766
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,120
Until next time, I'm Rob Roberts.

1767
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,120
That's Dark Soccer.

1768
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:41,440
This is Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
