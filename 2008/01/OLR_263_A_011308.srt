1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models are discontinued in Japan.

2
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:25,085
[SPEAKER_00]: The worlds of Soul Calibur and Star Wars collide, and can Resident Evil be returning to arcades?

3
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:35,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that video game show on the internet.

5
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:42,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:48,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

9
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:50,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Our show's very own bionic woman.

10
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Who hearts pirates, according to her shirt.

12
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.

13
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:56,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I skulls pirates.

14
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means you collect their skulls?

15
00:00:58,737 --> 00:00:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

16
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Like shrunken heads?

17
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Like PvP and Ragnarok, yo.

18
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That means skull fuck.

19
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the other voice you hear over there, the ever-giggly Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was watching Crisis YouTube videos.

21
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to understand, Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.

23
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:25,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's chickens, and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spawned a ton of chickens and vehicles and...

24
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing chickens has been funny ever since The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't kill them, though.

26
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:39,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.

27
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:41,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet, sweet, chickeny vengeance.

28
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:43,426
[SPEAKER_01]: These chickens do not get revenge.

29
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:44,387
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply die.

30
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:46,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we eat them?

31
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:46,608
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

32
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:46,828
[SPEAKER_02]: No fun.

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

34
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:17,755
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to come on the show.

36
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited.

37
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you guys more details.

38
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,171
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.

39
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Person on YouTube.

40
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,952
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be anyone on the face of the earth.

41
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:37,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be.

42
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a wonderful place.

43
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we have that, and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan.

44
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:46,616
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, it's kind of this dull period right now.

45
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of...

46
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Games coming out.

47
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a few.

48
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff.

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, kind of a slow period for games.

50
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:55,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean the news has stopped.

51
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.

52
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

53
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:05,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass, trying to get it to work.

54
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:15,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have Cooking Mama in the collection, in the purse to play, because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again.

55
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,325
[SPEAKER_03]: and to hell with my production.

56
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:31,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.

57
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I didn't know what rebirth was.

58
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night.

59
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.

60
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sort of.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:50,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to start, you start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.

62
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.

64
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:09,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really amazed, so.

65
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Warcraft had a new game plus.

66
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you get to 70.

67
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, you're stuck.

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, hey, I'm at 99.

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do the Time Warp again.

70
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to jump to the left.

71
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:33,826
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is in-game content.

72
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.

73
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:38,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You find a pond, you get experience.

74
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:39,708
[SPEAKER_02]: PvP.

75
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: New Level

76
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:14,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right now, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of.

77
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:23,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I bought a DVI to VGA converter.

78
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing is, the DVI side doesn't fit.

79
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I guess, completely different.

80
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:32,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.

81
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,622
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one that Vandalus gave me.

82
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

83
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:38,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, before he left us.

84
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:39,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Saka

85
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you got your account, me as well, right?

86
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:20,557
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no monthly fee or anything.

87
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:21,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always there to come back.

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this, DarkSakura.

89
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to bring this up now.

90
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message.

91
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.

92
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:33,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

93
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Until the server shut down on March 31st.

94
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:36,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

95
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?

96
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about it with Ranma last night.

97
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.

98
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:50,673
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

99
00:06:54,435 --> 00:07:08,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so... Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on, she's playing PSU.

100
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,462
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on Lost Planet.

101
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:10,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

102
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?

103
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:16,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, it's Julie.

104
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Julie?

105
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:17,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie?

106
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:19,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie's playing Last Planet?

107
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she hung out with us today.

108
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:25,868
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to breakfast and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.

109
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead.

110
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not the right one.

111
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,690
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually bought it for me.

112
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was really nice of her because it was only like $10.

113
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount.

114
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan used his...

115
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray, and I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.

116
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who knows?

117
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:15,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD finishes.

118
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's kind of jumping ship.

119
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's still kind of up there.

120
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:29,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.

121
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.

122
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:33,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very good.

123
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:33,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

124
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:41,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I made an icon for my live journal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.

125
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

126
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:48,247
[SPEAKER_03]: In Greek mythology, Lamia was the queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.

127
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.

128
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,692
[SPEAKER_02]: They should make a video game out of Stardust.

129
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.

130
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:55,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

131
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:56,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

132
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole swords and magic thing.

133
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Music is very Oblivion-ish.

134
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:06,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll link it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with it glowing green.

135
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:07,566
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pull My Finger.

136
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:09,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.

137
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:10,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very proud of it.

138
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:12,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It took like five seconds.

139
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?

140
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:15,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

141
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:16,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

142
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay.

143
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:22,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.

144
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:23,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's horrible.

145
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:25,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate.

146
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:27,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear it.

147
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just... It's all, yay!

148
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:37,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff, then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks!

149
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:42,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though my character's in it, which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.

150
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

151
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.

152
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penis as Magic Pen Gel.

153
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:50,338
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

154
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,299
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is way better.

155
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I played...

156
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,853
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

157
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches in it that make it almost impossible to play.

158
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:22,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I have been unable to beat the game because of these glitches.

159
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:29,441
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your strength mode or whatever.

160
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:34,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't actually be able to be knocked down.

161
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:35,666
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get stuck.

162
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:39,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, some other times, you know, for example, one of the...

163
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:49,656
[SPEAKER_01]: There's supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.

164
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:53,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand and that's it.

165
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,342
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just frozen and nothing ever happens.

166
00:10:56,662 --> 00:11:00,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to constantly restart the game and it's just horrible.

167
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:06,191
[SPEAKER_01]: If that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at all because it was just that bad.

168
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:19,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Even now, I've tried playing it through about 10 different times, starting on saves that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe something will work this time, but it doesn't.

169
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:20,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm about fed up with it.

170
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:26,129
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.

171
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,251
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.

172
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a portable nuke launcher.

173
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they have it at the beginning of the game?

174
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:35,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would have loved to have blown up chickens with that.

175
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to work towards it.

176
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:38,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

177
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I have to cheat really bad.

178
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a chicken cannon.

179
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see, what else did I play?

180
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:47,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's about it.

181
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Saints Row.

182
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,739
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of Earth Defense Force.

183
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Still plugging away at that game.

184
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.

185
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft.

186
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:07,288
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of new games coming out, and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.

187
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So really the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games ever.

188
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Dan was playing a demo of that.

189
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:22,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.

190
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you need is the booth.

191
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:28,238
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still...

192
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.

193
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.

194
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:38,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four minigames in one.

195
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:49,803
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of games in this period were similar to it, because honestly, the setup of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey, the arcade game, which is also made up of four minigames.

196
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:50,783
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX LIVE CO-OP

197
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,252
[SPEAKER_02]: $5 though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and age is worth too much more.

198
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.

199
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.

200
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:22,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be kind of cool.

201
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Discs of Tron was very interesting.

202
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:31,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.

203
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:39,290
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play the entire game.

204
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:46,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that, you know, when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and more difficult each time.

205
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:51,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really, you know, the demo will give you a really good idea of what the game's all about.

206
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that.

207
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:56,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

208
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:25,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.

209
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,448
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of bullets everywhere.

210
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,269
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always fun.

211
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can pick up these... You can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking up these different power-ups, and you can have, like, lasers or spreading bullets and things of that sort.

212
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:44,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was.

213
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Aegis Wing, yeah.

214
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.

215
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll give that... Omega 5's $10, but...

216
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:55,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely reminds me of a heyday arcade Japanese-influenced shooter, so definitely check it out.

217
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo on that one's not bad either.

218
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,000
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.

219
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You do one mini-boss fight, but it's pretty cool.

220
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:12,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's always our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and rostiout.com.

221
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite the smartass in our chatroom.

222
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,122
[SPEAKER_02]: The official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes and ways.

223
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:18,642
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

224
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:21,664
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.

225
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:22,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.

226
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about first-person shooters.

227
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:29,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know.

228
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,990
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too.

229
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.

230
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you have it.

231
00:15:41,342 --> 00:16:02,331
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's really going to do it for our gaming week so now we're going to move on into some housekeeping of which we don't have a whole lot to share I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished so if you were feeling there's not enough of the old school classics and music from video games and such you're going to love the new rotation it's

232
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

233
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing is that there's a new show.

234
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:28,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a live show or a hosted show.

235
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a music show.

236
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But it airs every day from noon to 1230.

237
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's every day, Monday through Sunday.

238
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:35,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day.

239
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Retro Lunch.

240
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.

241
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:41,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.

242
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:42,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't overdo it.

243
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:45,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.

244
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

245
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:48,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, lots of fun.

246
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:57,821
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station right now and try to guess.

247
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:58,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do that.

248
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fun.

249
00:16:59,543 --> 00:16:59,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

250
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:00,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

251
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:06,407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care of.

252
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:16,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody everywhere wants to know how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?

253
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:19,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know.

254
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:21,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the numbers, I don't know.

255
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:46,088
[SPEAKER_01]: To be exact, actually, because that's just an estimate, 1,300, I'm sorry, 132,199 copies sold so far.

256
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:46,349
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

257
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many does that mean we have left to go?

258
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,410
[SPEAKER_01]: About 870,000.

259
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

260
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:48,831
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

261
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:49,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to work.

262
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:10,140
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of Judgment could... If Eye of Judgment was actually... Because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece of shit.

263
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program.

264
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki says there's no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies.

265
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:25,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it does, he will don a Tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby Blackwolf in a match.

266
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,955
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.

267
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:28,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it on his show.

268
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:29,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my mistake.

269
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:29,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually 150,000.

270
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:30,395
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 million?

271
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:30,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.

272
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:32,036
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.

273
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:33,196
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.

274
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 million, that'd be unheard of.

275
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:37,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.

276
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize the 132,199 is just U.S.,

277
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:53,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is pretty impressive, actually, that the U.S.

278
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:54,391
[SPEAKER_01]: has actually sold them any copies.

279
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:55,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan, not so much.

280
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:57,553
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they're only up to 19,384.

281
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:02,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So no love in Japan for that stuff, but the U.S.

282
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:04,518
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps on chugging.

283
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is the game out in Europe yet?

284
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:08,520
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?

285
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.

286
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: According to this... That's not Europe, though.

287
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

288
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

289
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,274
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not out in Europe yet.

290
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, so Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.

291
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chatroom and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.

292
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:36,892
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon, apparently.

293
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:37,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

294
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:38,894
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it cheap.

295
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted a link in the chatroom where you can...

296
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:42,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Play along at home.

297
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:50,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, play along at home, and we'll probably post it in a thread or something in our forums so they can watch the count.

298
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show.

299
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,355
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can do it every few months or so.

300
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:56,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when it crosses milestones.

301
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get to 200,000, we'll mention it again, a quarter million, and then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows?

302
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:07,807
[SPEAKER_01]: If we keep going... I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but...

303
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:08,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

304
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's other stories we're getting into.

305
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:12,037
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

306
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:13,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall we get into these stories?

307
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall get into these stories.

308
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:24,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.

309
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:25,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more cards.

310
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,883
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's two of them.

311
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:36,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, the Machine Gods Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th.

312
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:45,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And, let's see here, there's also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in the summer.

313
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,889
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are, they said downloads, though.

314
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:51,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not really new cards, though.

315
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.

316
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this affect the bet?

317
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it affects anything because it's not actually selling anything.

318
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:02,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Download content does not count.

319
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:10,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?

320
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:19,852
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an expansion disc that comes, including cards obviously, because I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.

321
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now...

322
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:25,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's even kind of being a little generous because... It's very generous.

323
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I don't know.

324
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:29,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want to wear that Tingle outfit a little bit.

325
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.

326
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It will never sell one million units.

327
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:35,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever.

328
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:36,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

329
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with expansions that are retail.

330
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail Expansions

331
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:13,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.

332
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,033
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cheating.

333
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,574
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really a game.

334
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:17,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't count, you know, the download content.

335
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,596
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, at least we have the bet clarified.

336
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:23,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover U.S.

337
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,179
[SPEAKER_02]: sales.

338
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.

339
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:32,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it also was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for eternity, so...

340
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:33,676
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

341
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession behind us.

342
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be a good point.

343
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:39,199
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

344
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to let this joke die.

345
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,601
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not wearing it.

346
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:42,081
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

347
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:44,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very confident.

348
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:46,824
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.

349
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:52,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very confident that this will never sell a million units because it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

350
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Until they come out with something else that's even more retarded.

351
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:56,490
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

352
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,530
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now it's pretty retarded.

353
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:00,392
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

354
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:04,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you... Now, a good point brought up in chat here.

355
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:07,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly buying Eye of Judgment.

356
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?

357
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:10,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

358
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play card games.

359
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:12,143
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

360
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:13,383
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a no.

361
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:13,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say no.

362
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:23,765
[SPEAKER_01]: For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we could burn it on the show anyways.

363
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:26,706
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, nah, I'm not doing that.

364
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,546
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just use your credit and get something good.

365
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:31,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Why waste it?

366
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight is in chat.

367
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,923
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Dark Knight says get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the suit.

368
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,267
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not going to make me dress up.

369
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:41,589
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid.

370
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,142
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

371
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 gigabyte model of course is 40 gigabytes whereas the other one was a little smaller and a little larger but the other big change oh yeah it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility which obviously makes it a lot cheaper to produce so that's where they're headed in Japan obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards compatibility in Europe well shit they never really had it but at least our main model is 80 gigabytes and

372
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

373
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Drive!

374
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I used mine when my computer was starting to die.

375
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:06,851
[SPEAKER_03]: When my Vio was, the Franken-Vio, I should call it, was about to go.

376
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for backing up stuff.

377
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:11,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.

378
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: For porn.

379
00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:15,118
[SPEAKER_03]: For Doctor Who episodes.

380
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,275
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:48,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be a lot of things.

382
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:49,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

383
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.

384
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they need another color for a video game system.

385
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:00,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Why mint green?

386
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at the DS.

387
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for the DS.

388
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not the PSP?

389
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envy or something.

390
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Why mint green of all colors?

391
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:11,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

392
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:12,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not, you know...

393
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink and Red for Valentine's Day.

394
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:28,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Mint Green Olive Garden Mint

395
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually much paler than that.

396
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Made good on the promise.

397
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:57,882
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.

398
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:03,245
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Olive Garden and I had... What did I have?

399
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Seafood Alfredo.

400
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:04,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

401
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:06,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of never-ending breadsticks.

402
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:07,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

403
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:08,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really good meatball soup.

404
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

405
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:09,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

406
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:10,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

407
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:12,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Games, right?

408
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:13,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Games.

409
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

410
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:22,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.

411
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:23,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

412
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,503
[SPEAKER_01]: People are wondering why not the original PSP.

413
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:26,903
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?

414
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:33,088
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more RAM in it.

415
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:42,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, it is the only system able to handle Skype, apparently.

416
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:47,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing as Skype.

417
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:50,960
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I know of one that they're working on right now.

418
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:53,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well.

419
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,901
[SPEAKER_01]: No Skype for you.

420
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.

421
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.

422
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:03,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I mean, who am I really going to call on Skype?

423
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:08,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.

424
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:10,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very inconvenient anyways.

425
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:14,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, you have to have, you know, I think you have to buy Skype for this.

426
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's going to be free.

427
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be free to use, but I think you have to buy the software for it.

428
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,714
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you've done that,

429
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:23,932
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So PSPs are kind of mini-computers at this point.

431
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:59,047
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.

432
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not.

433
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.

434
00:29:06,423 --> 00:29:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3, is that the cross-media bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.

435
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the game, but that was something that the developers had to do.

436
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar to show up within a game.

437
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:44,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.

438
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.

439
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:54,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.

440
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there was no news at CES.

441
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,054
[SPEAKER_02]: They instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.

442
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon is the magic word, isn't it?

443
00:30:07,814 --> 00:30:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

444
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:18,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a little confirmation that should make some people happy and that is about LittleBigPlanet.

445
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:20,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out in September.

446
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,078
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what Sony's saying.

447
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:23,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's

448
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,916
[SPEAKER_03]: September and not September X date.

449
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:30,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's September, which is sometime.

450
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?

451
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:33,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

452
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:41,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is strange because Consumer Electronics Show, like it seems like we're getting slightly more gaming news out of CES this year.

453
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:44,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that word slightly because usually CES, not for games.

454
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a game show.

455
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kitchenware and 150,000 foot TVs and the George Foreman grilling machine.

456
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And robots to waltz with.

457
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:58,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

458
00:30:58,644 --> 00:30:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that stuff.

459
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:01,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show.

460
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:01,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see a lot of games.

461
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:03,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like this year...

462
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:07,989
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit more gaming news.

463
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying we never got game news out of CES.

464
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we got a little more this year.

465
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:18,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be or what the heck that's about.

466
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:20,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just thought that was interesting.

467
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not reading too much into that.

468
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was interesting.

469
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:24,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

470
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:25,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

471
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And then freaking Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft keynote.

472
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:32,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was kind of...

473
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:34,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

474
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:39,371
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlanet's coming out in September.

475
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?

476
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,387
[SPEAKER_01]: and now it's like, oh, I'm sorry.

477
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:45,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Sony delay?

478
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:46,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't say.

479
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's crazy.

480
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out?

481
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:58,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, they keep advertising this shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid 4, you know, all these games that are out now.

482
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games are out yet and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy a PlayStation 3.

483
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:07,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff will be coming someday.

484
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:11,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.

485
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:12,915
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem, though.

486
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:18,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they take their time on getting the product out, it's still just average.

487
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:20,620
[SPEAKER_01]: They can delay it all they want.

488
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,800
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still be kind of eh.

489
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree to an extent.

490
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think they should never have launched the damn console when they did.

491
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:34,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should have just sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.

492
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:35,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just like LittleBigPlanet.

493
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it's something that's pretty ambitious, but...

494
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking show this shit off.

495
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, oh, it's coming out this fall.

496
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:44,716
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get everybody excited.

497
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:46,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall.

498
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:47,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out this spring.

499
00:32:48,277 --> 00:32:50,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, okay, great, spring comes along.

500
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring.

501
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:53,078
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out in September.

502
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,919
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's... Okay.

503
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:56,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take them forever.

504
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuda in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com brings up a good point.

505
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't Super Smash Bros.

506
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:04,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?

507
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Sony the only bad guys here?

508
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:07,682
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not.

509
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:08,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

510
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:09,171
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

511
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:30,579
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3, PS4, PS5

512
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,089
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, what else is Sony teasing for us?

513
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:08,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games on the system.

514
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:12,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun.

515
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:14,437
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite games on the system.

516
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the few that I still own because I love it so much.

517
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60-player online deathmatches, which is fantastic.

518
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:25,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking crazy.

519
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight-player co-op and two campaigns.

520
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:36,822
[SPEAKER_01]: One which is supposed to be an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just standard single-player campaign.

521
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,363
[SPEAKER_02]: 60-player multiplayer matches.

522
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:41,385
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.

523
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:49,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48-player multiplayer deathmatches.

524
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's not so bad.

525
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to remember that

526
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:54,369
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

527
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:24,131
[SPEAKER_02]: and there should be something where if somebody is completely being a jerk then everybody can target that person and obliterate them to smithereens and they lose the right to speak.

528
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:25,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.

529
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Patent pending.

530
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:31,713
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I own all the rights to it and if you try to put this in your game I'll sue you for a million dollars.

531
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:36,355
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more information though on Resistance 2 it's supposed to be in the new issue of Game Informer.

532
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:38,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

533
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier how it's becoming more and more like a computer.

534
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:45,273
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

535
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,137
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:35,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're going to want to have this keyboard for in 2009.

537
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:40,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.

538
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a time thing.

539
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:42,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you wait.

540
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:43,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still lame.

541
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:46,823
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.

542
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:47,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wait?

543
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:51,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then if you wait, then you put this thing out.

544
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:54,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody buys it because there's nothing to use it for.

545
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first place?

546
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.

547
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's stupid.

548
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna sell anyways if it's AIM.

549
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:04,658
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid.

550
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, you know what?

551
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:12,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost blame, that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the GameCube.

552
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:13,237
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they call it?

553
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.

554
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,784
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody could get into at the time.

555
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did those things end up?

556
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:23,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Bargain bins.

557
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:26,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them are out there.

558
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:28,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of like a damning cycle.

559
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:30,533
[SPEAKER_02]: What should have happened is that at that time...

560
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:37,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo should have come out and said, we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.

561
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:43,903
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero is going to support the... How awesome would F-Zero GX have been if it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?

562
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:46,184
[SPEAKER_02]: A completely different kind of game than PSO.

563
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:49,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see Nintendo putting an online game...

564
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:54,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.

565
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:56,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.

566
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:03,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking off that.

567
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online thing.

568
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:17,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger for the PSP.

569
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,476
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already got Java stuff that works...

570
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:20,804
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

571
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Vibribin Vibribin

572
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:02,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but hey, VibRibbon's great.

573
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:16,062
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what VibRibbon is, it's a vector animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.

574
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:17,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some mood-setting music.

575
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:22,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

576
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It had, I think, eight tracks or something.

577
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:27,212
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of them built into the game.

578
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:33,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.

579
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:40,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that you play the game is you start the game and you can actually put in your own CDs.

580
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:46,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And we tried to do it to... CD-R music, like Max 300 and stuff.

581
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we tried to do it to 151.

582
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania, yeah.

583
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300.

584
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,304
[SPEAKER_03]: and we tried to pick as many fast and retarded stuff as we could and did it end up being some solitary song that was really hard instead?

585
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:04,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Colors.

586
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, designing your own levels with your own music, but it was kind of cool nevertheless.

587
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:21,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.

588
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:22,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.

589
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.

590
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope it comes out.

591
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:30,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it over here though.

592
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,644
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 has a brilliant idea.

593
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play that game with Dragon Force now.

594
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I could do?

595
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

596
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do that because I have Vib Ribbon.

597
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:43,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a copy of Vib Ribbon sitting at Network Video.

598
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:44,412
[SPEAKER_03]: May you rest in peace.

599
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need to do for our little piece.

600
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:50,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force.

601
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,738
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make that happen with Vib Ribbon.

602
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to dust off your copy because we're going to be doing that.

603
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it.

604
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:54,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

605
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:01,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up the ribbon for $40 and I got an original and I've never regretted it.

606
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

607
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?

608
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:07,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

609
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucka.

610
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I could just pop it in my PS2.

611
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:16,270
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet.

612
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:23,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We found the cartridge and our Super Nintendo so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing.

613
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:23,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

614
00:41:24,572 --> 00:41:24,832
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

615
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:30,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff not online, but stuff you can actually walk into a store and buy.

616
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:31,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the U.S.

617
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:37,271
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy, most of which the latter.

618
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Including kids sports, ice hockey for the Wii.

619
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:46,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet another game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good.

620
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Flat out head-on on the PSP, that's a flat out 2 port, so that should be pretty fun.

621
00:41:54,772 --> 00:42:21,564
[SPEAKER_01]: History Channel Lost Worlds on the PC Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii Which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails samurai game Let's see, Furu Furu Park on the Wii Only $20, a bunch of little mini-games by Majesco Let's see, Miami Knights Singles in the City for the DS I don't know if it's any better than Sprung, but I guess we'll have to see

622
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:49,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike64 and it's kind of the same thing, it's bikes with rockets on them and then the Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and the Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to $30 and

623
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, let's see here.

624
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:59,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle.

625
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:01,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming out as well.

626
00:43:02,424 --> 00:43:03,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough pirate games.

627
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:03,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough.

628
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:07,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, though, there is something kind of funny that's coming out next week.

629
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Also happens to be by Destiny Air, though.

630
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:12,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Kawasaki Jet Ski.

631
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:17,868
[SPEAKER_01]: This one looks almost identical to Wave Race 64.

632
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:19,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be pretty cool.

633
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:21,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

634
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:43,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th.

635
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sonic Riders Shooting Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

636
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:05,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking at the patient with a knife?

637
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:06,362
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

638
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:08,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007.

639
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:12,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not...

640
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:13,348
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

641
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:43,280
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?

642
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, I fucked up.

643
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week.

644
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:48,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

645
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:50,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

646
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:56,112
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star, which is also released next week.

647
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this week you can get a game called School Days.

648
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: School Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kind of arm in arm like they're BFFs.

649
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:32,375
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're wearing schoolgirl uniforms so you know this will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS a game called From the Abyss makes its way to the Nintendo DS and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS oh I guess it is there's the box art and everything Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS I always thought that was a Wii only game go figure

650
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan.

651
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:39,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing.

652
00:45:40,962 --> 00:45:41,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing for the PSP.

653
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have a price reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week.

654
00:45:44,903 --> 00:45:45,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

655
00:45:45,803 --> 00:45:47,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, your Japanese release dates.

656
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:52,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe.

657
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Balls of Fury.

658
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:56,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

659
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:58,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off a movie that didn't do very well.

660
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:17,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Knight's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure.

661
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

662
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:28,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I just say save your money, well, get Knights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles later that month.

663
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:36,119
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I will never understand our chat room and the way they think sometimes because you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?

664
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So SSJ100 Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup dating sim for DS.

665
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:44,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Or now, you know, two girls, one cup is now 2007.

666
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:51,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you have, you know, because obviously it's something much more hardcore came out apparently recently.

667
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And Corey31 suggests that four girls finger paint would make a good DS Wii game.

668
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:00,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.

669
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:02,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta keep up on the internet.

670
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:02,990
[SPEAKER_02]: You all are sick.

671
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

672
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better.

673
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:08,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

674
00:47:08,712 --> 00:47:09,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Date Dragon Force, the game.

675
00:47:09,752 --> 00:47:10,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want?

676
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:14,053
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.

677
00:47:14,213 --> 00:47:14,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

678
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:17,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.

679
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:17,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

680
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:22,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.

681
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:23,276
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

682
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:26,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was announced this week that

683
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:28,255
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

684
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:49,315
[SPEAKER_01]: You happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.

685
00:47:49,795 --> 00:47:52,657
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.

686
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.

687
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Cue all the Xbox fans going, No!

688
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:02,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can get them both.

689
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:03,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

690
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

691
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

692
00:48:04,305 --> 00:48:05,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you buy them both?

693
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,047
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly why they did this shit.

694
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:08,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That was sarcasm, by the way.

695
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:09,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank God.

696
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:11,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to come over there and beat you.

697
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to get the PS3 version.

698
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:13,031
[SPEAKER_02]: For Vader?

699
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:13,412
[SPEAKER_02]: For Vader.

700
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

701
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:20,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off of Soul Calibur 4.

702
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,199
[SPEAKER_03]: They went back and based it off of Soul Calibur 2.

703
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,641
[SPEAKER_03]: A balanced version.

704
00:48:25,941 --> 00:48:30,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?

705
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:33,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur 2.

706
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:38,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I don't have a problem with Link not being on the PlayStation because that doesn't make any sense.

707
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:43,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a PlayStation or something like that?

708
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:44,871
[SPEAKER_01]: This...

709
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:46,479
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

710
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!

711
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did that happen in the first place?

712
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,273
[SPEAKER_02]: That is stupid.

713
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:26,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts because they have a crazy looking Yoda.

714
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,456
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks stupid.

715
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:31,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at the screenshots of like Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever.

716
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:33,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going like, I just rolled my eyes.

717
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this looks dumb.

718
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:37,823
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.

719
00:49:37,883 --> 00:49:38,403
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

720
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:40,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hear what their original intent was?

721
00:49:41,085 --> 00:49:46,709
[SPEAKER_01]: The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fighting characters.

722
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:48,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

723
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to ruin his own franchise.

724
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:52,017
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next, Klonoa?

725
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Planoa would be awesome, though.

726
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw you!

727
00:49:58,392 --> 00:50:02,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like... You know, Planoa is one of my favorite games ever.

728
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.

729
00:50:05,496 --> 00:50:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cool to have Link in it.

730
00:50:07,997 --> 00:50:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Link made sense.

731
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Link, also a swordsy and, you know, swords and sorcery type of character.

732
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Hahachi?

733
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I can... We'll let that one slide.

734
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

735
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:21,523
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has he had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?

736
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:25,097
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a Soul Calibur character forever!

737
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:26,918
[SPEAKER_02]: At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.

738
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,141
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually has a diaper.

739
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,782
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what they're doing?

740
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:36,325
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking this over like they did with Tekken, where they just start putting all this ridiculous shit in there.

741
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears.

742
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:41,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken has always been that way, though.

743
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken, because they can.

744
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb, too.

745
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I don't know.

746
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:53,326
[SPEAKER_02]: A panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.

747
00:50:53,506 --> 00:51:00,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in... Oh, my God.

748
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:02,674
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?

749
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:03,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

750
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:03,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought.

751
00:51:04,776 --> 00:51:09,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And Devil and Angel and everybody, and Gold Banjo's his secret character, your mom.

752
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:12,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night, Devil Jin was awesome, by the way.

753
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:15,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not ever...

754
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop on Devil Jam.

755
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before the chatroom jumps, I know there already was one back on the PlayStation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.

756
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:49,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you make a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good game now.

757
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

758
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.

759
00:51:53,662 --> 00:51:55,123
[SPEAKER_02]: There were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?

760
00:51:55,223 --> 00:51:57,465
[SPEAKER_02]: These games have been coming out forever.

761
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:05,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know, like using the Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.

762
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be all kinds of awesome.

763
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.

764
00:52:10,896 --> 00:52:12,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of awesome, because I love Soul Calibur.

765
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in my live journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really like other fighting games.

766
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

767
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.

768
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Gon from Tekken 3.

769
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:29,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.

770
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:32,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.

771
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:39,471
[SPEAKER_02]: God, oh, and you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2 is there's the crappy spin-off games happening too, like the Legends game.

772
00:52:40,112 --> 00:52:40,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um...

773
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:42,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Death by playing this game.

774
00:53:06,178 --> 00:53:07,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.

775
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.

776
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:14,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game with massive boobage, and this game will move...

777
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: A zillion copies on the first day.

778
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you wait.

779
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark my words.

780
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:48,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Teras Kasi.

781
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it to slumber in its grave.

782
00:53:51,384 --> 00:53:52,644
[SPEAKER_02]: No zombie apocalypse.

783
00:53:56,918 --> 00:54:01,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

784
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:02,064
[SPEAKER_02]: They will cut through them.

785
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,926
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.

786
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read that the way it should have been read.

788
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

789
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

790
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:15,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seriously.

791
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:20,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to apply real world physics?

792
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:24,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I even calling the Star Wars universe real world physics?

793
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:26,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just say Jedi physics?

794
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,214
[SPEAKER_01]: No, real world physics.

795
00:54:28,354 --> 00:54:28,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

796
00:54:29,174 --> 00:54:30,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Jedi physics.

797
00:54:30,795 --> 00:54:33,015
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make me even more retarded.

798
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:34,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, who cares?

799
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:36,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fucking game.

800
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:39,897
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.

801
00:54:40,698 --> 00:54:41,578
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do need, though...

802
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to get some Star Trek characters.

803
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see Kirk.

804
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:45,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

805
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirk versus Picard.

806
00:54:46,222 --> 00:54:47,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's settle this shit right now.

807
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:49,065
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be funny.

808
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:50,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see that.

809
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.

810
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:55,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done up like one of those motivational posters.

811
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:58,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a picture of Kirk just grinning.

812
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:01,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.

813
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:05,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it.

814
00:55:06,022 --> 00:55:11,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Kirk, I want to see Adam West playing Adam West and, you know, just weird shit like that.

815
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:12,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki Fighter 2008?

816
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:13,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

817
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:14,686
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

818
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:16,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

819
00:55:18,407 --> 00:55:22,368
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

820
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, let me re-read that.

821
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,211
[SPEAKER_02]: The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

822
00:55:31,553 --> 00:55:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Please let's change the topic, pretty please.

823
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:35,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my turn, it sure is.

824
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft...

825
00:55:37,244 --> 00:55:38,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility

826
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible, but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.

827
00:56:11,427 --> 00:56:16,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy new games, or better yet, don't sell off your old system.

828
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:17,055
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

829
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:18,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem solved.

830
00:56:18,377 --> 00:56:20,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah.

831
00:56:21,496 --> 00:56:32,107
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially in light of now that they've launched this download Xbox Originals thing where they can charge more money for games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.

832
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:35,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they do an update, and watch this, this is what they'll do.

833
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:38,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.

834
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:41,956
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll only update it to do a download game or something.

835
00:56:42,256 --> 00:56:49,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat.

836
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:56,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, that's really the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games because, you know, they're a good workout, right?

837
00:56:57,439 --> 00:57:00,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?

838
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Diminishing Returns

839
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:19,685
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

840
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,050
[SPEAKER_01]: are probably pretty damn cheap right now.

841
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds and they're like an eyesore in my living room.

842
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.

843
00:57:52,312 --> 00:57:54,012
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still have an original Xbox.

844
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:55,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and you know where it is?

845
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:56,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in that drawer right there.

846
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The closed drawer right there.

847
00:57:57,973 --> 00:58:01,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and how often do you play Xbox games?

848
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible.

849
00:58:05,974 --> 00:58:06,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not.

850
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:08,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just Konami.

851
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:09,055
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like you.

852
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: We sometimes break out our old stuff.

853
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:14,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're crazy.

854
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:16,757
[SPEAKER_02]: You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.

855
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:18,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?

856
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:18,477
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

857
00:58:18,797 --> 00:58:21,198
[SPEAKER_03]: The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.

858
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

859
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because.

860
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.

861
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:33,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin today.

862
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:34,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Dust off the Genesis.

863
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:34,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it out.

864
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:36,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, we do that.

865
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:39,540
[SPEAKER_03]: CES Force Feedback Suit by TN Games

866
00:58:59,213 --> 00:59:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: because it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets punched in the chest you'll feel it as just pressure and it's meant for it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out so

867
00:59:31,126 --> 00:59:43,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for a light hit or blow air past you if something misses you.

868
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:50,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more for complete... I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why anyone would want one.

869
00:59:51,893 --> 00:59:53,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.

870
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:58,515
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an airzooka while I play a game.

871
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw the airzooka, I'll just have a can.

872
01:00:01,524 --> 01:00:06,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have those, I don't remember, like, ambient effects or something like that.

873
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:11,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.

874
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:17,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.

875
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:22,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on what's in the game.

876
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:26,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm laughing at Rob with two Bs in the chat room.

877
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,000
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, how does it play with Rez?

878
01:00:28,643 --> 01:00:29,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

879
01:00:29,483 --> 01:00:30,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be funny.

880
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:30,863
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be kind of fun.

881
01:00:34,204 --> 01:00:34,664
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

882
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:36,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's keep moving.

883
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:38,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.

884
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:47,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.

885
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:48,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

886
01:00:49,127 --> 01:00:51,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now you're not off to a good start.

887
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:54,047
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean, most reliable?

888
01:00:55,088 --> 01:00:55,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

889
01:00:56,168 --> 01:00:57,088
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically says...

890
01:00:58,294 --> 01:01:02,075
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.

891
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:05,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.

892
01:01:05,755 --> 01:01:07,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.

893
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Does most reliable mean like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?

894
01:01:17,197 --> 01:01:17,577
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

895
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how they can claim that even... I understand that they want to be the most reliable, but I want to be rich in the

896
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:33,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable, so I don't know.

897
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well,

898
01:01:37,016 --> 01:01:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox Originals will make its way to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

899
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Takedown.

900
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:48,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.

901
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries in the long-running Burnout series.

902
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout Paradise or anything like that, but...

903
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:06,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th to the Xbox 360 consoles, the downloadable original.

904
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:10,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about $14.99.

905
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:16,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360.

906
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:20,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?

907
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:24,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Burnout 3, I liked it better than Revenge anyway.

908
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:26,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommend it if you don't have it.

909
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:28,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Take Down is a good game.

910
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:29,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also recommend it.

911
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:32,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays well on the backwards compatibility and all that good stuff.

912
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:43,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer that got pooped on?

913
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:45,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy.

914
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.

915
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened... Oh, yeah, I know what happened.

916
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else left GameSpot, too, because of that, earlier this week.

917
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked...

918
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:58,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Gershman as why he was leaving.

919
01:02:58,557 --> 01:02:59,437
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny though?

920
01:02:59,457 --> 01:03:02,659
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been like some other independent reviewers also leaving.

921
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:07,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, I don't care what you're trying to like, you know, be all noble and stuff.

922
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have done it before you.

923
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:09,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

924
01:03:09,963 --> 01:03:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the game in question, Kane and Lynch, Dead Men, sold a million copies.

925
01:03:16,646 --> 01:03:24,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind of stuff on the internet.

926
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably helped.

927
01:03:26,443 --> 01:03:28,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what the drama's about.

928
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:33,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.

929
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:35,947
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as bad press.

930
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.

931
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.

932
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:42,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki made a really big funny.

933
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.

934
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

935
01:03:47,672 --> 01:03:47,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

936
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:53,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think parents just bought this game for their kids.

937
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, you really shouldn't buy this game for your kids.

938
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas tree, but quite a few people, apparently.

939
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:01,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure kids have it because their parents don't care.

940
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:06,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Billy wants King Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for him.

941
01:04:07,728 --> 01:04:10,029
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this M mean on the front of the package?

942
01:04:10,329 --> 01:04:12,550
[SPEAKER_00]: M means it's... Must have.

943
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:15,112
[SPEAKER_00]: It's magnificent.

944
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:16,913
[SPEAKER_00]: M for magnificent, okay.

945
01:04:19,537 --> 01:04:29,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess I don't know why they're doing it, but they did.

946
01:04:29,826 --> 01:04:36,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, RezHD will be supporting... I'm sorry, this is too good.

947
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:38,654
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, oh, M is for minors.

948
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Minors?

949
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:41,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.

950
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:42,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead.

951
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:48,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rez HD is going to be supporting trans-vibration in the form of your other controllers.

952
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:52,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So one person can play and three other people can be pleasured.

953
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:52,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

954
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:59,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers.

955
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:01,496
[SPEAKER_02]: One to play the game, three in your pants.

956
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:04,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they support just the Rez trans-vibrator?

957
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:08,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a USB device, and if they built in the driver for it...

958
01:05:10,396 --> 01:05:10,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they?

959
01:05:10,956 --> 01:05:12,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that would be kind of cool.

960
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:23,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so they're going to spend money to engineer this whole stupid thing on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans vibrator.

961
01:05:23,959 --> 01:05:25,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?

962
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually don't.

963
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,321
[SPEAKER_02]: See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one.

964
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:31,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now.

965
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:33,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking for one.

966
01:05:35,587 --> 01:05:37,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And cue the emails of everybody who has one.

967
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,431
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay, though.

968
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:44,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone will just reverse engineer a trans-vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that.

969
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like a dildo or something like that.

970
01:05:47,305 --> 01:06:12,807
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week during listless remember how we were doing the listless and it was the gadgets we most want to see at CES remember the Foreman grill that grills the entire cow one we had the holodeck in there remember SSJ100 Matt his entire list got eliminated and his list was gone one of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator

971
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:13,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we don't need it.

972
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.

973
01:06:15,991 --> 01:06:26,177
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually announced, in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now... I don't know why you would need the trans-vibrator anyways.

974
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:32,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird, but... Well, congratulations, SSJ100Matt, for being correct.

975
01:06:33,361 --> 01:06:41,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun, though, to put the controller on stuff that rattles, like my coffee table and stuff like that, so it'll be really loud and annoying.

976
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure your wife will love that.

977
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:48,750
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

978
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.

979
01:06:58,755 --> 01:06:59,155
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

980
01:06:59,235 --> 01:07:03,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic video game of the week brought to us by DarkSakura.

981
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what game have you picked for the masses this week?

982
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,680
[SPEAKER_03]: The game of the week is Bongaio.

983
01:07:10,567 --> 01:07:14,829
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure game on top of that which makes it even more awesome.

984
01:07:15,249 --> 01:07:17,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Two treasure games in a row.

985
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:18,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha.

986
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:19,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do that.

987
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:20,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I can.

988
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:28,635
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan and it has come out on the Dreamcast.

989
01:07:30,095 --> 01:07:36,898
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played a bunch of it.

990
01:07:36,978 --> 01:07:38,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really crazy because like

991
01:07:39,324 --> 01:07:47,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You go around and, well, actually I think it's kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version was a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.

992
01:07:47,888 --> 01:07:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

993
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:51,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!

994
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:58,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can...

995
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Do like a bajillion shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.

996
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:11,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that the maximum number of bullets you personally can shoot out at one time is like 400, I think.

997
01:08:12,536 --> 01:08:16,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small.

998
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,422
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you think about everything else that's going on in the game...

999
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense, you get a lot of action going on at one time.

1000
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:31,608
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Dreamcast, it makes you change this from the Nintendo 64 version.

1001
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:43,477
[SPEAKER_03]: You have sort of an explosion counter instead of the combo system, and you don't have a shot that you can device up with the Nintendo 64 version.

1002
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Your special attacks are based on...

1003
01:08:49,451 --> 01:08:51,772
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of incoming fire.

1004
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:53,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to charge for it.

1005
01:08:53,392 --> 01:08:56,413
[SPEAKER_03]: The more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.

1006
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:03,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, also all the characters were equalized as far as their power is concerned.

1007
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:05,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There's additional bosses.

1008
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:09,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Two new enemies, which are a flamethrower and a giant egg.

1009
01:09:09,055 --> 01:09:12,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little things, you know, graphical changes.

1010
01:09:14,256 --> 01:09:17,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a sequel that came out, which was...

1011
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,502
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:53,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have actually once played Nintendo 64, but there are some differences.

1013
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:56,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think Nintendo 64 is a lot more balanced.

1014
01:09:56,736 --> 01:09:57,056
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1015
01:09:57,677 --> 01:10:00,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bungaio.

1016
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:01,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1017
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:02,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Play it.

1018
01:10:03,237 --> 01:10:07,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio this week.

1019
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:09,883

1020
01:10:09,903 --> 01:10:13,906

1021
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:17,129

[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about Bionic Commando possibly coming to a Nintendo system as well.

1023
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:27,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And a very cool feature for Disney World travelers that could be coming to the DS very soon.
