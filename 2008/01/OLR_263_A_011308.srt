00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models have discontinued in Japan.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The worlds of Soulcalibur and Star Wars collide, and could Resident Evil be returning to arcades?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that video game show on the internet dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Our show's very own Bionic Woman.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who hearts pirates according to her shirt, or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have skulls pirates.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So that means you collect their skulls?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Like shrunken heads?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Like PVP and Ragnarok, yo.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That means skull fuck.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And of course the other voice you hear over there, the ever giggly tech master Loki.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sorry, I was watching Crysis YouTube videos.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I see.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Because you have to understand Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, there's chickens and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spotted a ton of chickens and vehicles and blowing them up and that's hilarious. I don't know.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Killing chickens has been funny ever since like the Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You didn't kill them though. They just, you picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sweet, sweet chicken-y vengeance.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
These chickens do not get revenge. They simply die.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Can we eat them?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, that was my next question. Can you eat them?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No fun.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right, well anyway, it's just the three of us tonight. We haven't had a guest in a long time. I think everybody locally hates our show suddenly.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Doesn't want to come visit anymore.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're listening to us.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There's some that are listening. No.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We'll get some more. I think the rain and the weather lately has been keeping people indoors and of course there was like the holidays.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, who wants to come do a show on Christmas, right?

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But anyhow, hopefully we'll have some more familiar faces and new faces as well.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've been talking to somebody locally that's going to come on a future show. I'll give you more details about that in the future, but I'm very excited about it.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's somebody I found on YouTube. That's all I'll say. Who happens to live here locally is going to come on the show.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'm very excited. I'll give you guys more details. This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Person on YouTube. That could be anyone on the face of the earth.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That could be. I mean, it's a wonderful place.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But anyway, we have that and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan, but of course it's kind of a dull period right now.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's not a lot of games coming out. I think there's a few. Of course there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff, but otherwise kind of a slow period for games.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But that doesn't mean the news has stopped, and we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass trying to get it to work.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I now have Cooking Mama in the collection in the purse to play because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again and to hell with my production.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now, I didn't know what rebirth was. You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night, and the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you have to start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've been really amazed, so, oh well.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I wish Warcraft had a New Game Plus.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, you get to 70. Ha ha, you're stuck.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm like, hey, I'm at 99. Let's do the Time Warp again.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's just to jump to the left.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is endgame content.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like, there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You find a pond, you get experience.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
PvP.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You find a rock, you get experience.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You don't get experience for discoveries at level 70 because there is no more experience.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, no, but I mean, for other stuff, when you're getting there, it's like, you, you, it's like, what was that, Eddie, is your thing, you have crossed the road, champagne!

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's kind of what it is, exactly.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But it's kind of cool because sometimes you gain levels when exploring.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think I hit like level, one of the higher ones, like 68 or 69 exploring, and it was like vroom, new level.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, right now I'm, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of, and I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I brought a DVI to VGA converter.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thing is the DVI side doesn't fit.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's, I guess, completely different.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the one that Vandalus gave me.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, nice.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, before he left us.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I, what we were going to do, we were going to put it in a different case so that I could add more stuff to it and use one of our newer cards so that I could use the other monitor.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And it works just fine with the graphics card that was in it.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And it's actually a pretty decent graphics card, but I want something that's going to be a little bit better before I hop back on Guild Wars because I am going to be going back to Guild Wars about once a week.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sokka.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm just kidding.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Guild Wars was kind of fun.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You got your account, man, as well, right?

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Exactly, I know.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's the one thing I always liked about Guild Wars is, like, it's always there for you to come back to, you know?

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You bought the game.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's no monthly fee or anything.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's always there to come back.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this Dark Sakura, so I'm going to bring this up now.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message, and apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I know.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Until the server's shut down on March 31st.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I know.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I talked about it with Rama last night.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ah.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Doh.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Doh.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Um, so I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so...

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She's playing PSU.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She was on Lost Planet the other night.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I was like, oh, it's Julie.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wait, Julie?

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Julie's playing Lost Planet?

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah, she hung out with us today.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We went to breakfast, and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead, but it's not the right one.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She actually bought it for me.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I thought I was really nice of her, because it was only, like, ten bucks.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount, and Dan used his gift card, and ended up getting one of those new PS3 remotes for twelve bucks.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So that was pretty cool.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Very cool.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They watched Ratatouille again, which is one of Dan's presents.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Aw.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, who knows?

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD kind of finishes.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everybody's kind of jumping ship.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, well, I think it's still kind of up there, you know.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was very good.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It was.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I heart that movie.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you like the new icon?

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, I did.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It was very nice.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I made an icon from my LiveJournal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know what?

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In Greek mythology, Lamia was the Queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hot.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They should make a video game out of Stardust.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I do.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know what it is.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the whole, like, swords and magic.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know, music is very Oblivion-ish.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,500
You can get it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with

147
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
it glowing green.

148
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
This has pulled my finger.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hilarious.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I know.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm very proud of it.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It took, like, five seconds.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why not?

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was okay.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's horrible.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I hate.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know, I was still looking for it.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Sorry to hear it.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just, it's all, yay.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks, even though my character is in it,

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penises Magic Pen Gel.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, no.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,440
That game is way better.

172
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,280
Then I played some more Crysis.

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,480
Actually I'm about to finish it, but that's where the game starts to really, really suck.

174
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,360
Apparently, I don't know, somewhere along the line of making the game, they decided

175
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,560
not to test the last level very much, and it has hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches

176
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,780
in it that make it almost impossible to play, and actually I have been unable to beat the

177
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,000
game because of these glitches.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,320
You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your

179
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,480
strength mode or whatever, and so when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't

180
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
actually be able to be knocked down.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
They'll get stuck.

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,720
And then some other times, you know, for example, one of the commanders or whatever, there's

183
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,760
supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.

184
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,120
Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand, and that's it.

185
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,720
He's just frozen, and nothing ever happens.

186
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,440
So you have to constantly restart the game, and it's just horrible.

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,160
It's like, if that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
all because it was just that bad.

189
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,920
And even now, I've tried playing it through about ten different times, starting on saves

190
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,760
that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe, you know, something will

191
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,680
work this time, but it doesn't.

192
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
And I'm about fed up with it.

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,560
However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.

194
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,040
It's like a portable nuke launcher, so I mean, why did they have it at the beginning of the

196
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
game?

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Because I would have loved to blow up chickens with that.

198
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
It would have been fun.

199
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
You have to work towards it.

200
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I know.

201
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
You have to earn it.

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Or I have to cheat really bad.

203
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
You need a chicken cannon.

204
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,080
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

205
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I think that's about it.

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,760
It's just Saints Row, a little bit of Earth Defense Force still plugging away at that

207
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
game.

208
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,600
Alright, well, my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.

209
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,920
Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft, you know, there's not a lot of new games coming

210
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
out and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.

211
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,200
So really, the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the

212
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,240
week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games

213
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
ever.

214
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,520
You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.

215
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,080
You know what you need is the booth.

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,720
The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.

217
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,120
I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.

218
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Basically if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four mini games

219
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
in one.

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,000
There's a lot of games in this period that were similar to it because honestly, the setup

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,440
of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey the arcade game, which is also

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,400
made up of four mini games.

223
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,560
But basically what you do in Tron, you know, there's one level that's based off the light

224
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,600
cycles and there's another where you're trying to enter the cone.

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,840
You've probably seen the pictures of that before.

226
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,160
And basically once you beat each of the four mini games, you get to do it all over again!

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Yay!

228
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,920
Well, the addition of Xbox Live co-op is kind of cool, getting to play a two-player game

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
experience.

230
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,820
Five dollars though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and

231
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,640
age is worth too much more.

232
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.

233
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,320
That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.

234
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
That'll be kind of cool.

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,680
Discs of Tron was very interesting.

236
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,280
I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:38,280
The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play

238
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
the entire game.

239
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,560
It's just that when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and

240
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,960
more difficult each time.

241
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,480
The demo will give you a really good idea of what the game is all about.

242
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Other than Tron, the other new game on Xbox Live this week was Omega 5, this new shooting

243
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,760
game that's out on Xbox Live Arcade.

244
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,000
And I'll tell you what, I kind of did a double take when I was playing the game because I'm

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,880
like, is this a PlayStation 2 game or an Xbox game?

246
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,960
And I'm not saying that to knock the graphics, because the graphics are actually pretty cool,

247
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,440
but this is not the type of game I'm used to seeing on the Xbox.

248
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,200
It's a shooter-rific game that I really would have thought would have been on the PlayStation

249
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,600
2, but it's in HD and widescreen.

250
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,240
I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.

251
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,820
You know, lots of bullets everywhere.

252
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
That's always fun.

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,160
Basically you can pick up these, you can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking

254
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,920
up these different power-ups and you can have lasers or spreading bullets and things of

255
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
that sort.

256
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,600
And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was

257
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
that you know?

258
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,840
Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.

259
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
I mean, I'll give it that.

260
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,520
Omega 5 is ten bucks, but it definitely reminds me of a Hay Day arcade Japanese-influenced

261
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,780
shooter, so definitely check it out.

262
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,820
The demo on that one is not bad either.

263
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,080
You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.

264
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,000
You do one mini-boss fight.

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,680
But it's pretty cool.

266
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,600
And of course there's always our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and rostielut, quite

267
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,760
the smartass in our chatroom, the official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
and ways.

269
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
No, I'm kidding.

270
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,520
He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.

271
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
You know what I mean.

272
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm not talking about first-person shooters.

273
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,120
I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know?

274
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,400
This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too, and

275
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,100
some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.

276
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,400
So there you have it.

277
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,880
So that's really going to do it for our gaming week.

278
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,120
So now we're going to move on into some housekeeping, of which we don't have a whole lot to share.

279
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,200
I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished.

280
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,760
So if you were feeling there's not enough of the old-school classics and music from

281
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,320
video games and such, you're going to love the new rotation.

282
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
It's tons and tons of music from various video games.

283
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,480
We wanted to avoid the temptation of just dumping MP3s upon MP3s in there and just tried

284
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,660
to pick out songs that were a little more upbeat, radio-friendly, and the types of things

285
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,520
that you'd hear on the radio that will still remind you of the classics.

286
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
So check it out.

287
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,000
Give us your feedback in our forums at orangelaunchradio.com.

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,360
And one other thing is that there's a new show.

289
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,080
It's not a live show or a hosted show.

290
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,240
It's just a music show, but it airs every day from noon to 1230.

291
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,340
That's every day, Monday through Sunday, so every day.

292
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,280
It's the retro lunch, so it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.

293
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Just a little bit.

294
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Don't overdo it.

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,840
But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.

296
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
So check that out.

297
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Yep, lots of fun.

298
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,440
And some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they

299
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,680
will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station

300
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
right now and try to guess.

301
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I used to do that.

302
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Yeah.

303
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
It's fun.

304
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
It's fun.

305
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
So check that out.

306
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
All right.

307
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care

308
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
of.

309
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,640
It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody

310
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,880
everywhere wants to know, how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?

311
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,000
We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know the number.

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,920
So but this week we have an idea of how Eye of Judgment is doing.

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Do we not?

314
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Yes.

315
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,480
So now we have an actual place we can look to see how Eye of Judgment is doing thanks

316
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:43,160
to VGcharts.com and apparently you guys are up to.15 million copies to be exact actually

317
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:52,680
because that's just an estimate, 132,199 copies sold so far.

318
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
All right.

319
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,240
So how many does that mean we have left to go?

320
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,120
About 870,000.

321
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Yeah.

322
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
All right.

323
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,480
Get to work.

324
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of

325
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,680
Judgment could, if Eye of Judgment was actually, because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece

326
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,280
of shit, we call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program, and Loki says there's

327
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,640
no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies and if it does, he will don

328
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,220
a tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby

329
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,960
Blackwolf in a match of the Eye of Judgment, which by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.

330
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I heard it on his show.

331
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,840
Oh, my own sake, it is actually 150,000.

332
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
150 million?

333
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Oh shit.

334
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
We've got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.

335
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
No, I don't think so.

336
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,800
150 million, that'd be unheard of.

337
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,560
Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.

338
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:53,120
I didn't realize the 132,199 is just US, which is pretty impressive actually that the US

339
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
has actually sold that many copies.

340
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Japan, not so much.

341
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:03,580
In fact, they're only up to 19,384, so no love in Japan for that stuff, but the US keeps

342
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
on chugging.

343
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,320
Now, is the game out in Europe yet?

344
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,760
The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?

345
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,640
Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.

346
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,400
According to this, that's not Europe though, let me see.

347
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I don't think so.

348
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,680
No, it's not out in Europe yet.

349
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,520
So Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.

350
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,280
Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chat room and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.

351
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,040
If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon apparently,

352
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
so there you go.

353
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
You can buy it cheap.

354
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I posted a link in the chat room where you can play along at home and we'll probably

355
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,760
post it in a thread or something in our forums so that you can watch the count.

356
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,080
So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show?

357
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,440
No, we can do it every month or so.

358
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,760
Maybe when it crosses milestones, when we get to 200,000 we'll mention it again, a quarter

359
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,400
million, then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows, if we keep going.

360
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,100
I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but I don't know, because there's

361
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,680
other stories we're getting into.

362
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
That's right.

363
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
Shall we get into these stories?

364
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,920
We shall get into these stories.

365
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,000
So the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Some more cards.

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,880
In fact, there's two of them.

368
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:39,640
Let's see, the Machine God's Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th and there's

369
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,520
also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in

370
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,640
the summer.

371
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
They said downloads, though.

372
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
That's not really new cards, though.

373
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,960
I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.

374
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,440
So how does this affect the bet?

375
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,760
I don't think it affects anything, because it's not actually selling anything.

376
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,080
Download content does not count.

377
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,740
But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of

378
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,180
Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?

379
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,680
If there's an expansion disc that comes, you know, including cards, obviously, because

380
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,120
I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.

381
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,080
But right now, and that's even kind of being a little generous, because seriously, I mean,

382
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
I don't know.

383
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,240
I think you want to wear that tingle outfit a little bit.

384
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,460
I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.

385
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,320
It will never sell one million units.

386
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Ever.

387
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Ever.

388
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,760
Even with expansions that are retail.

389
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Retail expansions.

390
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
But download expansions, we couldn't really track anyway.

391
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Exactly.

392
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Tony doesn't release those numbers.

393
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm not counting like fucking booster packs and shit like that, because that's just stuff

394
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
that we can't track.

395
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
All right.

396
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,120
You know, seriously, just if it's going to be sold like, you know, Warhawk or something

397
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,520
like that, where it's download content, and it's also, you know, sold as a retail disc,

398
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
then yeah, we'll count that.

399
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,160
But if it's like a fucking, you know, booster pack or some shit that they come out later

400
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,680
on, no, I'm sorry, that does not count.

401
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,440
Because they'll come out with one million booster packs.

402
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,000
Well no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.

404
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
That's stupid.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
That's cheating.

406
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
That's not really a game.

407
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,680
We don't count, you know, the download content.

408
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,760
All right, well at least we have the bet clarified.

409
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,600
You have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover US sales,

410
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,200
but you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.

411
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah, and also it was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for

412
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
eternity, so.

413
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,520
All right, and SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession

414
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
behind us.

415
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
That might be a good point.

416
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
No.

417
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Just to let this joke die.

418
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
No, I'm not wearing it.

419
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
All right.

420
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm very confident.

421
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,480
If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.

422
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,840
I am very confident that this will never sell a million units, because it's the stupidest

423
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,160
thing I've ever seen, until they come out with something else that's even more retarded,

424
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,920
but right now it's pretty retarded.

425
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,760
All right.

426
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Do you, now a good point brought up in chat here, Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly

427
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,840
buying Eye of Judgment.

428
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,960
Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?

429
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Why?

430
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
I don't play card games, and no.

431
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
That's a no.

432
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Just say no.

433
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,800
For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was

434
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,720
like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we converted it on the show anyways,

435
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,960
but I'm like, nah.

436
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm not doing that.

437
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
You could just use your credit and get something good.

438
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
Why waste it?

439
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
Darkknight is in chat, DJ Darkknight says, get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the

440
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
suit.

441
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,840
She's not going to make me dress up.

442
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,240
That's stupid.

443
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,300
All right, let's move on.

444
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,320
Let's put this obsession behind us, shall we?

445
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,640
And talking about the PlayStation 3 a little more, Sony of Japan is going to discontinue

446
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,680
certain models of the PlayStation 3.

447
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,880
That would be the 20 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte models, and that's going to be discontinued

448
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,880
after one last shipment at the end of this month.

449
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Sony will instead be focusing on the 40 gigabyte model.

450
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,500
The 40 gigabyte model, of course, is 40 gigabytes, whereas the other one was a little smaller

451
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,560
and a little larger.

452
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,320
But the other big change, oh yeah, it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility, which obviously

453
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,280
makes it a lot cheaper to produce.

454
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,400
So that's where they're headed in Japan.

455
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,200
Obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards

456
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
compatibility.

457
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,400
In Europe, well, shit, they never really had it.

458
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,640
But at least our main model is 80 gigabytes.

459
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,000
Of course, what I'm going to put on that PlayStation 3 on all that hard drive space, I'm not quite

460
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
sure yet.

461
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Porn.

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I guess porn.

463
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
I got a new hard drive this week, actually.

464
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,420
Like you, I have one of those little external drives now, because that's kind of the rage

465
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,560
right now, those external, like, what are they called?

466
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,160
The gigabooks or something?

467
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I don't know what the hell they're called.

468
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Travel books or whatever.

469
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,720
Well, William had one from his work he wasn't even using, and he's moving right now, and

470
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
he's like, you want this?

471
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm like, sweet, porn drive!

472
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Yoink.

473
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,480
I used mine when my computer was starting to die, when my Vio was, the Franken-Vio,

474
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,760
I should call it, was about to go.

475
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
So it's good for backing up stuff.

476
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah.

477
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
And porn.

478
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.

479
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
For porn.

480
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
For Doctor Who episodes.

481
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
By the way, on YouTube, okay, here's how bored I was on YouTube the other night.

482
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Like, I ended up watching an episode of The Weakest Link that had a bunch of Doctor Who

483
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
people on it.

484
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
It was like a Doctor Who special.

485
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Oh, I want to see that one!

486
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,720
I've watched some of it.

487
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
It's all on YouTube.

488
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,200
Because, yeah, it was all of the people from the second season, I think.

489
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,840
Yeah, I want to see that.

490
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Hey, Jamie.

491
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Games.

492
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Whatever.

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, hey, guess who they're getting in Japan?

494
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,080
I could be a lot of things.

495
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
What?

496
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,920
They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.

497
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,560
Like, they need another color for a video game system.

498
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Why mint green?

499
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Well, look at the DS.

500
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,840
It works for the DS.

501
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Why not the PSP?

502
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I guess so.

503
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,800
Maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envious.

504
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Why mint green of all colors?

505
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I don't know.

506
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,920
Why not, you know, pink and red for Valentine's Day?

507
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,680
They made a Sakura one.

508
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, a Sakura PS2 that I wanted that was metallic purple, and I was like, Cherry Blossom's

509
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
pink.

510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Why did you make it pink?

511
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, it's metallic purple.

512
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay, fine.

513
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,240
I just wanted it for the name.

514
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,920
Maybe there was a surplus of purple paint in the Sony factory, and maybe that's what

515
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
it is.

516
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,820
The Sony factory, they have certain excess paint supplies.

517
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,400
They have some green left and they have some white left, and it's like, screw it, mix it,

518
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
paint some PSPs.

519
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
All right.

520
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,120
We'll call it mint green.

521
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,920
And call it run out of color green.

522
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,320
You should put it out in, like, Ireland.

523
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,520
Mint green, like an Olive Garden mint, which, by the way, made good on the promise.

524
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
We did.

525
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,600
We went to Olive Garden, and I had, what did I have, Seafood Alfredo.

526
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,920
Yes, and lots of never-ending breadsticks.

527
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,120
I know, and that really good meatball soup.

528
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes, anyway, sorry.

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Games, right?

530
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Games.

531
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Yeah.

532
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,080
So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming

533
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,920
to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.

534
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,600
Well, people were wondering why not the original PSP.

535
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
What the hell?

536
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,500
The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more

537
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
RAM in it.

538
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,680
So, being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, is the only system able to

539
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,260
handle Skype, apparently.

540
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,400
Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing

541
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
as Skype.

542
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,040
I don't know of one that they're working on right now, so, oh well, no Skype for you.

543
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,320
Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.

544
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,360
Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.

545
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,160
But then again, who am I really going to call on Skype?

546
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,720
I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.

547
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,360
It's just very inconvenient anyways, I mean seriously, you have to have, I think you have

548
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,000
to buy Skype for this, I don't know if it's going to be free, it may be free to use, but

549
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,360
I think you have to buy the software for it.

550
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,320
And then, once you've done that, you have to have a Wi-Fi spot and stuff, it's just

551
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,120
like, shit, once you've already got all that stuff, might as well just use your computer

552
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
to do it.

553
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,440
Or just fucking call them on the phone.

554
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,020
Yeah, but you know, I'm hearing from more and more people who are interacting with this

555
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,880
program on a PSP.

556
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,400
So you know, PSPs are basically becoming little mini computers that you have in your pocket.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,120
You know, people take their PSP to Starbucks and they'll be sipping on a coffee, studying

558
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,720
for math class or something, and listening to our show, so that's kind of crazy.

559
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,160
So PSPs are kind of mini computers at this point.

560
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,120
PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.

561
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,520
Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not, but

562
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
one thing that is...

563
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,560
It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.

564
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,720
There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3 is that the cross-media

565
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,960
bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.

566
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,880
Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I

567
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,760
believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the

568
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,520
game, but that was something that the developers had to do.

569
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,920
There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar

570
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,440
to show up within a game.

571
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,780
And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every

572
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,480
game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that

573
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,520
the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.

574
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,160
Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.

575
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:56,960
Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.

576
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,360
However there was no news at CES, they instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales

577
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,920
or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.

578
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,800
Soon is the magic word, isn't it?

579
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Of course.

580
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:17,080
Well, there is a little confirmation that it should make some people happy, and that

581
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,160
is about LittleBigPlanet.

582
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,040
It will be out in September, at least that's what Sony's saying, but you know, it's September

583
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,560
and not September X date, it's September, which is some time.

584
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?

585
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Yes.

586
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,960
It changed because Consumer Electronics Show, it seems like we're getting slightly more

587
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,480
gaming news out of CES this year, I use that word slightly, because usually CES is not

588
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
for games.

589
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:55,080
It's not a game show, it's a kitchenware, and 150,000 foot TVs, and all the George Foreman

590
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
grilling machines.

591
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,640
And robots to waltz with.

592
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,080
Yes exactly, and all that stuff, that's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show, you

593
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
don't see a lot of games.

594
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,080
But I feel like this year, at least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit

595
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
more gaming news.

596
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm not saying we never got gaming news out of CES, but I feel like we got a little more

597
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,160
this year, and I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be, or what

598
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,080
the heck that's about, but I just thought that was interesting.

599
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm not reading too much into that, I just thought it was interesting, that's all.

600
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,200
And then freakin' Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft Keynote, I

601
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,880
mean that was kind of interesting.

602
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,480
The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlant is coming out in September,

603
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,960
I mean wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?

604
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
And now it's like, oh I'm sorry.

605
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Another Sony delay?

606
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
You don't say.

607
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
I know, it's crazy.

608
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,680
And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out, seriously, they keep advertising this

609
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,680
shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid

610
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,000
4, all these games that are out now, Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games

611
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,280
are out yet, and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy Playstation 3, good

612
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,520
stuff will be coming someday.

613
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,240
I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.

614
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,080
That's the problem though, even though they take their time on getting the product out,

615
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,260
it's still just average.

616
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,080
They can delay it all they want, it'll still be kind of eh.

617
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,500
I agree to an extent, I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think

618
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,400
they should never have launched the damn console when they did, I think they should have just

619
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,680
sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.

620
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,940
Well it's just like LittleBigPlanet, granted it's something that's pretty ambitious, but

621
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,220
don't fucking show this shit off like, oh it's coming out this fall, get everybody excited,

622
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,220
And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall, it's coming out this spring, or, okay,

623
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,440
great, spring comes along, oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring, it's coming

624
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
out in September.

625
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
You know, it's...

626
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Okay.

627
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
You can do them forever.

628
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,680
And Akuta in our chat room at chat.ornisontisradio.com brings up a good point.

629
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,380
Wasn't Super Smash Brothers Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?

630
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,160
So is Sony the only bad guys here?

631
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
No, they're not.

632
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,800
And, you know, Nintendo's just as guilty for doing that kind of stuff.

633
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,320
Hyping up a game, you know, that's supposed to be coming out at some point, and then ends

634
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,960
up getting delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and...

635
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,820
And basically you all ruined Christmas.

636
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,160
But here's the thing, though.

637
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Even still, so that they delay that one game, though, there's still other stuff coming out

638
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
that's good.

639
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,520
Whereas, you know, the PlayStation 3, a lot of their stuff is being delayed, and it's

640
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,240
not just one game, because one game, big deal, okay, so that gets delayed.

641
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,680
It's a lot of games being delayed, and it's consistent.

642
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,320
So that's the only thing that sucks.

643
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,440
And for anyone that just owns a PlayStation 3, you know, I'd be kind of disappointed.

644
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,200
I'd be pissed off if I owned just a PlayStation 3, because, you know, all these good games

645
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,240
come out for the 360, and then I have to wait months for the same thing to come out on the

646
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
PS3.

647
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,720
I don't know.

648
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
It's kind of unfair.

649
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,000
All right, well what else is Sony teasing for us?

650
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,760
Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games

651
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
on the system.

652
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,040
I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun, one of my favorite games on the

653
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,400
system, one of the few that I still own, because I love it so much.

654
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,040
Well this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60 player online death matches, which

655
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,720
is fucking crazy, eight player co-op, and two campaigns, one which is supposed to be

656
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,400
an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just, you know, standard single player

657
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
campaign.

658
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,280
60 player multiplayer matches, god I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.

659
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,920
Well from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48 player multiplayer death

660
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
matches.

661
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,560
So, you know, it's not so bad, and you have to remember though, not each one of these

662
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,880
PlayStation 3 consoles ships with a microphone, you have to buy that, you know, separately.

663
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
That's good.

664
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,520
So, they should make a new shooting game called The Right to Speak, and basically players

665
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,200
shoot each other to earn the right to speak into the microphone.

666
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,720
That would be funny, that should be just a mode in the game.

667
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,200
And there should be something where like if somebody is completely being a jerk, then

668
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,080
like everybody can like target that person and, you know, obliterate them to smithereens

669
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,640
and they lose the right to speak.

670
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
I like it.

671
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,500
Patent pending, that means I own all the rights to it, and if you try to put this in your

672
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,880
game, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

673
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,640
If you want more information though on Resistance 2, it's supposed to be in the new issue of

674
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Game Informer.

675
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Alrighty.

676
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,400
Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier, how it's becoming more and more

677
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
like a computer.

678
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,960
Well, there's one thing the PSP is sorely lacking, and that is a keyboard for now.

679
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,780
That's right, there is a PSP apparently.

680
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,960
It's something that Sony is actually developing themselves, first party.

681
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,720
It is, you know, consider it a rumor for right now, but it was something that GameSpot reported

682
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,240
on, so who knows.

683
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,960
It's supposed to arrive in the middle of 2009.

684
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,880
It's fucking lame.

685
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
It's a long ways out.

686
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
No, seriously, it's lame.

687
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Homebrew has already had, you know, keyboard support for a long time.

688
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,300
It has a damn IR port on it, so you can use keyboards that are meant for PDAs.

689
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,800
Why the hell is it going to take them so long to develop a USB keyboard?

690
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,060
I mean, seriously, it's not that hard.

691
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
It's a keyboard.

692
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
You know why?

693
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,640
It's probably something that they want, it's a time thing.

694
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,920
They want to put it out in 2009 for a reason.

695
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,680
They're going to add something that you're going to want to have this keyboard for in

696
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
2009.

697
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Hey, look, now you don't.

698
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,160
Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.

699
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Ah, lame.

700
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,920
It's a time thing.

701
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Just you wait.

702
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
It's still lame.

703
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,360
You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.

704
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
Why wait?

705
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,520
Because then, if you wait, then you put this thing out, nobody buys it because there's

706
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,200
nothing to use it for, so retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first

707
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
place?

708
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,600
Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.

709
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
I still think it's stupid.

710
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,240
It's not going to sell anyways if it's AIM.

711
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,120
That's stupid.

712
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
It's kind of like, you know what?

713
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,460
I would almost blame that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the

714
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
GameCube.

715
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
What do they call it?

716
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,760
The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.

717
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,520
There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody

718
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,220
could get into at the time.

719
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,720
So where did those things end up?

720
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,760
In the bargain bins, developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them

721
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
are out there.

722
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
It was kind of like a damning cycle.

723
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,560
What should have happened is that at that time, Nintendo should have come out and said,

724
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,720
we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.

725
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,360
F-Zero is going to support the, you know, how awesome would an F-Zero GX have been if

726
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?

727
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Like a completely different kind of game than PSO, right?

728
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,360
I can't see Nintendo putting an online game.

729
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
I know.

730
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,840
I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.

731
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't know.

732
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,240
I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.

733
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,320
Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking

734
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
off that.

735
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,000
I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really

736
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,080
a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online

737
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
thing.

738
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,200
I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger

739
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
for the PSP.

740
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,200
They've already got Java stuff that works for it, I mean, it works on cell phones.

741
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
What the hell's taken them so long?

742
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,680
I mean, seriously, this system's been out for a few years now.

743
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,100
I don't understand why there would be these two-year delays for this shit.

744
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
They're playing Eye of Judgment.

745
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,680
Yeah, they're too busy playing Eye of Judgment, exactly.

746
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,800
Well, this is a happy rumor, although, you know, it's also said that we might be getting

747
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:49,080
Parappa 2, but, you know, hey, they're talking about putting Vibribin out for the European

748
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
PSN.

749
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,060
I think that's pretty cool, although, you know, they also, like I said, mentioned Parappa

750
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,840
as well, but has that happened?

751
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
No.

752
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:06,480
So, but hey, Vibribin's great for anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what Vibribin

753
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
is.

754
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:16,120
It's a vector-animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.

755
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,080
I have some mood-setting music.

756
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Okay.

757
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:28,120
It had, I think, like eight tracks or something, this is one of them built into the game.

758
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:35,040
And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.

759
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,120
And the way that you play the game is you, you know, you start the game and you can actually

760
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
put in your own CDs.

761
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,480
And we tried to do it to, what did we call it?

762
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,360
TDR music, like Max 300 and stuff.

763
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Yeah, we tried to do it to, what did we call it, oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania,

764
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
yeah.

765
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,080
We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300, and we tried to pick as

766
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,600
many fast and retarded stuff as we could, and did it end up being, like, some Polteri

767
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,080
song that was really hard instead?

768
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,120
I think it was colors.

769
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,320
The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, you

770
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,880
know, designing your own levels with your own music.

771
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,600
But it was kind of cool, nevertheless.

772
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,880
And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.

773
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
It was pretty cool.

774
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,800
And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.

775
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,760
And I hope it comes out.

776
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,120
I want it over here, though.

777
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,760
GS68 has a brilliant idea.

778
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,320
You can play that game with Dragon Force now.

779
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
You know what I could do?

780
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
What?

781
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,440
I could do that, because I have VibRibbon.

782
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,440
I saw a copy of VibRibbon sitting at Network Video, may you rest in peace.

783
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,100
That's what we need to do for our little piece.

784
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,360
I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force, so

785
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,020
we need to make that happen with VibRibbon.

786
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,960
So you need to dust off your copy, because we're going to be doing that.

787
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
I found it.

788
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Good.

789
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I found my copy.

790
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Get that ready.

791
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
More like Dance Factory.

792
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
I picked up VibRibbon for 40 bucks, and I got an original, and I've never regretted

793
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
it.

794
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Awesome.

795
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Awesome.

796
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,080
Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?

797
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Probably.

798
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Alright.

799
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Sucka.

800
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Although, I could just pop it in my PS2.

801
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:19,240
This is the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet, because we found the cartridge

802
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,600
and our Super Nintendo, so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing, okay?

803
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Alright.

804
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,860
Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff, not online, but stuff you can actually

805
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,080
walk into a store and buy.

806
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Yes, in the US, it's the smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy,

807
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,040
most of which is the latter, including Kid Sports Ice Hockey for the Wii, yet another

808
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,920
game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good, FlatOut Head On on the PSP,

809
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,540
that's a FlatOut 2 port, so that should be pretty fun, History Channel Lost Worlds on

810
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,140
the PC, Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii, which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails

811
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:14,360
samurai game, Furu Furu Park on the Wii, only $20, a bunch of little mini games by Majesco,

812
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:20,240
Miami Nights Singles in the City for the DS, I don't know if it's any better than Sprung,

813
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,480
but I guess we'll have to see, Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose

814
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,760
to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike 64, and it's kind of the same

815
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,280
thing, it's bikes with rockets on them, and then The Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and The

816
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:48,760
Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out, Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to

817
00:42:48,760 --> 00:43:00,400
$30, and finally, let's see here, Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle,

818
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,160
and that's coming out as well, enough pirate games, enough, I was going to say though there

819
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,440
is something kind of funny that's coming out next week, also happens to be by Destineer

820
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:19,520
though, Kawasaki Jet Ski, this one looks almost identical to Waveray 64, so that might be

821
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
pretty cool, and that's it.

822
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,440
Alright then let's head on over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there in

823
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,160
Japan, not a lot sadly, but if you have an Xbox 360 in Japan, you're one of the few,

824
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,840
you have Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights to look forward to, which comes out on January 17th,

825
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,400
going over to other systems on the Playstation 3, Juiced 2 for some reason comes out a week

826
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,480
later, go figure, it comes out the week of January 24th, I guess Juiced takes longer

827
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,660
to produce for Sony Systems, I couldn't tell you, on the Nintendo Wii things look a little

828
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,720
better because you get Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th, and Sonic Riders Shooting

829
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,240
Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

830
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,320
Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking

831
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,000
at the patient with a knife?

832
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,680
You know what, Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007, like it was

833
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,800
on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not had the time amongst all

834
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,900
the other games that came out, but I will get to that very soon.

835
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,640
Also on the Playstation 2 this week, you get Juiced 2, but you get a game called Lucky

836
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,800
Star comes out this week, Lucky Star looks to be probably based off another anime, it's

837
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,640
an adventure game, and that's really all I know, except there's two chicks holding hands

838
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,440
on the front cover, but one's an angel, so I don't think it's Lesbians or anything like

839
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,700
that.

840
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,120
That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?

841
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Oh shit I fucked up, Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week, don't, sorry.

842
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,180
You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star which is

843
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,160
also released next week, however this week you can get a game called School Days, School

844
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,520
Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kinda

845
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,160
arm in arm like they're BFFs, and they're wearing school girl uniforms so you know this

846
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,360
will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe.

847
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:20,000
Moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, a game called From the Abyss makes its

848
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,680
way to the Nintendo DS, and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think

849
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,840
this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS, oh I guess it is, there's the box art and

850
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,160
stuff, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS, I always thought

851
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,080
that was a Wii only game, go figure, that comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in

852
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:42,600
Japan, and lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing, nothing for the PSP, but you have a price

853
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,880
reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week, so there you have it, your Japanese

854
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,880
release dates.

855
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:56,520
Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe, we have Balls of Fury, that's great.

856
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,240
That's based off a movie that didn't do very well.

857
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:07,160
Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Night's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost

858
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,560
picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team

859
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:22,400
in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure, and that's it.

860
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,560
I just say save your money, well get nights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles

861
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,760
later that month.

862
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,320
You know, I will never understand our chat room in the way they think sometimes, because

863
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,760
you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?

864
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,240
So SSG100Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup, dating sim for DS, or now, you know,

865
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,760
two girls, one cup is now 2007, but now you have, you know, because obviously something

866
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,740
much more hardcore came out apparently recently, and Cory31 suggests that four girls finger

867
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,600
paint would make a good DS Wii game.

868
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,880
Sick!

869
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,840
Gotta keep up on the internet, you all are sick!

870
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,860
There you go, BlackWolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better, absolutely.

871
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,860
Date Dragon Force, the game.

872
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,860
You know what I want?

873
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,440
They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.

874
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Really?

875
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,840
Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.

876
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,920
Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.

877
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Alright, well it was announced this week that two secret characters are going to be coming

878
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,640
to Soul Calibur IV, although I don't really know how an announcement makes it secret,

879
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,680
but anyways, Darth Vader and Yoda are coming to Soul Calibur IV.

880
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,480
The only bad thing about it is, one is coming to each version, so if you get the Playstation

881
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,840
3 version, you happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.

882
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,040
If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.

883
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,080
I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.

884
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,440
Cue all the Xbox fans going, noooooo!

885
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,880
Hey, I can't get them both!

886
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
Exactly!

887
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Why?

888
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,880
Why?

889
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Why would you buy them both?

890
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,880
That is exactly why they did this shit.

891
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,880
That was sarcasm, by the way.

892
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,880
Okay, thank god.

893
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
But it's also going to come over there and beat you.

894
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,880
But I'm going to get the PS3 version.

895
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,280
Well, yeah, but this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off

896
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,240
of Soul Calibur IV, they went back and based it off of Soul Calibur II.

897
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,520
A balanced version.

898
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,320
Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?

899
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,360
It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur II.

900
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,080
Yeah, but I don't have a problem with, you know, Link not being on the Playstation, because

901
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,220
that doesn't make any sense.

902
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:43,200
Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a Playstation or something like

903
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,820
that?

904
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,500
This they're, you know, not really specific to any console.

905
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,840
It's not like you have the Darth Vader game on the Playstation 3 or anything like that.

906
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,560
It's just fucking lazy is what it is.

907
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
What happened to Blu-ray?

908
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,960
I thought Blu-ray can hold all this, like, data and stuff.

909
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,680
Why can't you fit Yoda on there?

910
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,480
It's just being, you're just being an asshole is what you're being.

911
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,760
And to be honest, I'd rather have the Playstation 3 version with Darth Vader, and I'm sure Sony

912
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,800
paid money to have, you know, Darth Vader on there.

913
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,100
I will buy the Xbox 360 version because I love Soul Calibur, and you know what?

914
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,520
You know why else I don't care which of these versions I pick up?

915
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,120
Because Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!

916
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,600
Why did that happen in the first place?

917
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
That is stupid.

918
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,160
Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts to have a crazy-looking

919
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,160
Yoda.

920
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,160
It looks stupid.

921
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,560
I looked at the screenshots of, like, Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever, and I'm just

922
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,160
going like, I just rolled my eyes, I'm like, this looks dumb.

923
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,880
This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.

924
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,080
No, no, no, did you hear what their original intent was?

925
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,040
The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fight

926
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,040
characters.

927
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,440
Oh my god, he's going to ruin his own franchise.

928
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,720
He said that would have been his pick, but apparently someone-

929
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,720
What's next?

930
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Klonoa?

931
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
Apparently-

932
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
Klonoa would be awesome, though.

933
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Screw you!

934
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,720
Hey, I like-

935
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Apparently someone beat with that.

936
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,480
Klonoa is one of my favorite games ever.

937
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,520
I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.

938
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,240
I thought it was cool to have Link in it.

939
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,680
Link made sense.

940
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,280
Link also a swordsy and, you know, is swords and sorcery type of character.

941
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Ha-Hachi?

942
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,440
Okay, I can, we'll let that one slide, that makes sense.

943
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,560
How long have they had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?

944
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Well Yoshi-

945
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,600
Is they the Soul Calibur character forever?

946
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,480
At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.

947
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,360
Oh, it just doesn't, it doesn't fit.

948
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Ha-Hachi has a diaper.

949
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
You know what they're doing?

950
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,560
They're fucking, they're fucking this over like they would Tekken, where they just start

951
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,840
putting all this ridiculous shit in there.

952
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,720
Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears and-

953
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,320
Okay, Tekken has always been that way though.

954
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,820
Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken because they can.

955
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,800
And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb too.

956
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
Exactly.

957
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,640
Well actually, I don't know, a panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.

958
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:01,040
Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in, oh my god.

959
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,200
No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?

960
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
Yes!

961
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
That's what I thought.

962
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,160
Devil and Angel and everybody and the gold band just says, secret character, your mom.

963
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,600
Last night, Devil Jin was awesome by the way.

964
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,440
Do not ever poop on Devil Jin.

965
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,000
I would not, I would not be surprised if we saw a Soul Calibur versus Tekken game.

966
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,200
Ooh, I'd buy it.

967
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,320
That actually would kind of rock.

968
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:28,800
I don't know why, like I'm being a total hypocrite, but I don't care because that idea is actually

969
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
kind of cool to me.

970
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,880
But here's the other thing, okay, when I look at this and I see the Star Wars characters,

971
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,440
I'm like, why doesn't Namco just like do an all Star Wars fighting game?

972
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,520
Now I know, now before the chat room jumps, I know there already was one like back on

973
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,600
the Playstation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.

974
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,600
Like not a lot of people remember.

975
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,240
Because you made a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good

976
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
game.

977
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
Exactly.

978
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,440
You can, I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.

979
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,200
Star Wars, there were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?

980
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,800
These games have been coming out forever.

981
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,240
So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know like using the

982
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,680
Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.

983
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,280
That would be all kinds of awesome.

984
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,960
I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.

985
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
That would be kind of awesome.

986
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,960
Because I love Soul Calibur.

987
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,060
Somebody in my life journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really

988
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,320
like other fighting games.

989
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
It's true.

990
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,680
I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.

991
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,240
I liked Gon from Tekken 3, and that's about it.

992
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,480
Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.

993
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,760
Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.

994
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,560
And you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2?

995
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,240
It's the crappy spinoff games happening too, like the Legends game.

996
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,680
Like what's her, oh god, what's her name from Tekken got her own spinoff game?

997
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Death by degree.

998
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,560
Death by playing this game.

999
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,120
Here's the thing that really sucks about that whole Soul Calibur game, other than the fact

1000
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,120
that it was just crap.

1001
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,200
I don't understand why they couldn't do a fighting game on, you know, the Wii.

1002
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,680
In fact, I remember seeing someone comment on why don't they just take the engine from

1003
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,160
Soul Calibur 2 for the GameCube and just port it over to the Wii, maybe update the graphics

1004
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,320
a little bit, and put new characters in it.

1005
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,400
Or add some of the characters from Soul Calibur 4 and you can have its own series on the Wii

1006
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,120
that maybe not as pretty, but still just as effective.

1007
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,280
RossdielUT in chat says, Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.

1008
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,320
Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.

1009
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:32,320
Like I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game

1010
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:38,520
with massive boobage, and this game will move a zillion copies on the first day.

1011
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,440
Just you wait.

1012
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,600
Mark my words.

1013
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:51,400
Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Taras Kasi, leave it to slumber in its grave,

1014
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,000
no zombie apocalypse.

1015
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,600
Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords, they will cut

1016
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
through them.

1017
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,960
In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.

1018
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,800
Oh I'm sorry, let me read that the way it should have been read.

1019
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,960
I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.

1020
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,480
I mean, come on.

1021
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,880
It's a video game dude, seriously.

1022
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
Just giving you a hard time.

1023
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,120
I'm trying to apply real world physics, and why am I even calling the Star Wars universe

1024
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
real world physics?

1025
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,480
Did you just say Jedi physics?

1026
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,360
No, real world physics.

1027
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
Oh sorry.

1028
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Not Jedi physics.

1029
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,080
That would make me even more retarded.

1030
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,440
Seriously, who cares, it's just a fucking game.

1031
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,760
They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.

1032
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,880
What they do need though, they need to get some Star Trek characters.

1033
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
I want to see Kirk.

1034
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,680
That's right, Kirk vs Picard, let's settle this shit right now.

1035
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,880
That would be funny, I would love to see that.

1036
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,080
I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.

1037
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,680
It's done up like one of those motivational posters.

1038
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,680
It's a picture of Kirk just grinning, and it says, I'm sorry I can't hear you over the

1039
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,440
sound of how awesome I am.

1040
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,440
I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it, like Kirk, I want to see

1041
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,800
Adam West playing Adam West, and you know, just weird shit like that.

1042
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
Loki Fighter 2008?

1043
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Hell yeah.

1044
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
There you go.

1045
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:22,040
All right, Black Wolf says, the Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields

1046
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,040
down to 85%.

1047
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,420
I'm sorry, let me reread that.

1048
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:31,720
The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.

1049
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,680
Please let's change the topic, pretty please.

1050
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,760
It's my turn, it sure is.

1051
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,520
Microsoft has made a comment about Xbox 360 backwards compatibility.

1052
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,560
It was Albert Piniello, the group marketing manager for the Xbox 360, he said this to

1053
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,200
Kotaku earlier in the week, quote, I don't know if we have plans to do any more releases

1054
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,280
in regards to backwards compatibility, quote, it feels like we kind of hit the point of

1055
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,240
diminishing returns there.

1056
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,180
So in other words, if you were hoping for more games to become backwards compatible,

1057
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,000
you can just keep on hoping.

1058
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,860
And of course, everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible,

1059
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,480
but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.

1060
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,960
Buy new games.

1061
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,480
Or better yet, don't sell off your old system.

1062
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,480
There you go.

1063
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,480
Problem solved.

1064
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,600
I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah, but especially in light of now that

1065
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,480
they've launched this download Xbox originals thing where they can charge more money for

1066
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,440
games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.

1067
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,880
Unless they do an update, watch this, this is what they'll do.

1068
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,160
They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.

1069
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,440
They'll only update it to do a download game or something.

1070
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,760
Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution

1071
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,420
games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat, because really that's really

1072
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,280
the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games, because

1073
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,520
you know, they're a good workout, right?

1074
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,000
So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?

1075
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,880
But I could just see Microsoft making those games backwards compatible and then releasing

1076
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,880
them on the download service and not putting out a patch.

1077
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,520
That's what they're talking about when they say diminishing returns.

1078
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Bastards.

1079
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,080
It means, diminishing returns means they're not really going to sell that many copies

1080
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,960
of Xbox games as soon as they don't make them anymore, and what the hell do they care?

1081
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,120
I do agree, it is kind of like, Xbox was what, like three years ago now?

1082
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,960
So it's kind of over, but...

1083
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,620
They play quite a few games, I mean if you're so bent out of shape that you can't play your

1084
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:36,300
copy of I don't know what, but you know, some obscure game out there, then just fucking

1085
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,440
buy an Xbox.

1086
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,480
I'm sure original Xboxes, assuming you don't have one already, are probably pretty damn

1087
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
cheap right now.

1088
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds, and they're like an eyesore in my living room.

1089
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,680
I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.

1090
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,040
But you still have an original Xbox.

1091
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,040
I do, and you know where it is?

1092
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,440
It's in that drawer right there, the closed drawer right there.

1093
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,480
Well, how often do you play Xbox games?

1094
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,200
I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible, but they're not.

1095
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,120
Well, that's just Konami, they don't like you.

1096
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
I guess that's what it is.

1097
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,600
We sometimes break out our old stuff.

1098
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,200
Well, you're crazy.

1099
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,760
You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.

1100
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,320
Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?

1101
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
What?

1102
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,260
The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.

1103
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,260
Just because.

1104
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,260
Just because.

1105
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,260
Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.

1106
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:32,760
Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin

1107
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
today.

1108
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Dust off the Genesis.

1109
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
Let's get it out.

1110
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,360
Yeah, we do that.

1111
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,360
Sometimes.

1112
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,560
But we've brought out our Xbox before to play old stuff.

1113
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,440
Just depends.

1114
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:51,960
Well, this is something interesting, though, to come out of CES, is the Force Feedback

1115
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,040
Suit by TN Games, which I think is kind of stupid, but I figured it was worth a mention

1116
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:09,360
because you, it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch.

1117
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,400
Like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets, like, punched in the chest,

1118
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,240
you'll feel it as just pressure.

1119
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:23,080
And it's, you know, meant for, it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion,

1120
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,120
but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out.

1121
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:38,920
So it actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for, like, a light

1122
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,560
hit or blow air past you if something misses you.

1123
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:50,320
So it's more for, I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why

1124
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
anyone would want one.

1125
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,640
Yeah, it's too, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.

1126
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,040
If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an Air

1127
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,000
Zuka while I play a game.

1128
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,120
Screw the Air Zuka, I'll just have a can.

1129
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:06,920
Well, they have those, was it, I don't remember the, like, ambient FX or something like that.

1130
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,320
It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.

1131
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,600
So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.

1132
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,480
I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on

1133
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,200
what's in the game.

1134
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,400
I'm laughing at RobWithTwoBees in the chat room.

1135
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,120
It says, how does it play with rez?

1136
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,120
That's a good question.

1137
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
That'd be funny.

1138
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,120
That might be kind of fun.

1139
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,120
All right.

1140
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Well, let's keep it moving.

1141
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,840
Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.

1142
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:48,480
Anyways, so, Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.

1143
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Good luck.

1144
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,600
Because right now you're not off to a good start.

1145
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
What does that mean, most reliable?

1146
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I don't know.

1147
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:02,320
He basically says, he says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.

1148
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,520
Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.

1149
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,080
Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.

1150
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,600
Does most reliable mean, like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on

1151
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,400
the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?

1152
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,300
I don't know.

1153
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:25,240
But I don't know how they can claim that even, I understand that they want to be the most

1154
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:32,200
reliable, but I want to be rich, and I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable,

1155
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,640
so I don't know.

1156
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,200
All right.

1157
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,680
Well, one thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox originals will make its

1158
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,000
way to the Xbox Live Marketplace, and one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Take

1159
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Down.

1160
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,040
Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.

1161
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,360
But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries

1162
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,840
in the long-running Burnout series, I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout

1163
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,020
Paradise or anything like that, but yeah, Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th

1164
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,560
to the Xbox 360 console as a downloadable original.

1165
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:13,280
It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about 1,499.

1166
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,480
Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360, so

1167
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
yeah.

1168
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,800
Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?

1169
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,800
Yeah.

1170
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,800
That's coming out.

1171
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,960
Yeah, I liked it better than Revenge anyway, so.

1172
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,960
Recommend it if you don't have it.

1173
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,320
Yeah, Take Down's a good game.

1174
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,360
I would also recommend it, and it's, yeah, it plays well on the backwards compatibility

1175
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
and all that good stuff, so.

1176
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,040
Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer

1177
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,120
that got pooped on?

1178
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,440
Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy, well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.

1179
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
Whatever happened?

1180
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,440
Oh, yeah, I know what happened.

1181
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,400
Nobody else left GameSpot, too, because of that earlier this week.

1182
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,560
Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked Gerstmann as why he was leaving.

1183
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,840
You know what's funny, though, is there's been like some other independent reviewers

1184
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:06,280
also leaving, and I'm just like, I don't care what, you're trying to like, you know, be

1185
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,480
all noble and stuff.

1186
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,160
Other people have done it before you, who cares?

1187
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:16,680
Well, the game in question, Kane & Lynch Dead Men, sold a million copies.

1188
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,460
So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going

1189
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,840
to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind

1190
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
of stuff on the internet.

1191
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,840
It probably helped, if anything.

1192
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,120
I want to see what the drama's about.

1193
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,560
It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.

1194
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,320
There's no such thing as bad press, you know, that'd be great.

1195
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,280
This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.

1196
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,680
Loki made a really big funny.

1197
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,440
It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.

1198
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,920
Exactly.

1199
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,840
All right.

1200
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,960
Well I think parents just bought this game for their kids, well actually you really shouldn't

1201
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,920
buy this game for your kids, so I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas

1202
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,720
tree, but quite a few people, apparently.

1203
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,880
I'm sure kids have it, because their parents don't care.

1204
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,760
Well, Billy wants Kane & Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for

1205
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,760
him.

1206
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,560
What's this M mean on the front of the package?

1207
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,080
M means it's...

1208
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,080
Must have!

1209
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,560
It's magnificent.

1210
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,600
M for magnificent, okay.

1211
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:27,480
So one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess, I

1212
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,840
don't know why they're doing it, but they did.

1213
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,080
So now ResHD will be supporting...

1214
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,640
I'm sorry, this is too good.

1215
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,960
Black Wolf says, oh, M is for Miners.

1216
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,960
Miners?

1217
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,760
Yeah, there you go.

1218
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,760
Sorry, go ahead.

1219
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:49,400
So ResHD is going to be supporting trans vibration, in the form of your other controllers, so

1220
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:55,440
one person can play, and three other people can be pleasured, awesome.

1221
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,920
So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers, one to play the game,

1222
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
three in your pants.

1223
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,320
Why can't they support just the Res trans vibrator, I mean, it's just a USB device,

1224
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:11,720
and if they built in the driver for it, why don't they support it, because that'd be kind

1225
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,000
of cool.

1226
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,440
Okay, so they're going to spend money to, you know, engineer this whole stupid thing

1227
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,040
on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans

1228
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,040
vibrator.

1229
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,040
Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?

1230
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,040
No I actually don't.

1231
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,960
See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one, I'm telling you right now.

1232
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,760
I've been looking for one.

1233
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,080
And cue the emails of everybody who has one emailing me telling me I'm wrong.

1234
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:45,240
Just reverse engineer a trans vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that, or

1235
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,160
like a dildo or something.

1236
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,240
SSJ100Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week, during list lists,

1237
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,920
remember how we were doing the list lists, and it was the gadgets we most want to see

1238
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,880
at CES, remember the Foreman grill, the grill's the entire cow one, right, we had like the

1239
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,560
Holodeck in there and all that stuff, right?

1240
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,480
Remember SSJ100Matt, his entire list got eliminated, and his list was gone.

1241
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,480
One of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator.

1242
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,000
Oh we don't need it, we have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.

1243
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,600
No but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually

1244
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:25,160
announced in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now...

1245
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,960
I don't know why you would need a trans vibrator anyways, it's kind of weird, but...

1246
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,160
Well congratulations SSJ100Matt for being correct.

1247
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,520
It'll be fun though to put the controller on like stuff that rattles, you know, like

1248
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:43,000
my coffee table and stuff like that so it'll be really loud and annoying.

1249
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,280
I'm sure your wife will love that.

1250
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,680
One thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes

1251
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,880
a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.

1252
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,920
That's right, it's the classic video game of the week, brought to us by Dark Sakura.

1253
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,160
Dark Sakura, what games have you picked for the masses this week?

1254
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,760
The game of the week is Bongio, which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure

1255
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,360
game on top of that, which makes it even more awesome.

1256
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,080
Two treasure games in a row, aha!

1257
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,080
But you can do that.

1258
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,080
I can.

1259
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:28,560
The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan, and it has come out on the Dreamcast.

1260
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:35,600
In fact I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played

1261
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,920
a bunch of it, it's really crazy because like you go around and, well actually I think it's

1262
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,480
kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version has a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.

1263
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,480
It's pretty cool.

1264
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,440
So if you got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!

1265
01:07:51,440 --> 01:08:00,400
But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can do like a bajillion

1266
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,080
shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.

1267
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,360
And I believe that the maximum number of like bullets you personally can shoot out at one

1268
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,600
time is like 400 I think.

1269
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:18,600
It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small, but when you think

1270
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,320
about everything else that's going in the game, it makes sense, you get a lot of action

1271
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,320
going on at one time.

1272
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:35,760
With the Dreamcast it makes some changes from the Nintendo 64 version, you have a sort of

1273
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,960
an explosion counter instead of the combo system and you don't have a shot that you

1274
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,400
can buy stuff from the Nintendo 64 version.

1275
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:53,040
Your special attacks are based on the amount of incoming fire, so you don't have to charge

1276
01:08:53,040 --> 01:09:00,000
for it, the more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.

1277
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Everybody also, all the characters were equalized as far as their powers are concerned, there's

1278
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,280
additional bosses, two new enemies which are a flamethrower and a giant egg, just little

1279
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,720
things, you know, graphical changes.

1280
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:21,640
But there was a sequel that came out which was Bongayo Spirits that's actually in development

1281
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,440
with DS.

1282
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,600
I was going to say that Dark Hetsuya and Chao were saying something about DS and Xbox Live

1283
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,000
Arcade rumors as well.

1284
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,760
I've been hearing some of that too, but I'm definitely going to be getting Bongayo

1285
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Spirits.

1286
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,760
It's actually going to be coming out in Japan as Bongayo Tamashiki.

1287
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:44,800
So the Bongayo goodness lives on, but for now we pay tribute to the original Bongayo,

1288
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,880
apparently Dreamcast version over the Nintendo 64.

1289
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,360
I have actually once played a Nintendo 64 version, there are some differences, I actually

1290
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,240
think the Dreamcast version is a lot more balanced.

1291
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,640
Well there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bongayo.

1292
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,880
Love it, play it.

1293
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,320
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio this week, but fear

1294
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,440
not the show isn't done just yet, we're going to come back and we're going to have ourselves

1295
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,360
a part B, and in part B we're going to talk about a lot of other stuff, speaking of the

1296
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,040
DS, we're going to talk a little bit about Assassin's Creed, and we're going to talk

1297
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:23,680
about Bionic Commando possibly coming to a Nintendo system as well, and a very cool feature

1298
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,280
for Disney World travelers that could be coming to the DS very soon.

1299
