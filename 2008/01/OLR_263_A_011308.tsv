7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!
14000	19000	Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models have discontinued in Japan.
19000	25000	The worlds of Soulcalibur and Star Wars collide, and could Resident Evil be returning to arcades?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	42000	We are that video game show on the internet dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48000	49000	Hi.
49000	50000	Our show's very own Bionic Woman.
50000	51000	Hi.
51000	56000	Who hearts pirates according to her shirt, or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.
56000	57000	I have skulls pirates.
57000	58000	So that means you collect their skulls?
58000	59000	Yes.
59000	60000	Like shrunken heads?
60000	62000	Like PVP and Ragnarok, yo.
62000	63000	That means skull fuck.
63000	68000	And of course the other voice you hear over there, the ever giggly tech master Loki.
68000	71000	Sorry, I was watching Crysis YouTube videos.
71000	72000	I see.
72000	80000	Because you have to understand Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.
80000	89000	Well, there's chickens and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spotted a ton of chickens and vehicles and blowing them up and that's hilarious. I don't know.
89000	93000	Killing chickens has been funny ever since like the Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.
93000	98000	You didn't kill them though. They just, you picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.
98000	99000	That's right.
99000	101000	Sweet, sweet chicken-y vengeance.
101000	105000	These chickens do not get revenge. They simply die.
105000	106000	Can we eat them?
106000	108000	Yeah, that was my next question. Can you eat them?
108000	109000	No.
109000	110000	No fun.
110000	117000	All right, well anyway, it's just the three of us tonight. We haven't had a guest in a long time. I think everybody locally hates our show suddenly.
117000	118000	Doesn't want to come visit anymore.
118000	120000	They're listening to us.
120000	122000	There's some that are listening. No.
122000	128000	We'll get some more. I think the rain and the weather lately has been keeping people indoors and of course there was like the holidays.
128000	130000	You know, who wants to come do a show on Christmas, right?
130000	135000	But anyhow, hopefully we'll have some more familiar faces and new faces as well.
135000	142000	I've been talking to somebody locally that's going to come on a future show. I'll give you more details about that in the future, but I'm very excited about it.
142000	148000	It's somebody I found on YouTube. That's all I'll say. Who happens to live here locally is going to come on the show.
148000	154000	So I'm very excited. I'll give you guys more details. This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.
154000	157000	Person on YouTube. That could be anyone on the face of the earth.
157000	159000	That could be. I mean, it's a wonderful place.
159000	166000	But anyway, we have that and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan, but of course it's kind of a dull period right now.
166000	174000	There's not a lot of games coming out. I think there's a few. Of course there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff, but otherwise kind of a slow period for games.
174000	179000	But that doesn't mean the news has stopped, and we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.
179000	181000	StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
181000	186000	Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass trying to get it to work.
186000	199000	I now have Cooking Mama in the collection in the purse to play because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again and to hell with my production.
199000	212000	And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.
212000	219000	Now, I didn't know what rebirth was. You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night, and the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.
219000	231000	Yeah, sort of. I mean, you have to start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.
231000	238000	But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.
238000	247000	But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.
247000	251000	I've been really amazed, so, oh well.
251000	253000	I wish Warcraft had a New Game Plus.
253000	256000	Yeah, you get to 70. Ha ha, you're stuck.
256000	259000	I'm like, hey, I'm at 99. Let's do the Time Warp again.
259000	261000	It's just to jump to the left.
261000	274000	No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is endgame content.
274000	276000	Like, there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.
276000	279000	You find a pond, you get experience.
279000	280000	PvP.
280000	284000	You find a rock, you get experience.
284000	287000	You don't get experience for discoveries at level 70 because there is no more experience.
287000	297000	Well, no, but I mean, for other stuff, when you're getting there, it's like, you, you, it's like, what was that, Eddie, is your thing, you have crossed the road, champagne!
297000	299000	That's kind of what it is, exactly.
299000	302000	But it's kind of cool because sometimes you gain levels when exploring.
302000	308000	I think I hit like level, one of the higher ones, like 68 or 69 exploring, and it was like vroom, new level.
308000	323000	Well, right now I'm, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of, and I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I brought a DVI to VGA converter.
323000	326000	Thing is the DVI side doesn't fit.
326000	328000	It's, I guess, completely different.
328000	332000	So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.
332000	335000	This is the one that Vandalus gave me.
335000	336000	Oh, nice.
336000	338000	Yes, before he left us.
338000	352000	But I, what we were going to do, we were going to put it in a different case so that I could add more stuff to it and use one of our newer cards so that I could use the other monitor.
352000	355000	And it works just fine with the graphics card that was in it.
355000	366000	And it's actually a pretty decent graphics card, but I want something that's going to be a little bit better before I hop back on Guild Wars because I am going to be going back to Guild Wars about once a week.
366000	367000	Sokka.
367000	368000	Hey.
368000	369000	I'm just kidding.
369000	370000	Guild Wars was kind of fun.
370000	371000	You got your account, man, as well, right?
371000	372000	Exactly, I know.
372000	377000	That's the one thing I always liked about Guild Wars is, like, it's always there for you to come back to, you know?
377000	378000	You bought the game.
378000	380000	There's no monthly fee or anything.
380000	381000	It's always there to come back.
381000	385000	Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this Dark Sakura, so I'm going to bring this up now.
385000	392000	I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message, and apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.
392000	393000	I know.
393000	395000	Until the server's shut down on March 31st.
395000	396000	I know.
396000	400000	So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?
400000	402000	I talked about it with Rama last night.
402000	403000	Ah.
403000	408000	And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.
408000	410000	Doh.
410000	411000	Doh.
411000	423000	Um, so I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so...
423000	427000	Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on.
427000	428000	She's playing PSU.
428000	430000	She was on Lost Planet the other night.
430000	431000	That's right.
431000	435000	I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?
435000	437000	And I was like, oh, it's Julie.
437000	438000	Wait, Julie?
438000	440000	Julie's playing Lost Planet?
440000	442000	Yeah, she hung out with us today.
442000	447000	We went to breakfast, and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.
447000	455000	And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead, but it's not the right one.
455000	456000	She actually bought it for me.
456000	459000	I thought I was really nice of her, because it was only, like, ten bucks.
459000	475000	And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount, and Dan used his gift card, and ended up getting one of those new PS3 remotes for twelve bucks.
475000	477000	So that was pretty cool.
477000	478000	Very cool.
478000	482000	They watched Ratatouille again, which is one of Dan's presents.
482000	483000	Aw.
483000	485000	I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.
485000	489000	And I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.
489000	490000	Well, who knows?
490000	496000	It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD kind of finishes.
496000	498000	Everybody's kind of jumping ship.
498000	503000	Yeah, well, I think it's still kind of up there, you know.
503000	510000	But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.
510000	513000	And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.
513000	514000	It was very good.
514000	515000	It was.
515000	516000	I heart that movie.
516000	517000	Did you like the new icon?
517000	518000	Yes, I did.
518000	519000	It was very nice.
519000	522000	I made an icon from my LiveJournal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.
522000	523000	You know what?
523000	529000	In Greek mythology, Lamia was the Queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.
529000	531000	So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.
531000	532000	Hot.
532000	533000	They should make a video game out of Stardust.
533000	535000	Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.
535000	536000	I do.
536000	537000	I don't know what it is.
537000	539000	It's the whole, like, swords and magic.
539000	542000	You know, music is very Oblivion-ish.
542000	545500	You can get it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with
545500	546500	it glowing green.
546500	548000	This has pulled my finger.
548000	549000	Hilarious.
549000	550000	I know.
550000	551000	I'm very proud of it.
551000	552000	All right.
552000	553000	It took, like, five seconds.
553000	555000	Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?
555000	556000	Why not?
556000	557000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
557000	558000	It was okay.
558000	563000	I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.
563000	564000	It's horrible.
564000	565000	I hate.
565000	567000	You know, I was still looking for it.
567000	568000	Sorry to hear it.
568000	572000	I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just, it's all, yay.
572000	575000	I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff.
575000	579200	Then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks, even though my character is in it,
579200	583000	which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.
583000	585000	I don't know.
585000	586000	Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.
586000	590000	I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penises Magic Pen Gel.
590000	591000	No, no.
591000	593440	That game is way better.
593440	598280	Then I played some more Crysis.
598280	603480	Actually I'm about to finish it, but that's where the game starts to really, really suck.
603480	608360	Apparently, I don't know, somewhere along the line of making the game, they decided
608360	615560	not to test the last level very much, and it has hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches
615560	620780	in it that make it almost impossible to play, and actually I have been unable to beat the
620780	624000	game because of these glitches.
624000	628320	You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your
628320	633480	strength mode or whatever, and so when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't
633480	635000	actually be able to be knocked down.
635000	636480	They'll get stuck.
636480	643720	And then some other times, you know, for example, one of the commanders or whatever, there's
643720	649760	supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.
649760	654120	Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand, and that's it.
654120	656720	He's just frozen, and nothing ever happens.
656720	660440	So you have to constantly restart the game, and it's just horrible.
660440	664160	It's like, if that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at
664160	667040	all because it was just that bad.
667040	671920	And even now, I've tried playing it through about ten different times, starting on saves
671920	676760	that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe, you know, something will
676760	679680	work this time, but it doesn't.
679680	681360	And I'm about fed up with it.
681360	686560	However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.
686560	689360	See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.
689360	694040	It's like a portable nuke launcher, so I mean, why did they have it at the beginning of the
694040	695040	game?
695040	696040	Because I would have loved to blow up chickens with that.
696040	697040	It would have been fun.
697040	698360	You have to work towards it.
698360	699360	I know.
699360	700360	You have to earn it.
700360	702040	Or I have to cheat really bad.
702040	704040	You need a chicken cannon.
704040	707080	And then, let's see, what else did I play?
707080	708080	I think that's about it.
708080	713760	It's just Saints Row, a little bit of Earth Defense Force still plugging away at that
713760	714760	game.
714760	719600	Alright, well, my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.
719600	724920	Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft, you know, there's not a lot of new games coming
724920	727920	out and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.
727920	731200	So really, the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the
731200	735240	week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games
735240	736240	ever.
736240	742520	You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.
742520	745080	You know what you need is the booth.
745080	751720	The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.
751720	754120	I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.
754120	758120	Basically if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four mini games
758120	759120	in one.
759120	764000	There's a lot of games in this period that were similar to it because honestly, the setup
764000	768440	of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey the arcade game, which is also
768440	770400	made up of four mini games.
770400	773560	But basically what you do in Tron, you know, there's one level that's based off the light
773560	776600	cycles and there's another where you're trying to enter the cone.
776600	778840	You've probably seen the pictures of that before.
778840	783160	And basically once you beat each of the four mini games, you get to do it all over again!
783160	784160	Yay!
784160	788920	Well, the addition of Xbox Live co-op is kind of cool, getting to play a two-player game
788920	790920	experience.
790920	794820	Five dollars though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and
794820	796640	age is worth too much more.
796640	799160	I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.
799160	801320	That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.
801320	802880	That'll be kind of cool.
802880	806680	Discs of Tron was very interesting.
806680	812280	I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.
812280	818280	The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play
818280	819680	the entire game.
819680	825560	It's just that when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and
825560	828960	more difficult each time.
828960	835480	The demo will give you a really good idea of what the game is all about.
835480	840040	Other than Tron, the other new game on Xbox Live this week was Omega 5, this new shooting
840040	841760	game that's out on Xbox Live Arcade.
841760	845000	And I'll tell you what, I kind of did a double take when I was playing the game because I'm
845000	847880	like, is this a PlayStation 2 game or an Xbox game?
847880	850960	And I'm not saying that to knock the graphics, because the graphics are actually pretty cool,
850960	854440	but this is not the type of game I'm used to seeing on the Xbox.
854440	858200	It's a shooter-rific game that I really would have thought would have been on the PlayStation
858200	860600	2, but it's in HD and widescreen.
860600	866240	I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.
866240	867820	You know, lots of bullets everywhere.
867820	868820	That's always fun.
868820	874160	Basically you can pick up these, you can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking
874160	878920	up these different power-ups and you can have lasers or spreading bullets and things of
878920	879920	that sort.
879920	884600	And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was
884600	885600	that you know?
885600	886840	Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.
886840	887840	I mean, I'll give it that.
887840	894520	Omega 5 is ten bucks, but it definitely reminds me of a Hay Day arcade Japanese-influenced
894520	895780	shooter, so definitely check it out.
895780	897820	The demo on that one is not bad either.
897820	901080	You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.
901080	903000	You do one mini-boss fight.
903000	907680	But it's pretty cool.
907680	913600	And of course there's always our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com and rostielut, quite
913600	917760	the smartass in our chatroom, the official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes
917760	918760	and ways.
918760	919760	No, I'm kidding.
919760	922520	He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.
922520	923520	You know what I mean.
923520	924520	I'm not talking about first-person shooters.
924520	930120	I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know?
930120	933400	This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too, and
933400	938100	some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.
938100	941400	So there you have it.
941400	943880	So that's really going to do it for our gaming week.
943880	948120	So now we're going to move on into some housekeeping, of which we don't have a whole lot to share.
948120	953200	I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished.
953200	959760	So if you were feeling there's not enough of the old-school classics and music from
959760	962320	video games and such, you're going to love the new rotation.
962320	965680	It's tons and tons of music from various video games.
965680	973480	We wanted to avoid the temptation of just dumping MP3s upon MP3s in there and just tried
973480	977660	to pick out songs that were a little more upbeat, radio-friendly, and the types of things
977660	980520	that you'd hear on the radio that will still remind you of the classics.
980520	981520	So check it out.
981520	985000	Give us your feedback in our forums at orangelaunchradio.com.
985000	987360	And one other thing is that there's a new show.
987360	989080	It's not a live show or a hosted show.
989080	993240	It's just a music show, but it airs every day from noon to 1230.
993240	996340	That's every day, Monday through Sunday, so every day.
996340	1001280	It's the retro lunch, so it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.
1001280	1002280	Just a little bit.
1002280	1003280	Don't overdo it.
1003280	1006840	But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.
1006840	1007840	So check that out.
1007840	1009840	Yep, lots of fun.
1009840	1013440	And some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they
1013440	1016680	will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station
1016680	1017680	right now and try to guess.
1017680	1018680	I used to do that.
1018680	1019680	Yeah.
1019680	1020680	It's fun.
1020680	1021680	It's fun.
1021680	1022680	So check that out.
1022680	1023680	All right.
1023680	1026200	Anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care
1026200	1027200	of.
1027200	1031640	It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody
1031640	1036880	everywhere wants to know, how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?
1036880	1042000	We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know the number.
1042000	1045920	So but this week we have an idea of how Eye of Judgment is doing.
1045920	1046920	Do we not?
1046920	1047920	Yes.
1047920	1052480	So now we have an actual place we can look to see how Eye of Judgment is doing thanks
1052480	1063160	to VGcharts.com and apparently you guys are up to.15 million copies to be exact actually
1063160	1072680	because that's just an estimate, 132,199 copies sold so far.
1072680	1073680	All right.
1073680	1076240	So how many does that mean we have left to go?
1076240	1078120	About 870,000.
1078120	1079120	Yeah.
1079120	1080120	All right.
1080120	1081480	Get to work.
1081480	1085480	For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of
1085480	1089680	Judgment could, if Eye of Judgment was actually, because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece
1089680	1094280	of shit, we call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program, and Loki says there's
1094280	1099640	no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies and if it does, he will don
1099640	1104220	a tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby
1104220	1107960	Blackwolf in a match of the Eye of Judgment, which by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.
1107960	1108960	I heard it on his show.
1108960	1110840	Oh, my own sake, it is actually 150,000.
1110840	1111840	150 million?
1111840	1112840	Oh shit.
1112840	1114840	We've got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.
1114840	1117840	No, I don't think so.
1117840	1120800	150 million, that'd be unheard of.
1120800	1123560	Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.
1123560	1133120	I didn't realize the 132,199 is just US, which is pretty impressive actually that the US
1133120	1134880	has actually sold that many copies.
1134880	1135880	Japan, not so much.
1135880	1143580	In fact, they're only up to 19,384, so no love in Japan for that stuff, but the US keeps
1143580	1144580	on chugging.
1144580	1146320	Now, is the game out in Europe yet?
1146320	1148760	The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?
1148760	1152640	Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.
1152640	1157400	According to this, that's not Europe though, let me see.
1157400	1158400	I don't think so.
1158400	1160680	No, it's not out in Europe yet.
1160680	1163520	So Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.
1163520	1172280	Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chat room and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.
1172280	1177040	If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon apparently,
1177040	1178040	so there you go.
1178040	1179040	You can buy it cheap.
1179040	1185040	I posted a link in the chat room where you can play along at home and we'll probably
1185040	1190760	post it in a thread or something in our forums so that you can watch the count.
1190760	1193080	So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show?
1193080	1195440	No, we can do it every month or so.
1195440	1199760	Maybe when it crosses milestones, when we get to 200,000 we'll mention it again, a quarter
1199760	1204400	million, then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows, if we keep going.
1204400	1210100	I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but I don't know, because there's
1210100	1211680	other stories we're getting into.
1211680	1212680	That's right.
1212680	1213840	Shall we get into these stories?
1213840	1217920	We shall get into these stories.
1217920	1225000	So the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.
1225000	1226000	Some more cards.
1226000	1229880	In fact, there's two of them.
1229880	1239640	Let's see, the Machine God's Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th and there's
1239640	1244520	also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in
1244520	1246640	the summer.
1246640	1248400	They said downloads, though.
1248400	1251360	That's not really new cards, though.
1251360	1255960	I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.
1255960	1257440	So how does this affect the bet?
1257440	1261760	I don't think it affects anything, because it's not actually selling anything.
1261760	1263080	Download content does not count.
1263080	1266740	But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of
1266740	1271180	Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?
1271180	1276680	If there's an expansion disc that comes, you know, including cards, obviously, because
1276680	1280120	I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.
1280120	1287080	But right now, and that's even kind of being a little generous, because seriously, I mean,
1287080	1288080	I don't know.
1288080	1289240	I think you want to wear that tingle outfit a little bit.
1289240	1293460	I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.
1293460	1295320	It will never sell one million units.
1295320	1296320	Ever.
1296320	1297320	Ever.
1297320	1300760	Even with expansions that are retail.
1300760	1301760	Retail expansions.
1301760	1303320	But download expansions, we couldn't really track anyway.
1303320	1304320	Exactly.
1304320	1305320	Tony doesn't release those numbers.
1305320	1307360	I'm not counting like fucking booster packs and shit like that, because that's just stuff
1307360	1308360	that we can't track.
1308360	1309360	All right.
1309360	1313120	You know, seriously, just if it's going to be sold like, you know, Warhawk or something
1313120	1317520	like that, where it's download content, and it's also, you know, sold as a retail disc,
1317520	1318520	then yeah, we'll count that.
1318520	1322160	But if it's like a fucking, you know, booster pack or some shit that they come out later
1322160	1323680	on, no, I'm sorry, that does not count.
1323680	1326440	Because they'll come out with one million booster packs.
1326440	1330000	Well no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that
1330000	1333400	they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.
1333400	1334400	That's stupid.
1334400	1335400	That's cheating.
1335400	1336400	That's not really a game.
1336400	1337680	We don't count, you know, the download content.
1337680	1339760	All right, well at least we have the bet clarified.
1339760	1344600	You have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover US sales,
1344600	1347200	but you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.
1347200	1351680	Yeah, and also it was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for
1351680	1352680	eternity, so.
1352680	1357520	All right, and SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession
1357520	1358520	behind us.
1358520	1359520	That might be a good point.
1359520	1360520	No.
1360520	1361520	Just to let this joke die.
1361520	1362520	No, I'm not wearing it.
1362520	1363520	All right.
1363520	1364520	I'm very confident.
1364520	1366480	If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.
1366480	1371840	I am very confident that this will never sell a million units, because it's the stupidest
1371840	1376160	thing I've ever seen, until they come out with something else that's even more retarded,
1376160	1378920	but right now it's pretty retarded.
1378920	1381760	All right.
1381760	1386760	Do you, now a good point brought up in chat here, Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly
1386760	1387840	buying Eye of Judgment.
1387840	1389960	Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?
1389960	1390960	Why?
1390960	1393080	I don't play card games, and no.
1393080	1394080	That's a no.
1394080	1395080	Just say no.
1395080	1399800	For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was
1399800	1403720	like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we converted it on the show anyways,
1403720	1405960	but I'm like, nah.
1405960	1406960	I'm not doing that.
1406960	1411120	You could just use your credit and get something good.
1411120	1412720	Why waste it?
1412720	1416640	Darkknight is in chat, DJ Darkknight says, get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the
1416640	1417640	suit.
1417640	1420840	She's not going to make me dress up.
1420840	1422240	That's stupid.
1422240	1424300	All right, let's move on.
1424300	1427320	Let's put this obsession behind us, shall we?
1427320	1431640	And talking about the PlayStation 3 a little more, Sony of Japan is going to discontinue
1431640	1433680	certain models of the PlayStation 3.
1433680	1437880	That would be the 20 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte models, and that's going to be discontinued
1437880	1440880	after one last shipment at the end of this month.
1440880	1444880	Sony will instead be focusing on the 40 gigabyte model.
1444880	1448500	The 40 gigabyte model, of course, is 40 gigabytes, whereas the other one was a little smaller
1448500	1449560	and a little larger.
1449560	1454320	But the other big change, oh yeah, it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility, which obviously
1454320	1457280	makes it a lot cheaper to produce.
1457280	1459400	So that's where they're headed in Japan.
1459400	1463200	Obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards
1463200	1464200	compatibility.
1464200	1467400	In Europe, well, shit, they never really had it.
1467400	1469640	But at least our main model is 80 gigabytes.
1469640	1474000	Of course, what I'm going to put on that PlayStation 3 on all that hard drive space, I'm not quite
1474000	1475000	sure yet.
1475000	1476000	Porn.
1476000	1477000	I guess porn.
1477000	1478640	I got a new hard drive this week, actually.
1478640	1483420	Like you, I have one of those little external drives now, because that's kind of the rage
1483420	1487560	right now, those external, like, what are they called?
1487560	1489160	The gigabooks or something?
1489160	1490160	I don't know what the hell they're called.
1490160	1491160	Travel books or whatever.
1491160	1494720	Well, William had one from his work he wasn't even using, and he's moving right now, and
1494720	1495720	he's like, you want this?
1495720	1498080	I'm like, sweet, porn drive!
1498080	1499080	Yoink.
1499080	1505480	I used mine when my computer was starting to die, when my Vio was, the Franken-Vio,
1505480	1507760	I should call it, was about to go.
1507760	1509320	So it's good for backing up stuff.
1509320	1510320	Yeah.
1510320	1511320	And porn.
1511320	1512320	I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.
1512320	1514000	For porn.
1514000	1516960	For Doctor Who episodes.
1516960	1520640	By the way, on YouTube, okay, here's how bored I was on YouTube the other night.
1520640	1524640	Like, I ended up watching an episode of The Weakest Link that had a bunch of Doctor Who
1524640	1525640	people on it.
1525640	1526640	It was like a Doctor Who special.
1526640	1527640	Oh, I want to see that one!
1527640	1528720	I've watched some of it.
1528720	1529720	It's all on YouTube.
1529720	1535200	Because, yeah, it was all of the people from the second season, I think.
1535200	1536840	Yeah, I want to see that.
1536840	1537840	Hey, Jamie.
1537840	1538840	Games.
1538840	1539840	Whatever.
1539840	1548000	Well, hey, guess who they're getting in Japan?
1548000	1549080	I could be a lot of things.
1549080	1550080	What?
1550080	1554920	They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.
1554920	1559560	Like, they need another color for a video game system.
1559560	1560560	Why mint green?
1560560	1561560	Well, look at the DS.
1561560	1562840	It works for the DS.
1562840	1563840	Why not the PSP?
1563840	1564840	I guess so.
1564840	1568800	Maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envious.
1568800	1570800	Why mint green of all colors?
1570800	1571800	I don't know.
1571800	1574920	Why not, you know, pink and red for Valentine's Day?
1574920	1576680	They made a Sakura one.
1576680	1583000	Well, a Sakura PS2 that I wanted that was metallic purple, and I was like, Cherry Blossom's
1583000	1584000	pink.
1584000	1585000	Why did you make it pink?
1585000	1586000	No, it's metallic purple.
1586000	1587000	Okay, fine.
1587000	1589240	I just wanted it for the name.
1589240	1592920	Maybe there was a surplus of purple paint in the Sony factory, and maybe that's what
1592920	1593920	it is.
1593920	1596820	The Sony factory, they have certain excess paint supplies.
1596820	1601400	They have some green left and they have some white left, and it's like, screw it, mix it,
1601400	1602400	paint some PSPs.
1602400	1603400	All right.
1603400	1605120	We'll call it mint green.
1605120	1607920	And call it run out of color green.
1607920	1611320	You should put it out in, like, Ireland.
1611320	1617520	Mint green, like an Olive Garden mint, which, by the way, made good on the promise.
1617520	1618520	We did.
1618520	1624600	We went to Olive Garden, and I had, what did I have, Seafood Alfredo.
1624600	1626920	Yes, and lots of never-ending breadsticks.
1626920	1629120	I know, and that really good meatball soup.
1629120	1631000	Yes, anyway, sorry.
1631000	1632400	Games, right?
1632400	1633400	Games.
1633400	1634400	Yeah.
1634400	1640080	So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming
1640080	1642920	to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.
1642920	1646600	Well, people were wondering why not the original PSP.
1646600	1647600	What the hell?
1647600	1652500	The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more
1652500	1653500	RAM in it.
1653500	1660680	So, being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, is the only system able to
1660680	1663260	handle Skype, apparently.
1663260	1667400	Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing
1667400	1668400	as Skype.
1668400	1675040	I don't know of one that they're working on right now, so, oh well, no Skype for you.
1675040	1678320	Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.
1678320	1681360	Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.
1681360	1684160	But then again, who am I really going to call on Skype?
1684160	1688720	I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.
1688720	1693360	It's just very inconvenient anyways, I mean seriously, you have to have, I think you have
1693360	1697000	to buy Skype for this, I don't know if it's going to be free, it may be free to use, but
1697000	1699360	I think you have to buy the software for it.
1699360	1705320	And then, once you've done that, you have to have a Wi-Fi spot and stuff, it's just
1705320	1708120	like, shit, once you've already got all that stuff, might as well just use your computer
1708120	1709120	to do it.
1709120	1710440	Or just fucking call them on the phone.
1710440	1714020	Yeah, but you know, I'm hearing from more and more people who are interacting with this
1714020	1715880	program on a PSP.
1715880	1720400	So you know, PSPs are basically becoming little mini computers that you have in your pocket.
1720400	1726120	You know, people take their PSP to Starbucks and they'll be sipping on a coffee, studying
1726120	1731720	for math class or something, and listening to our show, so that's kind of crazy.
1731720	1737160	So PSPs are kind of mini computers at this point.
1737160	1739120	PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.
1739120	1742520	Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not, but
1742520	1743520	one thing that is...
1743520	1746560	It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.
1746560	1751720	There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3 is that the cross-media
1751720	1756960	bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.
1756960	1759880	Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I
1759880	1764760	believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the
1764760	1767520	game, but that was something that the developers had to do.
1767520	1771920	There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar
1771920	1774440	to show up within a game.
1774440	1778780	And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every
1778780	1782480	game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that
1782480	1785520	the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.
1785520	1788160	Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.
1788160	1796960	Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.
1796960	1802360	However there was no news at CES, they instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales
1802360	1805920	or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.
1805920	1807800	Soon is the magic word, isn't it?
1807800	1809800	Of course.
1809800	1817080	Well, there is a little confirmation that it should make some people happy, and that
1817080	1819160	is about LittleBigPlanet.
1819160	1825040	It will be out in September, at least that's what Sony's saying, but you know, it's September
1825040	1830560	and not September X date, it's September, which is some time.
1830560	1833040	And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?
1833040	1834040	Yes.
1834040	1838960	It changed because Consumer Electronics Show, it seems like we're getting slightly more
1838960	1844480	gaming news out of CES this year, I use that word slightly, because usually CES is not
1844480	1845480	for games.
1845480	1855080	It's not a game show, it's a kitchenware, and 150,000 foot TVs, and all the George Foreman
1855080	1856080	grilling machines.
1856080	1857640	And robots to waltz with.
1857640	1861080	Yes exactly, and all that stuff, that's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show, you
1861080	1862080	don't see a lot of games.
1862080	1867080	But I feel like this year, at least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit
1867080	1868080	more gaming news.
1868080	1872960	I'm not saying we never got gaming news out of CES, but I feel like we got a little more
1872960	1878160	this year, and I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be, or what
1878160	1881080	the heck that's about, but I just thought that was interesting.
1881080	1886960	I'm not reading too much into that, I just thought it was interesting, that's all.
1886960	1892200	And then freakin' Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft Keynote, I
1892200	1895880	mean that was kind of interesting.
1895880	1899480	The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlant is coming out in September,
1899480	1902960	I mean wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?
1902960	1904960	And now it's like, oh I'm sorry.
1904960	1905960	Another Sony delay?
1905960	1906960	You don't say.
1906960	1907960	I know, it's crazy.
1907960	1911680	And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out, seriously, they keep advertising this
1911680	1915680	shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid
1915680	1921000	4, all these games that are out now, Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games
1921000	1925280	are out yet, and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy Playstation 3, good
1925280	1927520	stuff will be coming someday.
1927520	1932240	I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.
1932240	1936080	That's the problem though, even though they take their time on getting the product out,
1936080	1939260	it's still just average.
1939260	1943080	They can delay it all they want, it'll still be kind of eh.
1943080	1947500	I agree to an extent, I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think
1947500	1950400	they should never have launched the damn console when they did, I think they should have just
1950400	1954680	sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.
1954680	1959940	Well it's just like LittleBigPlanet, granted it's something that's pretty ambitious, but
1959940	1965220	don't fucking show this shit off like, oh it's coming out this fall, get everybody excited,
1965220	1969220	And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall, it's coming out this spring, or, okay,
1969220	1972440	great, spring comes along, oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring, it's coming
1972440	1973440	out in September.
1973440	1974440	You know, it's...
1974440	1975440	Okay.
1975440	1977440	You can do them forever.
1977440	1981680	And Akuta in our chat room at chat.ornisontisradio.com brings up a good point.
1981680	1985380	Wasn't Super Smash Brothers Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?
1985380	1987160	So is Sony the only bad guys here?
1987160	1988160	No, they're not.
1988160	1991800	And, you know, Nintendo's just as guilty for doing that kind of stuff.
1991800	1995320	Hyping up a game, you know, that's supposed to be coming out at some point, and then ends
1995320	1998960	up getting delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and...
1998960	2000820	And basically you all ruined Christmas.
2000820	2002160	But here's the thing, though.
2002160	2007160	Even still, so that they delay that one game, though, there's still other stuff coming out
2007160	2008160	that's good.
2008160	2013520	Whereas, you know, the PlayStation 3, a lot of their stuff is being delayed, and it's
2013520	2017240	not just one game, because one game, big deal, okay, so that gets delayed.
2017240	2020680	It's a lot of games being delayed, and it's consistent.
2020680	2022320	So that's the only thing that sucks.
2022320	2027440	And for anyone that just owns a PlayStation 3, you know, I'd be kind of disappointed.
2027440	2031200	I'd be pissed off if I owned just a PlayStation 3, because, you know, all these good games
2031200	2035240	come out for the 360, and then I have to wait months for the same thing to come out on the
2035240	2036240	PS3.
2036240	2037720	I don't know.
2037720	2038720	It's kind of unfair.
2038720	2043000	All right, well what else is Sony teasing for us?
2043000	2047760	Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games
2047760	2048760	on the system.
2048760	2054040	I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun, one of my favorite games on the
2054040	2058400	system, one of the few that I still own, because I love it so much.
2058400	2064040	Well this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60 player online death matches, which
2064040	2070720	is fucking crazy, eight player co-op, and two campaigns, one which is supposed to be
2070720	2075400	an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just, you know, standard single player
2075400	2076400	campaign.
2076400	2082280	60 player multiplayer matches, god I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.
2082280	2088920	Well from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48 player multiplayer death
2088920	2089920	matches.
2089920	2094560	So, you know, it's not so bad, and you have to remember though, not each one of these
2094560	2099880	PlayStation 3 consoles ships with a microphone, you have to buy that, you know, separately.
2099880	2100880	That's good.
2100880	2106520	So, they should make a new shooting game called The Right to Speak, and basically players
2106520	2109200	shoot each other to earn the right to speak into the microphone.
2109200	2114720	That would be funny, that should be just a mode in the game.
2114720	2118200	And there should be something where like if somebody is completely being a jerk, then
2118200	2123080	like everybody can like target that person and, you know, obliterate them to smithereens
2123080	2125640	and they lose the right to speak.
2125640	2126640	I like it.
2126640	2130500	Patent pending, that means I own all the rights to it, and if you try to put this in your
2130500	2131880	game, I'll sue you for a million dollars.
2131880	2135640	If you want more information though on Resistance 2, it's supposed to be in the new issue of
2135640	2136640	Game Informer.
2136640	2137640	Alrighty.
2137640	2143400	Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier, how it's becoming more and more
2143400	2144400	like a computer.
2144400	2149960	Well, there's one thing the PSP is sorely lacking, and that is a keyboard for now.
2149960	2153780	That's right, there is a PSP apparently.
2153780	2157960	It's something that Sony is actually developing themselves, first party.
2157960	2161720	It is, you know, consider it a rumor for right now, but it was something that GameSpot reported
2161720	2163240	on, so who knows.
2163240	2165960	It's supposed to arrive in the middle of 2009.
2165960	2167880	It's fucking lame.
2167880	2168880	It's a long ways out.
2168880	2169880	No, seriously, it's lame.
2169880	2172760	Homebrew has already had, you know, keyboard support for a long time.
2172760	2178300	It has a damn IR port on it, so you can use keyboards that are meant for PDAs.
2178300	2180800	Why the hell is it going to take them so long to develop a USB keyboard?
2180800	2184060	I mean, seriously, it's not that hard.
2184060	2185060	It's a keyboard.
2185060	2186060	You know why?
2186060	2188640	It's probably something that they want, it's a time thing.
2188640	2190920	They want to put it out in 2009 for a reason.
2190920	2194680	They're going to add something that you're going to want to have this keyboard for in
2194680	2195680	2009.
2195680	2196680	Hey, look, now you don't.
2196680	2199160	Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.
2199160	2200160	Ah, lame.
2200160	2201920	It's a time thing.
2201920	2202920	Just you wait.
2202920	2203920	It's still lame.
2203920	2207360	You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.
2207360	2208960	Why wait?
2208960	2213520	Because then, if you wait, then you put this thing out, nobody buys it because there's
2213520	2217200	nothing to use it for, so retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first
2217200	2218200	place?
2218200	2220600	Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.
2220600	2221600	I still think it's stupid.
2221600	2224240	It's not going to sell anyways if it's AIM.
2224240	2226120	That's stupid.
2226120	2227120	It's kind of like, you know what?
2227120	2232460	I would almost blame that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the
2232460	2233460	GameCube.
2233460	2234460	What do they call it?
2234460	2235760	The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.
2235760	2239520	There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody
2239520	2241220	could get into at the time.
2241220	2242720	So where did those things end up?
2242720	2245760	In the bargain bins, developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them
2245760	2246760	are out there.
2246760	2248760	It was kind of like a damning cycle.
2248760	2252560	What should have happened is that at that time, Nintendo should have come out and said,
2252560	2256720	we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.
2256720	2261360	F-Zero is going to support the, you know, how awesome would an F-Zero GX have been if
2261360	2263520	it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?
2263520	2267360	Like a completely different kind of game than PSO, right?
2267360	2270360	I can't see Nintendo putting an online game.
2270360	2271360	I know.
2271360	2274840	I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.
2274840	2275840	I don't know.
2275840	2277240	I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.
2277240	2283320	Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking
2283320	2284320	off that.
2284320	2287000	I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really
2287000	2291080	a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online
2291080	2292080	thing.
2292080	2296200	I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger
2296200	2297200	for the PSP.
2297200	2304200	They've already got Java stuff that works for it, I mean, it works on cell phones.
2304200	2305200	What the hell's taken them so long?
2305200	2308680	I mean, seriously, this system's been out for a few years now.
2308680	2312100	I don't understand why there would be these two-year delays for this shit.
2312100	2313100	They're playing Eye of Judgment.
2313100	2316680	Yeah, they're too busy playing Eye of Judgment, exactly.
2316680	2321800	Well, this is a happy rumor, although, you know, it's also said that we might be getting
2321800	2329080	Parappa 2, but, you know, hey, they're talking about putting Vibribin out for the European
2329080	2330080	PSN.
2330080	2335060	I think that's pretty cool, although, you know, they also, like I said, mentioned Parappa
2335060	2338840	as well, but has that happened?
2338840	2339840	No.
2339840	2346480	So, but hey, Vibribin's great for anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what Vibribin
2346480	2347480	is.
2347480	2356120	It's a vector-animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.
2356120	2358080	I have some mood-setting music.
2358080	2359080	Okay.
2359080	2368120	It had, I think, like eight tracks or something, this is one of them built into the game.
2368120	2375040	And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.
2375040	2379120	And the way that you play the game is you, you know, you start the game and you can actually
2379120	2380120	put in your own CDs.
2380120	2384480	And we tried to do it to, what did we call it?
2384480	2386360	TDR music, like Max 300 and stuff.
2386360	2392360	Yeah, we tried to do it to, what did we call it, oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania,
2392360	2393360	yeah.
2393360	2397080	We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300, and we tried to pick as
2397080	2401600	many fast and retarded stuff as we could, and did it end up being, like, some Polteri
2401600	2403080	song that was really hard instead?
2403080	2406120	I think it was colors.
2406120	2412320	The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, you
2412320	2414880	know, designing your own levels with your own music.
2414880	2416600	But it was kind of cool, nevertheless.
2416600	2421880	And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.
2421880	2422880	It was pretty cool.
2422880	2426800	And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.
2426800	2429760	And I hope it comes out.
2429760	2431120	I want it over here, though.
2431120	2432760	GS68 has a brilliant idea.
2432760	2435320	You can play that game with Dragon Force now.
2435320	2436320	You know what I could do?
2436320	2437320	What?
2437320	2440440	I could do that, because I have VibRibbon.
2440440	2445440	I saw a copy of VibRibbon sitting at Network Video, may you rest in peace.
2445440	2447100	That's what we need to do for our little piece.
2447100	2450360	I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force, so
2450360	2452020	we need to make that happen with VibRibbon.
2452020	2453960	So you need to dust off your copy, because we're going to be doing that.
2453960	2454960	I found it.
2454960	2455960	Good.
2455960	2456960	I found my copy.
2456960	2457960	Get that ready.
2457960	2458960	More like Dance Factory.
2458960	2461440	I picked up VibRibbon for 40 bucks, and I got an original, and I've never regretted
2461440	2462440	it.
2462440	2463440	Awesome.
2463440	2464440	Awesome.
2464440	2467080	Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?
2467080	2468080	Probably.
2468080	2469080	Alright.
2469080	2470080	Sucka.
2470080	2471080	Although, I could just pop it in my PS2.
2471080	2479240	This is the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet, because we found the cartridge
2479240	2484600	and our Super Nintendo, so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing, okay?
2484600	2485600	Alright.
2485600	2489860	Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff, not online, but stuff you can actually
2489860	2491080	walk into a store and buy.
2491080	2496080	Yes, in the US, it's the smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy,
2496080	2503040	most of which is the latter, including Kid Sports Ice Hockey for the Wii, yet another
2503040	2510920	game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good, FlatOut Head On on the PSP,
2510920	2516540	that's a FlatOut 2 port, so that should be pretty fun, History Channel Lost Worlds on
2516540	2522140	the PC, Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii, which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails
2522140	2534360	samurai game, Furu Furu Park on the Wii, only $20, a bunch of little mini games by Majesco,
2534360	2540240	Miami Nights Singles in the City for the DS, I don't know if it's any better than Sprung,
2540240	2545480	but I guess we'll have to see, Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose
2545480	2551760	to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike 64, and it's kind of the same
2551760	2558280	thing, it's bikes with rockets on them, and then The Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and The
2558280	2568760	Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out, Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to
2568760	2580400	$30, and finally, let's see here, Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle,
2580400	2585160	and that's coming out as well, enough pirate games, enough, I was going to say though there
2585160	2589440	is something kind of funny that's coming out next week, also happens to be by Destineer
2589440	2599520	though, Kawasaki Jet Ski, this one looks almost identical to Waveray 64, so that might be
2599520	2602240	pretty cool, and that's it.
2602240	2605440	Alright then let's head on over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there in
2605440	2611160	Japan, not a lot sadly, but if you have an Xbox 360 in Japan, you're one of the few,
2611160	2616840	you have Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights to look forward to, which comes out on January 17th,
2616840	2621400	going over to other systems on the Playstation 3, Juiced 2 for some reason comes out a week
2621400	2626480	later, go figure, it comes out the week of January 24th, I guess Juiced takes longer
2626480	2630660	to produce for Sony Systems, I couldn't tell you, on the Nintendo Wii things look a little
2630660	2636720	better because you get Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th, and Sonic Riders Shooting
2636720	2639240	Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
2639240	2643320	Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking
2643320	2646000	at the patient with a knife?
2646000	2649680	You know what, Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007, like it was
2649680	2653800	on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not had the time amongst all
2653800	2657900	the other games that came out, but I will get to that very soon.
2657900	2662640	Also on the Playstation 2 this week, you get Juiced 2, but you get a game called Lucky
2662640	2668800	Star comes out this week, Lucky Star looks to be probably based off another anime, it's
2668800	2674640	an adventure game, and that's really all I know, except there's two chicks holding hands
2674640	2679440	on the front cover, but one's an angel, so I don't think it's Lesbians or anything like
2679440	2681700	that.
2681700	2685120	That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?
2685120	2691120	Oh shit I fucked up, Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week, don't, sorry.
2691120	2695180	You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star which is
2695180	2700160	also released next week, however this week you can get a game called School Days, School
2700160	2705520	Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kinda
2705520	2710160	arm in arm like they're BFFs, and they're wearing school girl uniforms so you know this
2710160	2714360	will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe.
2714360	2720000	Moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, a game called From the Abyss makes its
2720000	2723680	way to the Nintendo DS, and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think
2723680	2726840	this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS, oh I guess it is, there's the box art and
2726840	2731160	stuff, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS, I always thought
2731160	2735080	that was a Wii only game, go figure, that comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in
2735080	2742600	Japan, and lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing, nothing for the PSP, but you have a price
2742600	2746880	reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week, so there you have it, your Japanese
2746880	2747880	release dates.
2747880	2756520	Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe, we have Balls of Fury, that's great.
2756520	2759240	That's based off a movie that didn't do very well.
2759240	2767160	Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Night's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost
2767160	2773560	picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team
2773560	2782400	in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure, and that's it.
2782400	2787560	I just say save your money, well get nights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles
2787560	2790760	later that month.
2790760	2794320	You know, I will never understand our chat room in the way they think sometimes, because
2794320	2796760	you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?
2796760	2803240	So SSG100Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup, dating sim for DS, or now, you know,
2803240	2808760	two girls, one cup is now 2007, but now you have, you know, because obviously something
2808760	2813740	much more hardcore came out apparently recently, and Cory31 suggests that four girls finger
2813740	2818600	paint would make a good DS Wii game.
2818600	2820880	Sick!
2820880	2823840	Gotta keep up on the internet, you all are sick!
2823840	2828860	There you go, BlackWolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better, absolutely.
2828860	2829860	Date Dragon Force, the game.
2829860	2830860	You know what I want?
2830860	2834440	They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.
2834440	2835440	Really?
2835440	2837840	Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.
2837840	2842920	Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.
2842920	2848920	Alright, well it was announced this week that two secret characters are going to be coming
2848920	2853640	to Soul Calibur IV, although I don't really know how an announcement makes it secret,
2853640	2859680	but anyways, Darth Vader and Yoda are coming to Soul Calibur IV.
2859680	2865480	The only bad thing about it is, one is coming to each version, so if you get the Playstation
2865480	2869840	3 version, you happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.
2869840	2873040	If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.
2873040	2877080	I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.
2877080	2879440	Cue all the Xbox fans going, noooooo!
2879440	2882880	Hey, I can't get them both!
2882880	2883880	Exactly!
2883880	2884880	Why?
2884880	2885880	Why?
2885880	2886880	Why would you buy them both?
2886880	2887880	That is exactly why they did this shit.
2887880	2888880	That was sarcasm, by the way.
2888880	2889880	Okay, thank god.
2889880	2890880	But it's also going to come over there and beat you.
2890880	2894880	But I'm going to get the PS3 version.
2894880	2899280	Well, yeah, but this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off
2899280	2904240	of Soul Calibur IV, they went back and based it off of Soul Calibur II.
2904240	2905520	A balanced version.
2905520	2910320	Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?
2910320	2913360	It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur II.
2913360	2917080	Yeah, but I don't have a problem with, you know, Link not being on the Playstation, because
2917080	2918220	that doesn't make any sense.
2918220	2923200	Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a Playstation or something like
2923200	2924820	that?
2924820	2928500	This they're, you know, not really specific to any console.
2928500	2931840	It's not like you have the Darth Vader game on the Playstation 3 or anything like that.
2931840	2933560	It's just fucking lazy is what it is.
2933560	2934560	What happened to Blu-ray?
2934560	2936960	I thought Blu-ray can hold all this, like, data and stuff.
2936960	2938680	Why can't you fit Yoda on there?
2938680	2942480	It's just being, you're just being an asshole is what you're being.
2942480	2946760	And to be honest, I'd rather have the Playstation 3 version with Darth Vader, and I'm sure Sony
2946760	2948800	paid money to have, you know, Darth Vader on there.
2948800	2953100	I will buy the Xbox 360 version because I love Soul Calibur, and you know what?
2953100	2956520	You know why else I don't care which of these versions I pick up?
2956520	2960120	Because Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!
2960120	2961600	Why did that happen in the first place?
2961600	2962600	That is stupid.
2962600	2966160	Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts to have a crazy-looking
2966160	2967160	Yoda.
2967160	2968160	It looks stupid.
2968160	2971560	I looked at the screenshots of, like, Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever, and I'm just
2971560	2975160	going like, I just rolled my eyes, I'm like, this looks dumb.
2975160	2977880	This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.
2977880	2981080	No, no, no, did you hear what their original intent was?
2981080	2986040	The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fight
2986040	2987040	characters.
2987040	2991440	Oh my god, he's going to ruin his own franchise.
2991440	2993720	He said that would have been his pick, but apparently someone-
2993720	2994720	What's next?
2994720	2995720	Klonoa?
2995720	2996720	Apparently-
2996720	2997720	Klonoa would be awesome, though.
2997720	2998720	Screw you!
2998720	2999720	Hey, I like-
2999720	3000720	Apparently someone beat with that.
3000720	3002480	Klonoa is one of my favorite games ever.
3002480	3005520	I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.
3005520	3008240	I thought it was cool to have Link in it.
3008240	3009680	Link made sense.
3009680	3015280	Link also a swordsy and, you know, is swords and sorcery type of character.
3015280	3016280	Ha-Hachi?
3016280	3018440	Okay, I can, we'll let that one slide, that makes sense.
3018440	3022560	How long have they had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?
3022560	3023560	Well Yoshi-
3023560	3025600	Is they the Soul Calibur character forever?
3025600	3027480	At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.
3027480	3029360	Oh, it just doesn't, it doesn't fit.
3029360	3030360	Ha-Hachi has a diaper.
3030360	3031360	You know what they're doing?
3031360	3034560	They're fucking, they're fucking this over like they would Tekken, where they just start
3034560	3036840	putting all this ridiculous shit in there.
3036840	3039720	Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears and-
3039720	3042320	Okay, Tekken has always been that way though.
3042320	3046820	Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken because they can.
3046820	3049800	And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb too.
3049800	3050800	Exactly.
3050800	3053640	Well actually, I don't know, a panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.
3053640	3061040	Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in, oh my god.
3061040	3063200	No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?
3063200	3064200	Yes!
3064200	3065200	That's what I thought.
3065200	3070160	Devil and Angel and everybody and the gold band just says, secret character, your mom.
3070160	3073600	Last night, Devil Jin was awesome by the way.
3073600	3076440	Do not ever poop on Devil Jin.
3076440	3081000	I would not, I would not be surprised if we saw a Soul Calibur versus Tekken game.
3081000	3082200	Ooh, I'd buy it.
3082200	3083320	That actually would kind of rock.
3083320	3088800	I don't know why, like I'm being a total hypocrite, but I don't care because that idea is actually
3088800	3089800	kind of cool to me.
3089800	3092880	But here's the other thing, okay, when I look at this and I see the Star Wars characters,
3092880	3098440	I'm like, why doesn't Namco just like do an all Star Wars fighting game?
3098440	3102520	Now I know, now before the chat room jumps, I know there already was one like back on
3102520	3105600	the Playstation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.
3105600	3106600	Like not a lot of people remember.
3106600	3109240	Because you made a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good
3109240	3110240	game.
3110240	3111240	Exactly.
3111240	3113440	You can, I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.
3113440	3116200	Star Wars, there were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?
3116200	3117800	These games have been coming out forever.
3117800	3122240	So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know like using the
3122240	3126680	Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.
3126680	3128280	That would be all kinds of awesome.
3128280	3130960	I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.
3130960	3131960	That would be kind of awesome.
3131960	3133960	Because I love Soul Calibur.
3133960	3137060	Somebody in my life journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really
3137060	3138320	like other fighting games.
3138320	3139320	It's true.
3139320	3140680	I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.
3140680	3144240	I liked Gon from Tekken 3, and that's about it.
3144240	3149480	Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.
3149480	3154760	Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.
3154760	3156560	And you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2?
3156560	3160240	It's the crappy spinoff games happening too, like the Legends game.
3160240	3164680	Like what's her, oh god, what's her name from Tekken got her own spinoff game?
3164680	3165680	Death by degree.
3165680	3167560	Death by playing this game.
3167560	3171120	Here's the thing that really sucks about that whole Soul Calibur game, other than the fact
3171120	3173120	that it was just crap.
3173120	3176200	I don't understand why they couldn't do a fighting game on, you know, the Wii.
3176200	3180680	In fact, I remember seeing someone comment on why don't they just take the engine from
3180680	3187160	Soul Calibur 2 for the GameCube and just port it over to the Wii, maybe update the graphics
3187160	3190320	a little bit, and put new characters in it.
3190320	3194400	Or add some of the characters from Soul Calibur 4 and you can have its own series on the Wii
3194400	3199120	that maybe not as pretty, but still just as effective.
3199120	3203280	RossdielUT in chat says, Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.
3203280	3206320	Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.
3206320	3212320	Like I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game
3212320	3218520	with massive boobage, and this game will move a zillion copies on the first day.
3218520	3220440	Just you wait.
3220440	3222600	Mark my words.
3222600	3231400	Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Taras Kasi, leave it to slumber in its grave,
3231400	3237000	no zombie apocalypse.
3237000	3241600	Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords, they will cut
3241600	3242600	through them.
3242600	3243960	In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.
3243960	3246800	Oh I'm sorry, let me read that the way it should have been read.
3246800	3250960	I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.
3250960	3254480	I mean, come on.
3254480	3257880	It's a video game dude, seriously.
3257880	3258880	Just giving you a hard time.
3258880	3264120	I'm trying to apply real world physics, and why am I even calling the Star Wars universe
3264120	3265120	real world physics?
3265120	3266480	Did you just say Jedi physics?
3266480	3268360	No, real world physics.
3268360	3269360	Oh sorry.
3269360	3270360	Not Jedi physics.
3270360	3273080	That would make me even more retarded.
3273080	3276440	Seriously, who cares, it's just a fucking game.
3276440	3280760	They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.
3280760	3283880	What they do need though, they need to get some Star Trek characters.
3283880	3284880	I want to see Kirk.
3284880	3287680	That's right, Kirk vs Picard, let's settle this shit right now.
3287680	3290880	That would be funny, I would love to see that.
3290880	3294080	I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.
3294080	3296680	It's done up like one of those motivational posters.
3296680	3300680	It's a picture of Kirk just grinning, and it says, I'm sorry I can't hear you over the
3300680	3302440	sound of how awesome I am.
3302440	3307440	I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it, like Kirk, I want to see
3307440	3311800	Adam West playing Adam West, and you know, just weird shit like that.
3311800	3312800	Loki Fighter 2008?
3312800	3313800	Hell yeah.
3313800	3314800	There you go.
3314800	3322040	All right, Black Wolf says, the Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields
3322040	3323040	down to 85%.
3323040	3325420	I'm sorry, let me reread that.
3325420	3331720	The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.
3331720	3333680	Please let's change the topic, pretty please.
3333680	3335760	It's my turn, it sure is.
3335760	3341520	Microsoft has made a comment about Xbox 360 backwards compatibility.
3341520	3346560	It was Albert Piniello, the group marketing manager for the Xbox 360, he said this to
3346560	3351200	Kotaku earlier in the week, quote, I don't know if we have plans to do any more releases
3351200	3356280	in regards to backwards compatibility, quote, it feels like we kind of hit the point of
3356280	3358240	diminishing returns there.
3358240	3362180	So in other words, if you were hoping for more games to become backwards compatible,
3362180	3365000	you can just keep on hoping.
3365000	3368860	And of course, everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible,
3368860	3371480	but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.
3371480	3372960	Buy new games.
3372960	3376480	Or better yet, don't sell off your old system.
3376480	3377480	There you go.
3377480	3378480	Problem solved.
3378480	3383600	I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah, but especially in light of now that
3383600	3388480	they've launched this download Xbox originals thing where they can charge more money for
3388480	3392440	games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.
3392440	3395880	Unless they do an update, watch this, this is what they'll do.
3395880	3399160	They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.
3399160	3402440	They'll only update it to do a download game or something.
3402440	3405760	Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution
3405760	3411420	games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat, because really that's really
3411420	3415280	the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games, because
3415280	3417520	you know, they're a good workout, right?
3417520	3421000	So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?
3421000	3424880	But I could just see Microsoft making those games backwards compatible and then releasing
3424880	3428880	them on the download service and not putting out a patch.
3428880	3431520	That's what they're talking about when they say diminishing returns.
3431520	3432520	Bastards.
3432520	3437080	It means, diminishing returns means they're not really going to sell that many copies
3437080	3440960	of Xbox games as soon as they don't make them anymore, and what the hell do they care?
3440960	3445120	I do agree, it is kind of like, Xbox was what, like three years ago now?
3445120	3446960	So it's kind of over, but...
3446960	3451620	They play quite a few games, I mean if you're so bent out of shape that you can't play your
3451620	3456300	copy of I don't know what, but you know, some obscure game out there, then just fucking
3456300	3457440	buy an Xbox.
3457440	3462480	I'm sure original Xboxes, assuming you don't have one already, are probably pretty damn
3462480	3463480	cheap right now.
3463480	3468320	Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds, and they're like an eyesore in my living room.
3468320	3470680	I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.
3470680	3474040	But you still have an original Xbox.
3474040	3475040	I do, and you know where it is?
3475040	3478440	It's in that drawer right there, the closed drawer right there.
3478440	3481480	Well, how often do you play Xbox games?
3481480	3487200	I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible, but they're not.
3487200	3490120	Well, that's just Konami, they don't like you.
3490120	3491120	I guess that's what it is.
3491120	3492600	We sometimes break out our old stuff.
3492600	3494200	Well, you're crazy.
3494200	3496760	You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.
3496760	3498320	Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?
3498320	3499320	What?
3499320	3502260	The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.
3502260	3503260	Just because.
3503260	3504260	Just because.
3504260	3505260	Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.
3505260	3512760	Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin
3512760	3513760	today.
3513760	3514760	Dust off the Genesis.
3514760	3515760	Let's get it out.
3515760	3517360	Yeah, we do that.
3517360	3518360	Sometimes.
3518360	3521560	But we've brought out our Xbox before to play old stuff.
3521560	3523440	Just depends.
3523440	3531960	Well, this is something interesting, though, to come out of CES, is the Force Feedback
3531960	3539040	Suit by TN Games, which I think is kind of stupid, but I figured it was worth a mention
3539040	3549360	because you, it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch.
3549360	3553400	Like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets, like, punched in the chest,
3553400	3556240	you'll feel it as just pressure.
3556240	3563080	And it's, you know, meant for, it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion,
3563080	3568120	but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out.
3568120	3578920	So it actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for, like, a light
3578920	3584560	hit or blow air past you if something misses you.
3584560	3590320	So it's more for, I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why
3590320	3591320	anyone would want one.
3591320	3593640	Yeah, it's too, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.
3593640	3597040	If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an Air
3597040	3599000	Zuka while I play a game.
3599000	3601120	Screw the Air Zuka, I'll just have a can.
3601120	3606920	Well, they have those, was it, I don't remember the, like, ambient FX or something like that.
3606920	3612320	It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.
3612320	3617600	So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.
3617600	3621480	I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on
3621480	3623200	what's in the game.
3623200	3626400	I'm laughing at RobWithTwoBees in the chat room.
3626400	3628120	It says, how does it play with rez?
3628120	3629120	That's a good question.
3629120	3630120	That'd be funny.
3630120	3631120	That might be kind of fun.
3631120	3632120	All right.
3632120	3633120	Well, let's keep it moving.
3633120	3638840	Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.
3638840	3648480	Anyways, so, Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.
3648480	3649480	Good luck.
3649480	3652600	Because right now you're not off to a good start.
3652600	3654200	What does that mean, most reliable?
3654200	3656200	I don't know.
3656200	3662320	He basically says, he says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.
3662320	3665520	Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.
3665520	3668080	Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.
3668080	3673600	Does most reliable mean, like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on
3673600	3676400	the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?
3676400	3678300	I don't know.
3678300	3685240	But I don't know how they can claim that even, I understand that they want to be the most
3685240	3692200	reliable, but I want to be rich, and I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable,
3692200	3694640	so I don't know.
3694640	3696200	All right.
3696200	3700680	Well, one thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox originals will make its
3700680	3705000	way to the Xbox Live Marketplace, and one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Take
3705000	3706000	Down.
3706000	3709040	Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.
3709040	3713360	But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries
3713360	3717840	in the long-running Burnout series, I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout
3717840	3723020	Paradise or anything like that, but yeah, Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th
3723020	3726560	to the Xbox 360 console as a downloadable original.
3726560	3733280	It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about 1,499.
3733280	3737480	Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360, so
3737480	3738480	yeah.
3738480	3740800	Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?
3740800	3741800	Yeah.
3741800	3742800	That's coming out.
3742800	3745960	Yeah, I liked it better than Revenge anyway, so.
3745960	3746960	Recommend it if you don't have it.
3746960	3748320	Yeah, Take Down's a good game.
3748320	3752360	I would also recommend it, and it's, yeah, it plays well on the backwards compatibility
3752360	3754360	and all that good stuff, so.
3754360	3761040	Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer
3761040	3763120	that got pooped on?
3763120	3767440	Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy, well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.
3767440	3768440	Whatever happened?
3768440	3769440	Oh, yeah, I know what happened.
3769440	3773400	Nobody else left GameSpot, too, because of that earlier this week.
3773400	3778560	Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked Gerstmann as why he was leaving.
3778560	3781840	You know what's funny, though, is there's been like some other independent reviewers
3781840	3786280	also leaving, and I'm just like, I don't care what, you're trying to like, you know, be
3786280	3787480	all noble and stuff.
3787480	3790160	Other people have done it before you, who cares?
3790160	3796680	Well, the game in question, Kane & Lynch Dead Men, sold a million copies.
3796680	3800460	So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going
3800460	3803840	to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind
3803840	3804840	of stuff on the internet.
3804840	3806840	It probably helped, if anything.
3806840	3809120	I want to see what the drama's about.
3809120	3813560	It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.
3813560	3817320	There's no such thing as bad press, you know, that'd be great.
3817320	3821280	This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.
3821280	3822680	Loki made a really big funny.
3822680	3825440	It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.
3825440	3826920	Exactly.
3826920	3829840	All right.
3829840	3833960	Well I think parents just bought this game for their kids, well actually you really shouldn't
3833960	3836920	buy this game for your kids, so I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas
3836920	3838720	tree, but quite a few people, apparently.
3838720	3841880	I'm sure kids have it, because their parents don't care.
3841880	3846760	Well, Billy wants Kane & Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for
3846760	3847760	him.
3847760	3850560	What's this M mean on the front of the package?
3850560	3852080	M means it's...
3852080	3853080	Must have!
3853080	3855560	It's magnificent.
3855560	3859600	M for magnificent, okay.
3859600	3867480	So one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess, I
3867480	3869840	don't know why they're doing it, but they did.
3869840	3874080	So now ResHD will be supporting...
3874080	3876640	I'm sorry, this is too good.
3876640	3878960	Black Wolf says, oh, M is for Miners.
3878960	3879960	Miners?
3879960	3881760	Yeah, there you go.
3881760	3882760	Sorry, go ahead.
3882760	3889400	So ResHD is going to be supporting trans vibration, in the form of your other controllers, so
3889400	3895440	one person can play, and three other people can be pleasured, awesome.
3895440	3900920	So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers, one to play the game,
3900920	3901920	three in your pants.
3901920	3906320	Why can't they support just the Res trans vibrator, I mean, it's just a USB device,
3906320	3911720	and if they built in the driver for it, why don't they support it, because that'd be kind
3911720	3913000	of cool.
3913000	3918440	Okay, so they're going to spend money to, you know, engineer this whole stupid thing
3918440	3923040	on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans
3923040	3924040	vibrator.
3924040	3926040	Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?
3926040	3927040	No I actually don't.
3927040	3932960	See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one, I'm telling you right now.
3932960	3934760	I've been looking for one.
3934760	3939080	And cue the emails of everybody who has one emailing me telling me I'm wrong.
3939080	3945240	Just reverse engineer a trans vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that, or
3945240	3947160	like a dildo or something.
3947160	3953240	SSJ100Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week, during list lists,
3953240	3956920	remember how we were doing the list lists, and it was the gadgets we most want to see
3956920	3960880	at CES, remember the Foreman grill, the grill's the entire cow one, right, we had like the
3960880	3962560	Holodeck in there and all that stuff, right?
3962560	3968480	Remember SSJ100Matt, his entire list got eliminated, and his list was gone.
3968480	3972480	One of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator.
3972480	3976000	Oh we don't need it, we have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.
3976000	3979600	No but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually
3979600	3985160	announced in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now...
3985160	3988960	I don't know why you would need a trans vibrator anyways, it's kind of weird, but...
3988960	3992160	Well congratulations SSJ100Matt for being correct.
3992160	3997520	It'll be fun though to put the controller on like stuff that rattles, you know, like
3997520	4003000	my coffee table and stuff like that so it'll be really loud and annoying.
4003000	4009280	I'm sure your wife will love that.
4009280	4013680	One thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes
4013680	4018880	a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.
4018880	4023920	That's right, it's the classic video game of the week, brought to us by Dark Sakura.
4023920	4027160	Dark Sakura, what games have you picked for the masses this week?
4027160	4032760	The game of the week is Bongio, which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure
4032760	4035360	game on top of that, which makes it even more awesome.
4035360	4039080	Two treasure games in a row, aha!
4039080	4040080	But you can do that.
4040080	4041080	I can.
4041080	4048560	The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan, and it has come out on the Dreamcast.
4048560	4055600	In fact I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played
4055600	4061920	a bunch of it, it's really crazy because like you go around and, well actually I think it's
4061920	4067480	kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version has a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.
4067480	4068480	It's pretty cool.
4068480	4071440	So if you got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!
4071440	4080400	But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can do like a bajillion
4080400	4084080	shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.
4084080	4089360	And I believe that the maximum number of like bullets you personally can shoot out at one
4089360	4092600	time is like 400 I think.
4092600	4098600	It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small, but when you think
4098600	4105320	about everything else that's going in the game, it makes sense, you get a lot of action
4105320	4106320	going on at one time.
4106320	4115760	With the Dreamcast it makes some changes from the Nintendo 64 version, you have a sort of
4115760	4119960	an explosion counter instead of the combo system and you don't have a shot that you
4119960	4125400	can buy stuff from the Nintendo 64 version.
4125400	4133040	Your special attacks are based on the amount of incoming fire, so you don't have to charge
4133040	4140000	for it, the more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.
4140000	4144000	Everybody also, all the characters were equalized as far as their powers are concerned, there's
4144000	4151280	additional bosses, two new enemies which are a flamethrower and a giant egg, just little
4151280	4153720	things, you know, graphical changes.
4153720	4161640	But there was a sequel that came out which was Bongayo Spirits that's actually in development
4161640	4163440	with DS.
4163440	4167600	I was going to say that Dark Hetsuya and Chao were saying something about DS and Xbox Live
4167600	4169000	Arcade rumors as well.
4169000	4172760	I've been hearing some of that too, but I'm definitely going to be getting Bongayo
4172760	4173760	Spirits.
4173760	4178760	It's actually going to be coming out in Japan as Bongayo Tamashiki.
4178760	4184800	So the Bongayo goodness lives on, but for now we pay tribute to the original Bongayo,
4184800	4188880	apparently Dreamcast version over the Nintendo 64.
4188880	4194360	I have actually once played a Nintendo 64 version, there are some differences, I actually
4194360	4196240	think the Dreamcast version is a lot more balanced.
4196240	4201640	Well there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bongayo.
4201640	4202880	Love it, play it.
4202880	4208320	Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio this week, but fear
4208320	4211440	not the show isn't done just yet, we're going to come back and we're going to have ourselves
