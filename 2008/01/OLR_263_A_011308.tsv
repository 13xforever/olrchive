13920	19222	Tonight, January 13th, 2008, some PlayStation 3 models are discontinued in Japan.
19562	25085	The worlds of Soul Calibur and Star Wars collide, and can Resident Evil be returning to arcades?
27646	35409	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35469	37850	We are that video game show on the internet.
38257	42701	Dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42801	43842	My name is Rob Roberts.
44343	48106	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48567	48807	Hi.
49087	50569	Our show's very own bionic woman.
51049	51289	Hi.
51550	53211	Who hearts pirates, according to her shirt.
53391	55814	Or I guess not heart, but she skulls pirates.
55854	56454	I skulls pirates.
56834	58156	So that means you collect their skulls?
58737	58997	Yes.
59117	59857	Like shrunken heads?
59957	61658	Like PvP and Ragnarok, yo.
61738	63338	That means skull fuck.
63738	68299	And, of course, the other voice you hear over there, the ever-giggly Techmaster Loki.
68659	71339	Sorry, I was watching Crisis YouTube videos.
71719	72119	I see.
72280	79621	Because you have to understand, Rob, I've explained a little bit the draw of this game and how I get distracted by the wildlife that's in it.
80181	85482	Well, there's chickens, and there's also the sandbox editor, so this guy spawned a ton of chickens and vehicles and...
89438	93100	Killing chickens has been funny ever since The Legend of Zelda on Super Nintendo.
93120	94121	You didn't kill them, though.
94261	99064	You picked them up and carried them and threw them and smacked them and then they got revenge.
99164	101665	Sweet, sweet, chickeny vengeance.
101745	103426	These chickens do not get revenge.
103486	104387	They simply die.
105687	106228	Can we eat them?
106428	106608	No.
106628	106828	No fun.
111104	112125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
136874	137755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
147588	148408	is going to come on the show.
148668	149289	So I'm very excited.
149309	150269	I'll give you guys more details.
150289	154171	This is the first that Jamie and Loki have even heard of this, but I'll give you guys more details later.
154411	155331	Person on YouTube.
155371	156952	That could be anyone on the face of the earth.
156972	157512	That could be.
157592	159633	I mean, it's a wonderful place.
159733	163894	But anyway, we have that, and then hopefully some more phone interviews I'm trying to plan.
163934	166616	But of course, it's kind of this dull period right now.
166636	167356	There's not a lot of...
168038	168838	Games coming out.
168858	169679	I mean, there's a few.
169699	172080	Of course, there's Burnout coming out pretty soon and some other stuff.
172120	174341	But otherwise, kind of a slow period for games.
174401	175801	But that doesn't mean the news has stopped.
175821	178963	And we will get to the news right after we talk about our gaming week.
179083	180844	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
182364	185646	Well, I've been fiddling with my Ninja Pass, trying to get it to work.
188387	195850	I now have Cooking Mama in the collection, in the purse to play, because I'm going to actually start taking my breaks at work again.
196844	198325	and to hell with my production.
200607	211674	And I rebirthed two characters this week in Ragnarok and got one of them back to her second job level in a day.
212014	213435	Now, I didn't know what rebirth was.
213455	215917	You had to explain it to me on Instant Messenger the other night.
216017	218859	And the best thing I could come up with is that it's like New Game Plus.
219319	220000	Yeah, sort of.
220600	230946	I mean, you have to start, you start over and you have 200 skill points for your, well, just to allocate to what you want to allocate them to.
231347	237470	But you have to start over for all your skills and all of your, you know, the rest of your stat points.
239272	247356	But actually, it's kind of funny because I thought that, you know, when you rebirth your character, it's supposed to be slower to level them, but it's actually been kind of faster.
248237	249658	I've been really amazed, so.
251138	252759	I wish Warcraft had a new game plus.
253879	254559	Yeah, you get to 70.
254959	255860	Haha, you're stuck.
256160	256880	I'm like, hey, I'm at 99.
257700	259101	Let's do the Time Warp again.
259821	261142	It's just to jump to the left.
262102	273826	No, but, well, the thing about WoW is that there's a lot of, and very similar like Final Fantasy XI and some other MMOs I've played, a lot of the games are like half the experience of leveling and then half is in-game content.
274226	276007	Like there's just, there is a lot of shit to do when you're 70.
276187	278547	You find a pond, you get experience.
279368	279708	PvP.
281047	281427	New Level
308564	314728	Well, right now, we actually have rebuilt my computer, sort of.
315849	323494	And I'm, right now, though, it doesn't, I bought a DVI to VGA converter.
323834	326696	Thing is, the DVI side doesn't fit.
326756	328377	It's, I guess, completely different.
328737	332720	So we put in, we're just using the one, the graphics card that came in the system.
332740	335622	This is the one that Vandalus gave me.
336283	336603	Oh, nice.
336823	338364	Yes, before he left us.
339187	339547	Saka
368811	371575	Hey, you got your account, me as well, right?
378956	380557	There's no monthly fee or anything.
380617	381457	It's always there to come back.
381798	384659	Speaking of no monthly fees, you might enjoy this, DarkSakura.
384679	385620	So I'm going to bring this up now.
385660	389061	I was talking to Dark Knight before the show a little bit in private message.
389542	392843	And apparently, Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is now free.
393084	393344	I know.
393764	395705	Until the server shut down on March 31st.
396085	396325	I know.
396646	400488	So are you considering going back to have a last hurrah with Blue Burst?
400988	402769	I talked about it with Ranma last night.
404350	408652	And the thing is that about a month ago, I uninstalled it.
410293	410673	No.
414435	428141	So, I'm still kind of thinking about reinstalling it, and Julie said she might play, but she's all PSU addicted, so... Seriously, every time I log on to my 360 station, she's on, she's playing PSU.
428161	429462	She was on Lost Planet.
430322	430883	That's right.
431123	435725	I did see her on a different game, and I actually had to look for a minute, like, who's playing Lost Planet?
435745	436986	And I was like, oh, it's Julie.
437286	437866	Wait, Julie?
437886	437986	Julie?
438567	439747	Julie's playing Last Planet?
440047	441588	Yeah, she hung out with us today.
441968	445868	We went to breakfast and we were going to start moving stuff into the other case.
447289	452389	And it just turned out that we looked for the converter instead.
453050	454590	But it's not the right one.
454670	455690	She actually bought it for me.
455710	458671	I thought it was really nice of her because it was only like $10.
458751	464452	And then Dan ran into one of his old buddies at Fry's who used his discount.
464532	465492	And Dan used his...
467947	472830	I got him Ratatouille on Blu-ray, and I'm very upset that Stardust is not on Blu-ray.
489022	489683	Well, who knows?
489763	495989	It may come out later this year if all the support for HD DVD finishes.
496069	497270	Everybody's kind of jumping ship.
499692	501494	I think it's still kind of up there.
502935	509662	But there's a few things that coming up in Part B makes me a little bit upset.
510422	512865	And yes, I did make Jamie watch Stardust on HD DVD.
512945	513686	It was very good.
513766	513926	Yes.
514634	521421	I made an icon for my live journal of Lamia, which her name cracked me up the whole time.
521701	522522	You know what?
522922	528247	In Greek mythology, Lamia was the queen of Libya who was turned into a child-killing demon.
529709	531330	So I thought it was very funny that they named her that.
531370	532692	They should make a video game out of Stardust.
532732	534674	Every time I watch Stardust, I want to go play Oblivion.
535274	535534	I do.
535975	536756	I don't know what it is.
536856	539018	It's the whole swords and magic thing.
540060	541481	Music is very Oblivion-ish.
541782	546345	I'll link it in the chat room, but I made an icon of her holding her finger up with it glowing green.
546605	547566	This is Pull My Finger.
548807	549407	Hilarious.
549908	550948	I am very proud of it.
551629	552730	It took like five seconds.
553550	555031	Shall we move on with our gaming weeks?
555111	555592	Why not?
555712	556893	Loki, how was your gaming week?
557313	558093	It was okay.
558494	562296	I tried out that game I bought, Drawn to Life.
562997	563697	It's horrible.
565459	565839	I hate.
567347	567868	Sorry to hear it.
568168	571369	I was still looking forward to that game, and it's just... It's all, yay!
571689	577132	I spent, like, you know, 30 minutes drawing a character and stuff, then I played the game, like, wow, this game sucks!
577952	582474	Even though my character's in it, which is horribly animated, by the way, but it still sucks.
583215	584435	I don't know.
584875	586616	Not Magic Pen Gel-ish.
586636	589878	I was going to say, not nearly as fun as The Walking Penis as Magic Pen Gel.
589998	590338	No, no.
590658	592299	That game is way better.
593339	594100	Then I played...
596291	597853	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
612910	617713	Hundreds of fucking bugs and glitches in it that make it almost impossible to play.
618134	622897	And actually, I have been unable to beat the game because of these glitches.
623958	629441	You know, for example, there's a bunch of these doors you have to knock down using your strength mode or whatever.
629882	634905	And so, when you start doing that, a lot of times they won't actually be able to be knocked down.
634945	635666	They'll get stuck.
636406	639969	And then, some other times, you know, for example, one of the...
642310	649656	There's supposed to be an event that triggers where he dies, the captain, and it doesn't happen.
649736	653620	Instead you see him standing there with arms spread and a gun in his hand and that's it.
654060	656342	He's just frozen and nothing ever happens.
656662	660085	So you have to constantly restart the game and it's just horrible.
660826	666191	If that level was the first level, I probably wouldn't be playing the game at all because it was just that bad.
667235	679064	Even now, I've tried playing it through about 10 different times, starting on saves that were way before that to play up through it, see if maybe something will work this time, but it doesn't.
679544	680825	And I'm about fed up with it.
681225	686129	However, I still like the game because you can blow up chickens, among other things.
687050	689251	See, I got this weapon at the very end of the game.
689291	691053	It's like a portable nuke launcher.
692774	694075	Why did they have it at the beginning of the game?
694095	695836	Because I would have loved to have blown up chickens with that.
697436	698256	You have to work towards it.
698496	698856	I know.
699557	701077	Or I have to cheat really bad.
701977	703057	You need a chicken cannon.
703937	705858	And then let's see, what else did I play?
707118	707978	I think that's about it.
707998	708878	It's just Saints Row.
710039	711739	A little bit of Earth Defense Force.
712259	714039	Still plugging away at that game.
715800	719480	Alright, well my gaming week was pretty much most of the same old shit.
719520	722821	Some Wii Virtual Console stuff, Galaxy, Warcraft.
723326	727288	There's not a lot of new games coming out, and I haven't revisited anything from 2007 yet.
727868	735672	So really the only new stuff I played were the new Xbox Live Arcade releases for the week, one of which was Tron, which is of course one of the all-time greatest arcade games ever.
735912	737533	Oh yeah, Dan was playing a demo of that.
738553	742575	You know, Tron was slightly better when I was a kid than it is now.
743576	744756	You know what you need is the booth.
745056	748238	The game's not quite as cool now, but it's still...
749349	751631	It's still got a lot of nostalgia for me.
751851	753792	I don't know if a lot of people are going to be into this.
753832	758635	Basically, if you've never played Tron, the arcade game, it's basically four minigames in one.
758956	769803	There's a lot of games in this period were similar to it, because honestly, the setup of the Tron arcade game is almost exactly like Journey, the arcade game, which is also made up of four minigames.
770103	770783	XBOX LIVE CO-OP
791529	796252	$5 though is probably a good price because I don't think Tron in this day and age is worth too much more.
796812	799053	I'm sure Discs of Tron will be coming out soon as well.
799093	801295	That of course was the other arcade game based off of Tron.
801495	802235	That'll be kind of cool.
802696	805998	Discs of Tron was very interesting.
806801	811544	I will put this, Tron, the demo is very generous.
811825	819290	The Tron demo is one full cycle of the four stages, so you can pretty much get to play the entire game.
819630	826915	It's just that, you know, when you actually play the full arcade game, the stages get more and more difficult each time.
827296	831499	So that's really, you know, the demo will give you a really good idea of what the game's all about.
831819	833440	So that's that.
835385	836226	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
860867	865268	I would say Omega 5 is a pleasant surprise if you're especially a fan of shooting games.
866208	867448	You know, lots of bullets everywhere.
867708	868269	That's always fun.
868329	879231	Basically, you can pick up these... You can upgrade your weapon in three different styles by picking up these different power-ups, and you can have, like, lasers or spreading bullets and things of that sort.
879711	884552	And so it's certainly much better than the Aegis Wing or whatever that other one was.
884572	885252	Aegis Wing, yeah.
885452	886912	Yeah, but at least Aegis Wing was free.
886932	888213	I mean, I'll give that... Omega 5's $10, but...
890437	895719	It definitely reminds me of a heyday arcade Japanese-influenced shooter, so definitely check it out.
895759	897339	The demo on that one's not bad either.
897759	901000	You get to play like half the first level, so you don't get to really do any boss fights.
901020	904181	You do one mini-boss fight, but it's pretty cool.
907582	912804	And of course, there's always our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and rostiout.com.
913459	915080	Quite the smartass in our chatroom.
915100	918122	The official smartass of Orange Lounge Radio in some shapes and ways.
918162	918642	No, I'm kidding.
919142	921664	He says, not used to shooters on the Xbox.
922464	922985	You know what I mean.
923005	924525	I'm not talking about first-person shooters.
924565	929308	I'm talking about, you know, UN Squadron, Gradius-type shooters, you know.
930049	932990	This is kind of cool, though, because we know Ikaruga's on the way at some point, too.
933130	937893	And some of these other old shooter classics are going to be rediscovered on the Xbox.
938073	939294	So, there you have it.
941342	962331	so that's really going to do it for our gaming week so now we're going to move on into some housekeeping of which we don't have a whole lot to share I do want to state that the overhaul of the music on the live station is finished so if you were feeling there's not enough of the old school classics and music from video games and such you're going to love the new rotation it's
962711	963311	Thanks for watching!
984885	986686	And one other thing is that there's a new show.
987326	988987	It's not a live show or a hosted show.
989047	990067	It's just a music show.
990628	992388	But it airs every day from noon to 1230.
992768	995209	That's every day, Monday through Sunday.
995289	995690	So every day.
996270	997370	It's the Retro Lunch.
997790	1000852	So it's nothing but 8-bit classic songs playing for a half hour.
1001152	1001692	Just a little bit.
1001972	1002592	Don't overdo it.
1003013	1005594	But for your lunch break every day, some 8-bit classics.
1006774	1007354	So check that out.
1008195	1008935	Yep, lots of fun.
1009756	1017821	and some of our chatters actually have made a little bit of a game out of it where they will listen and then they'll close the window that shows them what's playing on the station right now and try to guess.
1017841	1018282	I used to do that.
1018542	1019322	Yeah, it's fun.
1019543	1019843	It's fun.
1020163	1020743	So check that out.
1021264	1026407	All right, anyhow, now there is something else very important during the housekeeping we need to take care of.
1026988	1036834	It has nothing to do with the real bulk of the gaming news we want to get into, but everybody everywhere wants to know how far are we to one million copies of Eye of Judgment?
1036874	1039496	We asked this question last week and Loki said, I don't know.
1039978	1041279	I don't have the numbers, I don't know.
1062045	1066088	To be exact, actually, because that's just an estimate, 1,300, I'm sorry, 132,199 copies sold so far.
1066108	1066349	All right.
1066369	1068050	So how many does that mean we have left to go?
1068070	1068410	About 870,000.
1068470	1068590	Yeah.
1068610	1068831	All right.
1068851	1069191	Get to work.
1081418	1090140	For those that are new to the show, Loki made a bet here on this program that if Eye of Judgment could... If Eye of Judgment was actually... Because he says Eye of Judgment is a piece of shit.
1091081	1093121	We call it the brown Eye of Judgment here on this program.
1093561	1097702	And Loki says there's no way in hell this game will ever sell one million copies.
1097742	1105204	And if it does, he will don a Tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire while playing our good friend Bobby Blackwolf in a match.
1105734	1107955	of the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, Bobby knows about the bet.
1108015	1108755	I heard it on his show.
1108855	1109355	Oh, my mistake.
1109395	1109915	It is actually 150,000.
1109955	1110395	150 million?
1110475	1110635	Oh, shit.
1110655	1112036	We got to go to Hancock's Fabrics.
1112056	1113196	No, I don't think so.
1113536	1116377	150 million, that'd be unheard of.
1116397	1117237	Anyways, no, it's 150,000 copies.
1117257	1118618	I didn't realize the 132,199 is just U.S.,
1130509	1133191	Which is pretty impressive, actually, that the U.S.
1133231	1134391	has actually sold them any copies.
1134752	1135832	Japan, not so much.
1136132	1137553	In fact, they're only up to 19,384.
1138294	1142336	So no love in Japan for that stuff, but the U.S.
1143397	1144518	keeps on chugging.
1144918	1146179	Now, is the game out in Europe yet?
1146999	1148520	The game's not even out in Europe yet, is it?
1149481	1152362	Because I didn't see Europe sales figures when I was looking at that site.
1152422	1155885	According to this... That's not Europe, though.
1155905	1156365	Let me see.
1157446	1158046	I don't think so.
1159113	1160274	No, it's not out in Europe yet.
1160414	1162377	Ah, so Europe, you're going to need to pull through for us.
1165920	1171546	Alright, SSJ100Matt is in our chatroom and is sharing an article courtesy of CheapAssGamer.
1172267	1176892	If you were holding off on getting Eye of Judgment, it's now $45 on Amazon, apparently.
1176992	1177573	So there you go.
1178214	1178894	You can buy it cheap.
1178974	1181217	I posted a link in the chatroom where you can...
1181923	1182644	Play along at home.
1182784	1190371	Yeah, play along at home, and we'll probably post it in a thread or something in our forums so they can watch the count.
1190711	1192993	So we don't have to do the Eye of Judgment watch every show.
1193173	1195355	No, we can do it every few months or so.
1195415	1196897	Maybe when it crosses milestones.
1196917	1202502	When we get to 200,000, we'll mention it again, a quarter million, and then probably it'll die off after that, but who knows?
1202562	1207807	If we keep going... I haven't thought about how generous I should be at this, but...
1208556	1208896	I don't know.
1209716	1211417	Because there's other stories we're getting into.
1211437	1212037	That's right.
1212357	1213478	Shall we get into these stories?
1213798	1215178	We shall get into these stories.
1215859	1224462	Anyways, so the Eye of Judgment actually is going to be getting some more expansions for it.
1224922	1225822	Some more cards.
1226322	1227883	In fact, there's two of them.
1229724	1236026	Let's see, the Machine Gods Mutiny will be available to download on March 27th.
1238078	1245005	And, let's see here, there's also a third expansion, which I don't remember the name, that will also be coming out in the summer.
1246027	1247889	But those are, they said downloads, though.
1247969	1251393	I mean, that's not really new cards, though.
1251413	1253655	I would think that you would need to buy new cards or something.
1255938	1257079	So how does this affect the bet?
1258080	1260802	I don't think it affects anything because it's not actually selling anything.
1261502	1262783	Download content does not count.
1263003	1270947	But if for some reason, let's clarify this now, if for some reason there is an Eye of Judgment thing that comes to retail, would we count these retail copies?
1271147	1279852	If there's an expansion disc that comes, including cards obviously, because I would have to do that, then yes, we will count those.
1279972	1281273	But right now...
1282575	1285759	And that's even kind of being a little generous because... It's very generous.
1285840	1287562	Seriously, I don't know.
1287742	1289324	I think you want to wear that Tingle outfit a little bit.
1289344	1292849	I don't want to wear the outfit, but to be honest, it'll never happen.
1293450	1294992	It will never sell one million units.
1295312	1295552	Ever.
1295953	1296894	All right.
1297175	1299598	Even with expansions that are retail.
1300510	1301230	Retail Expansions
1326368	1333392	Well, no, it's not, because people can buy tons of booster packs to get the cars that they want, but, you know, that doesn't really, that doesn't count.
1333432	1334033	That's cheating.
1334433	1335574	That's not really a game.
1335754	1337875	We don't count, you know, the download content.
1337895	1339596	All right, well, at least we have the bet clarified.
1339636	1343779	And you have been awfully generous, because originally the bet was only supposed to cover U.S.
1343839	1344179	sales.
1344559	1347121	But you were awfully generous in expanding that to international sales.
1347161	1352624	Yeah, it also was supposed to be within the first six months, and then now it's for eternity, so...
1353396	1353676	All right.
1354136	1358019	And SSJ100Matt says, I think Loki wants to wear it so we can put the obsession behind us.
1358039	1358839	That might be a good point.
1359019	1359199	No.
1359340	1360300	Just to let this joke die.
1360620	1361601	No, I'm not wearing it.
1361801	1362081	All right.
1363122	1364022	I'm very confident.
1364142	1366824	If you do, it's all people will talk about for the next six months.
1366844	1372988	I am very confident that this will never sell a million units because it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
1373748	1376029	Until they come out with something else that's even more retarded.
1376209	1376490	All right.
1376510	1377530	But right now it's pretty retarded.
1380112	1380392	All right.
1381741	1384482	Do you... Now, a good point brought up in chat here.
1384742	1387782	Portal Combat says, Loki is secretly buying Eye of Judgment.
1387822	1389923	Do you yourself, sir, own a copy of Eye of Judgment?
1390243	1390463	Why?
1390503	1391483	I don't play card games.
1391863	1392143	No.
1392923	1393383	That's a no.
1393443	1393983	Just say no.
1394723	1403765	For half a second one time, because I have like $200 worth of GameStop credit, I was like, hey, I could buy that Eye of Judgment, and then we could burn it on the show anyways.
1403805	1406706	But I'm like, nah, I'm not doing that.
1406926	1408546	You could just use your credit and get something good.
1411075	1411716	Why waste it?
1412537	1413739	Dark Knight is in chat.
1413759	1416923	DJ Dark Knight says get Loki's wife involved and he'll don the suit.
1418985	1420267	She's not going to make me dress up.
1420968	1421589	That's stupid.
1423041	1424142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1445198	1469727	40 gigabyte model of course is 40 gigabytes whereas the other one was a little smaller and a little larger but the other big change oh yeah it lacks the PlayStation 2 compatibility which obviously makes it a lot cheaper to produce so that's where they're headed in Japan obviously similar things have happened here in America where we have also lost the backwards compatibility in Europe well shit they never really had it but at least our main model is 80 gigabytes and
1470200	1470300	Sweet!
1470320	1470540	Porn Drive!
1498925	1501808	I used mine when my computer was starting to die.
1502568	1506851	When my Vio was, the Franken-Vio, I should call it, was about to go.
1506872	1509233	It's good for backing up stuff.
1509974	1511915	I mean, I use it now as my primary storage.
1512095	1512456	For porn.
1513997	1515118	For Doctor Who episodes.
1516934	1518275	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1548092	1548992	I could be a lot of things.
1549012	1549372	So what?
1549593	1553494	They're getting a mint green PSP to come out on February 28th.
1554815	1558976	Like they need another color for a video game system.
1559497	1560377	Why mint green?
1560417	1561337	Well, look at the DS.
1561637	1562638	It works for the DS.
1562778	1563878	Why not the PSP?
1564339	1568540	I guess maybe they're having, you know, I guess color envy or something.
1568720	1570761	Why mint green of all colors?
1570901	1571441	I don't know.
1571502	1572522	Why not, you know...
1573038	1574680	Pink and Red for Valentine's Day.
1587307	1588468	Mint Green Olive Garden Mint
1613800	1616181	It's actually much paler than that.
1616301	1617362	Made good on the promise.
1617502	1617882	We did.
1617922	1623245	We went to Olive Garden and I had... What did I have?
1623285	1624205	Seafood Alfredo.
1624645	1624865	Yes.
1625145	1626786	And lots of never-ending breadsticks.
1627026	1627407	I know.
1627487	1628727	And that really good meatball soup.
1628847	1629027	Yes.
1629287	1629808	Anyway, sorry.
1630148	1630388	Okay.
1631649	1632469	Games, right?
1632749	1633009	Games.
1633730	1634810	Yeah.
1635170	1642354	So anyways, remember last week we talked a little bit about Skype and how it was coming to the PSP, but only the PSP Slim.
1642854	1643114	Well...
1643581	1646503	People are wondering why not the original PSP.
1646523	1646903	What the hell?
1647544	1653088	The reason was because the PSP Slim, not only is it a little bit slimmer, it does have more RAM in it.
1653248	1662314	So being that it has twice the RAM, 64 megs instead of 32, it is the only system able to handle Skype, apparently.
1663175	1667918	Not to say that there won't be anything homebrew coming out that's basically the same thing as Skype.
1667998	1670960	In fact, I know of one that they're working on right now.
1672682	1673022	Oh well.
1674080	1674901	No Skype for you.
1674921	1677762	Still kind of blows for all of us who have the old PSP models.
1678162	1681144	Yeah, it does suck, but they don't really care.
1681164	1683925	But then again, I mean, who am I really going to call on Skype?
1684365	1688307	I mean, obviously there's this show, but I'm on the show, so I don't have to call it.
1688627	1690188	It's just very inconvenient anyways.
1690248	1694710	I mean, seriously, you have to have, you know, I think you have to buy Skype for this.
1694911	1696091	I don't know if it's going to be free.
1696111	1698652	It may be free to use, but I think you have to buy the software for it.
1699273	1701714	And then once you've done that,
1702711	1703932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1731661	1733763	So PSPs are kind of mini-computers at this point.
1736605	1739047	PlayStation 3, not sure if those are computers or not.
1739107	1742570	Nobody ever really clarified if it really was supposed to be a computer or not.
1742650	1745733	It is if by calling it a computer it makes it sell more.
1746423	1755970	There is one thing that is being confirmed for the PlayStation 3, is that the cross-media bar functionality is going to be going into the games itself.
1756930	1767418	Now obviously the cross-media bar is right now only available on the main menu, and I believe some games that have come out have added the cross-media bar feature into the game, but that was something that the developers had to do.
1767458	1773142	There was nothing system-wide on the system firmware that allowed the cross-media bar to show up within a game.
1774388	1784752	And of course this means that if that happens, you'll finally get custom soundtracks in every game, you'll have the instant messaging available in the games, and all these other things that the Xbox 360 has been doing ever since its launch.
1785632	1787273	Sorry I couldn't help myself, but it is true.
1788153	1794756	Anyhow, Sony will be hopefully announcing the launch date of when this will happen soon.
1796932	1798812	However, there was no news at CES.
1798912	1805054	They instead decided to kind of focus on the hardware sales or hardware, new hardware additions such as Skype.
1805714	1807354	Soon is the magic word, isn't it?
1807814	1808174	Of course.
1810115	1818457	Well, there is a little confirmation that should make some people happy and that is about LittleBigPlanet.
1819137	1820297	It will be out in September.
1820897	1822078	At least that's what Sony's saying.
1822858	1823978	But, you know, it's
1824514	1826916	September and not September X date.
1827736	1830218	It's September, which is sometime.
1830498	1832839	And all this news came out of a Consumer Electronics Show, right?
1832919	1833099	Yes.
1833420	1841044	Which is strange because Consumer Electronics Show, like it seems like we're getting slightly more gaming news out of CES this year.
1841144	1844967	I use that word slightly because usually CES, not for games.
1845948	1847530	It's not a game show.
1847690	1855961	It's a kitchenware and 150,000 foot TVs and the George Foreman grilling machine.
1856021	1857402	And robots to waltz with.
1857503	1858304	Yes, exactly.
1858644	1859345	And all that stuff.
1859365	1861027	That's what you see at Consumer Electronics Show.
1861047	1861948	You don't see a lot of games.
1861988	1863090	But I feel like this year...
1864008	1867989	At least in the Sony department, we've gotten a little bit more gaming news.
1869310	1871911	I'm not saying we never got game news out of CES.
1872051	1873291	I feel like we got a little more this year.
1873631	1878993	And I don't know if that's because E3 is much later than it used to be or what the heck that's about.
1879393	1880894	But I just thought that was interesting.
1882334	1883475	I'm not reading too much into that.
1883495	1884395	I just thought it was interesting.
1884555	1884875	That's all.
1885015	1885255	It is.
1886876	1892118	And then freaking Slash coming out and advertising Guitar Hero 3 at the Microsoft keynote.
1892158	1892818	I mean, that was kind of...
1893655	1894137	Interesting.
1895821	1899371	The thing is, I think it's kind of disappointing that LittleBigPlanet's coming out in September.
1899391	1902079	I mean, wasn't this a game that they promised us we'd have last fall?
1902867	1904387	and now it's like, oh, I'm sorry.
1904627	1905808	Another Sony delay?
1905848	1906408	You don't say.
1906448	1907428	I know, it's crazy.
1907628	1909689	And just like Home, when the fuck's Home coming out?
1909789	1918591	Seriously, they keep advertising this shit on their commercials and stuff, like all these games like Haze, Metal Gear Solid 4, you know, all these games that are out now.
1918651	1924652	Gran Turismo Prologue, fuck, none of these games are out yet and they're already advertising them saying, oh yeah, buy a PlayStation 3.
1925192	1927313	Good stuff will be coming someday.
1927673	1931574	I would rather they take the time and do it right than rush the product.
1932094	1932915	That's the problem, though.
1933255	1938518	Even though they take their time on getting the product out, it's still just average.
1939219	1940620	They can delay it all they want.
1940700	1941800	It'll still be kind of eh.
1943241	1944602	I agree to an extent.
1944742	1949665	I agree that they should take the time to get it right, but I think they should never have launched the damn console when they did.
1949705	1954468	I think they should have just sat on it for a year and took the time to get that right, if that makes sense.
1954488	1955849	Well, it's just like LittleBigPlanet.
1955889	1958771	Granted, it's something that's pretty ambitious, but...
1959975	1961395	Don't fucking show this shit off.
1961535	1963476	Like, you know, oh, it's coming out this fall.
1963536	1964716	You know, get everybody excited.
1965136	1966857	And then, oh, sorry, it's not coming out this fall.
1966897	1967737	It's coming out this spring.
1968277	1970458	Or, okay, great, spring comes along.
1970758	1972158	Oh, I'm sorry, it's not coming out in spring.
1972198	1973078	It's coming out in September.
1973098	1975919	You know, it's... Okay.
1975939	1976739	You can take them forever.
1977679	1981240	Akuda in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com brings up a good point.
1981580	1982761	Wasn't Super Smash Bros.
1982821	1984761	Brawl supposed to be out, like, last year?
1985341	1987062	So is Sony the only bad guys here?
1987142	1987682	No, they're not.
1988042	1988182	And...
1988931	1989171	and so on.
2010379	2010579	PS3, PS4, PS5
2039707	2042089	All right, well, what else is Sony teasing for us?
2042469	2048433	Resistance Fall of Man 2, which quite possibly would be, I don't know, one of the best games on the system.
2048853	2052515	I know Resistance, the first one, was actually pretty fun.
2053156	2054437	One of my favorite games on the system.
2054597	2058079	One of the few that I still own because I love it so much.
2059020	2064343	Well, this one, though, they're saying is going to have 60-player online deathmatches, which is fantastic.
2064673	2065454	Fucking crazy.
2066654	2068956	Eight-player co-op and two campaigns.
2069537	2076822	One which is supposed to be an online campaign, I believe, and the other is just standard single-player campaign.
2076842	2078363	60-player multiplayer matches.
2078503	2081385	God, I hope it's not like Halo where they all have a microphone.
2082146	2089371	Well, from what I remember, I think Resistance right now has 48-player multiplayer deathmatches.
2090432	2092153	So, you know, it's not so bad.
2092293	2093194	And you have to remember that
2093629	2094369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2114628	2124131	and there should be something where if somebody is completely being a jerk then everybody can target that person and obliterate them to smithereens and they lose the right to speak.
2125631	2125991	I like it.
2126152	2126752	Patent pending.
2128252	2131713	That means I own all the rights to it and if you try to put this in your game I'll sue you for a million dollars.
2131853	2136355	If you want more information though on Resistance 2 it's supposed to be in the new issue of Game Informer.
2138315	2138695	Alrighty.
2139315	2144257	Well, the PSP we were talking about a little bit earlier how it's becoming more and more like a computer.
2144653	2145273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2167796	2169137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2192836	2195177	That you're going to want to have this keyboard for in 2009.
2195477	2200000	Like AOL Instant Messenger on your PSP or some shit.
2200080	2201000	It's a time thing.
2201761	2202321	Just you wait.
2202581	2203422	It's still lame.
2203502	2206823	You can still put the keyboard out and then put that service out later.
2207304	2207824	Why wait?
2208644	2211846	Because then if you wait, then you put this thing out.
2212426	2214507	Nobody buys it because there's nothing to use it for.
2214587	2217249	So retailers go, why the fuck are we carrying this in the first place?
2217589	2219510	Put it in the bargain bins and nobody ever has them.
2220669	2221491	I still think it's stupid.
2221511	2223495	It's not gonna sell anyways if it's AIM.
2224116	2224658	That's stupid.
2226050	2227091	It's kind of like, you know what?
2227231	2232816	I would almost blame, that's what happened with the GameCube, the internet thing on the GameCube.
2232836	2233237	What do they call it?
2233257	2235699	The broadband adapter and the dial-up adapter.
2235719	2240784	There was one game out that supported it, and it wasn't the type of game that everybody could get into at the time.
2241164	2242365	So where did those things end up?
2242425	2243026	Bargain bins.
2243146	2246269	Developers go, we don't want to develop for this because none of them are out there.
2246289	2248391	It was kind of like a damning cycle.
2248651	2250533	What should have happened is that at that time...
2251173	2257098	Nintendo should have come out and said, we're going to put a first-party game out that supports this, like F-Zero.
2257618	2263903	F-Zero is going to support the... How awesome would F-Zero GX have been if it supported the broadband or dial-up adapter?
2263943	2266184	A completely different kind of game than PSO.
2267405	2269607	I can't see Nintendo putting an online game...
2270467	2274548	I know, I'm just saying, they could have probably done a better job at it if they wanted to.
2274568	2276989	I don't know, I think it's stupid to have to wait for this shit.
2277349	2283711	Well, look at what they're doing with the new Nintendo Wii and kind of really kicking off that.
2283731	2291173	I mean, sure, there's a couple games here and there that support it, but not really a game with the push that the new Mario Kart and the Wii is going to have for the online thing.
2291534	2297295	I just can't imagine that it would take them a year and a half to develop AOL Instant Messenger for the PSP.
2297715	2299476	They've already got Java stuff that works...
2300163	2300804	DarkSakura.com
2316789	2317410	Vibribin Vibribin
2340189	2342211	So, but hey, VibRibbon's great.
2342771	2356062	For anyone who lives in a barrel and doesn't know what VibRibbon is, it's a vector animated game that has a little rabbit that changes into different stuff.
2356183	2357484	I have some mood-setting music.
2361967	2362808	Okay.
2362868	2365630	It had, I think, eight tracks or something.
2365671	2367212	This is one of them built into the game.
2368015	2373396	And the little rabbit sings the tutorial on how to play the game, which is hilarious.
2374896	2380358	And the way that you play the game is you start the game and you can actually put in your own CDs.
2380778	2386079	And we tried to do it to... CD-R music, like Max 300 and stuff.
2386099	2387199	Yeah, we tried to do it to 151.
2390800	2392620	Oh, the Kiriyama Oka song from B-Mania, yeah.
2392800	2394901	We tried to do it to that, and we tried to do it to Max 300.
2396400	2403304	and we tried to pick as many fast and retarded stuff as we could and did it end up being some solitary song that was really hard instead?
2403965	2404825	I think it was Colors.
2405186	2416133	The algorithm for determining the levels wasn't exactly the smartest thing in the world, designing your own levels with your own music, but it was kind of cool nevertheless.
2416553	2421897	And it would give you different patterns to go on based on the music that you put in it.
2421937	2422517	It was pretty cool.
2422817	2425619	And it was different every time, so the game was consistently challenging.
2426679	2429721	and I hope it comes out.
2429781	2430882	I want it over here though.
2430942	2432644	GS68 has a brilliant idea.
2432724	2434965	You can play that game with Dragon Force now.
2435265	2436106	You know what I could do?
2436326	2436506	What?
2436526	2438508	I could do that because I have Vib Ribbon.
2440689	2443371	I saw a copy of Vib Ribbon sitting at Network Video.
2443411	2444412	May you rest in peace.
2445313	2447114	That's what we need to do for our little piece.
2447174	2450377	I still want to put together a piece of video game music made better by Dragon Force.
2450397	2451738	We need to make that happen with Vib Ribbon.
2451998	2453999	So you need to dust off your copy because we're going to be doing that.
2454019	2454440	I found it.
2454720	2454900	Good.
2457486	2461627	I picked up the ribbon for $40 and I got an original and I've never regretted it.
2462367	2463788	Awesome.
2463848	2466448	Even if it came out on PlayStation 3 downloadable, would you still get it?
2466688	2467128	Probably.
2468269	2468629	Sucka.
2469089	2471229	Although I could just pop it in my PS2.
2471269	2476270	That's the whole reason we haven't downloaded Super Metroid yet.
2477310	2483052	We found the cartridge and our Super Nintendo so we're like, hey, let's just play the real thing.
2483132	2483452	Okay.
2484572	2484832	All right.
2485944	2490827	Let's move on talking about some release dates of stuff not online, but stuff you can actually walk into a store and buy.
2491028	2491928	Yes, in the U.S.
2492008	2497271	it's a smorgasbord of stuff that's either really good or really crappy, most of which the latter.
2499013	2501894	Including kids sports, ice hockey for the Wii.
2502675	2506537	Yet another game by Destineer, who is known for absolutely nothing good.
2508639	2513922	Flat out head-on on the PSP, that's a flat out 2 port, so that should be pretty fun.
2514772	2541564	History Channel Lost Worlds on the PC Samurai Warriors Katana on the Wii Which looks kind of fun, it's like an on-rails samurai game Let's see, Furu Furu Park on the Wii Only $20, a bunch of little mini-games by Majesco Let's see, Miami Knights Singles in the City for the DS I don't know if it's any better than Sprung, but I guess we'll have to see
2542525	2569051	Nitro Bike on the Wii, this game I'll have to expose to Nelly because it's made by the creators of Excitebike64 and it's kind of the same thing, it's bikes with rockets on them and then the Sims Carnival Bumper Blast and the Sims Carnival Snap City on PC are coming out Battlefield 2142 is getting a price drop to $30 and
2570901	2574362	And finally, let's see here.
2575842	2579163	Pirates of the Burning Sea is also getting a bundle.
2580284	2581924	And that's coming out as well.
2582424	2583485	Enough pirate games.
2583665	2583945	Enough.
2584285	2587746	I was going to say, though, there is something kind of funny that's coming out next week.
2588186	2590186	Also happens to be by Destiny Air, though.
2590907	2592087	Kawasaki Jet Ski.
2592567	2597868	This one looks almost identical to Wave Race 64.
2598909	2599909	So that might be pretty cool.
2601059	2601519	And that's it.
2622418	2623579	Trauma Center New Blood on January 17th.
2635092	2639036	and Sonic Riders Shooting Star Story also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.
2639196	2645001	Now is the Trauma Center New Blood, is that new blood from people like me just poking at the patient with a knife?
2645962	2646362	You know what?
2646442	2648584	Trauma Center New Blood is one of those games from 2007.
2648985	2652448	It was on my list of I really need to play this game and I just have not...
2652888	2653348	and DarkSakura.com.
2681618	2683280	That would be a lucky game indeed, wouldn't it?
2685221	2686022	Oh shit, I fucked up.
2686082	2687564	Lucky Star doesn't come out until next week.
2687904	2688184	Don't.
2689085	2690967	Sorry.
2691067	2696112	You can start prepping now for Lucky Star or the deluxe pack of Lucky Star, which is also released next week.
2696452	2698914	However, this week you can get a game called School Days.
2700015	2706962	School Days comes out this week, another adventure game with two chicks on the front cover, kind of arm in arm like they're BFFs.
2707918	2732375	and they're wearing schoolgirl uniforms so you know this will sell like hotcakes at anime conventions around the globe moving on to the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS a game called From the Abyss makes its way to the Nintendo DS and I'm not sure if this is a misprint because I didn't think this game was coming out on the Nintendo DS oh I guess it is there's the box art and everything Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games comes out on the Nintendo DS I always thought that was a Wii only game go figure
2733080	2735541	That comes out on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan.
2736221	2739742	And lastly on the Sony PSP, nothing.
2740962	2741982	Nothing for the PSP.
2742002	2744623	But you have a price reduction on Luminous 2 to look forward to next week.
2744903	2745343	Yay.
2745803	2747403	So there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
2748043	2752625	Well, there's a few coming out on the 18th in Europe.
2752645	2753845	We have Balls of Fury.
2755525	2756265	That's great.
2756425	2758586	It's based off a movie that didn't do very well.
2759355	2777727	Geometry Wars Galaxies on DS and Wii, Knight's Journey of Dreams on Wii, which I so almost picked up today, Wii Chess, which actually I would get because I was on the chess team in high school, and Zack and Wiki Quest for Barbaros Treasure.
2777747	2780169	And that's it.
2782430	2788134	I just say save your money, well, get Knights, and then save your money for Dracula X Chronicles later that month.
2790677	2796119	You know, I will never understand our chat room and the way they think sometimes because you know how I was talking about dating sims a minute ago?
2796680	2800521	So SSJ100 Matt pipes up and goes, two girls, one cup dating sim for DS.
2801161	2804443	Or now, you know, two girls, one cup is now 2007.
2806524	2811066	But now you have, you know, because obviously it's something much more hardcore came out apparently recently.
2811386	2816148	And Corey31 suggests that four girls finger paint would make a good DS Wii game.
2820209	2820529	Sick.
2820729	2822110	Gotta keep up on the internet.
2822130	2822990	You all are sick.
2823770	2824170	There you go.
2824430	2827651	Black Wolf suggests Dragon Force would make any dating sim better.
2828212	2828652	Absolutely.
2828712	2829732	Date Dragon Force, the game.
2829752	2830572	You know what I want?
2830652	2834053	They made a Tokimeki game for girls, and I still want that game.
2834213	2834473	Really?
2835114	2837294	Yeah, where you guess pick up on boys or something.
2837494	2837954	Interesting.
2838375	2842416	Loki, please bring us back to video game chat, please.
2842916	2843276	All right.
2843956	2846077	Well, it was announced this week that
2846733	2848255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2866653	2869315	You happen to get the better half, which would be Darth Vader.
2869795	2872657	If you get the 360 version, well, you get Yoda.
2873078	2876880	I don't understand why they couldn't put both of them on there, because that's stupid.
2876940	2881043	Cue all the Xbox fans going, No!
2881063	2882244	Hey, I can get them both.
2882964	2883445	Exactly.
2883505	2883825	Why?
2883965	2884245	Why?
2884305	2885206	Why would you buy them both?
2885266	2887047	That is exactly why they did this shit.
2887067	2888468	That was sarcasm, by the way.
2888628	2889389	Okay, thank God.
2889549	2891210	I was going to come over there and beat you.
2891230	2892711	But I'm going to get the PS3 version.
2892731	2893031	For Vader?
2893051	2893412	For Vader.
2895475	2896095	Well, yeah.
2896255	2900418	But this is the good thing about it, though, is that they did not base it off of Soul Calibur 4.
2900458	2902199	They went back and based it off of Soul Calibur 2.
2904340	2905641	A balanced version.
2905941	2910163	Yeah, I was going to say, you're saying what the kind of bullshit is this, Loki?
2910243	2913205	It's the kind of bullshit, the exact same thing they did with Soul Calibur 2.
2913545	2918127	Yeah, but I don't have a problem with Link not being on the PlayStation because that doesn't make any sense.
2918187	2923250	Why would you put Link, you know, a Nintendo character on a PlayStation or something like that?
2924671	2924871	This...
2925558	2926479	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2942461	2944143	Star Wars characters should not be in Soul Calibur!
2960051	2961472	Why did that happen in the first place?
2961492	2962273	That is stupid.
2962413	2966235	Maybe they'll have a character editor and you can use some of the parts because they have a crazy looking Yoda.
2966275	2967456	It looks stupid.
2967576	2971238	I looked at the screenshots of like Darth Vader fighting Ivy or whatever.
2971279	2973060	I'm just going like, I just rolled my eyes.
2973100	2974401	I'm like, this looks dumb.
2975081	2977823	This looks about as dumb as Spawn being in the game.
2977883	2978403	No, no, no.
2978463	2980925	Did you hear what their original intent was?
2981085	2986709	The director of the Soul Calibur game, he wanted to have Pac-Man as one of the fighting characters.
2987189	2988150	Oh my God.
2988210	2989771	He's going to ruin his own franchise.
2991474	2992017	What's next, Klonoa?
2995831	2997512	Planoa would be awesome, though.
2997532	2998012	Screw you!
2998392	3002454	Hey, I like... You know, Planoa is one of my favorite games ever.
3002754	3005275	I like Soul Calibur just the way it was.
3005496	3007817	I thought it was cool to have Link in it.
3007997	3009237	Link made sense.
3009437	3014400	Link, also a swordsy and, you know, swords and sorcery type of character.
3014760	3015440	Hahachi?
3016280	3018381	Okay, I can... We'll let that one slide.
3018401	3018882	That makes sense.
3018902	3021523	How long has he had freaking Yoshimitsu in the games?
3022495	3025097	He's been a Soul Calibur character forever!
3025117	3026918	At least Yoshimitsu has a sword.
3028159	3030141	He actually has a diaper.
3030161	3031782	You know what they're doing?
3032022	3036325	They're fucking this over like they did with Tekken, where they just start putting all this ridiculous shit in there.
3036786	3039708	Like fucking woodblock characters and panda bears.
3039768	3041769	Tekken has always been that way, though.
3042830	3046513	Well, they want this to be fucking Tekken, because they can.
3046753	3049555	And for the record, those characters in Tekken were kind of dumb, too.
3050223	3051124	Well, actually, I don't know.
3051164	3053326	A panda bear beating people up was kind of awesome.
3053506	3060933	Okay, first of all, they've always had the bear characters in... Oh, my God.
3061273	3062674	No, Bear was in Tekken 1, wasn't he?
3062935	3063295	Yes!
3063315	3063996	That's what I thought.
3064776	3069400	And Devil and Angel and everybody, and Gold Banjo's his secret character, your mom.
3069921	3072984	Last night, Devil Jin was awesome, by the way.
3073544	3075006	Do not ever...
3075720	3076460	Poop on Devil Jam.
3098952	3105416	Now, before the chatroom jumps, I know there already was one back on the PlayStation 1 or whatever the hell it was, but it was kind of dumb.
3105536	3109679	Just because you make a crappy game a long time ago does not mean that you can't make a good game now.
3109739	3110180	Exactly.
3110660	3113642	I mean, Star Wars games come out on every fucking console.
3113662	3115123	There were Star Wars games on the Atari 2600, okay?
3115223	3117465	These games have been coming out forever.
3117745	3125511	So there's no reason they couldn't do a really new, super pretty, you know, like using the Soul Calibur engine, make a Star Wars fighting game.
3126374	3128295	That would be all kinds of awesome.
3128375	3130816	I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan, but I might buy that game.
3130896	3132777	That would be kind of awesome, because I love Soul Calibur.
3133857	3137919	Somebody in my live journal said, Soul Calibur is a fighting game for people who don't really like other fighting games.
3138279	3138539	It's true.
3139780	3141020	I don't know why I get into Soul Calibur.
3141040	3143021	I liked Gon from Tekken 3.
3144081	3149204	Gon was great, and actually Gon was the best person to beat the Tekken Street mode.
3150664	3152625	Because all you had to do was do the butt spin thing.
3153783	3159471	God, oh, and you know what's happening with Soul Calibur 2 is there's the crappy spin-off games happening too, like the Legends game.
3160112	3160673	Like, um...
3161943	3162804	Death by playing this game.
3186178	3187199	Namco would boob up the Star Wars girls.
3187219	3189861	Damn right they would, and it would sell zillions of copies.
3190181	3194785	Like, I don't even know what a zillion is, but you put Leia as a slave girl in this game with massive boobage, and this game will move...
3215919	3217800	A zillion copies on the first day.
3218320	3219020	Just you wait.
3220520	3221301	Mark my words.
3224682	3228703	Xenocore says, do not tempt the fates by summoning Teras Kasi.
3229023	3231224	Leave it to slumber in its grave.
3231384	3232644	No zombie apocalypse.
3236918	3241143	And Tigerclaw says, I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.
3241183	3242064	They will cut through them.
3242364	3243926	In fact, they'll cut right through the opponents.
3244287	3244887	Oh, I'm sorry.
3244947	3246489	Let me read that the way it should have been read.
3247150	3250293	I still don't see how lightsabers can clash with metal swords.
3250313	3254818	I mean, come on.
3254878	3255900	It's seriously.
3258011	3260552	Why are you trying to apply real world physics?
3261932	3264853	Why am I even calling the Star Wars universe real world physics?
3264873	3266233	Did you just say Jedi physics?
3266794	3268214	No, real world physics.
3268354	3268974	Oh, sorry.
3269174	3270255	Not Jedi physics.
3270795	3273015	That would make me even more retarded.
3273836	3274916	Seriously, who cares?
3275056	3276056	It's just a fucking game.
3276416	3279897	They can't do that because then all the Star Wars characters would win.
3280698	3281578	What they do need, though...
3282199	3283840	They need to get some Star Trek characters.
3283880	3284661	I want to see Kirk.
3284801	3285162	That's right.
3285202	3286182	Kirk versus Picard.
3286222	3287544	Let's settle this shit right now.
3288124	3289065	That would be funny.
3289926	3290906	I would love to see that.
3290987	3293429	I have a picture hanging outside of my cubicle, by the way.
3294049	3295971	It's done up like one of those motivational posters.
3296631	3298373	It's a picture of Kirk just grinning.
3299113	3301836	It says, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.
3302521	3305942	I just want to see a fighting game with absolutely random shit in it.
3306022	3311404	Like, you know, Kirk, I want to see Adam West playing Adam West and, you know, just weird shit like that.
3311724	3312385	Loki Fighter 2008?
3312605	3313085	Hell yeah.
3313585	3314686	There you go.
3315706	3316066	Alright.
3318407	3322368	BlackWolf says, The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.
3323609	3324829	I'm sorry, let me re-read that.
3325370	3328211	The Death Star wouldn't even take the Enterprise's shields down to 85%.
3331553	3333762	Please let's change the topic, pretty please.
3333782	3335429	That's my turn, it sure is.
3335730	3336373	Microsoft...
3337244	3338225	Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility
3364918	3371407	and of course everybody has their games that they wish were still backwards compatible, but it doesn't look like there'll be many more updates in the future.
3371427	3376274	Buy new games, or better yet, don't sell off your old system.
3376354	3377055	There you go.
3377516	3378297	Problem solved.
3378377	3380981	I would think maybe there would be one last hurrah.
3381496	3392107	But especially in light of now that they've launched this download Xbox Originals thing where they can charge more money for games than they are used, I wouldn't expect that they're going to do any more updates.
3392427	3395110	Unless they do an update, and watch this, this is what they'll do.
3395754	3398675	They'll update, but they won't push it out to play the discs.
3399035	3401956	They'll only update it to do a download game or something.
3402256	3409877	Because me personally, I would love to see an update make the Dance Dance Revolution games from Xbox playable because I can use my Xbox 360 mat.
3410378	3416979	Because really, that's really the only games I would probably still play on Xbox to this day are the DDR games because, you know, they're a good workout, right?
3417439	3420340	So why don't we get those games backwards compatible?
3420600	3421321	Diminishing Returns
3438564	3439685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3461550	3463050	are probably pretty damn cheap right now.
3463070	3468251	Yeah, but those things weigh 5,000 pounds and they're like an eyesore in my living room.
3468331	3470372	I don't want to hook it up unless I have to.
3472312	3474012	But you still have an original Xbox.
3474092	3475012	I do, and you know where it is?
3475052	3476253	It's in that drawer right there.
3476333	3477913	The closed drawer right there.
3477973	3481434	Well, and how often do you play Xbox games?
3481574	3484894	I would play the DDR games more if they were backwards compatible.
3485974	3486374	But they're not.
3487515	3488475	Well, that's just Konami.
3488495	3489055	They don't like you.
3490354	3492035	We sometimes break out our old stuff.
3492955	3494116	Well, you're crazy.
3494176	3496757	You would bust out your Dreamcast just to play club mixes.
3496777	3498177	Actually, you know what we have hooked up right now?
3498277	3498477	What?
3498797	3501198	The CDX and 32X and Knuckles Chaotix.
3501858	3502699	Just because.
3502919	3503339	Just because.
3503379	3505180	Like, you and Dan are the types where you'll get a whim.
3505520	3513063	Like, it's just like, God, I really feel like playing, you know, frickin' Echo the Dolphin today.
3513283	3514263	Dust off the Genesis.
3514323	3514963	Let's get it out.
3515524	3516584	Well, yeah, we do that.
3517239	3519540	CES Force Feedback Suit by TN Games
3539213	3568216	because it has these pockets that inflate that will sort of make a punch like if you're playing a fighting game and someone gets punched in the chest you'll feel it as just pressure and it's meant for it right now only works with Call of Duty 2 or Incursion but they're working on Valve software stuff coming out so
3571126	3583770	It actually also has this thing where it will do a partial inflation for a light hit or blow air past you if something misses you.
3584511	3590913	So it's more for complete... I mean, I think it's a neat idea, but at the same time, I don't see why anyone would want one.
3591893	3593693	Yeah, I bet it's going to be too much money, too.
3593713	3598515	If I want to feel air rushing past me, I'll just have Jamie stand next to me with an airzooka while I play a game.
3599262	3600983	Screw the airzooka, I'll just have a can.
3601524	3606727	Well, they have those, I don't remember, like, ambient effects or something like that.
3606827	3611850	It's a thing for your PC that actually has, like, fans and lights.
3612250	3617493	So it's got that ambient light and then the fans blow air or something like that.
3617674	3622116	I think you can even adjust the air, like, hot, cold, that kind of stuff, depending on what's in the game.
3623257	3626079	I'm laughing at Rob with two Bs in the chat room.
3626799	3628000	He says, how does it play with Rez?
3628643	3629363	That's a good question.
3629483	3630063	That'd be funny.
3630083	3630863	That might be kind of fun.
3634204	3634664	All right.
3635364	3636064	Let's keep moving.
3636364	3638245	Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about that.
3638985	3647006	Anyways, so Bill Gates, his aim is to make the Xbox 360 the most reliable console ever.
3648346	3648826	Good luck.
3649127	3651947	Because right now you're not off to a good start.
3652467	3654047	What does that mean, most reliable?
3655088	3655808	I don't know.
3656168	3657088	He basically says...
3658294	3662075	He says, incredible reliability on the new work that we've done.
3662295	3665355	Our commitment is to be the most reliable video game box out there.
3665755	3667296	Sounds like a bunch of PR bullshit to me.
3667996	3675817	Does most reliable mean like, okay, if you bought an Xbox 360 in 2006, you can rely on the fact that that thing will get the three rings of death at some point?
3677197	3677577	I don't know.
3678177	3687519	But I don't know how they can claim that even... I understand that they want to be the most reliable, but I want to be rich in the
3688598	3693911	I think I'm going to be rich before they become reliable, so I don't know.
3695615	3696117	Alright, well,
3697016	3702437	One thing you can certainly rely on is that more Xbox Originals will make its way to the Xbox Live Marketplace.
3702457	3705378	And one of them that's been announced, Burnout 3 Takedown.
3705418	3708619	Hey, this is one I actually own on disc, so I don't really need to worry about this.
3708959	3714840	But for those of you that don't have this game, Burnout 3, of course, one of the entries in the long-running Burnout series.
3715260	3719481	I'm sure this isn't timed with the release of Burnout Paradise or anything like that, but...
3720263	3726467	Burnout 3 is making its way on January 14th to the Xbox 360 consoles, the downloadable original.
3726567	3730350	It will set you back 1,200 Microsoft points, which calculates to about $14.99.
3730430	3736714	Makes sense that they would do that because Burnout Revenge is available on the 360.
3736834	3740556	Right, and there's the new Burnout game, right?
3740956	3744278	Yeah, Burnout 3, I liked it better than Revenge anyway.
3745679	3746720	Recommend it if you don't have it.
3747433	3748194	Take Down is a good game.
3748414	3749535	I would also recommend it.
3749575	3752917	It plays well on the backwards compatibility and all that good stuff.
3754618	3763424	Well, for anyone who was keeping up with the whole journalistic drama, wasn't that reviewer that got pooped on?
3763864	3765345	Oh, yeah, the GameSpot guy.
3765645	3767286	Well, we haven't heard that in a guy's name in a while.
3767306	3768927	Whatever happened... Oh, yeah, I know what happened.
3769268	3773170	Somebody else left GameSpot, too, because of that, earlier this week.
3773470	3775912	Alex Navarro left GameSpot and apparently invoked...
3776616	3778537	Gershman as why he was leaving.
3778557	3779437	You know what's funny though?
3779457	3782659	There's been like some other independent reviewers also leaving.
3782699	3787362	I'm just like, I don't care what you're trying to like, you know, be all noble and stuff.
3787422	3788602	Other people have done it before you.
3788642	3789062	Who cares?
3789963	3795246	Well, the game in question, Kane and Lynch, Dead Men, sold a million copies.
3796646	3804510	So in other words, all this video game drama on the internet that we thought was going to kill this game dead in its tracks, most people probably don't even read this kind of stuff on the internet.
3804530	3805631	It probably helped.
3806443	3808904	I want to see what the drama's about.
3809064	3813286	It's a good thing that he didn't get fired over a bad review for Eye of Judgment.
3813406	3815947	There's no such thing as bad press.
3816227	3816867	That'd be great.
3816887	3820229	This is what they say, there's no such thing as bad press.
3821349	3822630	Loki made a really big funny.
3822670	3824471	It took me a minute to get, but it was a really good funny.
3826511	3827012	Exactly.
3827672	3827952	All right.
3829757	3833059	Well, I think parents just bought this game for their kids.
3833079	3835040	Well, actually, you really shouldn't buy this game for your kids.
3835060	3838662	So I don't know who was getting this under their Christmas tree, but quite a few people, apparently.
3838802	3841304	I'm sure kids have it because their parents don't care.
3842785	3846927	Well, Billy wants King Lynch, and he got good grades this month, so let's buy it for him.
3847728	3850029	What's this M mean on the front of the package?
3850329	3852550	M means it's... Must have.
3853931	3855112	It's magnificent.
3855632	3856913	M for magnificent, okay.
3859537	3869266	So, one thing that's kind of magnificent, I guess, and a little weird, but I guess I don't know why they're doing it, but they did.
3869826	3876272	So now, RezHD will be supporting... I'm sorry, this is too good.
3876632	3878654	BlackWolf says, oh, M is for minors.
3879654	3880015	Minors?
3880875	3881336	Yeah, there you go.
3881812	3882612	Sorry, go ahead.
3883112	3888934	So Rez HD is going to be supporting trans-vibration in the form of your other controllers.
3889314	3892034	So one person can play and three other people can be pleasured.
3892514	3892894	Awesome.
3895375	3899276	So now there's a whole reason to have four Xbox 360 controllers.
3899456	3901496	One to play the game, three in your pants.
3901696	3904457	Why can't they support just the Rez trans-vibrator?
3904517	3908338	I mean, it's just a USB device, and if they built in the driver for it...
3910396	3910936	Why don't they?
3910956	3912016	Because that would be kind of cool.
3914377	3923639	Okay, so they're going to spend money to engineer this whole stupid thing on the Xbox 360 for the whole, I don't know, three people that still have an original trans vibrator.
3923959	3925720	Jamie, do you have an original trans vibrator?
3926000	3926700	No, I actually don't.
3926800	3930321	See, if this woman doesn't even own one, then nobody owns one.
3930361	3931181	I'm telling you right now.
3933022	3933902	I've been looking for one.
3935587	3937750	And cue the emails of everybody who has one.
3937791	3938431	That's okay, though.
3938451	3944199	Someone will just reverse engineer a trans-vibrator into a 360 controller or something like that.
3945241	3946683	Or like a dildo or something like that.
3947305	3972807	SSJ100 Matt wanted to take this opportunity to point out that last week during listless remember how we were doing the listless and it was the gadgets we most want to see at CES remember the Foreman grill that grills the entire cow one we had the holodeck in there remember SSJ100 Matt his entire list got eliminated and his list was gone one of the things on the list he wants to remind us was a new res trans vibrator
3973410	3973970	Oh, we don't need it.
3974050	3975971	We have controllers now that'll do just the same thing.
3975991	3986177	No, but he's pointing out the irony of the fact that of all things at CES that were actually announced, in a way, the Xbox 360 controller is now... I don't know why you would need the trans-vibrator anyways.
3986277	3992140	It's kind of weird, but... Well, congratulations, SSJ100Matt, for being correct.
3993361	4001225	It'll be fun, though, to put the controller on stuff that rattles, like my coffee table and stuff like that, so it'll be really loud and annoying.
4006069	4007110	I'm sure your wife will love that.
4008510	4008750	All right.
4009030	4018715	Well, one thing people everywhere love is a little segment we do on our show where Jamie takes a minute to respect our elders and pay tribute to the games of yesteryear.
4018755	4019155	That's right.
4019235	4023777	It's the classic video game of the week brought to us by DarkSakura.
4023797	4026478	DarkSakura, what game have you picked for the masses this week?
4027119	4029680	The game of the week is Bongaio.
4030567	4034829	which is a game that I really love and it's a treasure game on top of that which makes it even more awesome.
4035249	4037470	Two treasure games in a row.
4037790	4038250	Aha.
4039011	4039631	But you can do that.
4040151	4040471	I can.
4041011	4048635	The initial release was on the Nintendo 64 in Japan and it has come out on the Dreamcast.
4050095	4056898	In fact, I pretty much got this game right away when it came out on Dreamcast and played a bunch of it.
4056978	4058659	It's really crazy because like
4059324	4067387	You go around and, well, actually I think it's kind of funny because the Nintendo 64 version was a very limited release of 10,000 cartridges.
4067888	4068468	It's pretty cool.
4068788	4071169	So if you've got one for the Nintendo 64, you're lucky!
4074090	4078352	But it's a 300, you play basically a 360 degree type attack and you can...
4079167	4084351	Do like a bajillion shots in a row all over the place and there's enemies everywhere.
4084611	4091656	And I believe that the maximum number of bullets you personally can shoot out at one time is like 400, I think.
4092536	4096659	It's pretty crazy and your character on the screen looks really small.
4098020	4101422	But when you think about everything else that's going on in the game...
4103582	4106324	It makes sense, you get a lot of action going on at one time.
4107745	4111608	With the Dreamcast, it makes you change this from the Nintendo 64 version.
4112229	4123477	You have sort of an explosion counter instead of the combo system, and you don't have a shot that you can device up with the Nintendo 64 version.
4125279	4127860	Your special attacks are based on...
4129451	4131772	The amount of incoming fire.
4131852	4133352	So you don't have to charge for it.
4133392	4136413	The more stuff you have coming at you, the more you can shoot out.
4139613	4143614	Everybody, also all the characters were equalized as far as their power is concerned.
4143654	4145074	There's additional bosses.
4146395	4149035	Two new enemies, which are a flamethrower and a giant egg.
4149055	4152796	Just little things, you know, graphical changes.
4154256	4157577	But there was a sequel that came out, which was...
4158720	4161502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4188729	4193954	Yeah, I have actually once played Nintendo 64, but there are some differences.
4194154	4196035	I actually think Nintendo 64 is a lot more balanced.
4196736	4197056	All right.
4197677	4200159	Well, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Bungaio.
4201540	4201841	Love it.
4202061	4202341	Play it.
