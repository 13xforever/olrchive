5890	14735	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15456	19138	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20119	24901	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for part B of our program.
27874	35480	and if you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Bros.
35520	35981	delay.
36341	51713	We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.
51773	54575	So let's get back into some regular gaming news.
55115	55736	Start off with Loki.
56360	68748	Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.
69489	76013	This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN, and basically they gave the time frame.
76113	83398	Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.
84539	84699	And...
87119	89081	I don't know, I'll believe it when I see it type thing.
89882	102815	If it is, they may show it at like E3 or something like that because it'd have to be kind of done, but I don't, you know, it's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of, um,
103826	108571	Release dates, because, you know... Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever, right?
108651	109112	Exactly.
109192	114478	I really hope this rumor is true, though, because I... Oh, I love me some... I love me some Duke Nukem, too.
114498	119763	It would be even better if some of the expansions and the whole made stuff come out as, you know, downloadable stuff.
119823	123567	I hope the build editor comes with it, because that would be awesome.
123587	124789	I love the voice macros.
125513	125893	Oh, yes.
126494	128375	Being able to make your own voice macros, that'd be awesome.
128736	131318	Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C.
131558	132219	mod or something?
132239	134400	I still remember having that on CD at one point.
134761	135001	Yeah.
136382	137163	I love Duke Nukem.
137483	138023	Duke Nukem's great.
138043	141326	I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.
142027	142327	Oh, yeah.
142827	143628	That was awesome.
144128	145049	You're laughing, Nathan.
145069	146931	Did that inspire... What's a modem?
148232	148572	What are you, 12?
148692	151675	I'm just kidding.
151875	152235	They let you...
154269	154509	All right.
155711	156672	So, yeah, Duke Nukem.
156892	161116	I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.
161156	166262	But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem forever, damn it.
166782	168284	No, no, this I'll allow.
169037	169998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
193055	196579	Um, well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great.
196619	199762	At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.
199822	203145	But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.
203205	204546	Yeah, like the day it came out.
205988	210172	So, alright, well, um, let's move on with some other gaming news.
210272	214296	Talking about Xbox Live still, but this time, talking about...
215214	218355	Rock Band, and Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.
218375	237821	The last segment we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs, because, you know, unlike last year, EA Harmonix has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.
238181	240281	They also retracted them after they announced them.
240321	240642	Did they?
240842	241082	Yeah.
241222	241862	Yeah, but still.
242469	245470	Don't look back in anger, live forever in Wonderwall
263250	264650	I'd rather not, thank you.
265750	268531	On January 29th, the Progressive Pack comes out.
268671	274292	Both packs will set you back 400 points, or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive Pack.
274532	276512	Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.
277132	279053	Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed.
279593	280413	That's also a cover.
281053	282673	Smashing Pumpkins with Siva.
283293	283793	Not a cover.
283914	285614	Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s.
285634	286874	That was like their first single ever.
287174	292655	So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.
293775	295356	and that's all we know until February.
295436	298537	So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.
298737	303298	Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.
303819	305679	We get Foreigner.
306720	306940	Ooh.
307260	308800	Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.
310081	313362	And Journey's Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.
313422	313742	Yes!
314542	315023	Journey!
315963	318964	Now, I'm more about Boston right now.
320184	322065	But, I don't know, they did
322934	323975	There's better songs.
324355	324835	Why those?
325816	327016	At least we're not getting hot-blooded.
327496	328577	But it's Journey.
328697	329657	It's awesome.
330758	335760	I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and Rock Band because their music wasn't showing up.
335800	336881	And I was like, where's the Journey?
336921	338922	And now it's coming out, and that makes me very happy.
340262	344424	I think that all three of these songs are also in Rock Band, I want to say.
345265	346325	I know Jukebox Hero is.
346725	347806	Jukebox Hero is, yeah.
348446	351668	And I know that there's another Boston song that's in...
353337	353958	and Rock Band.
355299	356119	I don't think this is it.
357420	357660	Anyway.
359442	361023	So, we're getting old rock.
361243	361463	Yay.
361703	365686	You know, if you play Boston Backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.
365826	366727	That is not true.
367648	368729	That's from Little Nicky.
369049	370770	Stop spreading lies on the internet.
372131	372912	You're one of those.
373032	373752	Yeah, that's my job.
376434	380037	So, speaking of another, well,
381604	387847	Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the U.S.
388868	395272	The first machine, apparently, is at In The Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
396412	404597	According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at start.
407018	407999	All the other fun stuff.
408079	409900	No EMUs support that.
410387	421136	I don't know.
421797	423218	I'm excited that there's new DDR.
424699	427662	Although it's not near us, so... I don't know.
427922	431345	You know, I already told you how I feel about DDR, and I got in a little trouble for it.
431385	435889	But, you know, I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2, and I'm just kind of like...
436573	438354	It's just the same thing with some new songs.
438374	439715	It needs to be another Max 2.
440495	443236	They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.
443296	454982	It's, you know, where they have, like, remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the Oni courses and stuff like that, and that was exciting, you know, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, you know, that kind of thing, and the way they tease that.
455362	459624	With these, like, DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.
459684	463246	It's just kind of like, DDR, here you go, enjoy.
463786	465767	Oh, another DDR, enjoy.
465787	466027	They don't
466345	468126	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
496101	503806	years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, you know, the younger kids that were, you know, our age when we started.
504367	505207	Maybe they'll get into it.
505267	507769	Stop dating me and yourself.
508289	509330	But Rob, I love you.
509530	510851	Not that, you know what I mean.
512252	514914	No, I know, but I mean, like, I'd have to play it.
514994	516595	I don't know, I'm not as excited.
516675	521138	I was excited probably when 4th Plus came out and 5th Mix.
521258	525941	That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know, I just don't care anymore.
526891	527111	Let's see.
527131	529873	I'm looking at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
531594	533415	SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.
534115	536637	DJ Janai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.
537357	539438	Ross Steel UT says, DDR Star Wars edition.
539478	539958	That would work.
540659	540879	No.
542099	542720	Forget it.
549062	558905	No, and see, that's partially, I think, why DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap like Hottest Party and all this stuff that's just absolute shit.
559165	562446	They should make a 12-player mode with peripherals.
562926	563647	That'd be great.
563767	566627	I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.
566908	575350	No, but seriously, they could do, like, you know, make some really elaborate cabinet that was 4-player, have, like, a quad mode or something like that that's in the arcade.
575390	576290	That would be different.
577411	578071	You know, and...
578621	584584	Like, even Animero gets behind Pump It Up, and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.
584984	586025	You know, Konami doesn't do anything.
586065	587545	It's just like, oh, look, it's DR. Yes.
589761	592303	I mean, even with, like, Beatmania, it's like, what's it matter?
592323	611177	I mean, we're gonna release another one in a few months anyway, so, I mean, it's... I know, it's like they think it's some kind of a self-advertising franchise, like, we already have a fanbase built in, we don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah, but, like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing, like, excite us about it, otherwise why should we give a shit, so... Alright.
611838	617642	Like I said, just reinvent DDR, make it competitive, I'll be all over that game again, just, you know, just
618488	619328	Start from scratch.
619708	620569	You know what DDR needs?
620769	621429	A new producer.
622069	630331	I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some... I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there, because obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.
630831	631391	That's what it needs.
631851	632371	Some new blood.
633431	634532	We are starting over, right?
635052	635692	Alright, anyhow.
636652	638833	Something else so you can get your music fixed through.
638953	640133	Not DDR, but the other type.
640173	640253	The
640720	641561	Thanks for watching!
659830	666755	They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.
666835	669537	They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.
670758	676782	You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.
677543	679985	Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.
681360	684162	They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.
684502	686384	Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.
686464	690887	The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert.
690927	691588	That's kind of cool.
692428	703877	As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal, February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California, at the Knob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.
704457	705458	So if you want to catch that.
705976	711877	and if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.
713017	720299	And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet, including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.
720739	722699	Dude, Jamie, Anaheim, California?
723039	723739	Disneyland.
723759	725420	Disneyland slash Video Games Live.
725440	726420	Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?
726540	726920	Let's go.
727080	727580	Let's do it.
729280	730281	I'd rather go to E3.
731441	732361	I would like to go to E3.
732381	732761	We'll see.
733644	734605	Anyhow, so there you have it.
734645	735166	Video games live.
735186	735587	That'll be fun.
735667	737308	I have not been yet.
737349	741674	Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwolf at all games.
741974	743436	He goes, he enjoys the show.
743496	747620	I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show, and he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.
747961	748622	Disney World!
749282	749623	I know!
749643	750624	It's even better!
751024	751725	God, guys.
752266	753327	So one-track-minded.
754861	756482	Disney Land, Disney Land, Disney Land
780902	781542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
803689	806312	God, would it be Space Mountain again in California?
806332	807933	Space Mountain and California Screamin'.
807953	808955	Rawr, that sounds great.
809015	811617	Anyway, sorry, we turned into the Disney cast for a minute.
811657	813519	Jamie, please take the show back on track.
814080	824170	Okay, so Devil May Cry 4, there is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.
825464	837566	And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on that was actually removed from the downloadable version that was saying it would be out.
837586	842107	And of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st and out a week later in North America and Europe.
843047	845027	But is it going to happen?
845047	849648	And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.
850468	853089	So is it true?
853169	853589	Is it not?
853629	854789	Did someone just screw up?
855509	858831	It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.
859231	860531	It makes sense.
861792	862092	Jinx.
863873	864393	Your mom.
866794	867735	Oh, you showed me.
868515	869556	She wins, Rob.
869596	870556	She said your mom.
870576	872677	What are you going to do now?
872697	875558	I like how Jamie said that off the mic.
875618	876079	I'm going to refuse.
876099	876979	She goes, I like your mom.
877919	879800	Just to clarify, I do like your mom.
879860	880561	Your mom's cool.
880641	881381	My mom is cool.
882281	883202	She'd bake pies too.
884031	886673	Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.
886693	890556	You guys can make me Easter cookies together.
891797	892437	Alright, forget it.
892778	893518	Anyway, let's move on.
893558	894459	More game news, please.
894679	898362	Well, something else is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N+.
899442	910250	If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.
910951	912352	And it's very fucking hard.
913263	923886	Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be, I think, on both Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer, as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.
924226	932669	Doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon, because apparently it's already, I guess, past their certification.
933369	935230	So, hooray!
935250	937510	Oh, that's a pretty fun game.
937710	942812	It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon, too.
944491	964216	Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to www.harveycartel.org That's H-A-R-V-E-Y Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano?
965436	966356	Well, it's Cartel.
968317	969237	Okay, never mind.
969990	981318	h-a-r-v-e-y c-a-r-t-e-l dot org slash metanet slash downloads.html and you can play the full game there.
981599	982079	It's pretty fun.
983040	984821	Lots of challenge, though.
987643	988163	Yay!
991065	992186	So is it going to be worth it?
992206	993647	Because N right now is free, right?
993727	996189	Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?
996229	998771	I think it'll be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in there.
999458	1001219	and they're going to have new levels.
1001419	1005280	There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.
1005360	1009122	So I know those are going to be in there and you get achievements.
1010062	1010342	All right.
1010842	1013823	Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.
1014203	1019345	That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers sucked during Christmas.
1019485	1021026	Apparently they're not that sorry.
1021786	1024827	Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.
1025067	1026908	Not a new game, a game that was already out.
1027595	1030456	But you will be able to download it for a limited time for free.
1030476	1034218	I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.
1034258	1037019	So you have about a three-day period roughly to get the game.
1037059	1045863	And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800-FOR-MY-XBOX, they're supposed to be able to do something for you.
1046143	1047303	Like maybe give you the points back?
1047444	1047724	Maybe.
1047784	1048864	They won't say, will they?
1049124	1049204	Yeah.
1049224	1050785	Because they don't want everybody to rush them.
1051226	1060150	That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary, but whatever.
1060450	1064691	I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.
1065332	1065932	But it's just...
1066741	1067461	It's kind of fucked up.
1067522	1069803	I'd rather have, like, you know, a free month of live or something.
1069823	1073525	It would have been a lot cheaper for them, too, but... The demo was kind of fun.
1073885	1074426	I'll look at it.
1074446	1077187	I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.
1077528	1077768	You're right.
1077808	1078828	I'll grab it while it's free.
1078908	1079329	Why not?
1079429	1080229	Add it to my collection.
1080249	1081410	You know, it's on the hard drive.
1081990	1085172	And quite frankly, they didn't really owe us anything to begin with, I don't think.
1085212	1087253	I think this whole thing got blown way out of proportion.
1087334	1088734	So it's kind of like, you know what?
1088774	1090595	If you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.
1090615	1091876	It was still kind of spotty.
1091936	1092277	Like, I...
1093775	1104698	I guess I hadn't played on live since like New Year's or something because I had to recover my gamer tag from I think year 360 and it had trouble doing that.
1104718	1114360	I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked which sucks because for whatever reason to download that like six megs as your gamer tag it takes like a half an hour.
1114380	1115400	It's crazy.
1116621	1118381	It's fucking slow but yeah.
1119096	1124100	I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.
1124440	1125961	Son of Dad, I wanted Rez.
1126962	1129163	Actdeft seems to think that Rez will be up this week.
1129203	1129824	I hope that's true.
1130124	1134707	Actually, that may be true because I think they said Rez was coming out in January and there's only one more week in January, right?
1135088	1135588	No, two more.
1135788	1136228	Oh, two more.
1136409	1136629	All right.
1136749	1137669	So in the next couple weeks.
1140313	1140753	We'll see.
1141154	1145757	I thought this week was... Didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought, already?
1145877	1146237	I don't know.
1146537	1150500	Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it was?
1150580	1151320	It looks stupid.
1151961	1152621	It was okay.
1152741	1157444	It's pretty much... There's a game just like it, Magical Drop, on the Neo Geo.
1157845	1161767	It's almost just like Magical Drop, but with bunnies, and you can run up the sides, too.
1161807	1167871	That was the other little innovation, is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.
1167991	1169092	It adds a new element to it.
1169472	1170333	But, I don't know.
1170553	1173075	Anyway, sorry, I got a little off track, but I realized I never talked about it during my game.
1173095	1175856	I was going to check out Omega 5, maybe, but... Omega 5's awesome.
1175876	1177057	You've got to check that out.
1177177	1178078	That's definitely worth a look.
1179479	1185243	If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron, or if you like the newer ones or whatever, check it out.
1185983	1186203	Do it.
1186944	1188765	Alright, so Undertow for free.
1188825	1189826	Be sure to take a look this week.
1190996	1196419	Another game, and actually I'm sort of interested in, is the Highlander game that's coming out.
1197820	1202943	You play as Owen MacLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.
1203103	1203563	Go fig.
1205464	1215469	Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day, and you've got a lot of people that you meet, and a lot of people you kill, and it's supposed to be really, really gory.
1216370	1217491	But part of it is...
1218720	1220901	Act as a Conductor for High Voltage Electrical Current
1244480	1245361	So it's pretty cool.
1245941	1254429	You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions, and full cities, and you can use zip wires and that type of thing.
1255129	1256431	And did I say gory?
1256471	1257411	Because it's supposed to be gory.
1258272	1259673	This game sounds epic.
1259934	1262236	Like, you just know something's going to go wrong, though.
1262476	1264478	Like, it's too good on paper.
1264858	1267080	Well, it's PS3, 360, and PC.
1267260	1268581	And it's made by Eidos.
1270403	1271564	It did give us Tomb Raider.
1272632	1273412	Ah, exactly.
1273632	1274193	Exactly.
1275093	1276993	Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.
1277513	1280594	The second one was the best because you could make her explode.
1281335	1281835	I do agree.
1281855	1286396	You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.
1286616	1288597	Now, Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?
1289417	1290217	That's what I just said.
1290677	1294418	Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.
1295739	1295999	Rob.
1296899	1297079	Rob.
1297918	1305622	Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob
1328802	1329763	Sure, they were.
1329943	1332884	I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, the new one.
1332924	1337286	But, you know, different strokes for different folks, right?
1337326	1339207	Everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.
1339407	1342668	Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.
1343049	1351933	Spore, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous release on the PC.
1352273	1354054	So, awesome.
1354094	1354434	They can...
1355916	1356436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1379503	1381864	Most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008.
1382324	1389308	And somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which, you know, the marketing probably just hasn't kicked in yet.
1389348	1390529	I'm sure there'll be more later on.
1390829	1392049	But that Spore was overhyped.
1392089	1395651	And I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough, in my opinion.
1395711	1404335	Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but, I mean, I don't know if our poster, you know, everybody's welcome to their own opinion.
1404395	1407457	I don't know if the poster saw what I saw at E3 and stuff, but...
1407677	1408317	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1433877	1442260	Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin but has no sort of optical drive on it at all.
1442280	1443661	It has one USB port.
1445681	1450743	And so if you want to actually use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked.
1450763	1454865	You have to buy a $99 drive for it.
1455145	1461447	Or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck probably and use its optical drive.
1462638	1465040	I'm sorry, but that's... Oh, and $1,700.
1466041	1466641	Awesome!
1466741	1467782	Good job!
1467862	1468723	Good job, Steve Jones.
1468983	1470544	You really know what the consumer wants.
1470624	1472345	Crap for lots of money.
1472886	1473566	Hooray!
1473846	1480611	But I'm sure all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.
1480812	1482373	Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen.
1483974	1485315	He can send those cards and letters...
1485649	1486950	to Loki at OrangeSongTrader.com
1508174	1509055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1529295	1530896	Street Fighter Online.
1530937	1532558	There's some more news coming out about this.
1532618	1539164	Remember, they licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online.
1539744	1541185	But it's mouse controlled.
1541285	1545129	Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that were going to be in an MMO.
1545809	1547691	Right, no, this is a whole other thing.
1548071	1565944	I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses in certain combinations and click, you do the special attacks.
1566165	1566625	That's dumb.
1566845	1568426	That could be very interesting.
1568686	1570608	I have no idea how that's going to be.
1571455	1575980	But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about this game.
1576180	1576580	Like what?
1576900	1581805	Like the ability to, like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.
1583707	1584668	That's pretty awesome.
1585389	1587150	A little taunts with your cat.
1587310	1590253	You know, you can have, like, ceiling cat, you know, and stuff like that.
1590493	1594097	Ceiling cat is watching you lose.
1594157	1594437	I don't know.
1596107	1599748	Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltech toys.
1600089	1601609	That is an actual line of toys.
1603010	1604870	And they have the toys for this, too, that you can buy.
1605431	1605691	Nice.
1605831	1607311	So I can get my very own Chun-Li doll?
1607531	1607731	Yes.
1608112	1608452	Awesome.
1608852	1613053	Well, the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.
1613634	1618115	The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.
1618736	1621777	For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet.
1621797	1622377	There's no news.
1623397	1624257	We'll see you next time.
1659041	1661204	Hello, DarkSakura, Skye, and OtherDude.
1665448	1666328	Poor OtherDude.
1667109	1668250	That's fine, I'm OtherDude.
1668370	1669792	Nathan, you're already getting mails.
1669912	1670473	What do you think?
1670533	1672434	Hey, OtherDude, good job.
1672855	1673596	Welcome to the show.
1674737	1675057	Forget it.
1675535	1685483	I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot in my human growth class stole my PSP Slim, which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on it.
1685943	1692308	It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen, and it had my podcast for OLR.
1692968	1695030	Okay, this person doesn't use any punctuation, so sorry.
1695711	1703076	One of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you to people who steal and bully people, plus the stupid kid.
1703517	1705338	His name is, I'm not going to say his name.
1705905	1713691	It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook this kid had weed in his bag along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.
1714231	1715252	Kids today!
1715372	1715892	Jesus!
1716212	1724678	But get this, I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website worthy of going to all geeky things for girls and guys.
1724758	1726259	It's ofthinkgeek.com.
1726780	1727040	Okay.
1727981	1733044	Well, the background video for Potsilvania Dances and Chorus is like seen from Advent Children.
1733525	1735426	I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have...
1736778	1741220	Every title made, but did you know that Konami had Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?
1741920	1748603	Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.
1749304	1756427	I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game Boy, which sucked, by the way.
1757827	1763850	I love the portable aspect of this, but Stepmania has recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution, but that's how much...
1764739	1767501	I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.
1767981	1768341	Okay.
1768742	1775486	Is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist is going downhill to the mainstream crowd.
1775506	1779888	Okay, only our emails would go from cocaine in somebody's underwear to DDR Disney Channel.
1779928	1782090	What the... WTF, LOL.
1782110	1783591	There's no punctuation.
1784391	1786973	The only periods in this are used in a URL.
1789537	1791878	Don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.
1817694	1818134	Thank you.
1818234	1820315	Thank you for our lesson of the week.
1820375	1824676	And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in boredom and says help.
1825756	1831437	Well, I would say if your, you know, PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross because that was a good game.
1833117	1836378	Orange Lounge Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.
1837078	1838579	That's not a nice thing to do.
1838639	1840259	Or pick cocaine in your underwear.
1840299	1840579	Yes.
1840959	1844300	Everybody knows you put it in your jacket, in the inside liner, you've got to...
1844969	1845529	Just kidding.
1845569	1848371	You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.
1851052	1851312	Okay.
1851573	1856315	Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn how to put it in your body cavity.
1856415	1857076	So there you go.
1858036	1863419	Oh, and this person was called... As soon as... Email servers are tuning up.
1863559	1864379	Punctuation man.
1865800	1867281	DSMaster25.
1869102	1870923	Which is like... It sounds like an old AOL screen name.
1871103	1871483	Wait, wait, wait.
1871723	1872564	DSMaster...
1873630	1879494	So the guy had his PSP, I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand, this story is completely crazy.
1879634	1881015	Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.
1882295	1885938	He talks about how much he misses his PSP, and he's DS fan.
1887238	1887899	But I'm bum.
1888499	1889680	Okay, next email.
1889740	1891501	Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.
1891921	1894463	Oh, okay, okay, there it is.
1894503	1895203	No, that can't be it.
1897045	1897505	Whatever.
1898045	1899606	Can I read the next email, Rob?
1899666	1900307	Yes, you may.
1900327	1900927	Okay, stop.
1901570	1901870	Love you.
1924480	1932029	Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give you a copy of Super Stardust HD.
1932109	1934092	How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?
1934693	1937977	It's a relatively easy process, and I'd be happy to share my games with you.
1938778	1941521	So add Resumo to your friends list and we'll talk.
1942025	1943265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1965487	1972131	I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the iCamera and in the process help Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.
1972391	1973112	Never gonna happen.
1973452	1974332	Never gonna happen.
1974452	1979736	I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other game in all our history.
1979756	1981437	Great, and it's still under cheese big time.
1981457	1990002	We've had guests on to promote, you know, Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote, you know, and, you know, I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought...
1990943	1994245	24 of the game because you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.
1994645	2003991	No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a tingle suit if you can tell a million of your friends to buy this game.
2004752	2008734	It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.
2008874	2009915	It's starting to flat out.
2010215	2014618	And in fact, in Japan, they only sold like a couple hundred units the other week.
2014718	2019181	So it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one millionth.
2019858	2022140	DJ Janai now calls it the brown eye of fudgement.
2024542	2025862	Can I finish reading this email, please?
2025903	2026523	Yes, you may.
2026583	2026863	Sorry.
2027123	2029225	The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.
2029365	2035650	I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.
2035730	2038092	I can store as much as 5 gigs of video on the hard drive.
2039333	2045837	Attached is a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1,000 mile rally arcade machine that I recorded with the iCamera.
2046538	2047759	And I'll watch it later.
2047799	2048079	It's an MP4.
2050538	2053259	Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter 2 machine that I just bought.
2053679	2054999	She loves my Pac-Man the most.
2055279	2059580	Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to this show on my PSP.
2059920	2063741	I made the mistake of listening to this show last week while drinking coffee and ringing up a customer.
2064101	2068842	Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow-cooking George Foreman girl and I laughed and spat coffee at my customer's face.
2069282	2070242	Not good for business.
2071462	2075963	Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't have to pay for his merchandise.
2076960	2080441	Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.
2081201	2081861	I love that.
2081961	2084842	It's so strange to me the effect this show has.
2084942	2094864	Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a BART ride home from San Francisco or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.
2095144	2097685	It's amazing what you can achieve.
2097745	2098945	Yeah, that's mostly Loki's fault.
2098985	2099545	I'll give him that.
2100846	2103326	Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.
2103386	2103907	It's not nice.
2103967	2104487	Yeah, really.
2104887	2105847	Oh, yeah, it's my fault.
2106656	2115223	and just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting so that we can see your daughter play a video game.
2116624	2117405	Sorry, was it goddaughter?
2117485	2117665	Yeah.
2118305	2118826	Play a video game.
2120467	2121828	Next email.
2122869	2127713	Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorse DS piracy.
2128693	2131756	I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.
2133482	2134182	500 games in total.
2134643	2136885	I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.
2136925	2138106	Crack firmware on iPod games.
2138146	2139448	Should you really read this on the air?
2139488	2140108	From Ryan.
2142571	2143532	You know, here's the thing.
2144133	2144833	Here's the thing about that.
2144873	2151300	Like, I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.
2151320	2152161	You know, it's just like,
2153734	2155375	I could pirate all these games.
2155415	2157575	As the FBI is coming to Ryan's house right now.
2158155	2158595	Oh, yeah.
2159376	2161316	We've narrowed it down to Ryan.
2161376	2162517	Let's find Ryan.
2162557	2163517	How many Ryans are there?
2163717	2165097	Oh, only a couple billion.
2165177	2165617	Oh, wait a minute.
2165657	2167058	Ryan's not listening to this program.
2167078	2168078	There's probably only one.
2169118	2170239	We don't have that many listeners.
2171699	2172279	He emailed.
2172319	2173820	He didn't say he listened to the program.
2173860	2174920	He just emailed us.
2175380	2176180	IP tracking.
2176220	2176700	Let me see.
2178061	2182082	But anyway, the only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all the games I don't want to import.
2182967	2183727	That's why I have it.
2184288	2186469	Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.
2187129	2189190	My husband, you know, manages a game crazy.
2191271	2196533	By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.
2196893	2197874	That game sucks.
2199274	2200055	It's not good at all.
2200075	2201035	Didn't you say that last week?
2202643	2204864	Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing.
2232634	2232874	Okay.
2233314	2235776	It's A-M-A-Z-I-Z-I-N-G.
2236216	2242220	You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news that we all want.
2242240	2248905	You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with any... I feel... I don't know.
2248925	2253428	I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other publishers.
2253808	2255529	Hey, we'll promote your stuff.
2256530	2256870	No thanks.
2257110	2258551	I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.
2258591	2261073	Sorry, Jamie.
2261778	2262738	Okay.
2262778	2263339	Blame him.
2264759	2265140	I am.
2266000	2266600	Can I read now?
2266780	2267000	Yes.
2267140	2267441	Okay.
2267661	2272963	I love how the mailbag segment always turns into, how many times can we cut off Jamie with a random tangent?
2272983	2275384	How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?
2275404	2276825	Sorry, go ahead.
2277305	2284188	Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd only listened to before on my PSP, even though I live overseas.
2284808	2287309	I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.
2287450	2290671	Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stories.
2291291	2295954	DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem to have anything special
2313837	2318941	Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a Worst Game of the Week segment or something like that?
2319361	2320502	Loki is special.
2320842	2323584	It would give him a chance to blow off some steam, LOL.
2324225	2327287	I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a Worst Game of the Week.
2327327	2328348	That's kind of stupid.
2330029	2331470	That's the worst idea of the week.
2331791	2333792	Poor listener.
2334413	2335073	Can I finish?
2335573	2335814	Yes.
2335894	2336214	Thank you.
2337015	2337675	Well, that's about it.
2337795	2338776	Again, an ego plug...
2343160	2344762	Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.
2344842	2345363	I'm sorry.
2345383	2346524	You're like, can I finish?
2347105	2348046	Well, that's just about it.
2360301	2361282	I hate you guys.
2363263	2364464	Anyway, well that's about it.
2364824	2372290	Again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being, and being 15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.
2372671	2373691	Keep up the awesome work.
2373791	2377595	Wow, this person writes a very freaking good, you know, email for being 15.
2378555	2380277	And this is from TheFlawlessBoltX.
2381246	2388628	PS, I bought myself an Eye of Judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.
2389048	2391228	PSS, put more crap on the PSP website.
2391489	2392209	I never get tired of that.
2392249	2392769	No!
2392929	2393689	I will never!
2395830	2397250	It will stay the way it is.
2397750	2400291	It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.
2401911	2403692	Which I think we finally let expire.
2405392	2409693	Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.
2411870	2414171	So, to keep on reading.
2414311	2417173	Dear OLR crew, this is Ranma from Indonesia.
2417213	2418353	I think, yeah, you've written to us.
2418433	2419574	Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.
2419954	2421295	It's been a while since my last email.
2422016	2424077	I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.
2424537	2430080	To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments about game-related contents.
2430140	2431541	Keep getting crazy then.
2432338	2437020	to Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game-related content in your mocking style.
2437080	2437541	I love that.
2437941	2442783	Nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.
2443564	2451108	To DarkSakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week, as I am blind, so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.
2451648	2454129	Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.
2455150	2458932	By the way, guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.
2459272	2461353	I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.
2461789	2464270	Yes, I love playing recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.
2465171	2467712	And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.
2468332	2469393	Everyone sent us movies this week.
2470953	2471954	Yeah, there's links on here.
2475075	2480038	These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments and I will add more songs to play.
2480078	2481098	Perhaps Dragon Force.
2481658	2485200	It did Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok.
2485260	2486041	Hey, I love Ragnarok.
2486881	2488041	More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.
2488662	2489742	That's kind of old school.
2490503	2491043	That's pretty cool.
2492392	2493173	Last email, dun dun dun.
2510953	2514594	Back then it was your abbreviated Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
2515014	2530438	I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the podcasts I was getting, and yours was one of the longest, but recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors don't notice me on it all day, or call me on it, and have me subscribe.
2530478	2531978	Now I listen to your show every week.
2532318	2537299	Anywho, for starters, you'll notice that I've included an attachment.
2538259	2539980	God, we've been getting attachments all...
2541261	2544324	I'm trying to blow up our email box.
2545004	2553571	I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare to Be Stupid as the background music for your Stupid Awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your dialogue on top of it.
2554251	2557994	I've included an instrumental version of the song taken from the Amish Paradise single.
2558315	2562118	I ripped the file myself, so I know it's legit, in case you want to use it in future segments.
2562298	2563759	That's cool.
2563779	2568723	The background vocals on the chorus are still there, so it's still relevant.
2570183	2574524	Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played during last week's FU segment?
2575024	2582547	I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others.
2583007	2586248	And I was wondering if you could hook me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.
2586808	2588688	It's on the Advent Children soundtrack.
2590009	2592289	But I'll take care of this later.
2593350	2593830	Stay tuned.
2601576	2604478	How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?
2606279	2606579	Anyway.
2607700	2609761	So, if I may continue.
2611543	2614345	Finally, the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.
2615285	2620128	I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney World.
2621449	2622010	I'll leave it at that.
2622370	2624811	Well, nice.
2624891	2626913	We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.
2627813	2632276	Keep up the great work and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as I can get away with it.
2632676	2635298	Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.
2635838	2637459	Sincerely, Justin the Claw.
2638740	2638880	P.S.
2640350	2646352	On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to a game as addicting.
2646872	2648252	When did that word become an adjective?
2648592	2651713	According to Merian Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.
2651813	2653833	Addictive would be the proper adjective form.
2654394	2655354	You're not the only one to do this.
2655394	2658175	It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.
2658515	2659975	I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.
2660355	2663476	I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?
2663576	2664296	No offense, of course.
2664356	2665296	I'm just making an observation.
2665737	2667437	Yes, but it could also be an understood object.
2669301	2670162	Whatever, dude.
2670242	2673384	Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.
2674325	2678008	I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.
2679329	2680010	Don't hate.
2680750	2683532	See, the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.
2686755	2689557	He learns something new every week here on Orange Lines Radio.
2692820	2694001	And FreezePop emailed us.
2695089	2695329	Really?
2695889	2699790	I'm like, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?
2700050	2702251	Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of weeks.
2702311	2705251	The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.
2705392	2706352	I'm so excited.
2706612	2707752	I will tell you who it is next week.
2708832	2709753	No, I won't.
2709893	2710833	Well, I'll tell you later.
2711973	2713133	Yes, I will.
2713573	2714294	In a private room.
2715374	2719715	Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.
2720888	2724790	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
2725130	2731353	Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow up and self-destruct.
2731813	2732474	So please don't do that.
2733314	2735335	And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.
2736075	2740197	All right, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we haven't even touched, right, Loki?
2741078	2741538	Definitely.
2742118	2745560	The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced.
2747826	2759951	Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version, and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network as Bionic Commando Rearmed.
2760691	2761892	Looks fucking awesome.
2761992	2764073	It's going to have two-player co-op in the game.
2764673	2771536	It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.
2772391	2776274	New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses.
2776794	2779296	But it's basically going to follow the original game.
2779616	2780877	This game looks so hot.
2781017	2785861	I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go seek out the video for this.
2786621	2787442	Everybody has it, right?
2787482	2788483	Yeah, pretty much everyone.
2788863	2790204	Every big video game site has it.
2790484	2791525	It looks so hot.
2791725	2793086	That is the way you redo an old game.
2793106	2794807	I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.
2794847	2795608	Me too, me too.
2797178	2806866	But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy.
2806906	2809949	He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.
2810189	2810709	That's cool.
2811230	2811950	That is great.
2812851	2814693	Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?
2815453	2816974	As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.
2817935	2819937	Well, I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right?
2819977	2820798	To be politically correct?
2820838	2823680	Well, they could still be... His name is now Hyler.
2824710	2826550	I don't know, it's just like
2854457	2859080	I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, just... It's the claw.
2859520	2860041	The claw.
2860921	2863783	See, just in the claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?
2864443	2867045	Alright, anyway.
2867105	2874270	If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking game that kind of moves like an M.C.
2874430	2875110	Escher piece.
2875230	2879633	Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to be making its way to the PlayStation 3.
2879673	2882855	You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.
2882895	2883856	This was one of their kind of like
2884412	2884673	and more.
2904495	2909119	Check this out on March 19th, which coincidentally is the same day that you can actually check out the PSP version.
2909440	2911241	And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.
2911762	2913103	If I had a PS3, I'd check it out.
2913123	2915265	But since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and check it out there.
2916986	2917527	Sound good, Loki?
2918247	2918467	Sure.
2918527	2920029	I'm crashing your party.
2921070	2923132	All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.
2924773	2925774	Very cool.
2926534	2930458	Well, in other news, crap.
2931894	2932194	Really?
2932415	2933175	What kind of crap?
2933315	2938099	No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.
2938660	2942143	So I have to reload show roll.
2942263	2942724	Oh, that's okay.
2942764	2943204	We can wait.
2945346	2945846	You know what?
2948809	2949369	Give me a second.
2949409	2951051	I just bit on a Vetrix, by the way.
2951624	2951944	Cool!
2951964	2953025	You're going to buy a Vectrex?
2953105	2953405	Why?
2953545	2958847	Because someone in Stockton is selling one and right now the bidding is up to $50 and it comes with like 10 games.
2959187	2960127	But what do you want it for?
2960187	2960847	Just to see how... I want a Vectrex.
2960867	2962488	Put it in my desk at work.
2963468	2965609	DarkSakura is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.
2965789	2966049	I don't care.
2966069	2966510	You better watch it.
2966530	2967090	I'll do it too.
2968290	2968730	Whatever.
2968770	2969851	If I don't win, I don't win.
2969891	2972072	I'm not like that dead set on getting it.
2972192	2974813	I bought, like I said, that Bit Generations game.
2976433	2977334	What's it called?
2977594	2978214	DotStream.
2979514	2980375	It's up, by the way.
2980715	2980975	All right.
2982790	2983251	It will be.
2984912	2985493	Okay.
2988235	2992699	Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.
2992719	2994060	It has 16 games on it.
2994080	2996402	It will be on PS2 and PSP.
2997342	3003527	And it's going to be... Let's see what's on here.
3004668	3005089	We have...
3007245	3022491	Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku, Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician Lord, but they're not on there.
3024732	3026452	Actually, yes.
3027753	3028853	Yes, they are on there, sorry.
3031094	3032114	We just can't make up our mind.
3032134	3033875	There's so many SNK classics to choose from.
3034195	3034955	No, they are on there.
3036116	3036456	Excellent.
3037403	3037643	Guitar Hero 3
3065976	3078867	They're going to be doing a little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say, on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.
3079708	3085273	You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live.
3085879	3100003	on Guitar03, where you can possibly win a LG 50-inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and a Boomchair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.
3100143	3100863	A Boomchair?
3101083	3101923	Yes, Boomchair.
3104424	3114967	Also, you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller faceplate signed by Slash, and some other crap, including, I think, some points and
3119482	3120522	So that should be cool.
3121882	3127083	Actually, it looks like the event is going to go from February 1st through the 3rd.
3127243	3129384	So, yeah, it's 72 hours.
3130164	3139106	But I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12 to 4, isn't a big deal there.
3139526	3143207	Oh, and it's for US and Canada only.
3143387	3144507	So, sorry everybody else.
3145894	3147214	Sorry, international people.
3147695	3151476	Apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.
3152596	3153296	No, just kidding.
3154057	3155337	There's probably laws or something.
3155357	3155657	I don't know.
3155777	3160018	If you want to find out more information on us, go to xbox.com slash rockyourparty.
3160438	3162059	We're going to rock your party.
3163709	3170191	All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we are going to get to the Skype line, where you can call us and interact with us.
3170211	3179354	You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give us a call toll-free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3179394	3183835	We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.
3183875	3184775	It's one we don't talk about.
3184815	3185936	It's not really World of Warcraft.
3185956	3191518	We don't talk about this game very much, but it is, I believe, the most popular MMO in the world, even above World of Warcraft.
3191578	3192478	It's a game called Lineage 2.
3194045	3195688	and, yeah, you know Lineage 2?
3195848	3196769	Have you played Lineage 2?
3197370	3199994	No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2.
3200334	3201596	I'm like, hey, I've heard of that before.
3201616	3202557	I have a Coke can.
3202898	3203319	I do too.
3203339	3205742	I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.
3206010	3206451	Lineage 2 Lineage 2
3226029	3228031	A Russian man has been charged with murder.
3229012	3233117	It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.
3234298	3235600	There were these two clans.
3235640	3238403	There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.
3238803	3240525	It's the Ku Klux Klan.
3242488	3244630	That's, yeah, wow, that's all I can say on that one.
3244997	3246359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3257774	3259254	and Plotanium were people over 30.
3260315	3267157	And the guy who was killed here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer.
3268057	3268997	And he had a clan.
3269037	3270178	There were warriors in the clan.
3270498	3273939	And just before New Year, there was a big old battle with the Ku Klux.
3274439	3278680	And for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face-to-face in the real world.
3279511	3280752	Sign of trouble right there.
3281232	3286136	And when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.
3286597	3291181	Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, Amazing.
3307765	3310487	Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?
3310687	3314410	Like, is this like a satire website or whatever?
3314490	3316671	But I think it's real.
3318493	3321055	That's kind of, wow, sad.
3323376	3324157	Sad, sad, sad.
3325057	3325778	That was awful.
3326899	3328660	No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?
3330305	3337768	Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3 and apparently someone found Goatse in Zelda 3.
3342090	3343431	It was ridiculous, but funny.
3344772	3350394	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness or anything else we've talked about tonight.
3350414	3352395	You can go ahead and give us a call right now.
3352495	3356417	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3356457	3357437	Let's go to the phones.
3357497	3358558	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3358578	3358958	Who's this?
3362810	3364031	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3364071	3364451	Who's this?
3364791	3365091	You there?
3365511	3365812	Caller?
3368053	3370354	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
3370374	3372755	Hello.
3372775	3374056	Okay, apparently our caller's not there.
3374136	3377978	Make sure you always check your connection with Echo 123.
3378619	3379619	Let's try this one instead.
3379679	3380660	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3380680	3381040	Who's this?
3383481	3385502	Hello, this is ION671.
3385762	3387143	Hello, ION671.
3387163	3387683	What's on your mind?
3390005	3392086	Well, I just want to say that
3393126	3398789	I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that, like, you know, parents don't understand games.
3399570	3406613	Because I'm a kid, you know, 16, and both my parents are really into video games and anime.
3408374	3414578	Like, my dad just was saying, like, how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.
3415719	3421101	You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns, and you're very lucky to have them, right?
3421362	3421682	Yes.
3424780	3432607	because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games and think that they are the devil's creation.
3433247	3436610	What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?
3437591	3440193	Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?
3442735	3443696	I really don't know.
3443756	3445578	I may have just been lucky.
3448660	3450482	Actually, Rice Princess is asking a question here.
3450502	3450702	Hold on.
3451155	3455897	I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were younger?
3457898	3471484	Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games, but then they grow up for quotation fingers.
3474665	3480488	And there's some people who see it as childish, so they disregard it.
3481674	3484796	or Discard.
3484996	3485717	It's late.
3486377	3491041	I would assume that in your household, you sound pretty well off for 16.
3491081	3492582	You sound like you're a smart kid.
3493322	3495023	Obviously, you're smart because you're listening to this show.
3496144	3500247	Video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've turned out okay.
3500447	3502168	Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?
3503889	3504109	No.
3504289	3506291	Then you probably turned out A-okay.
3506591	3509593	What do you think other families can learn from yours?
3512216	3525760	Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because every so often they mention a game called Granddad's Otter, so I'm wondering why parents are still buying it for their kids.
3526240	3527040	That's a good question.
3527420	3528601	Hey, I got another question for you.
3528641	3530361	Do your parents play the games with you?
3533142	3533662	Oh, yeah.
3534842	3540924	Well, of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually kick my ass
3541528	3542068	at Burnout.
3542309	3543449	He is a Burnout machine.
3543469	3545030	It's just the next generation.
3565188	3566329	Well, I wouldn't support it, so good luck at that.
3566349	3566649	One last thing?
3566669	3568631	I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all this PSP stuff.
3568651	3570032	And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.
3591764	3593625	Okay, well, I'm very sorry.
3593725	3598686	So look, we disavow all knowledge of that email and anything that was ever said.
3599486	3599786	Okay.
3600326	3601107	Why would he sue?
3601147	3601927	I mean, seriously.
3602627	3603767	He's the one breaking the law.
3604688	3609049	And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.
3609749	3610849	See, we didn't know that before.
3611169	3612210	So we ought to sue you.
3612650	3613050	Okay.
3613846	3615828	I just said I know him.
3615908	3617469	I don't say I know him personally.
3618209	3618830	Oh, okay.
3618890	3619370	Oh, snap.
3619611	3621232	See how I flipped that right back at you?
3621572	3622152	Aha.
3623193	3623974	In your face, Rob.
3623994	3625655	Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?
3625675	3626656	You did.
3626776	3627817	Rob got majorly pwned.
3628217	3630519	That was indeed a zing, Rob.
3631760	3633821	You got a zing.
3634162	3634422	All right.
3634702	3635983	For that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.
3636984	3637464	Bye.
3637765	3638085	Okay, bye.
3638145	3638505	All right.
3638525	3639066	Have a good week.
3640106	3640887	That was a good call.
3641274	3642154	That was a really good call.
3642194	3643195	That was a very good call.
3643215	3645216	One of our better calls.
3645236	3650458	I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.
3650898	3652779	Invite yourself, Rob.
3652799	3653599	My parents will buy beer.
3656341	3657501	I hope they buy good beer.
3658201	3658502	All right.
3658542	3659702	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3659722	3664464	Who's this?
3664524	3666165	Is Justin TV fucking up Skype tonight?
3666225	3667265	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3667285	3667666	Who's this?
3670047	3670327	Hello?
3670387	3670787	Hi, hi.
3672247	3672587	Hello?
3673608	3675350	Oh, okay.
3675610	3676230	Sorry about that.
3676270	3676991	I have a microphone.
3677691	3679153	Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.
3679173	3681154	You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.
3681174	3681494	What's up?
3686358	3686679	How's that?
3687019	3687699	Ah, much better.
3687740	3688440	What's on your mind?
3688500	3689401	Introduce yourself.
3689561	3689801	Yes.
3690242	3690882	Introduce yourself.
3694225	3696467	Oh, by the way... Okay, sorry.
3696647	3697087	Sorry, dude.
3697207	3697267	Um...
3699804	3705706	Okay, um, I don't know, I'm just hanging out and, you know, listening on the East Coast, I guess.
3707366	3707927	What's your name?
3708407	3709727	Or you have an online name, or?
3714269	3715949	Uh, yeah, Banjo, in the chat room.
3716389	3717089	Okay, cool.
3717129	3719390	Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?
3719710	3722571	Was there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?
3725752	3728173	I was... I don't...
3729508	3733811	I don't know, I just wanted to say... Oh, oh, what?
3736653	3737834	Sorry.
3737874	3739775	I'm sorry, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
3740055	3744498	Oh, oh, do you mind if I... I got Akula in the same room, do you want to talk to him?
3745099	3745919	Uh, sure, okay.
3750402	3750682	Okay.
3755446	3755806	Hello?
3756046	3756386	Hello?
3757427	3757687	Hello.
3757927	3758908	Hi, identify yourself.
3760540	3760840	Hello.
3761321	3762021	Hi, who's this?
3763062	3763923	This is Okuda.
3764083	3764944	Hello, Okuda.
3765785	3767266	Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.
3767367	3769088	I mean, we're just an internet radio show.
3769649	3770830	Nothing to be scared of, right?
3771130	3771591	Right, Okuda?
3774533	3777316	Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.
3777476	3780759	Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.
3780779	3781260	What's on your mind?
3786176	3792361	I was wondering, I play World of Warcraft a lot, I was wondering, do you like private servers?
3792681	3794563	What's your opinion on private servers?
3795864	3797265	I'm sorry, on crowded servers?
3797605	3798246	Private servers.
3798266	3799487	Oh, private servers.
3799807	3799927	Oh.
3800368	3801268	I don't know much about them.
3801348	3802489	I mean, I know they're out there.
3804011	3810156	I've understood it's kind of a risky thing, because once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?
3810176	3810276	Right.
3811021	3811521	I don't know.
3811761	3813742	But private servers are kind of corny.
3813782	3816863	I mean, like, yeah, you can do... I was into a cash file.
3818303	3818423	Oh.
3818804	3819644	You can dump a cash file.
3820044	3820144	Oh.
3820244	3820504	I guess.
3820624	3821484	But anyway, sorry, go ahead.
3821504	3827186	No, I'm just saying, like, you can mod it to be, like, super strong or, like, make all this money and stuff, but that makes the game boring to me.
3827286	3828106	Like, I don't know.
3828126	3829007	You can have the nude patch.
3829847	3830767	You can have the nude patch.
3830827	3831588	I'm there.
3832608	3833728	Only on the private servers.
3833748	3834068	Really?
3834168	3836649	I have three characters on... Oh my god, you pervert!
3836669	3837510	Get away from me!
3837690	3838290	Stop sitting next to me!
3838310	3838830	They're all...
3840791	3844754	Oh my... Get especially away from me.
3844774	3845995	That doesn't even make sense.
3846976	3847196	Ew.
3847756	3849177	Well, okay.
3849777	3855059	But private servers, I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.
3855119	3863121	I mean you need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at 2 in the morning on a private server.
3863561	3872264	So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, there's not – you can't really progress very far I would think.
3872624	3872884	I don't know.
3872904	3874004	Do you have a difference of opinion?
3874325	3875665	Akuta, do you play on a private server?
3877678	3878458	and how do you like it?
3879699	3881240	Yeah, I'd play in a private server.
3883541	3885522	Yeah.
3886042	3887342	Sorry, there's a huge lag.
3888023	3889864	It's probably Justin TV screwing everything up.
3889884	3890304	That's alright.
3891104	3895846	Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous.
3895886	3897747	Hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?
3898467	3899568	Thanks for having me.
3901089	3901949	No problemo.
3904550	3905751	I think they're handing the phone back.
3905771	3906191	I'm not sure.
3907136	3907496	Okay.
3907716	3908016	All right.
3908857	3909637	Have a good one, you guys.
3910698	3911018	All right.
3911438	3912539	Okay, thanks for having us.
3912599	3913299	You're welcome.
3913539	3914040	You too.
3914900	3915620	Smoke another bud.
3915841	3916101	All right.
3916121	3917621	That's terrible.
3917862	3918602	I'm kidding.
3918682	3919322	I'm kidding.
3919342	3920323	They're just nervous.
3920403	3921043	God, come on.
3921924	3924165	But if they do smoke a bud, they'll relax.
3926186	3926886	Not that I would know.
3926946	3928387	No, we're not encouraging that, though.
3928447	3928887	We would never.
3929287	3929508	No.
3929568	3929888	That's wrong.
3929908	3932129	But if you feel so inclined, it would...
3932637	3933137	Hope you relax.
3933157	3934739	All right, look, we give people shit.
3934759	3935259	That's what we do.
3935619	3936840	Like, we're going to give our next caller.
3936880	3937841	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3937861	3938201	Who's this?
3939462	3940143	It's me, Ranma.
3940163	3940783	What's up, everyone?
3940823	3941524	Hello, Ranma.
3941544	3942525	Hello, Ranjan.
3942705	3943685	What is up, Ranma?
3943705	3945307	Speaking of giving people shit.
3945427	3945947	Not mine.
3947088	3948009	No, that was me.
3948049	3950430	I called the first set, but my headset was acting really retarded.
3950991	3952032	Sorry about that.
3952112	3953052	Yeah, echo 123 next time.
3953353	3954454	Yeah, that was the headset.
3954474	3955835	I think that was user error, Ranma.
3955855	3956435	What's on your mind?
3957456	3957716	Yeah, that.
3958257	3958977	Oh, not too much.
3959017	3964220	I want to talk about that whole PlayStation Dusty article you talked about earlier.
3964480	3964980	Dust Cap 3.
3968302	3968662	What about it?
3968702	3969163	Pretty much.
3970463	3971003	Check this out.
3971084	3975946	I mean, I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now off the consumers.com.
3976446	3980968	I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.
3981369	3983830	As somebody who's been in the technical field for about ten years...
3984844	3991509	Even in the worst conditions, I've never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty.
3992850	3997054	So obviously this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.
3997574	4001637	Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website.
4002358	4006461	Supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.
4009295	4014317	It's coming from Consumerist.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.
4014357	4015697	They're both in that same thing.
4015737	4017698	Their blogs are also very similar looking.
4018458	4019779	I actually kind of like Consumerist.
4019799	4025921	They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.
4025941	4026641	But anyhow, sorry.
4026961	4028622	I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.
4028642	4028982	That's fine.
4029662	4033083	So we're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation, and
4034157	4037299	Was this person smoking right in front of it?
4037739	4039000	Was it just poorly ventilated?
4039040	4045163	I look at Loki's house and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that.
4045604	4047605	DarkSakura's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that.
4047765	4049206	I don't think it's the machine.
4049246	4051247	I think there's something the person is doing.
4052467	4053188	That's what it is.
4053868	4055269	Is the cat sleeping on it at night?
4056482	4059683	I don't know, he's just stuck in somewhere to easily collect dust in a basement or something.
4059923	4065284	Now, the next link I posted off the consumer is, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.
4065624	4070185	If you read the comments, you find out that the guy that complained about this is an actor.
4070405	4074066	And now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.
4074126	4077507	And I also posted a link from playtime.net about it.
4077547	4079848	The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?
4081788	4082168	Yeah.
4082288	4082628	Why?
4082648	4085809	Supposedly, this guy is a paid... He was paid to do this.
4087190	4092815	This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?
4093255	4094816	PS3, you're so dirty.
4095497	4097759	You've been very naughty, Sony PlayStation.
4097839	4102082	You're a naughty play... What the crap?
4103103	4111810	Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3... Who paid him to... Oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.
4111870	4113031	It wasn't Sony that did it.
4113411	4114552	Somebody paid him to do it.
4115232	4115653	He's... Okay.
4115673	4115833	Okay.
4116221	4117882	I'm reading this from Play3.net.
4117922	4118382	End of the story?
4118422	4124206	No, it only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.
4124646	4128908	Now, it is possible this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.
4128948	4140535	These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career or paid as part of the much-cited Microsoft Dirty Tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.
4146399	4147259	What the hell?
4148320	4149440	That seems kind of low.
4149560	4158682	I mean, I don't think, you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da, this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.
4158802	4163383	So I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.
4164743	4165563	Oh, yes, sure, Nathan.
4168264	4173405	I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.
4174045	4174385	You know what?
4175535	4178318	It's not supposed to be an act on the news.
4178979	4180240	Oh, it was Fox News.
4181141	4184244	That could be... Yeah, fair and balanced.
4184264	4184924	Well, you know what?
4184964	4187827	When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?
4189749	4190670	Even porno?
4191231	4191971	Yeah, sure, porno.
4192572	4193052	Skinamax.
4193193	4193613	I don't know.
4193813	4195075	Why do people do Skinamax films?
4195135	4195475	I don't know.
4196336	4197217	Well, Ranma, I don't know.
4197237	4197977	What do you think of this?
4198057	4199499	Who do you think did the set-up?
4200658	4202921	I honestly don't know because I read all the comments.
4203101	4204763	He claims that this is legit.
4205083	4207806	To be perfectly honest, I don't know.
4208126	4211730	But I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.
4212651	4218498	I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.
4218578	4219559	That's what I honestly think.
4220034	4221415	That's kind of a mental problem.
4221655	4224918	It gets dusty, but we've had stuff sit out for like three, four months.
4225258	4228601	We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months, and it's not even that dirty.
4229141	4231723	It looks like it's nearly new, and we don't even touch it.
4231964	4233044	I think he just has issues.
4233245	4234365	I think that's what it boils down to.
4235747	4236747	Cleaning issues.
4236807	4238068	Yeah, cleaning issues.
4238429	4239550	Maybe he lives in a toilet.
4239870	4240230	Who knows?
4240991	4242912	Where it would get especially dusty.
4244133	4245895	That makes a lot of sense, Rob.
4245955	4246315	Shut up.
4246415	4246775	I hate you.
4246795	4248457	You shut up, you m'lady.
4249418	4250078	I hate you.
4250338	4251419	Children, children, behave.
4251479	4253139	That's what I get for reading fast.
4253459	4253760	All right.
4256521	4258201	Anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?
4258221	4261262	All right, we'll be making a trip out to the West Coast.
4261622	4261842	When?
4262303	4262743	Yay.
4263583	4266264	Looking at Fourth of July weekend.
4267124	4267464	Awesome.
4267484	4269405	Well, we will be seeing you then.
4270745	4271346	Oh, yeah.
4272006	4273226	Oh, yeah.
4273947	4274607	And all time.
4274887	4275267	All right.
4275587	4276487	All right, Ranma, we've got to let you go.
4276507	4278088	We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.
4279055	4280817	One last question, I'll get out of here.
4280837	4283159	Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?
4283579	4285721	Whose idea was it to put the Goldschlager on the table?
4285921	4287403	I will give you three guesses.
4287483	4292807	It starts with a J. I love you.
4293448	4293748	All right.
4294209	4295029	Take care, Ranma.
4296030	4296471	All right.
4296591	4297031	Bye.
4297371	4298032	Bye.
4298072	4300494	I'd like to point out it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager, too.
4300674	4301155	Just so you know.
4301175	4304798	Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of Goldschlager.
4305928	4311934	Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4313155	4317900	Hi there, this is RawSteelUT Hello RawSteelUT, what is on your mind?
4319241	4326348	Not much, you know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO podcast
4328803	4332406	I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.
4332566	4334228	I mean, it was that unreal.
4335109	4338292	Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight?
4339012	4340233	Or a clan fight or whatever?
4340334	4345378	I would not want to meet... Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.
4345638	4346779	I guess.
4348161	4350263	Anyway, that reminds me of a...
4350979	4358442	Recent post on Kotaku, apparently the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on internet cafes and stuff like that.
4358462	4360503	Let me put a link on the chat.
4361844	4373489	Basically what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming cafes because, like you know, China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.
4376894	4377635	Well... Hello?
4377935	4381477	Yeah, no, no, no, sorry, I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.
4381537	4384319	Let's see, it looks like you're linking us to Kotaku, who ran this report.
4384840	4399030	Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal internet cafes, Xinhua said.
4399710	4406035	The crackdown netted 1407 computers while 7 people were arrested and nearly 5000 internet accounts closed.
4407070	4410994	Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.
4411514	4411855	Wow.
4412795	4415137	Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.
4415197	4422724	I mean, normally I'm not for forcing limits on internet time, but damn it, it really sounds like China's got a real problem.
4423477	4424458	Most of Asia, really.
4449918	4452882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4465071	4466292	Yeah, I was about to say that.
4466312	4468553	That sounds like people are really crammed in there.
4468573	4471254	That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.
4471374	4474395	I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.
4474415	4476196	That's an interesting image right there.
4477296	4477897	For real.
4478217	4479837	That's a very interesting image.
4479858	4482539	That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.
4482579	4483099	All right, go ahead.
4483179	4483679	Sorry, anyway.
4485320	4494224	Anyway, there's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the...
4495217	4496778	Xbox 360 failures.
4496818	4497378	Give me a second.
4497398	4498519	I'll pop up another link.
4500219	4503581	The guy's saying that they're... I think I heard about this.
4503621	4508603	This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this is why they're paying for it, right?
4509783	4511784	Well, I'm posting the link now.
4512985	4515326	It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually.
4516086	4524630	You know, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.
4525598	4531080	So, you know, it sort of makes me wonder, you know, the legitimacy of it.
4531980	4536702	You know, I don't know if you're reading it now, but... Yeah, it's kind of a lengthy article.
4536782	4539903	It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site that ran this, it looks like.
4540263	4548467	A story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about the Xbox 360 Red Ring of Death failures.
4549007	4551068	And it was an interview conducted via email.
4552168	4553188	Yeah, exactly.
4553228	4554929	That's already a big red flag.
4555849	4560172	I don't know.
4560212	4567738	I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.
4567858	4571020	Maybe it's the same guy who's doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.
4571060	4571460	Who knows?
4571640	4573862	Yeah, exactly.
4573922	4576804	I mean, it's funny you mention that because Ranma was just talking about that.
4576844	4580347	It could just be mudslinging on both sides.
4580527	4581607	It's Reggie.
4581648	4583649	Reggie Fils-Aimé is doing it all, apparently.
4584238	4585218	No, I don't know.
4585518	4589339	I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.
4589379	4605844	I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article because, honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 Red Rings of Death are caused because Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's not really news to me.
4606468	4609031	I was about to say, yeah.
4609131	4612254	I mean, that's been everybody's known about the X-Clamps for some time.
4612554	4618560	So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners to save money?
4619221	4619602	Not really.
4619662	4620402	That's no surprise.
4620623	4621483	Does it make it right?
4621664	4621904	No.
4622004	4625107	But I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.
4625267	4628371	I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of...
4629255	4630715	of trying to correct the issue, really.
4630996	4631836	They made a boo-boo.
4632116	4632856	They're fessing up to it.
4632896	4634737	I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.
4634857	4635977	He's got an Instagram.
4635997	4638958	Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.
4638998	4640318	I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.
4640558	4641319	I suppose that's true.
4641979	4643900	So, yeah, I don't know.
4644220	4651682	I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but, you know, I guess...
4652732	4656414	As long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.
4656434	4658795	And there are some people who still do have working ones.
4659156	4662157	But honestly, you tell me the failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?
4662357	4664819	It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.
4665239	4666800	I don't know.
4666880	4667260	I don't know.
4667280	4674744	Well, the problem is when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.
4674764	4677065	They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system worked.
4677432	4677932	Good point.
4677952	4678793	You're right.
4678933	4679814	You're right.
4679874	4680874	I've never seen that happen.
4680914	4682876	People don't complain when things are working.
4682896	4683316	You're right.
4683356	4683936	That's a good point.
4686038	4687919	Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.
4687939	4698366	We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.
4698586	4706612	Apparently, and here's one more link, Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable content.
4708291	4714373	Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice, you know?
4724440	4726741	Yeah, you know what?
4726841	4729201	Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.
4729241	4744206	You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe since we have some new people, thanks to Justin.TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content
4744566	4745848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4762965	4774575	So I think if Capcom's taking a stand going, you know what, this game is too complex, we can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock content, then I say, applause!
4774595	4776997	I think they're just, you know... Hello?
4777597	4777998	Yeah, go ahead.
4779058	4785143	I think it's just that, you know, this is their game, you know, and personally, I applaud them for it.
4786204	4791749	Because you do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content to Hello Horse Armor.
4794346	4797549	and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.
4797649	4802172	And it's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game and this is what it's going to be.
4803033	4804374	You don't see enough of that nowadays.
4804554	4807055	I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.
4807116	4807636	It's a good one.
4808176	4810458	Ross Dio, we've got to let you go because we've got to wrap up the show.
4810498	4811819	But thank you so much for calling.
4811999	4812740	We'd love to hear from you.
4813020	4813280	Okay.
4813980	4814601	Have a good one, buddy.
4815649	4817509	DarkSakra, Loki, I have nothing.
4817529	4817829	Do you guys?
4817849	4817930	Nope.
4817950	4818070	Loki.
4844203	4844644	Uh, yeah.
4844984	4846425	Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff.
4847085	4851928	Um, one of which is this game that I just found called Line Golfer.
4852188	4856131	Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses, almost.
4856491	4857412	And it's actually pretty fun.
4857432	4863115	Uh, you can find it at, uh, let's see here, this website called CandyStand.com.
4863896	4865437	And you can, uh, check it out there.
4865477	4867498	Wait, isn't that, like, Lifesavers and stuff?
4867638	4868459	Isn't that their website?
4868499	4869039	CandyStand?
4869059	4869879	I don't know.
4869919	4870380	Or am I crazy?
4871160	4871400	Maybe.
4871420	4871821	But, um...
4873796	4879278	Well, no, it is Wrigley'sCandyStand.com The hottest games online, they say.
4880219	4881339	And it's pretty fun.
4881359	4888682	You can create your own courses and you can upload them and play all these different courses and stuff.
4889923	4890803	Let's see here.
4891443	4894225	Then, other stuff that's kind of funny.
4895025	4902508	Apparently, GameGirl.com ran a Top 7 Geek Panties for Girls.
4903203	4904183	Oh God, I heard about this.
4904423	4906484	How many does Irene own?
4906524	4907144	That's what I want to know.
4908344	4910205	Eight.
4910265	4915726	Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone on there or not.
4915826	4916366	I don't think so.
4917666	4920207	Number six would be the password protection panties.
4920727	4922147	It says username and password.
4922687	4923348	That's kind of funny.
4923528	4924188	Wow.
4924288	4925588	Bonus stage panties.
4926208	4928089	I agree with Halo Master in chat.
4928169	4929209	Best radio show ever.
4930499	4933121	Space Invader Panties would be number four.
4933942	4936104	Number three is Achievement Unlocked Panties.
4937665	4940528	Number two, Classic Nintendo Panties.
4940548	4943991	Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?
4944251	4944711	I don't think so.
4944751	4945592	These can't be legitimate.
4945612	4946473	And then Mario Panties.
4947033	4948114	Hooray!
4949195	4952058	Other fun stuff, there's a rumor that when Smash Bros.
4952118	4956942	Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that
4957355	4958176	Super Smash Bros.
4958236	4958537	Brawl
4975876	4979579	Hillary Clinton is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto 4.
4979619	4980459	Bullshit.
4980519	4981700	No, hold on, hold on, hold on.
4981760	4985363	It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her.
4985643	4989506	Kind of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.
4990106	4994349	Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.
4994970	4999533	I know, why would you want that prostitute?
4999633	5000554	That doesn't make sense.
5000714	5001154	I don't know.
5002219	5002759	Whatever.
5003139	5004000	Guys, whatever.
5005241	5008962	Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.
5009243	5012244	The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me?
5012544	5016826	And after being killed with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.
5016967	5017907	That's fucked up.
5017947	5019188	That's gotta be a lie.
5019208	5022429	That's some stupid kid's idea of a funny.
5023390	5024050	But you know what?
5024530	5027972	Ranma in chat at chat.org sums up my thoughts perfectly.
5028492	5029273	Do not want...
5032397	5035259	Um, and then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.
5036119	5036520	That's it?
5036740	5037760	I found something pretty.
5038000	5038621	Alright, what's that?
5039401	5049347	Um, Eurogamer, which is one of the places I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out.
5049387	5051488	And Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.
5051969	5055651	You know, Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chatroom.
5056391	5056691	Alright.
5056791	5057832	It's very, very pretty.
5059273	5083186	even though they're getting the most awful person in the world to play them but oh well alright well it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up this show Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess thank you guys for coming to the show we haven't had guests here in forever even though you guys didn't talk much but maybe it's because we have a mic shortage I don't know but I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless and thank you for the pie that was much appreciated do you have any final thoughts Sir Nathan?
5084307	5087949	no alright Rice Princess any final thoughts?
5088772	5089072	Yes.
5090333	5092154	All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?
5093115	5098037	My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what my computer can actually do.
5098838	5099418	Yay.
5100299	5112786	And so I... My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now on JustinTV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take a couple weeks to work out the bumps.
5113346	5114427	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5115988	5118029	Well, someone in our chat room said...
5121618	5122499	The pie is true.
5123939	5124600	The pie is true.
5124620	5125400	The pie is delicious.
5126160	5127441	That's what it really boils down to.
5128382	5130403	At the end of Orange Launch Radio, there will be pie.
5131883	5132164	Wow.
5132644	5132884	All right.
5133614	5136216	Thank you so much for tuning in.
5151690	5154070	All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.
5154351	5155691	That's how we slowly spread the word.
5155751	5163652	If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Dig, whatever.
5164833	5167713	Or even if you do tell two people, you can also leave a five-star review.
5167773	5168193	It's okay.
5168473	5173134	I want to thank – we had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people that put those very kind reviews.
5173154	5173855	We really appreciate it.
5175095	5175975	Until next time.
5177153	5182835	I'm Rob Roberts, that's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5185935	5188396	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
