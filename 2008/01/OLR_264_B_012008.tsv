0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	28000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, January the 20th of 2008 for Part B of our program.
28000	36000	If you have not yet listened to Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, you should go do that because we talk a lot about the official Smash Brothers delay.
36000	52000	We talk about a possible new Kid Icarus game on the Wii and WiiWare and porn and HD DVD that they're no longer going to be doing that and so on and so on.
52000	56000	Let's get back into some regular gaming news. Start off with Loki.
56000	69000	Well, this isn't the first time we've heard this rumor, but apparently Duke Nukem 3D is supposed to make its way onto Xbox Live Arcade at some point within the next several months.
69000	76000	This comes from a developer's interview that they had on IGN and basically they gave the timeframe.
76000	84000	Within the next several months, it will feature four-player online co-op and eight-player online deathmatch.
84000	89000	I don't know. I'll believe it when I see it type thing.
89000	96000	If it is, they may show it at E3 or something like that because it would have to be kind of done.
96000	109000	It's hard for me to trust anything 3D Realm says in the realm of release dates because Duke Nukem Forever is taking forever.
109000	114000	I really hope this rumor is true, though. I love me some Duke Nukem, too.
114000	119000	It would be even better if some of the expansions and the homemade stuff come out as downloadable stuff.
119000	123000	I hope the build editor comes with it because that would be awesome.
123000	125000	Wasn't there voice macros?
125000	128000	Oh, yes. Being able to make your own voice macros would be awesome.
128000	134000	Wasn't there a Duke Nukem in Washington, D.C. mod or something? I still remember having that on CD at one point.
134000	137000	Yeah. I love Duke Nukem.
137000	141000	Dunu is great. I have so many memories of playing that in a college dorm via the modem.
141000	142000	Oh, yeah.
142000	147000	That was awesome. You're laughing, Nathan. Did that inspire what's a modem?
147000	149000	What are you, 12?
149000	152000	I'm just kidding. No. They let you...
152000	161000	All right. So, yeah. Duke Nukem. I really hope that's true that it's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but it could be just another dirty rumor.
161000	166000	But then this is where I normally say, stop working on Duke Nukem 3D and finish Duke Nukem Forever, dammit.
166000	169000	No. No. This will all allow.
169000	173000	As long as they don't screw it up. If it's just like a boring old port...
173000	176000	It's going to be a boring old port. It's going to look just like Doom.
176000	181000	Remember how awesome Doom was when it came out? We're like, ooh, Doom. Ooh, we can play Deathmatch on Doom.
181000	186000	And then something else came out and we completely forgot about Doom?
186000	193000	Seriously, is anyone still playing Doom? I don't think so.
193000	200000	Well, the problem with Doom is that the multiplayer didn't play that great. At least when I was playing on Xbox Live, the multiplayer was really laggy.
200000	203000	But I had a lot of fun with Doom the week it came out, and then it kind of went away.
203000	206000	Yeah, like the day it came out.
206000	212000	All right. Well, let's move on with some other gaming news, talking about Xbox Live still.
212000	218000	But this time, talking about Rock Band. And Rock Band, of course, gets a lot of download content.
218000	224000	The last segment, we were talking about some download content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3.
224000	232000	But now talking about the download content for Rock Band, Xbox.com has posted spoilers on their website for the upcoming packs.
232000	238000	Because unlike last year, EA Harmonics has not been announcing a lot of stuff in advance.
238000	240000	They also retracted them after they announced them.
240000	241000	Did they?
241000	248000	Yeah, but still. If Xbox.com posted it, I would think there's some type of legitimacy to that.
248000	252000	Well, they took it down because it was OMG Spoilers. That's what it was.
252000	259000	But anyway, on January 22nd, an Oasis pack is coming out with the songs Don't Look Back in Anger, Live Forever, and Wonderwall.
259000	263000	That would make you relive the 90s all over again, getting to play Wonderwall.
263000	265000	I'd rather not, thank you.
265000	271000	On January 29th, the Progressive pack comes out. Both packs will set you back 400 points.
271000	274000	Or you can buy the songs individually in the Progressive pack.
274000	277000	Rush with Working Man, but it's a cover.
277000	281000	Coheed and Cambria with 10 Speed, that's also a cover.
281000	284000	Smashing Pumpkins with Seva, not a cover.
284000	287000	Also a fabulous way to relive the 90s. That was like their first single ever.
287000	293000	So if you think the new Smashing Pumpkins stuff is sucky, you can go back and relive the good old days of the Smashing Pumpkins.
293000	298000	And that's all we know until February. So, rock band content coming soon to Xbox Live.
298000	303000	Well, for Guitar Hero 3, there's also some new downloadable content.
303000	307000	We get Foreigner. Ooh.
307000	309000	Well, okay, you get Jukebox Hero.
309000	313000	And Journey is Any Way You Want It and Boston's Peace of Mind.
313000	315000	Yes! Journey!
315000	325000	I'm more about Boston right now, but I don't know. There's better songs! Why those?
325000	327000	At least we're not getting hot-blooded.
327000	335000	But it's Journey. It's awesome. I thought Journey had something against Guitar Hero and rock band because their music wasn't showing up.
335000	339000	And I was like, where's the Journey? And now it's coming out and that makes me very happy.
339000	346000	Well, I think that all three of these songs are also in rock band, I want to say. I know Jukebox Hero is.
346000	348000	Jukebox Hero is, yeah.
348000	358000	And I know that there's another Boston song that's in rock band. I don't think this is it. Anyway.
358000	361000	So, we're getting old rock.
361000	365000	You know, if you play Boston backwards on a record, it tells you to worship Satan.
365000	367000	That is not true.
367000	371000	That's from Little Nicky. Stop spreading lies on the internet.
371000	376000	You're one of those, but yeah, that's my job.
376000	382000	So, speaking of another, well, more music-related stuff.
382000	388000	Supernova 2, the new DDR game, has finally had an arcade version come out in the US.
388000	397000	The first machine, apparently, is at In the Zone in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
397000	406000	According to people that have seen the machine, it's got 33 songs available in the Supernova 2 category at the start.
406000	411000	You know, all the other fun stuff. No EMUs support right now.
411000	420000	And also, I guess when you play the nonce upcourses, you can put your name and state in there and record all the information.
420000	426000	I don't know. I'm excited that there's a new DDR, although it's not near us.
426000	431000	I don't know. I already told you how I feel about DDR and I got in a little trouble for it,
431000	436000	but I was looking at the video of all the new songs that they have in Supernova 2 and I'm just kind of like,
436000	438000	it's just the same thing with some new songs.
438000	443000	It needs to be another Max 2. They need another Max 2 to come out, basically.
443000	449000	Remember what they were doing with the remix songs that were in the ONI courses and stuff like that,
449000	455000	and that was exciting, hearing, oh my god, that remix is cool, and that kind of thing, and the way they teased that.
455000	459000	With these DDR mixes that come out, they don't really tease them or do anything at all.
459000	463000	It's just kind of like, DDR, here we go, enjoy.
463000	468000	Oh, another DDR. Enjoy. They don't hype it up any.
468000	471000	It's like, ah, no one cares anymore, so we don't either. Just throw it out.
471000	476000	They need to give DDR a swift kick in the booty and put something new in it to make me want to go back to the arcades.
476000	481000	Irene, I know you've been a long-time DDR fan. What do you think of where the series is going?
481000	487000	I don't know. It's kind of dropped off the face of the earth. It's kind of like, I don't know, Debbie Gibson or something.
487000	494000	It's just like, oh, hey, there's DDR. I mean, I'd play it if it came here just to try it out, but that was kind of,
494000	504000	I stopped playing DDR years ago, so I don't know, maybe the new kids like it, the younger kids that were our age when we started.
504000	505000	Maybe they'll get into it.
505000	508000	Stop dating me and yourself.
508000	509000	But Rob, I love you.
509000	512000	Not that. You know what I mean.
512000	517000	No, I know, but I mean, I'd have to play it. I don't know. I'm not as excited.
517000	521000	I was excited probably when Fourth Plus came out and Fifth Mix.
521000	526000	That was like the height of my DDR day right there, but I don't know. I just don't care anymore.
526000	530000	Let's see. I'm looking at our chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
530000	534000	SSJ100Matt says, Konami never cared.
534000	537000	DJ Genai says, DDR needs the RE4 upgrade.
537000	540000	RosteelUT says, DDR Star Wars edition. That would work.
540000	542000	No.
549000	557000	See, that's partially why I think DDR is hurting right now is because they keep putting out this crap, like hottest party and all this stuff.
557000	559000	It's just absolute shit.
559000	563000	They should make a 12 player mode with peripherals.
563000	567000	That'd be great. I get the Resident Evil chainsaw again.
567000	575000	No, but seriously, they could make some really elaborate cabinet that was four player, have a quad mode or something like that in the arcade.
575000	577000	That would be different.
577000	585000	Even Animaro gets behind Pump It Up and they kind of hype it up and have little teaser videos and shit on the internet.
585000	589000	Konami doesn't do anything. It's just like, oh look, it's DDR.
589000	595000	Even with BeatMania, it's like, what's it matter? We're going to release another one in a few months anyway.
595000	598000	I know. It's like they think it's some kind of self advertising franchise.
598000	603000	Like, we already have a fan base built in. We don't need to advertise it, blah blah blah.
603000	609000	But like, put the word out to the people who stopped playing. Excite us about it. Otherwise, why should we give a shit?
609000	616000	Alright. Like I said, just reinvent DDR. Make it competitive. I'll be all over that game again.
616000	619000	Just, you know, just start from scratch.
619000	621000	You know what DDR needs? A new producer.
621000	626000	Like, I don't know, maybe there has been one, but they need to bring someone in there with some fr- I mean, no offense to the guy that's been there.
626000	630000	Because, you know, obviously he created a wonderful franchise, but just bring in some new blood.
630000	633000	That's what it needs. Some new blood.
633000	635000	We are starting over, right?
635000	640000	Alright, anyhow, something else that you can get your music fixed through, not DDR, but the other type.
640000	644000	The orchestral. Nice, live, take in the music type thing.
644000	646000	Like, remember Dear Friends, the Final Fantasy concert?
646000	652000	Well, of course, one of the other big tours that goes around is Tommy Tallarico's Video Games Live.
652000	654000	And Video Games Live has been going for, like, two years straight.
654000	660000	They ain't stopping anytime soon. They've added 40 shows throughout the globe this year.
660000	667000	They're going to be doing some shows at Game Developers Conference, Comic Con, Leipzig, Mexico.
667000	670000	They're going to be doing all these different shows just all throughout the world.
670000	677000	You can look at the full list at the website for Video Games Live, which I believe is videogameslive.com.
677000	681000	Specifically, you can go to videogameslive.com slash dates.
681000	684000	They're actually doing one on a cruise ship, which I think is pretty awesome.
684000	687000	Carnival Cruises, November 14th, 2008.
687000	692000	The Navigator Cruise gets the Video Games Live concert. That's kind of cool.
692000	696000	As for concerts taking place near us, because I'm selfish and I want to look at stuff in NorCal.
696000	704000	February 22nd of 2008, San Francisco, California at the Nob Hill Masonic Center to collate with Game Developers Conference.
704000	706000	So if you want to catch that.
706000	712000	And if you want to take a little bit of a drive, San Diego on July 24th, 2008 at the Embarcadero Marina Park.
712000	717000	And there's supposedly going to be some more dates announced that haven't quite locked down the venues yet,
717000	720000	including Anaheim, California and Los Angeles, California.
720000	723000	Dude, Jamie. Anaheim, California.
723000	724000	Disneyland.
724000	725000	Disneyland slash Video Games Live.
725000	726000	Wouldn't that be the best trip ever?
726000	727000	Let's go.
727000	729000	Let's do it.
729000	731000	I'd rather go to E3.
731000	733000	I would like to go to E3, but we'll see.
733000	735000	Anyhow, so there you have it. Video Games Live. That'll be fun.
735000	737000	I have not been yet.
737000	741000	Some of my friends throughout the internet, such as, you know, we're good pals with Bobby Blackwell at all games.
741000	743000	He goes, he enjoys the show.
743000	745000	I think he's going all the way to Orlando to see a show.
745000	747000	And he lives in Atlanta, so that's a little bit of a trip for him.
747000	748000	Disney World!
748000	751000	Yeah, I know! It's even better!
751000	754000	God, guys. So one-track minded.
754000	756000	Well, you know what? Disneyland's fun.
756000	758000	Loki, you need to come to Disneyland with us sometime.
758000	761000	I've been to Disneyland and it's just like, ooh, yay!
761000	763000	Did you go to Disneyland in the 90s, though?
763000	764000	Because it was kind of junky.
764000	766000	That was before they started doing all the renovation.
766000	769000	I went there when they were building California.
769000	771000	So you went during the days of Suck.
771000	776000	Yeah, I went there when they had the rocket rods and I got to ride them before they ripped them out
776000	780000	because some idiot jumped off the rocket rods and killed themselves
780000	782000	the same way they killed themselves.
782000	785000	That never made any sense to me whatsoever.
785000	789000	Oh, well, we'll get rid of the people movers because someone fell out of it and died.
789000	791000	Let's put something faster there instead.
791000	793000	That'll be better.
793000	795000	The rumor is rocket riders are coming back.
795000	796000	We'll see.
796000	797000	The rocket rides are awesome.
797000	801000	I've also been hearing a rumor that the next rock in the parks they're doing is Aerosmith.
801000	803000	Nice.
803000	806000	Would it be Space Mountain again in California?
806000	808000	Space Mountain and California Screamin'.
808000	809000	Rawr! That sounds great.
809000	812000	Anyway, sorry. We turned it into the Disney cast for a minute.
812000	814000	Jamie, please take the show back on track.
814000	817000	Okay, so Devil May Cry 4.
817000	825000	There is a rumor that there will be an online demo available on January 31st.
825000	831000	And this is actually because there was a little bit of text left on
831000	836000	that was actually removed from the downloadable version
836000	839000	that was saying it would be out, and of course it's going to be out in Japan on the 31st
839000	843000	and out a week later in North America and Europe.
843000	845000	But is it going to happen?
845000	850000	And these were on two Capcom websites that had it on there.
850000	853000	So is it true? Is it not?
853000	855000	Did someone just screw up?
855000	859000	It'll have to be around that time anyways because it comes out the week after that.
859000	861000	It makes sense.
861000	863000	Jinx.
863000	866000	Your mom.
866000	868000	Oh, you showed me.
868000	871000	She wins, Rob. She said your mom.
871000	872000	Aw, damn. All right.
872000	874000	What are you going to do now?
874000	876000	I like how Jamie said that off the mic.
876000	878000	I'm going to repeat. She goes, I like your mom.
878000	879000	I do.
879000	880000	Just to clarify, I do like your mom.
880000	881000	Your mom's cool.
881000	882000	My mom is cool.
882000	884000	She'd make pies too.
884000	888000	Maybe Nathan and my mom can have a pie baking contest.
888000	892000	You guys can make me Easter cookies together.
892000	893000	All right, forget it.
893000	894000	Anyway, let's move on.
894000	895000	More game news, please.
895000	899000	Well, something else that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade pretty soon is N Plus.
899000	905000	If you may not be familiar with N, N is that freeware game that used to be available out
905000	911000	there where you play a ninja and you jump around collecting gold.
911000	913000	And it's very fucking hard.
913000	918000	Well, the new game, of course, which is going to be I think on both Xbox Live Arcade and
918000	924000	PlayStation Network, will feature multiplayer as well as a level editor and other fun stuff.
924000	929000	It doesn't mention yet when it's coming out, although pretty soon because apparently it's
929000	933000	already, I guess, passed their certification.
933000	935000	So, hooray.
935000	937000	Oh, that's a pretty fun game.
937000	944000	It will be available also on PSP and DS at some point pretty soon too.
944000	951000	Although, if you want to play the full PC version, which is free, you can go to, this
951000	960000	is kind of funny, www.harveycartel.org, that's H-A-R-V-E-Y...
960000	965000	Wait, like the actor from Reservoir Dogs and the piano and...
965000	967000	Well, it's Cartel.
967000	970000	Okay, never mind.
970000	980000	H-A-R-V-E-Y-C-A-R-T-E-L dot org slash meta net slash downloads dot HTML.
980000	982000	And you complete the full game there.
982000	983000	It's pretty fun.
983000	988000	Lots of challenge though, so.
988000	991000	Yay.
991000	994000	So is it going to be worth, because N right now is free, right?
994000	996000	Is it going to be worth the money to get it on Xbox Live, you think?
996000	999000	I think it's going to be fun because it's going to have the multiplayer and stuff in
999000	1000000	there.
1000000	1001000	And they're going to have new levels.
1001000	1005000	There was a contest for people to make levels and put it in the game.
1005000	1010000	So, no, those are going to be in there and you get achievements.
1010000	1011000	Alright.
1011000	1014000	Well, also coming to Xbox Live, a free game.
1014000	1019000	That's right, a free game to apologize and say we're sorry that our servers suck during
1019000	1020000	Christmas.
1020000	1021000	Apparently they're not that sorry.
1021000	1022000	Please don't sue us.
1022000	1025000	Yeah, because the free game we're getting is Undertow.
1025000	1029000	Not a new game, a game that was already out, but you will be able to download it for a
1029000	1030500	limited time for free.
1030500	1034000	I believe it starts Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning Pacific time and ends on Sunday.
1034000	1037000	So you have about a three day period, roughly, to get the game.
1037000	1044000	And supposedly, if you already have purchased the game, if you call the 1-800 for my Xbox,
1044000	1046000	they're supposed to be able to do something for you.
1046000	1049000	Like maybe give you the points back or they won't say, will they?
1049000	1051000	Because they don't want everybody to rush them.
1051000	1055000	That kind of makes me mad that you can do that because I got screwed with the Carcassonne
1055000	1059000	thing because I bought Carcassonne and then they gave it away free during Live's anniversary,
1059000	1060000	but whatever.
1060000	1065000	I, you know, I have no interest in this game, but I'll download it because it's free.
1065000	1066000	Yeah.
1066000	1067000	But it's just, it's kind of fucked up.
1067000	1069000	I'd rather have like, you know, a free month of Live or something.
1069000	1071000	It would have been a lot cheaper for them too, but.
1071000	1073000	The demo was kind of fun.
1073000	1074000	I'll look at it.
1074000	1077000	I mean, I wasn't super into it, but maybe I'll look at it again.
1077000	1078000	You're right.
1078000	1079000	I'll grab it while it's free.
1079000	1080000	Why not?
1080000	1082000	You know, it's on the hard drive.
1082000	1085000	And, quite frankly, they didn't really OS anything to begin with, I don't think.
1085000	1086000	No.
1086000	1087000	I think this little thing got blown way out of proportion.
1087000	1090000	So, it's kind of like, you know what, if you had your hopes up, it's your own damn fault.
1090000	1092000	It was still kind of spotty.
1092000	1098500	Like, I guess I hadn't played on Live since like New Year's or something because I had
1098500	1102000	to recover my gamer tag from, I think, year 360.
1102000	1105000	And, it had trouble doing that.
1105000	1109000	I had to do it like three or four times before it finally worked, which sucks because for
1109000	1114000	whatever reason, the download that like six megs is your gamer tag, it takes like a half
1114000	1115000	an hour.
1115000	1116000	That is crazy.
1116000	1119000	It's not fucking slow, but yeah.
1119000	1122000	I'm looking to see what our chat room thinks at chat.orangelountradio.com.
1122000	1125000	Let's see, Son of Dad.
1125000	1127000	I wanted Res.
1127000	1129200	Act Def seems to think that Res will be up this week.
1129200	1130200	I hope that's true.
1130200	1133200	Actually, that may be true because I think they said Res was coming out in January and
1133200	1135000	there's only one more week in January, right?
1135000	1136000	No, two more.
1136000	1137000	No, two more.
1137000	1138000	All right.
1138000	1139000	So.
1139000	1140000	We'll see.
1140000	1145000	I thought this week was, didn't they already announce the games for this week, I thought,
1145000	1146000	already?
1146000	1147000	I don't know.
1147000	1150000	Did you check out the game that came out last week, the bunny puzzle game or whatever it
1150000	1151000	was?
1151000	1152000	It looks stupid.
1152000	1153000	It was okay.
1153000	1157900	It's pretty much, there's a game just like it, Magical Drop on the Neo Geo.
1157900	1161860	It's almost just like Magical Drop but with bunnies and you can run up the sides too.
1161860	1165440	That was the other little innovation is that you don't just have to throw the bunnies from
1165440	1168000	the bottom, you can go to the sides, which is kind of weird.
1168000	1171880	It adds a new element to it but, I don't know, anyway, sorry, I got a little off track but
1171880	1172880	I realize I never talked about it during my game.
1172880	1175920	I was going to check out Omega 5 maybe but Omega 5 is awesome.
1175920	1177320	You got to check that out.
1177320	1179520	That's definitely worth a look.
1179520	1183500	If you like shooters at all, like if you miss the days of UN Squadron or if you like the
1183500	1185640	newer ones or whatever, check it out.
1185640	1186640	Do it.
1186640	1187640	All right.
1187640	1188880	So, Undertow for free.
1188880	1191240	Be sure to take a look this week.
1191240	1196940	Highlander game, actually I'm sort of interested in is the Highlander game that's coming out
1196940	1203760	that you play as Owen McLeod, who is a gladiator and found out he was an immortal that way.
1203760	1205660	Go fig.
1205660	1211600	Going through different times from the ancient days to modern day and got a lot of people
1211600	1216440	that you meet and a lot of people you kill and it's supposed to be really, really gory.
1216440	1226600	But part of it is that you're using his ability to not die and to regrow and regenerate bits
1226600	1231320	and pieces so you can stab yourself to kill someone behind you.
1231320	1234960	That sounds actually kind of cool.
1234960	1238360	Jump off buildings.
1238360	1242480	One of the things mentioned on here is act as a conductor for high voltage electrical
1242480	1243480	current.
1243480	1246000	So, it's pretty cool.
1246000	1253400	You get 77 characters to meet, 18 missions and full cities and you can use zip wires
1253400	1255400	and that type of thing.
1255400	1256400	And did I say gory?
1256400	1258300	Because it's supposed to be gory.
1258300	1260480	This game sounds epic.
1260480	1263300	You just know something's going to go wrong though.
1263300	1264480	It's too good on paper.
1264480	1267340	Well, it's PS3, 360 and PC.
1267340	1268840	And it's made by Eidos.
1268840	1272360	They did give us Tomb Raider.
1272360	1273360	Exactly.
1273360	1274360	Exactly.
1274360	1277200	Hey, the original Tomb Raider was pretty awesome.
1277200	1280800	The second one was the best because you could make her explode.
1280800	1281800	I do agree.
1281800	1282800	The second one was the best.
1282800	1286640	You could break her neck and lock that annoying butler in the lock-in freezer.
1286640	1289560	Now Jamie, is this game going to be multi-platform?
1289560	1290560	That's what I just said.
1290560	1293920	Oh, but Jamie, there can be only one platform.
1293920	1294920	Rob.
1294920	1295920	Rob.
1295920	1296920	Rob.
1296920	1297920	Rob.
1297920	1300600	If you like that joke, you can PayPal me some money.
1300600	1301600	Rob.
1301600	1302600	Rob.
1302600	1303600	Rob.
1303600	1304600	Rob.
1304600	1305600	Good.
1305600	1306600	Alright.
1306600	1307600	This game sounds epic.
1307600	1309080	Again, I hope it's as cool as it sounds.
1309080	1310080	That's all I can say.
1310080	1311080	We'll see.
1311080	1316000	Anyways, it doesn't sound very cool to me.
1316000	1317000	Prototype.
1317000	1319000	Now that sounds like a cool game.
1319000	1321640	It's like Grand Theft Auto and Mutants.
1321640	1326280	RasteelUT in our chat room would like to point out, hey, Tomb Raider Legend and Anniversary
1326280	1327280	were awesome.
1327280	1328280	Sure, they were.
1328280	1334840	I didn't like the one on 360, whatever that was, a new one, but you know, different strokes
1334840	1336880	for different folks, right?
1336880	1339320	You could, everybody's welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong.
1339320	1343120	Well, this is a game that we've been waiting to come out for quite a while now.
1343120	1350780	Spore is, they announced at Macworld that it will be coming out on the Mac with a simultaneous
1350780	1354120	release on the PC, so awesome.
1354120	1358880	They can get to play that game, at least, whenever the hell it decides to come out.
1358880	1363240	I think second quarter, hopefully no later than that.
1363240	1365120	I'm excited for Spore, yes.
1365120	1367400	I hope no later than second quarter, either.
1367400	1371400	I will be creating the Urken Empire.
1371400	1372400	You know what's interesting?
1372400	1376600	There's a thread going on in our forums, if you go to our website, www.orensonshortradio.com,
1376600	1382600	there's a thread in our forums for the most overhyped and most underhyped games of 2008,
1382600	1388160	and somebody had made a post saying they believed that Fallout 3 was underhyped, which the marketing
1388160	1391320	probably just hasn't kicked in yet, I'm sure there'll be more later on, but that Spore
1391320	1394920	was overhyped, and I kind of looked at that and went, dude, Spore's not hyped enough,
1394920	1395920	in my opinion.
1395920	1402280	Like, maybe Spore is hyped within the gaming industry, but I mean, I don't know if our
1402280	1406400	poster, everybody's welcome to their own opinion, I don't know if the poster saw what I saw
1406400	1408520	at E3 and stuff, but the game looks amazing.
1408520	1410680	I think it's going to be deserving of the hype.
1410680	1415480	I hope so, but the problem is that now my bar is set really high for the game, so if
1415480	1419560	it isn't that good, I'm going to be disappointed, which kind of sucks for EA and the people
1419560	1422560	who made Spore, but I guess it's kind of cool, it's going to be a hybrid game, you know,
1422560	1426240	Mac people complain they don't get enough games, so there you go, EA loves you, so there
1426240	1427240	you have it.
1427240	1431400	So, by the way, Loki, I find it interesting that you're doing a report on Macworld, did
1431400	1433640	you keep tabs on what happened at Macworld?
1433640	1439720	Yeah, they announced a really crappy laptop that happens to be really thin, but has no
1439720	1446880	sort of optical drive on it at all, it has one USB port, and so if you want to actually
1446880	1454400	use your DVDs or anything like that, you know, you're kind of fucked, you have to buy a $99
1454400	1460080	drive for it, or you can use it, connect wirelessly to another computer that doesn't suck, probably,
1460080	1467960	and use its optical drive, I'm sorry, but that's, oh, and $1700, awesome, good job,
1467960	1474200	Steve, you really know what the consumer wants, crap for lots of money, hooray, but I'm sure
1474200	1478320	all you people will go out there and spend your hard-earned money on this piece of shit
1478320	1480760	and wait for the next redesign to come out for it.
1480760	1486140	Loki took my bait, ladies and gentlemen, he can send those cards and letters to loki at
1486140	1487140	orangeontrader.com.
1487140	1490460	I mean, it's cool that it's really thin and it has a long battery life on it, but
1490460	1495680	okay, so, like, crap, that whole thing in the envelope, like, putting it in an interoffice
1495680	1498960	envelope, that's kind of rad, that's like Mission Impossible right there, is what that
1498960	1499960	is.
1499960	1503120	That's cool, okay, granted, I know it's cool and I know that they're really pushing
1503120	1509400	for e-distribution stuff in the iTunes and all that kind of stuff, but as a consumer,
1509400	1514100	say you want to play Spore, you can't install it because there's no optical drive, what
1514100	1519800	the fuck, I mean, come on, create some really thin optical drive for it, make it a little
1519800	1520800	bit thicker.
1520800	1523400	Alright, I'm turning this car around, we've got to get back to the gaming news before
1523400	1529600	the Apple fans bombard us with their hate mail, I love you, Apple fans.
1529600	1534280	Street Fighter Online, there's some more news coming out about this, remember, they
1534280	1539800	licensed out the rights to do a Street Fighter game to make this whole Street Fighter Online,
1539800	1540800	but it's mouse-controlled.
1540800	1544080	Well, this is a whole different game than those other Street Fighter characters that
1544080	1545280	were going to be in an MMO.
1545280	1548000	Right, no, yeah, this is a whole other thing.
1548000	1551500	I thought we reported on this earlier where it had been licensed out to another company
1551500	1555560	that was going to make a Street Fighter Online game for the PC, but it's going to have mouse
1555560	1560460	controls, and you slide left and right to move the character, you left-click and right-click
1560460	1564560	to do different attacks, and of course if you do mouses and certain combinations and
1564560	1566320	click you do the special attacks.
1566320	1567320	That's dumb.
1567320	1570960	That could be very interesting, I have no idea how that's going to be.
1570960	1575520	But really, we need to be talking about the other features that are super awesome about
1575520	1576520	this game.
1576520	1577520	Like what?
1577520	1583920	You really need to like, you know, put pictures of your pets in the corners of the game.
1583920	1584920	That's pretty awesome.
1584920	1589840	Little taunts with your cat, you know, you can have like ceiling cat, you know, and stuff
1589840	1590840	like that.
1590840	1596040	Ceiling cat is watching you lose a fight, I don't know.
1596040	1600200	Apparently, the whole object of the game is that you're fighting Revoltec toys.
1600200	1602400	That is an actual line of toys, so.
1602400	1605400	And they have the toys for this too, that you can buy.
1605400	1606400	Nice.
1606400	1607680	Is that your very own Chun-Li doll?
1607680	1608680	Yes.
1608680	1609680	Awesome.
1609680	1613640	Well the game is going to be going into beta in the next couple months, March-ish, February-ish.
1613640	1618800	The full game is supposed to come out in April, but that's for Japanese players.
1618800	1622840	For you folks not in Japan, don't know what to tell you just yet, there's no news.
1622840	1625760	But what we do have some news on is the mailbag.
1625760	1629580	Every week you guys send us your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and lovely
1629580	1633600	Dark Sakura rips open the mailbag, picks a few of her favorite emails and reads them
1633600	1635280	right here on the air.
1635280	1640000	So for you Justin TV folk that can't see Dark Sakura, she's the mysterious woman off-camera.
1640000	1642660	We have our element of mystery here on the program.
1642660	1645680	She's the voice for Justin TV.
1645680	1646680	Okay.
1646680	1647680	Alright, anyhow.
1647680	1648680	Here it is, the mailbag.
1648680	1649680	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1649680	1657240	I can't read the whole track.
1657240	1662440	So uh, hello Dark Sakura, Skye, and other dude.
1662440	1667280	Haha, poor other dude.
1667280	1668280	That's fine, I'm other dude.
1668280	1669960	Nathan, you're already getting mails.
1669960	1670960	What do you think?
1670960	1671960	Hey, other dude.
1671960	1672960	Good job.
1672960	1673960	Welcome to the show.
1673960	1674960	Forget it.
1674960	1680360	I love the show, but here's the reason it has been a craptacular day because some idiot
1680360	1685440	in my human growth class stole my PSP slim which had a Japanese firmware with Skype on
1685440	1686440	it.
1686440	1691040	It was my alternative to a cell phone, and my flash drive was stolen and it had my podcast
1691040	1700320	for OLR, one of the most current ones up to date, and I feel so much angst to say F you
1700320	1704720	to people who steal and bullying people, plus the stupid kid, his name is, I'm not gonna
1704720	1705720	say his name.
1705720	1710040	It was during the search for my flash drive in my yearbook, this kid had weed in his bag
1710040	1714560	along with some cocaine in his underwear with my PSP in there.
1714560	1715560	Kids today?
1715560	1716560	Jesus.
1716560	1722480	I'm in high school, which is considered, which I'm considered the geek, and I have a website
1722480	1724840	worthy of going to geeky things for girls and guys.
1724840	1725840	It's ThinkGeek.com.
1725840	1726840	Okay.
1726840	1732600	Well, the background video for Potsylvania Dances and Choruses is like seen from Advent
1732600	1733600	Children.
1733600	1739460	I'm also a hardcore DDR fan, and I have every title made, but did you know that Konami had
1739460	1741600	Game Boy versions of DDR and Beatmania?
1741600	1746600	Yes, I did know that, and I actually have two of the DDR Game Boy releases with the
1746600	1749120	stupid little pad that's supposed to go on top of them.
1749120	1755320	I actually kept an old Game Boy just so that I could still play my version of DDR Game
1755320	1757760	Boy, which sucked, by the way.
1757760	1763220	I love the portable aspect of this, but StepMania has a recording on the PSP called PSP Revolution,
1763220	1767920	but that's how much I know that Hannah Montana is great, but nobody's perfect.
1767920	1768920	Okay.
1768920	1773720	This is a good song on DDR Disney Channel Edition, but I do agree that the playlist
1773720	1775520	is going downhill to the mainstream crap.
1775520	1780040	Okay, only our emails would go from Cocaine in Somebody's Underwear to DDR Disney Channel.
1780040	1781040	What the...
1781040	1782040	WTF?
1782040	1783040	LOL.
1783040	1784040	There's no punctuation.
1784040	1789640	The only periods in this are used in a URL.
1789640	1792020	It's like the run-on sentence that doesn't die.
1792020	1793240	Maybe he wrote it on his PS...
1793240	1794840	No, his PSP got stolen.
1794840	1795840	I don't know.
1795840	1796840	They had to have found it.
1796840	1797840	They found it in the guy's underwear.
1797840	1802000	They found crack in his crack.
1802000	1805520	Like Hilary Duff in Fallout Boy, that I don't keep it go...
1805520	1807680	Okay, I'm saying put in a song like...
1807680	1808680	Okay, okay, whatever.
1808680	1809680	You know what?
1809680	1810680	I'm sorry.
1810680	1817860	The point of this letter is to say don't put mainstream crap in there and don't steal PSPs.
1817860	1818860	Thank you.
1818860	1820360	Thank you for our lesson of the week.
1820360	1824480	And he's also a first-person shooter and RPG fan in Boredom and says help.
1824480	1830560	Well, I would say if your PSP hadn't been stolen, you should get Popola Cross, because
1830560	1833120	that was a good game.
1833120	1837240	Orange Launch Radio would like to urge our listeners to not steal PSPs.
1837240	1839240	That's not a nice thing to do for you.
1839240	1840240	Or put cocaine in your underwear.
1840240	1841240	Yes.
1841240	1843800	Everybody knows you put it in your jacket in the inside liner.
1843800	1844800	You gotta...
1844800	1845800	I'm just kidding.
1845800	1849920	You put it in envelopes and send it to people who say it's anthrax.
1849920	1850920	Okay.
1850920	1855080	Look, if you want to go to Mexico with that shit someday, you're going to have to learn
1855080	1856460	how to put it in your body cavity.
1856460	1857640	So there you go.
1857640	1863560	Oh, and this person was called, um, as soon as kind of the email server was acting up.
1863560	1865560	Punctuation Man.
1865560	1869160	DS Master 25.
1869160	1871240	Which is like, it sounds like an old AOL screen name.
1871240	1872240	Wait, wait, wait.
1872240	1873240	DS Master?
1873240	1874240	Uh-huh.
1874240	1875240	So the guy had his PSP...
1875240	1878280	I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm making fun of the guy, and I'm not, but you have to understand,
1878280	1879280	the story is like completely crazy.
1879280	1882320	Maybe he's a fan of Dungeon Siege.
1882320	1887360	He talks about how much he misses his PSP and he's DS fan.
1887360	1888360	But I'm bummed.
1888360	1889360	Okay.
1889360	1890360	Next email.
1890360	1891360	Maybe he's a fan of Dark Sakura.
1891360	1892360	Oh, okay.
1892360	1893360	Okay.
1893360	1894360	Okay.
1894360	1895360	There it is.
1895360	1896360	No, that's not going to be it.
1896360	1897360	No, that can't be it.
1897360	1898360	Whatever.
1898360	1899640	Can I read the next email, Rob?
1899640	1900640	Yes, you may.
1900640	1901640	Okay, stop.
1901640	1902640	Love you.
1902640	1903640	Stop it.
1903640	1906040	You're all red in the face and you look scary.
1906040	1907520	This is from Recimo.
1907520	1909400	Hey, guys!
1909400	1910400	Hi.
1910400	1912840	I've emailed before regarding the PSN.
1912840	1916040	I've heard Lucky say that he's waiting for the PSN cards because he doesn't like the
1916040	1919040	idea of using his debit account to buy games.
1919040	1922540	I personally like the option because it's more convenient since you don't buy the games.
1922540	1924600	How about game sharing?
1924600	1930160	Many people forget that PSN games can be shared with up to three other people, so I can give
1930160	1932180	you a copy of Super Stardust HD.
1932180	1934760	How about Tekken Online or Everyday Shooter?
1934760	1938800	It's a relatively easy process and I'd be happy to share my games with you.
1938800	1941800	So add Recimo to your friends list and we'll talk.
1941800	1944680	Now, basically, here's why I don't want to...
1944680	1948640	I'm waiting for those cards is because I'm cheap and I just use a lot...
1948640	1953480	I get a lot of free games that I turn in the GameStop and get store credit, so I buy those
1953480	1959480	points cards with store credit and that's why, so I don't actually spend money on it.
1959480	1960480	That's a good idea.
1960480	1961480	All right.
1961480	1965440	Also, I just asked my sister to buy me the Eye of Judgment for Christmas.
1965440	1969200	I'm not into card games at all, but I really wanted to get the eye camera and in the process
1969200	1972520	helped Loki realize his dream of becoming Tingle for a day.
1972520	1973800	Never going to happen.
1973800	1974800	Never going to happen.
1974800	1978760	I love how we've probably driven sales of the Eye of Judgment more so than any other
1978760	1979760	game in all our history.
1979760	1980760	Great.
1980760	1981760	It's still under cheese big time.
1981760	1987560	We've had guests on to promote Geometry Wars, to promote DDR, to promote...
1987560	1991800	I don't hear about people going, yeah, I ran out and bought the 24 of the game because
1991800	1994440	you were talking about it on your show and gave a copy away.
1994440	1998220	No, we sell copies of the Eye of Judgment because there's this remote possibility that
1998220	2002840	will never freaking happen that Loki may dress up in a Tingle suit if you can tell a million
2002840	2004760	of your friends to buy this game.
2004760	2008920	It will never happen as I've looked at the sales charts.
2008920	2014120	It's starting to flat out and in fact in Japan, they only sold a couple hundred units the
2014120	2019400	other week so it's just going to bottom out and you'll never ever hit one million.
2019400	2022240	DJ Genai now calls it the Brown Eye of Fudgement.
2022240	2025880	Can I finish reading this email please?
2025880	2026880	Yes, you may.
2026880	2027880	Sorry.
2027880	2029280	The iCreate software is pretty cool as well.
2029280	2035640	I can create videos and photos with special effects and edit them.
2035640	2038640	I can store as much as five gigs of video on the hard drive.
2038640	2044520	I attached a little video of my goddaughter playing the great 1000 mile rally arcade machine
2044520	2050720	that I recorded with the iCamera.
2050720	2053760	Next time I'll have her play that Street Fighter II machine that I just bought.
2053760	2055360	She loves my Pac-Man the most.
2055360	2059800	Lastly, I manage a 7-Eleven in Virginia and was listening to the show on my PSP.
2059800	2063040	I made the mistake of listening to the show last week while drinking coffee and ringing
2063040	2064040	up a customer.
2064040	2067480	Lo and behold, Loki brought up the cow cooking George Foreman grill and I laughed and spat
2067480	2069360	coffee at my customer's face.
2069360	2070880	Not good for business.
2070880	2074640	Luckily, it was one of my regular customers who forgave me on the condition that he didn't
2074640	2077080	have to pay for his merchandise.
2077080	2082040	Thanks for reading this email and also for putting such an amusing show week after week.
2082040	2085000	It's so strange to me the effect this show has.
2085000	2091640	Like this little tiny idea that we came up with on a Bart ride home from San Francisco
2091640	2095200	or whatever has caused drama at 7-Elevens now.
2095200	2096960	It's amazing.
2096960	2097960	What you can achieve.
2097960	2098960	Yeah, it's mostly Loki's fault.
2098960	2100960	I'll give him that.
2100960	2103440	Loki, stop making people spit coffee at customers.
2103440	2104440	It's not nice.
2104440	2105440	Yeah, really.
2105440	2106760	Oh yeah, it's my fault.
2106760	2111440	And just to let you know, I am going to download this when we're not in the middle of broadcasting
2111440	2115640	so that we can see your daughter play a video game.
2115640	2118160	Or your, sorry, was it goddaughter?
2118160	2119160	Yeah.
2119160	2120680	Play video game.
2120680	2121680	Next email.
2121680	2122680	Dun dun dun.
2122680	2128560	Hey, OLR, I was happy to hear Jamie got a Ninja Pass as I openly endorsed DS piracy.
2128560	2132560	I would be happy to send you a bunch of DVDs loaded with DS backups.
2132560	2134520	500 games in total.
2134520	2136960	I've also hacked a PS2, PSP, and iPod.
2136960	2138240	Crack firmware on iPod games.
2138240	2139640	Should you really read this on the air?
2139640	2140640	From Ryan.
2140640	2141640	Oh, jeez.
2141640	2145000	You know, here's the thing about that.
2145000	2148760	I've looked at getting one of those R4s or the Ninja Pass or something like that, but
2148760	2151760	I've looked at the DS games and I'm like, there's not really anything I want.
2151760	2157040	It's just like, ooh, I could pirate all these games as the FBI is coming to Ryan's house
2157040	2158040	right now.
2158040	2159040	Oh, yeah.
2159040	2161560	We've narrowed it down to Ryan.
2161560	2162560	Let's find Ryan.
2162560	2163560	How many Ryans are there?
2163560	2165040	Oh, only a couple billion.
2165040	2166040	Well, wait a minute.
2166040	2167160	Ryan's not listening to this program.
2167160	2169160	There's probably only one.
2169160	2170480	We don't have that many listeners.
2170480	2171480	Well.
2171480	2172480	He emailed.
2172480	2173880	He didn't say he listened to the program.
2173880	2175240	He just emailed us.
2175240	2176280	IP tracking.
2176280	2177280	Let me see.
2177280	2178280	No.
2178280	2179280	But anyway, no.
2179280	2182360	The only reason I got my Ninja Pass was to play all of the games I don't want to import,
2182360	2183920	so that's why I have it.
2183920	2187140	Because anything that comes out in the US, if I want it, I just buy it.
2187140	2191280	My husband manages a game crazy.
2191280	2196960	By the way, I played, I forgot to mention, I played some of that Drawn to Life.
2196960	2197960	That game sucks.
2197960	2199600	It's not good at all.
2199600	2201800	Didn't you say that last week?
2201800	2204800	No, I bought Drawn to Life last week.
2204800	2207720	No, I'm pretty sure you reviewed it last week and said it sucked last week.
2207720	2209120	Well, it sucks.
2209120	2210120	It still sucks.
2210120	2211120	It still sucks.
2211120	2213120	News flash.
2213120	2214800	Here's your update on Drawn to Life.
2214800	2217440	Loki, what is the current update on Drawn to Life?
2217440	2218440	It sucks.
2218440	2219440	It stinks.
2219440	2220440	It stinks.
2220440	2221440	Sorry, Jamie.
2221440	2222440	Can I read?
2222440	2223440	Yes.
2223440	2224440	Please.
2224440	2225440	Okay.
2225440	2233400	Hey Skye, Loki, and DarkSakura, you guys are absolutely amazing, okay?
2233400	2236280	It's A-M-A-Z-I dash Z-I-N-G.
2236280	2241400	You stick out all over gaming podcasts with your unscripted humor and the gaming news
2241400	2242400	that we all want.
2242400	2247960	You know what's sad is I can't really share this show with like any, like, I feel, I don't
2247960	2253360	know, I want to say I kind of feel embarrassed to share this podcast with other like publishers
2253360	2254360	out there.
2254360	2255360	Hey, we'll promote your stuff.
2255360	2256360	And they listen to it.
2256360	2257360	No, thanks.
2257360	2259360	I don't think I want to be promoted on your show.
2259360	2260360	Yeah.
2260360	2261360	Sorry, Jamie.
2261360	2262360	Okay.
2262360	2263360	Blame him.
2263360	2264360	I am.
2264360	2266360	Can I read now?
2266360	2267360	Yes.
2267360	2268360	Okay.
2268360	2272000	I love how the mailbag segment always turns into how many times can we cut off Jamie with
2272000	2273000	a random tension?
2273000	2275480	How many times can I flip you off with my broken finger?
2275480	2276480	All right.
2276480	2277480	Sorry.
2277480	2278480	Go ahead.
2278480	2281080	Having listened live only once, it was quite awesome to be a part of this show that I'd
2281080	2284740	only listened to before my PSP, even though I live overseas.
2284740	2287560	I wanted to bring up an interesting thing that I observed before.
2287560	2292600	Being an American living overseas, I have access to a few American stores.
2292600	2296640	In one of these in mid-November, I saw the orange box for PS3 on the shelves.
2296640	2300540	Not knowing the intended release date for this game at the time, I didn't know how big
2300540	2304320	of an opportunity this was since I can't find that friggin' game here anymore.
2304320	2308640	I wanted to know what you guys thought of that, and I had a little idea.
2308640	2312160	DarkSakura gets her classic game of the week, Sky gets to talk a lot, but Loki doesn't seem
2312160	2313160	to have anything special.
2313160	2317960	Since he likes to be quite the critic, why not give him a worsted game of the week segment
2317960	2319560	or something like that?
2319560	2320880	Loki is special.
2320880	2324200	It would give him a chance to blow off some steam lol.
2324200	2327480	I don't need steam to be blown off, and I don't want to do a worsted game of the week.
2327480	2328480	That's kind of stupid.
2328480	2331920	That's the worst idea of the week.
2331920	2332920	Poor listener.
2332920	2333920	Can I finish?
2333920	2334920	Yes.
2334920	2335920	Thank you.
2335920	2344800	Well, that's about it, again, an ego- Jamie, you have to admit that was funny.
2344800	2345800	I'm sorry.
2345800	2346800	You're like, can I finish?
2346800	2353800	Well, that's just about it.
2353800	2360200	Bob.
2360200	2362200	I hate you guys.
2362200	2367960	Anyway, well, that's about it, again, an ego plus plus to you guys for being- and being
2367960	2372800	15, I also wanted you to know that you appeal to quite a broad range of gamers as well.
2372800	2373800	Keep up the awesome work.
2373800	2379600	Wow, this person writes a very freaking good email for being 15, and this is from The Flawless
2379600	2380600	Bolt X.
2380600	2381600	P.S.
2381600	2385480	I bought myself an eye of judgment and even one for my friend on his birthday, so there's
2385480	2388840	two small footsteps towards what will be a hit on YouTube.
2388840	2389840	P.S.S.
2389840	2392760	Put more crap on the PSP website and never get tired of that-
2392760	2393760	No!
2393760	2395860	I will never!
2395860	2397800	It will stay the way it is.
2397800	2402040	It'll be as updated as E3 on PSP.
2402040	2405440	Which I think we finally let expire.
2405440	2410440	Now I have all those cards that advertise a site that no longer exists.
2410440	2411440	D'oh.
2411440	2414320	So, to keep on reading.
2414320	2418480	Dear OLR crew, this is Rama from Indonesia, I think- yeah, you've written to us.
2418480	2420040	Oh yeah, it says on here, duh.
2420040	2421880	It's been a while since my last email.
2421880	2424560	I keep listening to your great show and I enjoy it heavily.
2424560	2428880	To Sky, the only person that makes me laugh every time I hear you make jokes and comments
2428880	2432400	about game related content, keep getting crazy then.
2432400	2436320	To Loki, very intellectual, especially when you criticize game related content and your
2436320	2437320	mocking style.
2437320	2443600	I love that nobody gamers in my area can make such a mocking style that bad.
2443600	2447400	To Dark Sakura, the sweetest thing is when I enjoy your classic game of the week as I
2447400	2451800	am blind so I rely on listening to the music and sound effects from the games.
2451800	2455160	Thanks for bringing every background from the game you review.
2455160	2459200	By the way guys, this is some of my crazy projects during next year's holiday.
2459200	2461720	I recorded some game music with me playing a recorder.
2461720	2465240	Yes I love playing a recorder and I wish I could get a real flute to play.
2465240	2468480	And again, I'll download these when we're not broadcasting.
2468480	2470120	Everyone sent us movies this week.
2470120	2475200	Yeah, there's links on here.
2475200	2478960	These are probably silly and I know I'm not a good player, but please leave me comments
2478960	2481880	and I will add more songs to play, perhaps Dragon Force.
2481880	2486960	And Super Mario Galaxy, Chrono Cross, Ragnarok, hey I love Ragnarok.
2486960	2488800	More Chrono Cross, Lufia 2.
2488800	2490600	That's kind of old school.
2490600	2491600	That's pretty cool.
2491600	2496760	Well I'll leave these active in the email box and we'll check them out.
2496760	2501200	Last email, dun dun dun.
2501200	2505600	Dear Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki, I am a long time listener but first time writer slash
2505600	2506600	contributor.
2506600	2511040	I found your show when iTunes first started offering podcasts and OLR was one of my first.
2511040	2514880	Right then it was your abbreviated Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.
2514880	2517680	I unsubscribed for a while when I found out I just didn't have time to listen to all the
2517680	2520480	podcasts I was getting and yours was one of the longest.
2520480	2524880	But recently I found I can get away with listening to my iPod at work as long as my superiors
2524880	2530240	don't notice me on it all day and don't notice or call me on it and have resubscribed.
2530240	2532400	Now I listen to your show every week.
2532400	2537560	Anywho, for starters you'll notice that I've attached, I've included an attachment.
2537560	2548680	I love the fact that you use Weird Al's Dare To Be Stupid as the background music for your
2548680	2552520	stupid awards segment, but I find the lyrics distracting when I'm trying to listen to your
2552520	2554200	dialogue on top of it.
2554200	2557920	I've included an instrumental version of the song Taken from the Amish Paradise single
2557920	2561840	– I ripped the file myself so I know it's legit – in case you want to use it in future
2561840	2562840	segments.
2562840	2563840	That's cool.
2563840	2564840	Aw, that's nice of you.
2564840	2565840	Thank you.
2565840	2570200	It's still relevant.
2570200	2573120	Speaking of background music, where did you get the version of One Winged Angel you played
2573120	2574960	during last week's A Few segment?
2574960	2578680	I love the combination of orchestra and metal, and One Winged Angels is one of my favorite
2578680	2584000	game music cues, as I'm sure it is to many others, and I was wondering if you could hook
2584000	2586880	me up with a copy or at least put it to where I can find it for myself.
2586880	2592800	It's on the Advent Children soundtrack, but I'll take care of this later.
2592800	2593800	Stay tuned.
2593800	2607760	How does this song not inspire fear in the hearts of everybody everywhere?
2607760	2611720	So if I may continue.
2611720	2615200	Finally the biggest reason for me writing is to Rob and Jamie Minch.
2615200	2619880	I don't know if I'm going to say so much about this on air, but he works for Disney
2619880	2620880	World.
2620880	2622880	I'll leave it at that.
2622880	2624920	Well, nice.
2624920	2627960	We might have to come to your neck of the woods very soon.
2627960	2631400	Keep up the great work, and I will continue to listen to your weekly podcast as long as
2631400	2632720	I can get away with it.
2632720	2635920	Maybe one of these days I'll join the chat on the live show.
2635920	2637920	Sincerely, Justin the Claw.
2637920	2638920	P.S.
2638920	2644960	On a completely unrelated note, not to sound like a jerk, but I recall Rob referring to
2644960	2646960	a game as addicting.
2646960	2648600	When did that word become an adjective?
2648600	2652320	According to Merriam-Webster, addicting is a transitive verb.
2652320	2654480	Addictive would be the proper adjective form.
2654480	2655480	You're not the only one to do this.
2655480	2658480	It's become a common error in recent years and in professional publications.
2658480	2660240	I'm just surprised Jamie didn't jump on that.
2660240	2663640	I may be mistaken, but doesn't she pride herself on knowledge of proper grammar?
2663640	2664640	No offense, of course.
2664640	2665640	I'm just making an observation.
2665640	2668120	Yes, but it could also be an understood object.
2668120	2670520	Whatever, dude.
2670520	2674080	Don't hate just because I'm the most smartest radio host in the world.
2674080	2679600	I actually think that it has an understood object, therefore addicting could be correct.
2679600	2680600	Don't hate.
2680600	2686800	I'd say the game is addicting me, but me would not be necessary to say.
2686800	2689880	He learns something new every week here on Orange Lime's radio.
2689880	2693280	And Freeze Pop emailed us.
2693280	2694280	Really?
2694280	2696640	Just with updates to their shows.
2696640	2699760	Mike, are they coming to do a live show in the studio?
2699760	2700760	No.
2700760	2702320	Because you know we're going to have a musical guest here in a couple of hours.
2702320	2705360	The very first OLR musical guest live in studio in two weeks.
2705360	2706360	I'm so excited.
2706360	2707360	That's cool.
2707360	2708360	I will tell you who it is next week.
2708360	2709360	No, I won't.
2709360	2711240	Well, I'll tell you later.
2711240	2713600	Yes, I will.
2713600	2714600	In a private room.
2714600	2721040	Anyhow, so if that's it for the emails, I encourage more emails to come.
2721040	2725280	Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
2725280	2730160	Send us more, but try not to send us too many videos because then our email bag will blow
2730160	2731860	up and self-destruct.
2731860	2732860	So please don't do that.
2732860	2735680	And if you try to do it on purpose, we'll ban you.
2735680	2739280	Alright, now I know we've covered a lot of news, but there's still some huge news we
2739280	2740280	haven't even touched.
2740280	2741280	Right, Logie?
2741280	2742280	Definitely.
2742280	2747880	The most exciting news that could possibly ever be announced was announced this week.
2747880	2754780	Capcom has announced that they are remaking Bionic Commando, the old original 2D version,
2754780	2759480	and are releasing it on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network as Bionic Commando
2759480	2760480	Rearmed.
2760480	2762060	It looks fucking awesome.
2762060	2764780	It's going to have two player co-op in the game.
2764780	2768920	It's also going to have some new moves you can do, like you can pick up barrels and throw
2768920	2772400	them at people or pick up people with your claw and that kind of thing.
2772400	2777380	New weapons, like grenades and that kind of stuff, and new bosses, but it's basically
2777380	2779680	going to follow the original game.
2779680	2781040	This game looks so hot.
2781040	2784640	Like I know we're a radio show, so you can't really see the video, but you've got to go
2784640	2786840	seek out the video for this.
2786840	2787840	Everybody has it, right?
2787840	2788960	Yeah, pretty much everyone.
2788960	2790500	Every big video game site has it.
2790500	2791500	It looks so hot.
2791500	2793080	Like, that is the way you redo an old game.
2793080	2795040	I'm more excited about this than the actual 3D.
2795040	2797280	Me too, me too.
2797280	2801640	But supposedly, if you are looking forward to the 3D one, getting this game will unlock
2801640	2806920	the classic skin in the 3D one so that your dude isn't the new dreadlock guy or what.
2806920	2810360	He looks like the old school guy with the hair and everything.
2810360	2811360	That's cool.
2811360	2812360	That is great.
2812360	2815480	Jamie, are you excited about a new Bionic Commando?
2815480	2817920	As long as you can kill Hitler, I'm happy.
2817920	2821040	I'm pretty sure they probably changed him, right, to be politically correct?
2821040	2822720	Well, they could still be...
2822720	2824320	His name is now Heiler.
2824320	2825320	No.
2825320	2831600	Well, no, he was... he had a different name in the US one anyway, but it was still Hitler.
2831600	2832840	He looked like him.
2832840	2836440	They had Master... you know, Master D trying to...
2836440	2837440	Master D.
2837440	2838440	Yeah.
2838440	2840360	I don't know.
2840360	2841360	I'm excited.
2841360	2842800	I cannot wait to play this game.
2842800	2846820	I love the whole idea about you can pick up somebody with your claw and throw them.
2846820	2849020	That is awesome.
2849020	2850020	Very awesome.
2850020	2851400	Still no ability to jump, though.
2851400	2852920	Why does that make you laugh?
2852920	2853920	I don't know.
2853920	2854920	It's just like...
2854920	2858360	I love the fact that you can pick up someone with your claw, like, I don't know, it's just...
2858360	2859360	It's the claw.
2859360	2860360	The claw.
2860360	2864400	See, Justin the Claw would be all over a Bionic Commando game, you think?
2864400	2865400	All right.
2865400	2866400	Anyway.
2866400	2872280	If you're not into the claw, then maybe you're into the more black and white, modern-looking
2872280	2874400	game that kind of moves like an M.C.
2874400	2875400	Escher piece.
2875400	2878360	Of course, I'm talking about Echo Chrome, which is one of the games that's going to
2878360	2879840	be making its way to the PlayStation 3.
2879840	2882960	You might remember, I believe they showed this at Game Developers Conference last year.
2882960	2885200	This was one of their kind of, like, wow-em kind of games.
2885200	2888440	I don't remember if it was that or E3, but it was one of the games that people kind of
2888440	2890640	went and go, oh, Sony's kind of putting out some cool stuff.
2890640	2891640	It was E3.
2891640	2892640	Yeah.
2892640	2893640	Oh, sorry.
2893640	2897760	Well, anyhow, it's going to be up, finally, on March 19th.
2897760	2900680	That's going to be a PlayStation Network download on March 19th.
2900680	2904800	Only the PSP version had been given a date previously, but you can finally check this
2904800	2908040	out on March 19th, which, coincidentally, is the same day that you can actually check
2908040	2909040	out the PSP version.
2909040	2911760	And that looks like a pretty interesting puzzle game.
2911760	2914720	If I had a PS3, I'd check it out, but since I don't, I'm going to go over to Loki's and
2914720	2917120	check it out there.
2917120	2918120	Sound good, Loki?
2918120	2919120	Sure.
2919120	2920520	I'm crashing your party.
2920520	2925000	All right, so look for that, Echo Chrome.
2925000	2926840	Very cool.
2926840	2930720	Well, in other news, crap.
2930720	2931720	Really?
2931720	2933360	What kind of crap?
2933360	2938720	No, it was when I closed the mailbag, it closed my other Firefox window.
2938720	2941880	So I have to reload show roll.
2941880	2942880	Oh, that's okay.
2942880	2943880	We can wait.
2943880	2944880	You know what?
2944880	2945880	Give me a second.
2945880	2951240	I just bid on a Vectrex, by the way.
2951240	2952240	Cool.
2952240	2953240	You're going to buy a Vectrex?
2953240	2954240	Why?
2954240	2957040	Because someone in Stockton is selling one, and right now the bidding is up to 50 bucks,
2957040	2959320	and it comes with, like, 10 games.
2959320	2960320	But what do you want it for?
2960320	2963600	Just say you have to put it in my desk at work.
2963600	2965680	Dark Soccer is going to go on eBay and snipe you for that.
2965680	2966680	I don't care.
2966680	2967680	I'm going to watch it.
2967680	2968680	I'll do it, too.
2968680	2969680	I don't care if I win.
2969680	2970680	I don't win.
2970680	2972120	I'm not, like, that dead set on getting it.
2972120	2979600	I bought, like I said, that bit generations game, what's it called, Dot Stream.
2979600	2981600	It's up, by the way.
2981600	2982800	All right.
2982800	2985800	It will be.
2985800	2987320	Okay.
2987320	2992520	Well, there is a new compilation of games being put out by SNK.
2992520	2994280	It has 16 games on it.
2994280	3004680	It will be on PS2 and PSP, and it's going to be, let's see what's on here.
3004680	3014080	We have Top Hunter, Last Resort, Shock Troopers, Sengoku Burning Fight, Baseball Stars 2, Neo
3014080	3020540	Turf Masters, Super Sidekicks 3, and of course there's the original Metal Slug and Magician
3020540	3024680	Lord, but they're not on there.
3024680	3026560	Actually, yes.
3026560	3031120	Yes, they are on there, sorry.
3031120	3032120	We just can't make up our mind.
3032120	3034400	There are so many SNK classics to choose from.
3034400	3036440	They are all on there.
3036440	3037440	Excellent.
3037440	3038440	What is this for again?
3038440	3039440	It's a PSP.
3039440	3040440	PS2 and PSP.
3040440	3041440	Oh, nice.
3041440	3043240	That'll be fun to play on the PSP.
3043240	3046640	It's nice to see them putting together nice compilations since, you know, SNK doesn't
3046640	3047640	want to make any new games.
3047640	3048840	They've never done a compilation before.
3048840	3049840	Yeah.
3049840	3050840	They don't want to make new games.
3050840	3055400	I mean, what's this, like the E compilation that Metal Slug's been in?
3055400	3056400	SNK compilation?
3056400	3057400	Unheard of.
3057400	3058400	Unheard of.
3058400	3066960	Well, this isn't really a compilation, but Guitar Hero 3, they're going to be doing a
3066960	3074160	little contest on Super Bowl weekend where you can win basically during, I want to say,
3074160	3080680	on Sunday from 12 to 4 Pacific Standard Time.
3080680	3087020	You will be entered in a contest if you play multiplayer over live on Guitar Hero 3 where
3087020	3095520	you can possibly win a LG 50 inch 1080p flat panel plasma HDTV, an Xbox 360 Elite, and
3095520	3100080	a Boom Chair, which is a YFX wireless gaming chair.
3100080	3101080	A Boom Chair?
3101080	3104600	Yes, Boom Chair.
3104600	3112440	Also you may win a Guitar Hero guitar controller face plate signed by Slash and some other
3112440	3117040	crap including, I think, some points and whatnot.
3117040	3122080	But yeah, so that should be cool.
3122080	3125360	Actually they're saying, it looks like the event's going to go from February 1st through
3125360	3135960	the 3rd, so yeah, it's 72 hours, but I don't know why the significant part of Sunday, 12
3135960	3139920	to 4 isn't a big deal there, whatever.
3139920	3146160	Oh, and it's for US and Canada only, so sorry everybody else.
3146160	3151960	Sorry international people, apparently Microsoft and all these people involved don't love you.
3151960	3154160	No, just kidding.
3154160	3155800	There's probably laws or something, I don't know.
3155800	3160160	If you want to find out more information on us, go to Xbox.com slash rock your party.
3160160	3163000	We're going to rock your party.
3163000	3167880	All right, anyhow, one more story for you guys and then we are going to get to the Skype
3167880	3170280	line where you can call us and interact with us.
3170280	3174480	You can either call us on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is our name on there, or you can give
3174480	3179440	us a call toll free, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3179440	3183940	We'll get to that in just a moment, but first, some news on a popular MMO.
3183940	3184940	It's one we don't talk about.
3184940	3185940	It's not really World of Warcraft.
3185940	3190560	We don't talk about this game very much, but I believe the most popular MMO in the world,
3190560	3195840	even above World of Warcraft, is a game called Lineage 2, and you know Lineage 2?
3195840	3196840	Have you played Lineage 2?
3196840	3201200	No, I just have a shirt from E3 that says Lineage 2, and I'm like, hey, I've heard
3201200	3202200	of that before.
3202200	3203200	I have a Coke can.
3203200	3204200	I do too.
3204200	3205840	I have like a six-pack of Coke with Lineage characters.
3205840	3207800	I remember them giving that away or something.
3207800	3213040	Well, anyway, Lineage 2 is one of the most popular MMOs anywhere, and unfortunately,
3213040	3217120	there's always some tragedy that comes out of MMOs, and this tragedy comes out of Russia,
3217120	3220120	where there is probably, you know, probably here in America, most people are playing Warcraft,
3220120	3223160	but I suppose over in Russia, there's much more people playing Lineage 2.
3223160	3225920	Not to say no one in America is playing it, but anyway.
3225920	3229020	A Russian man has been charged with murder.
3229020	3234400	It was basically over a clan war inside Lineage 2.
3234400	3235700	There were these two clans.
3235700	3238880	There was the, oh God, this name's amazing.
3238880	3242640	It's the Ku Klux Klan.
3242640	3243640	Yes.
3243640	3244640	Yeah, wow.
3244640	3245640	That's all I can say about that one.
3245640	3249440	There was this, I mean, that should have been the first sign that something was wrong.
3249440	3255340	There was this clan, and then the Platinum Clan, they were just fighting each other consistently.
3255340	3262920	The Ku Klux were mostly students, and Platinum were people over 30, and the guy who was killed
3262920	3269140	here, 33-year-old Albert, used to spend hours in front of his computer, and he had a clan.
3269140	3273040	There were warriors in the clan, and just before New Year, there was a big old battle
3273040	3278000	with the Ku Klux, and for whatever reason, these people agreed to meet face to face in
3278000	3279720	the real world.
3279720	3283960	Sign of trouble right there, and when they did meet in the real world, Albert was beaten
3283960	3286720	and died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.
3286720	3291960	Here's a quote from the sister of Albert, Albina, says, I think they have confused the
3291960	3296400	game in reality, and after we buried him on December 31st, they continued to threaten
3296400	3297400	us.
3297400	3301360	The alleged murderer has not shown any regret, and has yet to justify himself.
3301360	3304360	The alleged murderer, 22 years old.
3304360	3305360	Amazing.
3305360	3310760	Part of me, I read this and I go, is this even real?
3310760	3318680	Like is this like a satire website or whatever, but I think it's real.
3318680	3325120	That's kind of, wow, sad, sad, sad, sad.
3325120	3326120	That was awful.
3326120	3329760	No, I'm like, why are you laughing over there then if it's sad?
3329760	3336920	Sorry, I was showing them a picture of Zelda 3, and apparently someone found goat's say
3336920	3342080	in Zelda 3.
3342080	3343720	It was ridiculous, but funny.
3343720	3348980	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line if you want to talk about MMO craziness
3348980	3351960	or anything else we've talked about tonight, you can go ahead and just call.
3351960	3356560	Right now, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.
3356560	3357560	Let's go to the phones.
3357560	3360880	Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?
3360880	3364840	Hello, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?
3364840	3365840	You there?
3365840	3366840	Caller?
3366840	3367840	Hola, bienvenidos a Orangelaunchradio.
3367840	3368840	Hello.
3368840	3374200	Okay, apparently our caller's not there.
3374200	3378720	Make sure you always check your connection with Echo123.
3378720	3379720	Let's try this one instead.
3379720	3381720	Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio, who's this?
3381720	3384440	Hello, this is Ion671.
3384440	3389240	Hello, Ion671, what's on your mind?
3389240	3397600	Well, I just want to say that I'm kind of annoyed at all the people who say that parents
3397600	3404960	don't understand games, because I'm a kid, 16, and both my parents are really into video
3404960	3408640	games and anime.
3408640	3415780	My dad just was saying how he wants the Xbox 360 because he wants to get Burnout Paradise.
3415780	3419280	You do realize, though, that in the larger scope of things, your parents are unicorns
3419280	3422640	and you're very lucky to have them, right?
3422640	3430760	Yes, because I go to other people's houses and I see how other parents hate video games
3430760	3433340	and think that they are the devil's creation.
3433340	3437840	What do you think is the difference between your parents and other people's parents?
3437840	3442560	Why do you think your parents get it more so than other families?
3442560	3449240	I really don't know, I may have just been lucky.
3449240	3451000	Rice Princess is asking a question here, hold on.
3451000	3457320	I just want to know if they were gamers or tabletop gamers or anything when they were
3457320	3458320	younger.
3458320	3467060	Yeah, and something I've always thought was there's a lot of people who play video games,
3467060	3478920	but then they grow up with quotation fingers, and there are some people who see a show so
3478920	3484520	they disregard it or discard it, it's late.
3484520	3491400	And I would assume that in your household you sound pretty well off for 16, you sound
3491400	3494920	like you're a smart kid, and obviously you're smart because you're listening to this show,
3494920	3499520	but video games are obviously not the evil spawn of Satan because you sound like you've
3499520	3500520	turned out okay.
3500520	3502960	Have you ever tried to put cocaine in your underwear?
3502960	3504360	No.
3504360	3509080	Then you've probably turned out a-okay, so what do you think other families can learn
3509080	3510800	from yours?
3510800	3519360	Well, just really educate your kids about it and also pay attention to the news because
3519360	3525000	every time they mention a game called Grand Theft Auto, so I'm wondering why parents are
3525000	3526000	buying it for their kids.
3526000	3527000	That's a good question.
3527000	3528680	Hey, I've got another question for you.
3528680	3531280	Do your parents play the games with you?
3531280	3540180	Oh yeah, well not of course we all play Wii Tennis and all that, but my dad will continually
3540180	3544720	kick my ass at burnout, he is a burnout machine.
3544720	3548520	That's kind of cool, like you guys have fun as a family together playing the games, right?
3548520	3549520	Mm-hmm.
3549520	3553400	And how's that different from card game night or board game night or whatever, you know?
3553400	3555240	I don't know, it's just kind of the new way of doing things.
3555240	3557120	It's just way cooler, that's what it is.
3557120	3559680	It's way cooler.
3559680	3561680	We're all going to come over- It's just the next generation.
3561680	3565280	We're all going to come over to your house someday and have a party, okay?
3565280	3566280	Because your parents sound like they'd be cool with that.
3566280	3568600	Well, I wouldn't afford it, so good luck at that.
3568600	3573640	All right, well hey, you know, Jamie and I are in Disney World, so don't bite your tongue,
3573640	3574640	sir.
3574640	3576640	We might be in your neck in the woods.
3576640	3577640	Okay.
3577640	3578640	One last thing?
3578640	3581320	Yeah, sure, go ahead.
3581320	3586200	I actually know Ryan, the guy who hacked all his PSP stuff.
3586200	3587200	Really?
3587200	3591360	And if the FBI does come to his house, we shall sue.
3591360	3598280	Okay, well I'm very sorry, so look, we disavowed all knowledge of that email and anything was
3598280	3599280	ever said.
3599280	3600280	Okay.
3600280	3601280	Why would he sue?
3601280	3603640	I mean, seriously, I mean, he's the one breaking the law.
3603640	3604640	It's a joke.
3604640	3608840	And I would like to point out, you, sir, have nailed it down to Ryan in Florida now.
3608840	3612560	See, we didn't do that before, so we ought to sue you.
3612560	3613560	Okay.
3613560	3615840	I just said I know him.
3615840	3617560	I don't say I know him personally.
3617560	3618560	Oh, okay.
3618560	3619560	Oh, snap.
3619560	3621560	Here, I flipped that right back at you.
3621560	3625440	Did I just get pwned by a 16-year-old?
3625440	3626440	You did.
3626440	3628280	Rob got majorly pwned.
3628280	3631840	That was indeed a zing, Rob.
3631840	3633840	You got a zing.
3633840	3636840	Alright, for that, I'm hanging up on you, sir.
3636840	3637840	Bye.
3637840	3638840	Okay, bye.
3638840	3639840	Alright, have a good week.
3639840	3640840	That was a good call.
3640840	3642080	That was a really good call.
3642080	3643200	That was a very good call.
3643200	3645240	One of our better calls.
3645240	3648600	I also kind of like the fact that when we said, you know what, we might actually come
3648600	3650960	to Florida, he was like, okay, you can come over.
3650960	3652800	Invite yourself, Rob.
3652800	3656280	My parents will buy beer.
3656280	3657680	I hope they buy good beer.
3657680	3659760	Alright, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3659760	3660760	Who's this?
3660760	3664880	Hello, hi, hi.
3664880	3665880	Hello?
3665880	3666880	Hello?
3666880	3667880	Sorry about that.
3667880	3668880	I'm going to make a phone.
3668880	3669880	Yeah, you're very, very quiet, dude.
3669880	3671880	You're going to have to put that microphone right by your mouth.
3671880	3672880	What's up?
3672880	3673880	How's that?
3673880	3674880	Ah, much better.
3674880	3675880	What's on your mind?
3675880	3676880	Introduce yourself.
3676880	3677880	Yes.
3677880	3678880	Introduce yourself.
3678880	3679880	Hi, I'm Rob.
3679880	3680880	I'm Rob.
3680880	3681880	Hey, Rob.
3681880	3682880	I'm Rob.
3682880	3683880	I'm Rob.
3683880	3684880	Hi.
3684880	3685880	I'm Rob.
3685880	3686880	I'm Rob.
3686880	3687880	I'm Rob.
3687880	3688880	I'm Rob.
3688880	3689880	I'm Rob.
3689880	3690880	I'm Rob.
3690880	3691880	I'm Rob.
3691880	3692880	Hi, I'm Rob.
3692880	3693880	I'm Rob.
3693880	3694880	Hi.
3694880	3695880	How's Rob?
3695880	3696880	I'm Rob.
3696880	3697880	Hi, I'm Rob.
3697880	3698880	Yes.
3698880	3699880	Introduce yourself.
3699880	3700940	Oh, by the way, sorry, dude.
3700940	3701940	Okay, I don't know.
3701940	3707460	I'm just hanging out and listening on the east coast, I guess.
3707460	3708460	What's your name?
3708460	3713600	Or you have an online name, or?
3713600	3716220	I have an email in the chat room.
3716220	3717220	Okay, cool.
3717220	3719800	Well, what are you doing while you're hanging out?
3719800	3738400	Is there something in tonight's show that inspired you to call in tonight?
3738400	3740000	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
3740000	3742000	Oh, do you mind if I...
3742000	3743720	I got a cool dad in the same room.
3743720	3747720	Do you want to talk to him?
3747720	3749720	Okay.
3749720	3751720	Hello?
3751720	3753720	Hello?
3753720	3755720	Hello.
3755720	3757720	Hi, identify yourself.
3757720	3759720	Hello.
3759720	3761720	Hi, who's this?
3761720	3763720	This is Okuda.
3763720	3765720	Hello, Okuda!
3765720	3767720	Hi, I think your friend was kind of nervous.
3767720	3769720	I mean, we're just an internet radio show.
3769720	3771720	Nothing to be scared of, right?
3771720	3773720	Right, Okuda?
3773720	3775720	Yeah, he gets really nervous sometimes.
3775720	3777720	Yeah, we're just some dumb kids on the internet with a show.
3777720	3779720	What's on your mind?
3779720	3781720	I was wondering...
3781720	3783720	I play World of Warcraft a lot.
3783720	3785720	I was wondering...
3785720	3787720	Do you like private servers?
3787720	3789720	What's your opinion on private servers?
3789720	3791720	On crowded servers?
3791720	3793720	Private servers.
3793720	3795720	Oh, private servers.
3795720	3797720	I don't know much about them.
3797720	3799720	I know they're out there.
3799720	3801720	I've understood it's kind of a risky thing to do.
3801720	3805720	Once you mod your Warcraft to go on a private server, you can't play on the public ones anymore, right?
3805720	3807720	I don't know.
3807720	3809720	But private servers are kind of corny.
3809720	3811720	I mean, yeah, you can do...
3811720	3813720	I wasn't there a cash file.
3813720	3815720	Oh, you can dump a cash file.
3815720	3817720	I guess.
3817720	3819720	But anyway, sorry, go ahead.
3819720	3821720	No, I'm just saying you can mod it to be super strong or make all this money and stuff.
3821720	3823720	But that makes the game boring to me.
3823720	3825720	I don't know.
3825720	3827720	You can have the new patch.
3827720	3829720	You can have the new patch.
3829720	3831720	You can have the new patch. I'm there.
3831720	3833720	Only on the private servers.
3833720	3835720	Really?
3835720	3837720	I have three characters.
3837720	3839720	Oh my god, you're perfect. Get away from me.
3839720	3841720	Stop sitting next to me.
3841720	3843720	They're all female dwarves.
3843720	3845720	Oh my...
3845720	3847720	Get especially away from me.
3847720	3849720	That doesn't even make sense.
3849720	3851720	But private servers...
3851720	3855720	I would think in Warcraft you kind of have to have a lot of people in order to be able to do things.
3855720	3863720	You need to have thousands of people on a server in order to get things done because there's not always people looking to run steam vaults at two in the morning on a private server.
3863720	3871720	So I would think the problem with a private server is that unless you're playing with the same people at the same time, you can't really progress very far, I would think.
3871720	3873720	I don't know. Do you have a difference of opinion?
3873720	3875720	Akuda, do you play on a private server?
3875720	3877720	Yeah.
3877720	3879720	And how do you like it?
3879720	3881720	Yeah, I play on a private server.
3881720	3885720	Um, yeah...
3885720	3887720	Sorry, there's a huge lag.
3887720	3889720	Oh, it's probably JustinTV screwing everything up. That's alright.
3889720	3897720	Well, hey, thank you guys so much for calling in and even though we were a little bit nervous, hey, you got through and you got to hear yourself on the radio, okay?
3897720	3899720	Thanks for having me.
3899720	3901720	No problemo.
3901720	3903720	You got to say hi.
3903720	3905720	I think they're handing the phone back. I'm not sure.
3905720	3907720	Okay.
3907720	3909720	Alright. Have a good one, you guys.
3909720	3911720	Alright.
3911720	3913720	Okay, thanks for having us. Have a good night.
3913720	3915720	You too.
3915720	3917720	Smoke another bud.
3917720	3919720	That's terrible, Rob.
3919720	3921720	I'm kidding, I'm kidding. They're just nervous. God, come on.
3921720	3923720	No.
3923720	3925720	But if they use smoke bud, they'll relax.
3925720	3929720	No, we're not encouraging that, though. We would never...
3929720	3933720	No, but if you feel so inclined, it would help you relax.
3933720	3935720	Alright, look, we give people shit, that's what we do.
3935720	3937720	Like, we're going to give our next caller.
3937720	3939720	Who's this?
3939720	3941720	It's me, Rama. What's up, everyone?
3941720	3943720	Hello, Rama.
3943720	3945720	What is up, Rama, speaking of giving people shit?
3945720	3947720	Not much.
3947720	3950720	No, that was me that called the first time, but my headset was acting really retarded.
3950720	3952720	Sorry about that.
3952720	3954720	Yeah, echo 123 next time.
3954720	3956720	That was the headset. I think that was user error, Rama.
3956720	3958720	What's on your mind?
3958720	3964720	Oh, not too much. I want to talk about the whole PlayStation Dusty article you told earlier.
3964720	3966720	Dust Cap 3.
3966720	3968720	What about it?
3968720	3970720	Pretty much.
3970720	3976720	Check this out. I'm looking at pictures of it, and I'm posting it in the chat room now at theconsumers.com.
3976720	3981720	I mean, this guy had his PS3 only three months, and it's that dusty.
3981720	3986720	As somebody who's been in a technical field for about ten years, even in the worst conditions,
3986720	3992720	I have never seen, not even a computer on the outside of it, that dusty, okay?
3992720	3997720	So, obviously, this guy really must have stuck it somewhere and just didn't care.
3997720	4008720	Plus, I also found this out by reading off that website that supposedly this was an entire setup from start to finish.
4008720	4013720	It's coming from consumers.com, which is the same network that owns Kotaku.
4013720	4015720	They're both in that same thing.
4015720	4017720	Their blogs are also very similar looking.
4017720	4019720	I actually kind of like Consumerist.
4019720	4025720	They're a fun blog to read because I teach customer service, so I always like to read horrible customer service stories.
4025720	4028720	But anyhow, sorry, I just want to say we can't say the name of the blog.
4028720	4030720	That's fine.
4030720	4033720	We're looking at a dirty-ass picture of a PlayStation.
4033720	4039720	Was this person smoking right in front of it, or was it just poorly ventilated?
4039720	4044720	Because I look at Loki's house, and his PlayStation 3 he's had since launch doesn't look like that,
4044720	4048720	and Dark Soccer's PlayStation 3 doesn't look like that, so I don't think it's the machine.
4048720	4051720	I think there's something the person is doing.
4051720	4053720	That's what it is.
4053720	4056720	Is the cat sleeping on it at night?
4056720	4059720	He's just stuck in somewhere where he could collect dust in the basement or something.
4059720	4064720	Now, the next link I posted off the Consumerist, Visa extended the warranty and replaced it.
4064720	4069720	If you read the comments, you find that the guy that complained about this is an actor,
4069720	4073720	and now they're assuming that, like I said, this was an entire setup.
4073720	4076720	And I also posted a link from PlayStation.net about it.
4076720	4080720	The dirty PlayStation is all a setup?
4080720	4081720	Yeah.
4081720	4082720	Why?
4082720	4086720	Supposedly this guy is a pay... he was paid to do this.
4086720	4092720	This makes no sense, and this is supposed to be promotion for Sony to put pictures of a dirty-ass PlayStation 3 all over the internet?
4092720	4094720	PS3, you're so dirty.
4094720	4096720	You've been very naughty, Sony.
4096720	4098720	You're a naughty person.
4098720	4100720	I paid him to do it.
4100720	4102720	What the crap?
4102720	4108720	Wait, no, but this is coming from the Play 3...
4108720	4111720	Who paid him to... oh, so somebody paid him to attack Sony.
4111720	4112720	It wasn't Sony that did it.
4112720	4114720	Somebody paid him to do it.
4114720	4115720	He's... okay.
4115720	4117720	I'm reading this from Play3.net.
4117720	4118720	End of the story? No.
4118720	4124720	It only turns out that Reed Goldshaw happens to be a professional bit-part actor who has appeared on Fox News before.
4124720	4128720	Now, it is possible that this chap can be a paid actor who also happens to have the world's dirtiest console.
4128720	4135720	These coincidences suggest he was faking his m'lady to jumpstart his career, or paid as part...
4135720	4137720	I know, m'lady? M'lady?
4137720	4139720	What a crappy word to use.
4139720	4144720	Paid as a part of the much-cited Microsoft dirty tricks campaign against the PlayStation 3.
4144720	4146720	Ah, what the hell?
4146720	4148720	I don't... that seems kind of low.
4148720	4154720	I mean, I don't think... you know, as much as we'd like to spread these stories about Microsoft is evil and da-da-da,
4154720	4158720	this doesn't seem like something they'd do, and neither Nintendo.
4158720	4163720	So, I don't know who's got something against Sony this bad, but that makes no sense at all.
4163720	4164720	Nathan has a question.
4164720	4167720	Oh, yeah, sure, Nathan.
4167720	4173720	I don't understand how being on Fox News would jumpstart an actor's career.
4173720	4178720	You're not... it's not supposed to be an act on the news.
4178720	4180720	Oh, it was Fox News.
4180720	4182720	That could be...
4182720	4183720	Yeah, fair and balanced.
4183720	4184720	Well, you know what?
4184720	4188720	When you're a struggling actor, any exposure is exposure, right?
4188720	4190720	Even porno?
4190720	4191720	Yeah, sure, porno.
4191720	4192720	Oh, Skinimax.
4192720	4194720	I don't know. Why do people do Skinimax films?
4194720	4195720	I don't know.
4195720	4196720	Well, Rama, I don't know.
4196720	4197720	What do you think of this?
4197720	4199720	Who do you think did the setup?
4199720	4202720	I honestly don't know because I read all of the comments.
4202720	4204720	He claims that this is legit.
4204720	4211720	To be perfectly honest, I don't know, but I do know that that PS3 got dusty on purpose.
4211720	4217720	I'm guessing he collected dust in a vacuum and just started sprinkling it on there and complained or something like that.
4217720	4219720	That's what I honestly think.
4219720	4220720	That's kind of a mental problem.
4220720	4224720	It gets dusty, but we've had stuff set up for like three, four months.
4224720	4228720	We have a Nintendo sitting on the floor for about four months and it's not even that dirty.
4228720	4231720	It looks like it's nearly new and we don't even touch it.
4231720	4232720	I think he just has issues.
4232720	4234720	I think that's what it boils down to.
4234720	4236720	Cleaning issues.
4236720	4237720	Yeah, cleaning issues.
4237720	4239720	Maybe he lives in a toilet.
4239720	4240720	Who knows?
4240720	4243720	Where it would get especially dusty.
4243720	4245720	That makes a lot of sense, Rob.
4245720	4246720	Shut up. I hate you.
4246720	4248720	You shut up, you m'lady.
4248720	4249720	I hate you.
4249720	4251720	Children, children behave.
4251720	4252720	So I get for reading fast.
4252720	4253720	No.
4253720	4255720	All right.
4255720	4258720	Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?
4258720	4260720	I will be making a trip out to the West Coast.
4260720	4261720	When?
4261720	4262720	Yay.
4262720	4266720	Looking at Fourth of July weekend.
4266720	4267720	Awesome.
4267720	4268720	Woohoo.
4268720	4269720	Well, we will be seeing you then.
4269720	4270720	Oh, yeah.
4270720	4271720	Oh, yeah.
4271720	4272720	Clean the book hard.
4272720	4273720	End all time.
4273720	4274720	All right.
4274720	4275720	All right, Rama.
4275720	4276720	We got to let you go.
4276720	4278720	We want to try and take one more call before it's all over.
4278720	4279720	One last question.
4279720	4280720	I'll get out of here.
4280720	4282720	Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?
4282720	4285720	Whose idea was it to put the gold schlager on the table?
4285720	4286720	I will give you three guesses.
4286720	4289720	It starts with a J.
4289720	4292720	I love you.
4292720	4293720	All right.
4293720	4294720	Take care, Rama.
4294720	4295720	All right.
4295720	4296720	Bye.
4296720	4297720	Bye.
4297720	4300720	I like to point out it was an empty bottle of gold schlager, too.
4300720	4302720	Just so you know.
4302720	4305720	Just so you know, it was an empty bottle of gold schlager.
4305720	4309720	Username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, Skype Line 1877, Game OLR.
4309720	4311720	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4311720	4312720	Who's this?
4312720	4313720	Hi, there.
4313720	4315720	This is Ross Deal UT.
4315720	4316720	Hello, Ross Deal UT.
4316720	4318720	What is on your mind?
4318720	4319720	Not much.
4319720	4327320	You know, I was kind of calling because that whole thing about the Russian MMO freaks who
4327320	4329720	started fighting with each other.
4329720	4332520	I seriously had to read that and wonder if it was a parody.
4332520	4335160	I mean, it was that unreal.
4335160	4340320	Why would you want to meet in real life to have a gang fight or a clan fight or whatever?
4340320	4341320	I would not want to meet in real life.
4341320	4345520	Well, soccer fans do it all the time, so maybe it's just an extension of that.
4345520	4348120	I guess, I don't know.
4348120	4352320	Anyway, that reminds me of a recent post on Kotaku.
4352320	4357320	Apparently, the Chinese government is going to be cracking down a little harder on Internet
4357320	4358320	cafes and stuff like that.
4358320	4361320	Let me put a link on the chat.
4361320	4369820	Basically, what they're doing is they're trying to, like I said, cut down on illegal gaming
4369820	4373320	cafes because China has a huge problem with MMO addiction.
4373320	4374320	Hello?
4374320	4375320	Yeah, no, no, no.
4375320	4376320	Sorry.
4376320	4381520	I brought up the report and I'm actually trying to read it right now.
4381520	4382520	Let's see.
4382520	4385120	It looks like you're linking us to Kotaku who ran this report.
4385120	4388540	Chinese government cracking down on online gaming, let's see, in a sweep designed to
4388540	4393360	clean up young people's online environment, police in the southern Chinese border city
4393360	4399720	of Shenzhen uncovered 563 illegal Internet cafes, Xinhua said.
4399720	4405020	The crackdown netted 1407 computers while seven people were arrested and nearly 5,000
4405020	4407360	Internet accounts closed.
4407360	4411680	Police in one case discovered 30 computers crammed into a 40 square meter room.
4411680	4412680	Wow.
4412680	4415520	Yeah, that sounds pretty damn wrong.
4415520	4421920	Normally, I'm not forcing limits on Internet time, but damn, it really sounds like China
4421920	4422920	has got a real problem.
4422920	4424920	Well, most of Asia, really.
4424920	4428000	Well, these cafes sound a little bit shady anyway.
4428000	4432440	Even in the U.S., you have to register your business with the government.
4432440	4435460	That's because we want taxes.
4435460	4439120	Something similar could happen here.
4439120	4442960	If the government found a business running illegally that was making all this money under
4442960	4445960	the table, they'd send the IRS after their assets.
4445960	4447960	They go about it a different way.
4447960	4455520	You wouldn't see the SWAT team going in there, but it would be a civil crime.
4455520	4461000	Kind of similar, I don't know, but yeah, it's very interesting that it's become that ramp.
4461000	4464640	Thirty computers crammed into a 40 square meter room, that's not very big.
4464640	4466400	Yeah, I was about to say that.
4466400	4468520	That sounds like people are really crammed in there.
4468520	4471320	That sounds like computers on bunk beds is what that sounds like.
4471320	4474400	I think that's the only way you would be able to fit that in.
4474400	4476400	That's an interesting image right there.
4476400	4477400	For real.
4477400	4480040	That's a very interesting image.
4480040	4482680	That's the image we think of when we think of wild gold farmers.
4482680	4483680	All right, go ahead.
4483680	4484680	Sorry, anyway.
4484680	4496920	There's a supposed interview with an Xbox 360 insider talking about the Xbox 360 failures.
4496920	4497920	Give me a second.
4497920	4498920	I'll pop up another link.
4498920	4503680	I think I heard about this.
4503680	4507420	This is where the guy admitted that Microsoft went the cheap way with heat sinks and this
4507420	4509440	is why they're paying for it, right?
4509440	4513000	Well, I'm posting the link now.
4513000	4521920	It just sounds pretty damn fake, actually, considering he goes straight to the 30%, which
4521920	4526660	is sort of the colloquial thing you hear on the internet all the time.
4526660	4532400	It sort of makes me wonder the legitimacy of it.
4532400	4535680	I don't know if you're reading it now.
4535680	4536820	It's kind of a lengthy article.
4536820	4539360	It's coming from 8-Bit Joystick is the site they ran this.
4539360	4545480	It looks like a story they posted on January 17th, an inside source reveals the truth about
4545480	4549120	the Xbox 360 red ring of death failures.
4549120	4553400	It was an interview conducted via email.
4553400	4559960	That's already a big red flag.
4559960	4565840	I read it beforehand, obviously, and it sounds like either the guy's an actor and they set
4565840	4568040	the whole thing up or the guy has an axe to grind.
4568040	4571320	He was the same guy who was doing the PlayStation 3 stuff right now.
4571320	4572320	Who knows?
4572320	4573320	Yeah, exactly.
4573320	4576880	I mean, it's funny you mention that, because Rama was just talking about that.
4576880	4580400	It could just be muddling on both sides.
4580400	4581400	It's an attempt.
4581400	4582400	It's Reggie.
4582400	4584080	Reggie Fils-Aime is doing it all, apparently.
4584080	4586560	No, I don't know.
4586560	4589360	I think there's a little bit of sensationalism to this.
4589360	4594120	I mean, a little bit, but I think there's, I guess, over-sensationalism in this article,
4594120	4598920	because honestly, if you tell me that the Xbox 360 red rings of death are caused because
4598920	4604740	Microsoft cut corners in the heat sinks in order to save cost, I kind of go, yeah, that's
4604740	4606400	not really news to me.
4606400	4608920	I mean, to be honest.
4608920	4609920	I think most of us...
4609920	4612640	That's been everybody's note about the X-Climbs for some time.
4612640	4617960	So is that really surprising that, okay, it's an after effect of Microsoft cutting corners
4617960	4618960	to save money?
4618960	4619960	Not really.
4619960	4620960	That's no surprise.
4620960	4621960	Does it make it right?
4621960	4625120	I mean, but I think Microsoft's paying the price in having to do this.
4625120	4631040	I think Microsoft's done a wonderful job of trying to correct the issue, really.
4631040	4632200	They made a boo-boo.
4632200	4633200	They're fessing up to it.
4633200	4635080	I don't know why this guy's trying to smear the company.
4635080	4636080	He's got an Instagram.
4636080	4638600	Yeah, it's certainly not as bad as the PS2's DRE issues.
4638600	4640480	I mean, at least Microsoft's helping.
4640480	4641480	I suppose that's true.
4641480	4642480	So, yeah, I don't know.
4642480	4643480	I'm sorry, what?
4643480	4651440	I mean, it is shitty that so many of those machines get the red ring of death, but I
4651440	4656480	guess as long as Microsoft continues to fix them, it's kind of hard to complain too much.
4656480	4660040	And there are some people who still do have working ones, but honestly, you tell me the
4660040	4662240	failure rate is 30%, and I kind of go, that's it?
4662240	4665040	It seems like half the people I know have a broken one.
4665040	4666040	I don't know.
4666040	4667040	I don't know.
4667040	4672440	Well, the problem is with, when you hear about these things, it's only the people who have
4672440	4674560	broken systems that go on the Internet and complain.
4674560	4677560	They're the ones that go on the Internet and say, hey, my system works.
4677560	4678560	Good point.
4678560	4679560	You're right.
4679560	4680560	You're right.
4680560	4683000	People don't complain when things are working.
4683000	4684000	You're right.
4684000	4685000	That's a good point.
4685000	4686000	Yeah.
4686000	4688360	Anyways, I've got one more thing to go.
4688360	4695000	We all see games that are released sort of incomplete, and then they start putting things
4695000	4699560	in for downloadable content that should have been there in the first place.
4699560	4706000	Apparently, and here's one more link, the Devil May Cry 4 is not going to have any downloadable
4706000	4707000	content.
4707000	4714120	Capcom's Hiroyuki Kobayashi said, with Devil May Cry 4, we feel that we've created a game
4714120	4717760	that has a huge amount of content right out of the box without the need to download extra
4717760	4718760	content.
4718760	4723720	I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty damn nice.
4723720	4724720	Yeah.
4724720	4726880	You know what?
4726880	4729280	Nobody says you have to do downloadable content.
4729280	4732520	You know our whole issue, and we haven't gotten into this in a while on the show, and maybe
4732520	4737400	since we have some new people, thanks to Justin TV and whatever other outlets, we should probably
4737400	4744440	take this time to emphasize how much we hate it when people call pay-to-unlock content
4744440	4746020	downloadable content.
4746020	4749600	When you are unlocking something that was already on the disc that you paid for, that
4749600	4755120	should be considered pay-to-unlock content, such as what the Stages and Beautiful Katamari
4755120	4756120	write.
4756120	4757120	Those are pay-to-unlock content.
4757120	4760860	Whereas, when you download the Rock Band songs, that is true downloadable content.
4760860	4763160	You're not unlocking something already on the disc.
4763160	4766240	I think if Capcom is taking a stand going, you know what?
4766240	4767840	This game is too complex.
4767840	4772040	We can't really do any downloadable content, and we're not going to charge for pay-to-unlock
4772040	4773040	content.
4773040	4774040	I say applause.
4774040	4777040	I don't know if there's so much you can do, but I think that just, you know, hello?
4777040	4778720	Yeah, go ahead.
4778720	4786520	I think it's just that this is their game, and personally I applaud them for it, because
4786520	4790880	we do see a lot of people, you know, that they put in these garbage downloadable content,
4790880	4797880	the Hello Horse Armor, and just try to squeeze as much money out of it as possible.
4797880	4801800	It's really refreshing to see a company say, hey, this is our game, and this is what it's
4801800	4802800	going to be.
4802800	4804480	You don't see enough of that nowadays.
4804480	4807200	I applaud them for taking the high ethical road on this one.
4807200	4808200	It's a good one.
4808200	4810880	Ross Dio, we've got to let you go, because we've got to wrap up the show, but thank you
4810880	4811880	so much for calling.
4811880	4812880	We'd love to hear from you.
4812880	4813880	Okay.
4813880	4814880	Have a good one, man.
4814880	4815880	Have a good one, buddy.
4815880	4816880	Take care.
4816880	4817880	Bye-bye.
4817880	4818880	Bye-bye.
4818880	4820480	I like how Ross Dio kind of shared all the stories that we seem to miss otherwise on
4820480	4821480	tonight's program.
4821480	4822480	Kind of interesting.
4822480	4823480	It's really nice of him.
4823480	4824480	It was.
4824480	4825480	Anyway, sorry, guys.
4825480	4826900	I know there were a ton of people still trying to get through, but we are just running along
4826900	4827900	on time tonight.
4827900	4830200	We want to get out of here at a decent hour, so we're going to go ahead and shut off the
4830200	4831920	Skype line for tonight.
4831920	4835600	We'll take more calls next week, though, as always, so please tune in live.
4835600	4839280	Meanwhile, we're going to go around and see if there are any last-minute stories.
4839280	4841000	Dark Sakura, Loki, I have nothing.
4841000	4842000	Do you guys?
4842000	4843000	Nope.
4843000	4844000	Loki?
4844000	4845000	Yeah.
4845000	4846000	Yeah.
4846000	4850580	Actually, I do have some pretty cool stuff, one of which is this game that I just found
4850580	4851880	called Line Golfer.
4851880	4857120	Now, it's like Line Rider, but you make miniature golf courses almost, and it's actually pretty
4857120	4858120	fun.
4858120	4865020	You can find it at, let's see here, this website called candystand.com, and you can check it
4865020	4866020	out there.
4866020	4867020	Wait.
4867020	4868020	Isn't that Lifesavers and stuff?
4868020	4869020	Isn't that their website, Candystand?
4869020	4870020	I don't know.
4870020	4871020	Or am I crazy?
4871020	4872020	I don't know.
4872020	4873020	I forget.
4873020	4874020	Maybe.
4874020	4880320	No, it is wrigleyscandystand.com, the hottest games online, they say.
4880320	4881380	And it's pretty fun.
4881380	4887320	You can create your own courses, and you can upload them and play all these different courses
4887320	4890080	and stuff.
4890080	4891800	Let's see here.
4891800	4895040	Then other stuff that's kind of funny.
4895040	4902680	Apparently, gamegirl.com ran a top seven geek panties for girls.
4902680	4904480	Oh God, I heard about this.
4904480	4906640	How many does Irene own?
4906640	4910400	That's what I want to know.
4910400	4915000	Number seven is the iPhone panties, which I don't know if you can actually put an iPhone
4915000	4916000	on there or not.
4916000	4917840	I don't think so.
4917840	4920760	Number six would be the password protection panties.
4920760	4922800	It says username and password.
4922800	4923800	That's kind of funny.
4923800	4924800	Wow.
4924800	4926140	Bonus stage panties.
4926140	4928380	I agree with the Halo Master in chat.
4928380	4930720	Best radio show ever.
4930720	4934060	Space Invader panties would be number four.
4934060	4937880	Number three is achievement unlocked panties.
4937880	4940560	Number two, classic Nintendo panties.
4940560	4944120	Are these all things people have on their cafe press shops or something?
4944120	4945120	I don't think so.
4945120	4946120	These can't be legitimate.
4946120	4947120	And then Mario panties.
4947120	4948120	Mario panties.
4948120	4949280	Hooray.
4949280	4950280	Other fun stuff.
4950280	4957500	There's a rumor that when Smash Brothers Brawl actually makes it out to the Wii that Super
4957500	4961560	Smash Brothers Brawl will be released on the virtual console as well.
4961560	4962560	Makes sense.
4962560	4964280	So we'll see.
4964280	4967840	I don't really know if there's much to that.
4967840	4976640	Apparently there's a rumor from website gameeater.com or gameeater, whatever, that Hillary Clinton
4976640	4980120	is going to have sort of a cameo in Grand Theft Auto IV.
4980120	4981120	Bullshit.
4981120	4982120	No, hold on, hold on.
4982120	4985760	It's not necessarily Hillary Clinton, but someone that kind of looks like her, kind
4985760	4989880	of like how there's a lawyer that sort of looks like Jack Thompson in the game.
4989880	4997280	Well, there's a prostitute that apparently looks like Hillary.
4997280	4999720	Why would you want that prostitute?
4999720	5001280	That doesn't make sense.
5001280	5004240	Whatever, guys, whatever.
5004240	5009280	Apparently it says Rockstar is going beyond looks after having sex with the player.
5009280	5013400	The prostitute will say something like, will you still vote for me, and after being killed
5013400	5017160	with your last breath, now I'll never get to be president.
5017160	5018160	That's fucked up.
5018160	5019160	That's got to be a lie.
5019160	5020160	That would be funny.
5020160	5023520	That has some stupid kid's idea of the funny.
5023520	5024520	But you know what?
5024520	5028520	Rama in chat at chat.org.trader.com sums up my thoughts perfectly.
5028520	5033200	Do not want.
5033200	5036280	And then, yeah, and then that's pretty much it.
5036280	5037280	That's it?
5037280	5038280	I found something pretty.
5038280	5039280	All right, what's that?
5039280	5044960	Eurogamer, which is one of the places that I like to go through for my UK news, has pictures
5044960	5052280	of the Iron Man game that's going to be coming out, and Sega's doing it, so I'm already happy.
5052280	5055840	Sega plus Marvel equals love, so I'm posting pics in the chat room.
5055840	5056840	All right.
5056840	5061480	It's very, very pretty, even though they're getting the most awful person in the world
5061480	5063440	to play them, but oh well.
5063440	5064440	All right.
5064440	5068840	Well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so we can wrap up this show.
5068840	5072520	Nathan, Irene, Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming to the show.
5072520	5075520	We haven't had guests here in forever, even though you guys didn't talk much, but maybe
5075520	5076520	it's because we have a mic shortage.
5076520	5077520	I don't know.
5077520	5080420	But I hope you enjoyed yourselves nonetheless, and thank you for the pie.
5080420	5081420	That was much appreciated.
5081420	5083560	Do you have any final thoughts, Sir Nathan?
5083560	5084560	No.
5084560	5088400	All right, Rice Princess, any final thoughts?
5088400	5089400	Yes.
5089400	5093140	All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts?
5093140	5096920	My final thought is my second graphics card comes in this week, so we'll have to see what
5096920	5099080	my computer can actually do.
5099080	5100080	Yay.
5100080	5101680	An SLI.
5101680	5106240	My final thought is thank you to all our listeners, as always, for supporting us in chat and now
5106240	5111340	on Justin TV and welcoming us to a new place on the internets, even if it's going to take
5111340	5113040	a couple weeks to work out the bumps.
5113040	5114960	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
5114960	5123940	Well, someone in our chat room said the pie is true.
5123940	5124940	The pie is true.
5124940	5125940	The pie is delicious.
5125940	5128400	That's what it really boils down to.
5128400	5130960	At the end of Orange Lawn's radio, there will be pie.
5130960	5131960	Wow.
5131960	5134000	All right, forget it.
5134000	5138880	All right, thank you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading and supporting independent
5138880	5139880	podcasting.
5139880	5144360	We wouldn't be here without you guys because we have no big magazine supporting us or any
5144360	5149900	big gaming company, so this truly is an independent effort, and we appreciate it.
5149900	5151720	If you like what you hear, it's free.
5151720	5154520	All we ask, tell two people you know about our program.
5154520	5155760	That's how we slowly spread the word.
5155760	5159920	If you absolutely cannot think of anybody to tell, leave us a nice review on iTunes
5159920	5165960	or on one of those other sites such as Yahoo, Digg, whatever, or even if you do tell two
5165960	5167840	people, you can also leave a five-star review.
5167840	5168840	It's okay.
5168840	5171720	I want to thank... We had some new reviews posted this week, so thank you to both people
5171720	5173360	that put those very kind reviews.
5173360	5175080	Really appreciate it.
5175080	5178120	Until next time, I'm Rob Roberts.
5178120	5179120	That's Dark Soccer.
5179120	5201440	This is Loki, and we will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
