00:00.000 --> 00:20.920
Today, November 30th, 2008, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC gets controversial DRM, a 10 year old

00:20.920 --> 00:32.480
game gets a new patch, and could Sackboy soon become a street fighter?

00:32.480 --> 00:35.800
And we're back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, we are that show on

00:35.800 --> 00:41.040
the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.320
My name is Rob Roberts, not joining us tonight sadly is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summer, she is

00:46.320 --> 00:49.560
out tonight, hopefully we'll be back next week.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.720
Also joining us, why am I saying hopefully, she better be back next week or we're going

00:52.720 --> 00:53.800
to be in trouble.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.800
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.800
Hello.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
How you doing, Loki?

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
Good.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.900
And it's just Loki night tonight, which is kind of odd having come off a week of no show,

01:03.900 --> 01:07.800
apologies for there not being a show, and man if you're listening on the podcast you

01:07.800 --> 01:12.400
got double screwed because you had to wait forever for episode 302 to hit the feed, but

01:12.400 --> 01:16.360
I was having some problems getting the file back and forth, and so it really caused a

01:16.360 --> 01:19.960
big delay just with the holiday and everything, but hopefully y'all have just taken some time

01:19.960 --> 01:24.240
away to enjoy the holiday, you know, relax a little bit, and now we really start to get

01:24.240 --> 01:27.500
towards the really effed up part of the year.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
You're grinning like a madman, Loki.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.920
You should tell them how you got injured.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.680
Okay, the reason why there was no show last week, for one, Dark Sakura was out of town,

01:35.680 --> 01:39.920
she was stuck out of town, but usually if one of us is gone, the show will go on.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.360
But then two of us ended up being gone last week because I kind of hurt myself, and it's

01:43.360 --> 01:48.160
really stupid, but my roommate decided to put on his own version of The Amazing Race.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.160
You know that show on TV?

01:49.160 --> 01:50.160
Yeah.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.160
Yeah, you know, it's on the same time, I think, as we do our show, so I shouldn't be encouraging

01:53.160 --> 01:57.680
people to watch it, but we TiVo it, so you know, it's a lot of fun, it's a good show.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.840
He did a local version here in Sacramento, and I signed up to do this like, you know,

02:01.840 --> 02:05.440
months ago before I had had my surgery, and I just kind of thought, you know, after talking

02:05.440 --> 02:08.760
to the doctor, he said I'd be okay to resume all physical activity after two weeks.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.400
Well, I think I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much because, you know, when

02:13.400 --> 02:17.900
we were doing this race, we were running, I mean, everybody that was racing was really

02:17.900 --> 02:21.000
into it, and it was a lot of fun, my roommate did an awesome job with the whole thing, I

02:21.000 --> 02:23.800
gotta say, it was very, you should have done it low-key, except you probably wouldn't have

02:23.800 --> 02:28.360
been able to do it because you would have been...

02:28.360 --> 02:29.360
Like me, after...

02:29.360 --> 02:33.180
No, I don't get out of breath, my legs get sore before I get out of breath.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.000
That's what ultimately happened to me, is that actually I started getting sore in the

02:37.000 --> 02:40.680
area where I had my surgery and I had to come home and take, like, painkillers, it was so

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
bad.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.520
So I ended up passing out pretty much during the time we had the show, so...

02:44.520 --> 02:47.920
A little embarrassing, yeah, but, you know, we've all done dumb shit that sometimes takes

02:47.920 --> 02:50.720
us out of, you know, our other commitments, so...

02:50.720 --> 02:56.480
Yeah, last week I went and played Airsoft, and I got, I think, poison oak, but I don't

02:56.480 --> 02:57.480
know if it's poison oak.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.480
It doesn't itch, so that's...

02:58.480 --> 03:00.920
God, I hope you didn't bring that in this house.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.400
Luckily, I think I'm immune, I've never had it, but I don't want it now.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.680
I don't, I've never had it either, so I don't know if it's poison oak, it's just, it looks

03:07.680 --> 03:13.560
like a rash on my arm, where I was crawling through, like, brush and grass and stuff like

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
that, so...

03:14.560 --> 03:18.280
Who knows, you know, what it is, but, you know, I just made a rash and it doesn't really

03:18.280 --> 03:19.520
itch, so...

03:19.520 --> 03:24.440
I thought poison oak is really itchy and spreads like crazy, but...

03:24.440 --> 03:25.440
I don't know, whatever.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.440
It was fun, though.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.760
We shot each other with guns.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.120
Hey, shooting each other is always fun, so...

03:30.120 --> 03:33.580
It was, you know what's interesting is what I ended up doing last week instead of the

03:33.580 --> 03:37.880
show is I was kind of, like, waking up in the night, I actually was using the Xbox 360

03:37.880 --> 03:41.760
to kind of check out Netflix, you know, and all the streaming movies, and one thing I

03:41.760 --> 03:47.800
am loving, obscure-ass documentaries that you can only find on Netflix.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.800
Seriously, I watched a couple of them, I watched, get this, there was a documentary I watched

03:52.800 --> 03:59.440
on Netflix about strippers that, they were these girls that turned to stripping to make

03:59.440 --> 04:01.560
ends meet after Hurricane Katrina.

04:01.560 --> 04:08.160
And the movie was called, I know, the movie was called Hurricane Strip was the name of

04:08.160 --> 04:13.160
the movie, and I'm like, I have to watch this, how obscure is that, seriously, right?

04:13.160 --> 04:18.400
But here's the thing, the movie itself kind of was dumb, because on one hand you had a

04:18.400 --> 04:23.600
documentary about Hurricane Katrina, and then, you know, which was very powerful to see that

04:23.600 --> 04:29.200
imagery and impactful, you know, it was obviously a terrible tragedy that happened, you know,

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
years ago when it happened.

04:30.200 --> 04:36.400
But then on the other hand, you had this documentary about strippers, and like, why do women want

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
to strip?

04:37.400 --> 04:40.520
Well, for money and attention, you know, okay, we could have told you that.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.720
It really never, for me, it never tied it into why did they feel the need to do it because

04:44.720 --> 04:48.060
of Hurricane Katrina or anything like that, like, it felt like I was watching two completely

04:48.060 --> 04:49.060
different movies.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.060
In a blender.

04:50.060 --> 04:53.680
They probably started out making a documentary about strippers and it was just too, whatever,

04:53.680 --> 04:57.840
and then all of a sudden Hurricane Katrina happened, they're like, hey, there we go,

04:57.840 --> 05:02.480
that's how we can tie this into it, and people are interested in Hurricane Katrina, so they

05:02.480 --> 05:04.040
will watch our crappy movie.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.840
Or it will end up free on Netflix someday, you know, who knows?

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
It was not good.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.000
Like seriously, don't waste your time with it.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.960
I know it's like, you're like, hey, strippers, or hey, interesting documentary on Hurricane

05:15.960 --> 05:19.800
Katrina, but I'm sure there are plenty of more informative documentaries on Hurricane

05:19.800 --> 05:25.360
Katrina that are much more powerful than this, which was kind of garbage, it was just garbage.

05:25.360 --> 05:30.100
But there's some other good stuff out there that is worth watching, but maybe if I ever

05:30.100 --> 05:33.240
have a Netflix review show, I'll talk about that someday.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.680
But for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.840
We can review some of the games we've been playing this week, and I definitely have one

05:37.840 --> 05:38.840
I want to talk about.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.320
I don't know about you, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:42.320 --> 05:46.040
I really only played scenes for a two, I mean, I've been playing a lot of scenes for a two,

05:46.040 --> 05:49.300
I'm done with it, I'm almost 100% complete with the game.

05:49.300 --> 05:53.480
By the way, he's not lying, like every time I've logged on to Netflix this week to watch

05:53.480 --> 05:58.920
something, I see Loki and his little avatar there in Saints Row 2, which, by the way,

05:58.920 --> 06:01.560
we haven't talked really, because we weren't here last week, we haven't gotten to talk

06:01.560 --> 06:05.240
a lot about NXT, the new Xbox experience, I don't know what your thoughts are on it,

06:05.240 --> 06:08.880
I guess I've already talked about Netflix and how much I love that, that's an awesome

06:08.880 --> 06:11.100
addition, but what are you thinking about NXT?

06:11.100 --> 06:17.000
There's some things I like, the avatars are kind of neat.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.720
I don't like the new friends list on there, I think it's too hard to find what people

06:22.720 --> 06:26.560
are playing, it takes me forever to scroll through that list, whereas, you know, I can

06:26.560 --> 06:31.200
just hit the guide button again and just pull up my friends list and it just has a drop

06:31.200 --> 06:35.200
down on what people are playing, so I can look at it at a glance real quick.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.880
I do like the community games, those are pretty fun.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.080
I kind of like the new shop, how they have it set up with where you can see screenshots

06:46.080 --> 06:52.680
and box art and stuff like that for the games, that's kind of neat.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.520
It does seem to be a little harder just to browse stuff sometimes, but I'm just getting

06:58.520 --> 07:00.520
used to it.

07:00.520 --> 07:06.880
That's kind of my thoughts on it, I really love the new features, the avatars are cute,

07:06.880 --> 07:13.240
Netflix is awesome, community games are awesome, so I appreciate that Microsoft tried to modernize

07:13.240 --> 07:16.480
everything, which sounds weird because not only is the Xbox an old system, but they're

07:16.480 --> 07:21.080
basically trying to put some of these new stuff in an all new package, but I'm not sure

07:21.080 --> 07:24.720
I like the navigation, I think it is kind of a hard thing to navigate, especially compared

07:24.720 --> 07:29.580
to the old one, it's kind of hard to find some things in there, which I don't like.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.360
And I don't know about you, I was kind of expecting a little more out of that whole

07:33.360 --> 07:38.320
party system, like I actually thought it was going to be like you would actually have rooms

07:38.320 --> 07:42.140
that you would actually be walking the avatars around, like I don't know why I got this impression,

07:42.140 --> 07:45.060
so maybe I was just setting myself up for disappointment, but I didn't think it would

07:45.060 --> 07:48.560
just be, oh, when I'm looking at the friends list, I'll just see all the people they're

07:48.560 --> 07:50.160
playing with's avatars too.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
That's true, yeah.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
It'll come out later, who knows.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.400
Well, that's true, it may, and it sounds like they've kind of built on the back end a chance

07:56.400 --> 08:00.040
to be expansive, and some of these things like the photo party, you know, as silly as

08:00.040 --> 08:03.800
that application is, it does show you that it's very easy for them to push out these

08:03.800 --> 08:06.800
new features that you can just download and use.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.800
I don't like the-

08:07.800 --> 08:11.760
So there's a lot of problems, I can't say it's a negative thing, you know, NXC overall

08:11.760 --> 08:16.580
is a positive thing, I just think some things are a little more difficult when they don't

08:16.580 --> 08:17.580
need to be.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.120
I don't like all the advertisements on there, like for example, when you first bring it

08:20.120 --> 08:24.440
up it's like the what's going on in the Xbox and stuff like that, and they have all this

08:24.440 --> 08:28.160
crap that I gotta scroll through, it's just, you know, that's kind of annoying, I wish

08:28.160 --> 08:29.160
I could take that away.

08:29.160 --> 08:35.600
I love the little intro video when you first install it, that's pretty awesome.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
I don't know.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.560
Don't you think gold users shouldn't have to see as many of those ads?

08:39.560 --> 08:44.680
You know, I understand, some of them are for, you know, like their little inside Xbox videos

08:44.680 --> 08:49.160
and things, I don't mind it, because it's free stuff, you know, I know.

08:49.160 --> 08:55.520
It's just, it's, at least it's not, you know, Flash here, you know, your IQ is smarter than

08:55.520 --> 08:59.000
Sarah Palin and all the stuff you see on the internet, at least it's not that bad, you

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
know what I mean?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's just small gripes.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.680
Now going to the community games, I did play, I tried to play everything on there, or at

09:06.680 --> 09:07.920
least a lot of it.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.080
Geez, it's taken you a while.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.360
Well, I haven't gotten to play everything, a lot of it, you know, I downloaded and I

09:14.360 --> 09:19.660
looked at it again, I'm like, ehhh, I don't want that, you know, I'm just deleting that.

09:19.660 --> 09:24.480
But I ended up buying a couple of them, I bought a weapon of choice, which is awesome,

09:24.480 --> 09:29.780
it's kind of like a Contra type game, which is really weird weapons and weird characters

09:29.780 --> 09:32.200
and enemies and stuff that you fight.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.520
So that's kind of neat, it's kind of quirky.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.960
And then the other one, I don't know why I bought it, but it was kind of fun was, I think

09:39.960 --> 09:45.200
it was like sign surfing, and that was kind of cool.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.480
It's just really simple, just a little fun, like, mess around game, which is kind of neat.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.280
The word puzzle one, I kind of thought about buying that, but I haven't gotten a chance

09:54.280 --> 09:59.280
to yet, and then I just go on there every, you know, every time I'm on there, usually

09:59.280 --> 10:02.320
if I'm on there for an extended period of time, I'll look to see the new ones that have

10:02.320 --> 10:05.540
come up and stuff like that.

10:05.540 --> 10:12.320
As I was complaining before on when we were talking to Bobby, some of the graphics, it

10:12.320 --> 10:17.720
looks really unpolished, just a lot of it looks like the games aren't done and they're

10:17.720 --> 10:21.520
just putting them up to see if they can make any money off of them.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.800
I don't know, it's just really bad.

10:23.800 --> 10:29.080
Even some of these independent developers and stuff, like some of the Japanese ones,

10:29.080 --> 10:33.800
like we were talking about in Warning Forever, just really simple freeware games that are

10:33.800 --> 10:37.720
pretty popular out there, they have the polish and the graphics on there, it's just, if these

10:37.720 --> 10:41.520
people took a little bit more time on their games, I think they'd be a little bit better,

10:41.520 --> 10:47.880
but for some reason, it just looks really bad, just even, I don't know, the textures

10:47.880 --> 10:51.480
are bad for like the 90s type stuff.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.240
I don't know, it's just not the same polish that you would see in like a shareware game

10:54.240 --> 10:56.960
or something like that.

10:56.960 --> 11:02.800
Now other than that, like I said, Saints Row 2, playing through that, just getting to the

11:02.800 --> 11:09.280
point now where I'm just doing the 100% stuff so I can finish the entire game.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.760
Playing Grand Theft Auto 4 now because everyone got hooked on that because they thought for

11:12.760 --> 11:19.040
some reason that they can't beat me in Saints Row 2, so let's try Grand Theft Auto 4 and

11:19.040 --> 11:21.700
I'm starting a new run on that, so that's kind of cool.

11:21.700 --> 11:28.600
We did an hour long marathon during the week last week and I ended up winning that, that

11:28.600 --> 11:30.480
was kind of fun.

11:30.480 --> 11:37.080
And the other games have been, not really playing, but I've watched a lot of my wife

11:37.080 --> 11:41.120
playing Animal Crossing, haven't gotten, you see, because every time she's done playing

11:41.120 --> 11:44.400
it, she's already done everything in the town, it's like, well shit, I can't go play the

11:44.400 --> 11:49.040
game now because you've already shaken all the trees, dug up everything, you know, fished

11:49.040 --> 11:53.680
the rivers clean or whatever, it's just, I don't know, I played it actually the other

11:53.680 --> 11:59.800
day during the Harvest Festival thing and did the Harvest Furniture which, sad to find

11:59.800 --> 12:07.240
out it's all girly crap, so I ended up selling all of it, but I don't know, that game is

12:07.240 --> 12:14.200
very sad, it's just, it's very sad because they didn't do anything to it and they in

12:14.200 --> 12:18.720
fact actually took things out of like, say if you played the original GameCube one, you'll

12:18.720 --> 12:22.160
know that they have like a fountain and stuff like that, well now you have to buy those

12:22.160 --> 12:27.700
things and I think that was the way it was in Wild World, I can't remember, but it's

12:27.700 --> 12:31.980
still sad that they took stuff out and they made stuff simpler and there's no reason for

12:31.980 --> 12:37.760
it, it's not, I don't know, they could have added so much to this and it would have been

12:37.760 --> 12:42.700
very little effort on their part, but once again, they don't want to put the effort in

12:42.700 --> 12:49.760
if they don't think that it needs to be done for the, you know, mom and pops that are buying,

12:49.760 --> 12:51.360
you know, the Wii for Wii Sports.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.200
Have you seen the commercials for Animal Crossing?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.200
Yes I have.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
Oh my god.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
Yes I have.

12:56.200 --> 13:02.080
I swear to god it makes me feel like I'm playing a chick game, it's just seriously, not that

13:02.080 --> 13:07.840
there's anything wrong with that, it's just, it makes the game so damn casual, as if you

13:07.840 --> 13:12.720
needed to be told that it was a casual game, it's just like, I laugh every time I see the

13:12.720 --> 13:17.640
commercial, oh I hear there's a new boutique in town, god you're stupid, I mean, are you

13:17.640 --> 13:22.080
excited about a store in a fictional city in a game?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
I mean come on.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.960
You know, I can appreciate what Nintendo's trying to do, I mean even though they have

13:26.960 --> 13:31.360
gotten pigeonholed as the casual game company and the, you know, the one that's catering

13:31.360 --> 13:36.940
to women, and rightfully so, let's face it, they're selling like crazy, and if it helps

13:36.940 --> 13:42.020
enable more people that usually wouldn't play games to play games, I'm okay with it, I'm

13:42.020 --> 13:45.520
okay with Nintendo reaching out to a different audience as gay as it might make you feel.

13:45.520 --> 13:53.720
Okay, well here's the thing though, is their games, as of after Mario Kart basically that's

13:53.720 --> 13:59.740
come out, all the games that have been released by Nintendo haven't sold very well, and it's

13:59.740 --> 14:05.240
been going downhill fast, especially the fourth quarter stuff, Wario Land Shake It surprisingly

14:05.240 --> 14:10.920
didn't sell very well, Wii Music, well we don't even need to go there, and Animal Crossing

14:10.920 --> 14:16.800
surprisingly not that big of a seller, it's just people realize that they haven't changed

14:16.800 --> 14:20.000
anything, and the people that don't realize it are the people that probably aren't going

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
to buy it anyways.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.040
What about the overall picture, because the pool's getting pretty diluted out there when

14:24.040 --> 14:27.620
you look at all the third party titles, I mean is it just because people that would

14:27.620 --> 14:32.280
have bought Animal Crossing are instead tempted by these cheaper budget games that are shovelware?

14:32.280 --> 14:35.800
I don't think so, because there's nothing really competing with those genres of games,

14:35.800 --> 14:39.680
like Wario Land Shake It doesn't really have any good side-scrolling platformers that are

14:39.680 --> 14:44.040
competing with it, Wii Music, maybe Guitar Hero would have competed with it, but I think

14:44.040 --> 14:47.880
Wii Music was bad to begin with, and Animal Crossing really the only thing that kind of

14:47.880 --> 14:52.360
compares to it that came out around the same time is My Sims Kingdom, which sold even worse

14:52.360 --> 14:58.160
than Animal Crossing, so I don't think, I think it'll do pretty well, but right now

14:58.160 --> 15:04.240
they haven't given us any hope to like, there's nothing really different, that's the problem,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.920
it's like, oh my god, and then the next-

15:06.920 --> 15:10.800
Okay, I gotta read some comments from chat here, chat.orangelandtrudy.com, of course

15:10.800 --> 15:14.360
always our other guest here on the program, the fourth guest, or tonight, they've been

15:14.360 --> 15:19.560
promoted to third guest, because Dark Soccer is not here tonight, Game Guru says, how do

15:19.560 --> 15:23.360
we know City Folk isn't selling well, we don't have an MPD, but you have a little, kind of

15:23.360 --> 15:24.360
an insider perspective on it.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.240
Well, I just, from what I've seen, and it could be selling very well, but from what

15:27.240 --> 15:28.240
I've seen-

15:28.240 --> 15:29.680
On a grander scale, but from what you are seeing, it is not.

15:29.680 --> 15:35.440
I mean, we're selling out, but it's just not, there wasn't that many to begin with to sell

15:35.440 --> 15:38.560
out from, we didn't, you know, buy it that heavy.

15:38.560 --> 15:44.480
Okay, let's see, looking at Biohaze20 said, wasn't Rob anti-Nintendo, or am I missing

15:44.480 --> 15:45.480
something here?

15:45.480 --> 15:49.760
No, I'm not anti-Nintendo, just like I was never anti-Sony when I was mad at the PlayStation

15:49.760 --> 15:55.960
3, and that was getting the bane of everything I had negative to say, you know, it's just

15:55.960 --> 16:00.360
that I think Nintendo's made a lot of very disappointing decisions in the past two years,

16:00.360 --> 16:04.920
and a lot of that has affected the hardcore gamers like you and me, and you know, and

16:04.920 --> 16:08.960
it just kind of goes right into what Acidic Vampire says in chat, Nintendo is reaching

16:08.960 --> 16:15.000
out to other people and neglecting the hardcore gamers frown, and that's kind of my issue.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
And the whole thing-

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Right there.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.200
Yeah, and my thing was too, is before with the GameCube, when they were done with the

16:20.200 --> 16:23.360
GameCube and they're developing the Wii and they're promoting the Wii, it's like, listen,

16:23.360 --> 16:27.560
the Wii is for everybody, the Wii system is not, we're not going to be pigeonholed in

16:27.560 --> 16:32.740
being, you know, known as a company that puts out games only for like children, we are trying

16:32.740 --> 16:37.000
to appeal to everybody, but they're not, they're just doing the same thing that they've been

16:37.000 --> 16:40.420
doing before, they're just complaining that everyone sees them as a company that puts

16:40.420 --> 16:46.400
out, you know, games for like, you know, too many family games and too many just casual

16:46.400 --> 16:49.680
games, and well, complain all you want, but that's what you're doing.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.800
And here's the other thing too, I can respect what Nintendo does from a business perspective,

16:53.800 --> 16:56.840
which is what I'm kind of saying with these commercials and things, it's like, you know,

16:56.840 --> 17:00.660
as a business move, it's a smart idea and it's something new, but at the same time on

17:00.660 --> 17:05.400
a personal level, I can still kind of go, but it sucks, you know, because for me personally,

17:05.400 --> 17:11.960
the selfish gamer in me wants something else, you know, wants the Wii to have been HD capable

17:11.960 --> 17:16.880
in the first place and, you know, and so on and so on, you know, from that perspective.

17:16.880 --> 17:23.720
And also I kind of think that, you know, hardcore gamers kind of push the Wii to be so in demand

17:23.720 --> 17:27.960
in the first place and Nintendo's going to need them if they, you know, launch another

17:27.960 --> 17:31.240
system or an upgraded version of the Wii, which is kind of my fear is what's going to

17:31.240 --> 17:34.600
happen is that we're going to see the next system that comes out of Nintendo is going

17:34.600 --> 17:40.200
to be, and it could be as soon as next year, maybe 2010, I would say no later than 2010,

17:40.200 --> 17:44.360
you're going to see it Wii HD or something where now they're going to start catering

17:44.360 --> 17:48.240
into all those features, you know, but their big selling point is going to be, but it's

17:48.240 --> 17:53.080
also a Wii, just like the Wii was also a GameCube, you know what I mean?

17:53.080 --> 17:57.840
So you know, I think to get that support, they're going to need to win us hardcore gamers

17:57.840 --> 18:04.240
back and the more you push us away and the more that Xbox and even now Sony starts to

18:04.240 --> 18:07.080
woo us over, which who would have thought that would have happened a few years ago that

18:07.080 --> 18:11.360
we'd be talking so great about Sony, but whereas Nintendo has been making a lot of disappointing

18:11.360 --> 18:18.720
decisions this year, Sony has been making a lot of, I can't say great decisions, but

18:18.720 --> 18:23.340
satisfying decisions, let's put it that way, you know, they're, we're content with Sony

18:23.340 --> 18:24.340
right now.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.340
Let me just put it this way.

18:25.340 --> 18:29.600
They're coming out for the first two months of 2009 from Nintendo and it's sad.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.800
I mean, it's sad if you own a Wii, let me put it that way.

18:33.800 --> 18:39.160
If you own a DS, you might not be so disappointed, but seriously, this is the trend that they're

18:39.160 --> 18:43.080
doing now is let's start remaking GameCube games.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.760
Can you put any less effort into that?

18:44.760 --> 18:52.000
I mean seriously, what we got, but play for Wii Mario Tennis and play for Wii Pikmin is

18:52.000 --> 18:56.880
the first two games of next year for the Wii.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.880
I mean, woo!

18:57.880 --> 18:58.880
With Pikmin!

18:58.880 --> 18:59.880
Oh, awesome!

18:59.880 --> 19:00.880
It's Pikmin all over again.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.280
Well, we're going to get to a story later tonight about that there's something, a surprise

19:04.280 --> 19:06.820
cooking over at Nintendo, one of their developers.

19:06.820 --> 19:13.080
Is it possible that Nintendo is setting the stage to really knock our socks off next E3?

19:13.080 --> 19:15.560
They better.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.760
That's all I'm saying.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.480
I have a feeling next E3 it's going to be about the DSi.

19:21.480 --> 19:29.080
And I hope that they do something good because, man, my bar for them is set so low right now,

19:29.080 --> 19:37.040
it's like there's very little, maybe a new Zelda game, or F-Zero or something.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.440
Or that Kid Icarus game that's been rumored for a long, long time.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.440
Yeah, that'll never happen.

19:40.440 --> 19:44.200
Well, I'm just saying, you want to win me back, here's some ways.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
And they've got to be good.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.380
It can't be shovelware.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.600
You shovelware Kid Icarus, I'm going to be pissed, I'm going to be twice as pissed as

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
I was before.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.600
You've got to make it good.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
Well, anyway.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.040
Just stop being so stingy is what they need to do.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.280
Game Guru says the thing is that the core gamer and the third party's abandoned Nintendo.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.600
Yeah, we're going to get to another story later tonight about how some of these companies

20:05.600 --> 20:09.080
are now starting to say, look, Louise is not capable of doing what we wanted to do, so

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
bye.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.080
Yeah, but the core gamer's finicky, okay?

20:11.080 --> 20:14.440
If they come out with a really kick-ass game, they're going to come right back, okay?

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
So it doesn't matter.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.440
That's a damn good point.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.760
The core gamers are extremely finicky.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.520
I mean, God, this even ties into something else that kind of came up while we were gone.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
We've kind of missed a lot.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.320
It was a pretty busy time of the year.

20:26.320 --> 20:35.660
But there was this whole interview and look into as to why do game blogs and even podcasters

20:35.660 --> 20:40.480
like us and so on find the need to nitpick the negative in every single game out there.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.480
And I think it's centered around Mirror's Edge and how Mirror's Edge is really getting

20:44.480 --> 20:48.400
these reviews that are just all over the map.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.520
Some people are giving it, oh my God, best game ever, et cetera, et cetera.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.960
And some people are saying, and just really nitpicking the shit out of the game.

20:55.960 --> 21:01.360
You know, are people doing it just to be negative on something?

21:01.360 --> 21:04.240
They're not fucking Power Trip is what they are.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.920
They're getting treated like royalty, getting promo shit sent to them.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.120
They're getting basically blown by these game companies.

21:10.120 --> 21:15.120
And then they're just like, oh, well, this game isn't as good as buh buh buh buh buh,

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
you know?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.320
And this is why I'm going to nitp- meh meh meh meh meh.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.520
You know, just like I'm playing about little shit, and that's probably because they're-

21:21.520 --> 21:24.200
You know, this is so ironic coming from you.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.560
But you know what, though?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.320
I find fun in different things.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.960
I mean, like Earth Defense Force, perfect example, that game is absolute shit.

21:30.960 --> 21:37.520
If you were to look at it, like, by, you know, graphics, AI, everything is goddamn retarded

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
in that game.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.520
But it's fun.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.120
And that's the whole point is that's really all that counts is if the game is fun.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.720
Who gives a crap if it's ugly?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.720
It's fun.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
That's the whole point.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.960
You just were sitting here dogging on the community games for having crappy graphics.

21:50.960 --> 21:51.960
Exactly.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.960
But they aren't fun either.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
Okay.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
All right, then.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.960
All right, fine.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.280
And seriously, though, I mean, there are lines that, you know, can be crossed, you know,

22:00.280 --> 22:04.520
where it's like, okay, yeah, it might be fun, but seriously, man, that looks awful.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.520
Just, I don't know.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.840
All right.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.080
Any other games you've been playing this week?

22:09.080 --> 22:12.440
We've kind of gone on all these tangents, but it's been fine.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.120
Any other games you've been playing this week?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
No.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.480
I've been using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player quite a bit.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.200
Katung Pupan is pretty awesome.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.200
Sweet.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.720
Mamma Mia is coming out pretty soon.

22:25.720 --> 22:32.600
Dark Knight and Sing Star Abba on PlayStation 3 is this week, isn't it?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.000
Yeah, I believe it is.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.200
Oh, I'm excited.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.880
Well, I, was it, I, someone had mentioned, like, I have pre-ordered right now one of

22:40.880 --> 22:45.600
the limited editions of Dark Knight with the stupid Batpod thing because I want a piece

22:45.600 --> 22:50.440
of crap for my desk, you know, like, running out of cool things to put on it.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.640
So we'll see if I actually buy that, but, I don't know.

22:53.640 --> 22:57.400
All right, games I've been playing this week, pretty much, you know, same old stuff.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.760
I was talking about Netflix.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.120
I did dive into community games.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
I picked up Snake 360.

23:01.120 --> 23:05.480
You know, we had Aaron on last week, who was the, really the dude behind Snake 360, and,

23:05.480 --> 23:08.160
you know, I had a good time with Snake 360.

23:08.160 --> 23:13.380
I really like that Aaron has pushed the limits of everything that you can kind of possibly

23:13.380 --> 23:16.920
do within the confines of what community games lets you do.

23:16.920 --> 23:20.680
Like, you know, he just has all these different modes, all these different maps.

23:20.680 --> 23:26.680
You know, when you take a really basic game, you know, Snake is not the most complicated

23:26.680 --> 23:27.680
game.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.980
You know, it's basically an evolved Atari 2600 game, right?

23:30.980 --> 23:35.200
Surround evolved into the cell phone snake game evolved into what we have here now, Snake

23:35.200 --> 23:39.600
360, right, with some, with Tron Light Cycles mixed in there somewhere.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.480
You know, he's really kind of done a lot that you can do with this game when it comes to

23:43.480 --> 23:47.680
having the multiplayer, having the timed mode, having the, you know, pick up a certain number

23:47.680 --> 23:50.520
of pods in a level mode, having the different mazes.

23:50.520 --> 23:56.020
And I think the soundtrack, it was really smart of him to pair up with, you know, Kyle

23:56.020 --> 24:01.200
Ward and his company and have the music, because it adds a certain uniqueness to the game,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.100
which is kind of cool.

24:03.100 --> 24:08.440
The only drawbacks to Snake 360 are out of this guy's control.

24:08.440 --> 24:12.640
The biggest problems I have with the game is that when I'm playing these multiplayer

24:12.640 --> 24:15.560
modes, I'm kind of like, this would be so much more fun if I could play it on Xbox Live

24:15.560 --> 24:18.760
with people across, you know, the nation.

24:18.760 --> 24:23.960
But I realize at the same time, that's something that Microsoft just plain won't let him do.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.180
But I worry for community games as a whole, because I think there's going to be a lot

24:27.180 --> 24:30.140
of people that don't know so much about, you know, well, community games have all these

24:30.140 --> 24:31.520
restrictions to them.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.240
And like, he can't do online leaderboards, because Microsoft won't let them.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.560
But you know, he's found a lot of very creative workarounds, I'll give him that.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.560
Instead of achievements, he has goals, and the goals will unlock things.

24:43.560 --> 24:48.440
Instead of the leaderboards, he has the online leaderboards where you go and put in the codes.

24:48.440 --> 24:53.320
Instead of, you know, he's done some very creative workarounds, especially when he considered

24:53.320 --> 24:58.360
this is for all intents and purposes a launch title for community games.

24:58.360 --> 25:02.340
So it's definitely worth your $5 if you're a fan of like 80s arcade games that were very

25:02.340 --> 25:03.640
basic and to the point.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.580
I think you'll find that this is pretty extensive.

25:05.580 --> 25:10.100
But if you think a game like Snake is going to bore you, like, you know, you don't play

25:10.100 --> 25:14.840
it for more than 5 seconds on the cell phone, or you have a very short attention span, there's

25:14.840 --> 25:17.400
not going to be a lot here for you, I don't think.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.600
I think you probably won't enjoy the game.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.440
But I think as a local multiplayer, especially, it's a lot of fun.

25:23.440 --> 25:28.160
I crave it to be on Xbox Live, and I'm kind of disappointed Microsoft won't let some of

25:28.160 --> 25:29.680
these games go to the next level.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.680
I hope they will.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.720
I hope some of these really good, you know, impressing community games, such as, you know,

25:35.720 --> 25:37.160
Weapon of Choice I think is doing very well.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.480
You mentioned it earlier, Bobby had the dude on his show tonight from Weapon of Choice.

25:41.480 --> 25:46.080
Maybe some of these guys will get to upgrade if they want to a full on game.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.440
I don't know, we'll see.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.760
But it's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of like old school 80s games,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.360
like, you know, arcade games.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.020
It's fun.

25:56.020 --> 25:59.320
Not worth your time whatsoever, I'm sorry, I know I'm going to piss a lot of people off

25:59.320 --> 26:00.320
with this.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.080
Another Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix is poop.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.520
I didn't like it one bit.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.760
I checked it out on PlayStation Network when it came out.

26:07.760 --> 26:11.360
My friend actually bought it, so I did get to take a look at the full version.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.840
I didn't even look at the demo first.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.240
I didn't realize that the Xbox 360 demo was as handicapped as it was.

26:16.240 --> 26:19.560
I actually kind of did most of my play on this game on PlayStation Network, and I'll

26:19.560 --> 26:21.120
tell you what.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.320
It's the same game you've had already, and I know you already know this about Street

26:25.320 --> 26:29.800
Fighter II, but to me it's a little bit insulting that, you know, they would charge $10 for

26:29.800 --> 26:34.100
that first game and then come around a year later and charge $10 for essentially the same

26:34.100 --> 26:35.200
game.

26:35.200 --> 26:41.260
You have an additional $5 or whatever you want to say for this game, and yes, I realize

26:41.260 --> 26:46.620
Street Fighter II is a classic, but at the same time, there's only so much you can do

26:46.620 --> 26:51.920
with it, and I think Street Fighter IV is more of what, in my opinion, a redone Street

26:51.920 --> 26:54.480
Fighter II ought to be, is Street Fighter IV.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.480
Here's the thing.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.560
What do you get in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix that you didn't have before?

26:59.560 --> 27:06.400
It's the same game with four new characters, of which, you know, give or take, in my opinion.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.480
I guess I like Fei Long, but I don't know.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.880
They're kind of give or take.

27:09.880 --> 27:15.280
It isn't worth the $5 to me, or so there's that, and then there's the new graphics and

27:15.280 --> 27:16.280
the new sound.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.560
And the rebalancing.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.880
I'm going to say something here.

27:18.880 --> 27:23.160
Well, the rebalancing for a casual fighter person like me is irrelevant.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.400
The graphics aren't bad.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.400
I'll give it that.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.140
The HD is pretty cool.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.320
The sprites are done fairly well.

27:29.320 --> 27:35.600
Although, it's not a smooth game, because you still have very, you know, but I understand

27:35.600 --> 27:38.840
you can't do that without breaking the original mechanics of Street Fighter, but don't expect

27:38.840 --> 27:42.320
that the game is necessarily going to run smoother or look that much smoother, because,

27:42.320 --> 27:45.700
you know, the sprites are just prettier, and that's about it, okay?

27:45.700 --> 27:50.640
And I'm being corrected by chat, because five new characters when you count, Akuma, but

27:50.640 --> 27:51.640
whatever.

27:51.640 --> 27:52.640
But here's the thing, okay?

27:52.640 --> 27:55.700
Now I'm going to make a statement that's really not going to make me popular, but the other

27:55.700 --> 28:02.880
thing that, you know, you have besides the new graphics is the new sound, and the soundtrack

28:02.880 --> 28:03.880
sucks.

28:03.880 --> 28:10.840
Like, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate what they tried to do with Street Fighter

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
2.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.640
I appreciate that they tried to go to the indie community and this OC remix thing, and

28:15.640 --> 28:20.240
they actually got people to remix the songs, but for me, they don't work.

28:20.240 --> 28:24.640
They don't match the mood of the original songs at all, and I could tell this from the

28:24.640 --> 28:26.480
minute the character select screen came up.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.400
I was like, what did they do to the character select music?

28:29.400 --> 28:32.000
This is awful!

28:32.000 --> 28:35.480
So sorry, I know that statement's probably not going to make me popular amongst fans

28:35.480 --> 28:40.280
of the OC remix circuit, and it's not to say that website hasn't done a lot of great things

28:40.280 --> 28:46.640
in the past, but I think it's left best these tracks that made it into this game as remix,

28:46.640 --> 28:51.000
and I realize it's a whole play on that word, remix, and da-da-da-da-da, but it didn't work

28:51.000 --> 28:55.800
in the game at all for me, and sound to me is very, very important in the game and the

28:55.800 --> 29:01.040
music, and if you're going to try and rate me for $15 more based on nostalgia, I want

29:01.040 --> 29:03.480
my tunes to have some sense of nostalgia.

29:03.480 --> 29:10.600
Yes, I realize I can revert to classic mode, but again, what are you trying to sell me?

29:10.600 --> 29:14.040
If you just wanted to sell me the classic songs, you already sold that to me a year

29:14.040 --> 29:15.040
ago!

29:15.040 --> 29:20.440
So, I expect that these remixes are going to have some type of, maybe I'm just bothered

29:20.440 --> 29:25.120
because I've heard remixes of these songs before that were more true to the originals,

29:25.120 --> 29:29.240
and that were better for me, but I did not like the soundtrack at all, you know?

29:29.240 --> 29:35.240
Call me names, tell me I'm hatin' if you want, but in this particular circumstance, I did

29:35.240 --> 29:37.080
not like the music, I'm sorry.

29:37.080 --> 29:41.080
I'm not a real big fan of Street Fighter II anyway, so I didn't even look at it.

29:41.080 --> 29:46.760
I was just like, eh, $15, screw that, I'm not going to buy it, I'm not going to buy

29:46.760 --> 29:47.760
the original either.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.400
Now, if they came out with yet another Bionic Commando game, then yes, I would probably,

29:51.400 --> 29:54.160
shit, I gotta go back and play the Bionic Commando again.

29:54.160 --> 29:59.440
So, it nearly came out later this whole thing on the Xbox 360, how the demo on Xbox 360

29:59.440 --> 30:04.160
only was local multiplayer, and like, so if you're a solo player, you can't do crap with

30:04.160 --> 30:08.200
the demo, and you know, I was talking about this on Bobby's show, I don't know if he

30:08.200 --> 30:12.440
has, hopefully you're listening to him too, but I kind of theorized this might be because

30:12.440 --> 30:15.480
Capcom didn't want to do a demo for this game.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.400
I think they are afraid if people check out this game, they're going to realize it's

30:19.400 --> 30:21.280
a waste of their money.

30:21.280 --> 30:27.040
That there's not enough here besides the continued whoring of your nostalgia, which,

30:27.040 --> 30:33.200
God, I feel like I've been through that enough in the past two years thanks to Nintendo.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
You know what I mean?

30:34.200 --> 30:37.880
But I gotta give them credit, at least the sprites look good, they put the effort into

30:37.880 --> 30:43.480
the graphics of the game and stuff, it's not just blurry, you know.

30:43.480 --> 30:50.480
But yeah, I mean really, if you're not really, if you bought the first one on Xbox Live,

30:50.480 --> 30:52.760
you probably don't need to buy this either.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.960
Honestly, don't bother with it on Xbox at all if you don't have the right controller.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.880
Don't try to play this game with a regular Xbox 360 controller unless you have somehow

31:00.880 --> 31:05.560
been able to overcome that whole, I'm telling you, every bad thing you hear about the Xbox

31:05.560 --> 31:09.040
360 controller is true for this.

31:09.040 --> 31:14.360
Don't, if you have to get it, get it on PlayStation Network for the controller alone, unless you

31:14.360 --> 31:19.880
have an arcade stick on 360 or something.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.840
And of course, folks in chat are completely disagreeing, which is fine, I kind of expected

31:23.840 --> 31:24.840
that.

31:24.840 --> 31:29.480
Hitstun says, but really, STHD is the definitive Street Fighter now even more so than Street

31:29.480 --> 31:33.560
Fighter IV, all fighting game players need to buy it.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.000
Acidic Vampire says, that's what some movie studios do, when they know a movie's going

31:37.000 --> 31:39.440
to suck, they don't release it to the press for advanced reviews.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.600
Well, here's the weird thing, I think the game overall is getting good reviews, I realize,

31:43.600 --> 31:46.680
and I'm not doing it for the sake of going against it, I just personally, I did not like

31:46.680 --> 31:47.680
it, I'm sorry.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.840
No, I'm not sorry, I didn't like it, deal with it.

31:50.840 --> 31:54.560
But that's another thing too, is this whole game review stuff, because they remember,

31:54.560 --> 31:58.000
and this all just like Chrono Trigger and stuff, no offense, Chrono Trigger is an awesome

31:58.000 --> 32:03.520
game and stuff, but they didn't really do too much to the DS game, and it's getting

32:03.520 --> 32:05.760
like almost perfect scores and stuff.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.800
It's kind of weird.

32:07.800 --> 32:12.040
But you know, it is Chrono Trigger, so it's pretty awesome.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.840
Then Hitstun goes on to say, if you don't have a 360, and I might be taking this out

32:15.840 --> 32:20.280
of context, I apologize, says, if you don't have a 360 or PS3, it's a good reason to buy

32:20.280 --> 32:21.880
the console just to get the game.

32:21.880 --> 32:25.860
Oh god, do I disagree with that comment.

32:25.860 --> 32:30.800
If the game in question is Street Fighter, because it's really not.

32:30.800 --> 32:35.720
You can't put games out there like LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid IV, and say, those are the

32:35.720 --> 32:42.160
reasons, those are the reasons to get a PlayStation 3, and then Gears 2, Fable 2, countless games

32:42.160 --> 32:43.160
on 360.

32:43.160 --> 32:47.480
Dude, if you're going to buy a console, and you're going to spend like $300 on a console,

32:47.480 --> 32:56.800
or $400 in the case of a PS3, I haven't really priced them lately, or at all, but I would

32:56.800 --> 33:01.100
be willing to bet you could probably get a full-size arcade cabinet with Street Fighter

33:01.100 --> 33:02.100
2.

33:02.100 --> 33:06.600
It probably wouldn't be that expensive, I mean, that would be my guess, just the original

33:06.600 --> 33:09.760
Street Fighter 2, or whatever.

33:09.760 --> 33:14.760
You might even be able to get it for just slightly more than $400, if you're really

33:14.760 --> 33:19.560
that insane that you'd buy a console for a freaking downloadable game, I mean that's

33:19.560 --> 33:23.240
weird.

33:23.240 --> 33:27.000
I have a comment that'll piss off the Street Fighter fans even further.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.240
Now this I will say, just for the sake of pissing people off, I'll admit this, playing

33:31.240 --> 33:36.920
Street Fighter 2 HD Remix almost made me want to go buy Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.160
That's how much I did not enjoy the game.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.040
No, that's not right.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.640
You think that's taking it too far?

33:42.640 --> 33:43.640
That's taking it too far.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.840
Taking it too far?

33:46.840 --> 33:56.880
I mean, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is, cannot even begin to be compared to Marvel

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
vs. Capcom.

33:57.880 --> 34:02.600
It's just like, on another subpar level, I don't even know.

34:02.600 --> 34:08.520
But it's really sad, and that's insulting to me, and I don't even like either one of

34:08.520 --> 34:11.040
those games, really.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.000
I'm getting yelled at by chat for that comment, that was pretty bad.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.440
Alright, look, let's get into some of tonight's games.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.480
Okay, see, here's what I'm saying right here.

34:22.480 --> 34:27.620
Street Fighter 2, you can get Street Fighter Alpha 2 Arcade Cabinet, $600.

34:27.620 --> 34:33.040
So you better believe that you can get an original Street Fighter 2 machine, yeah, they're

34:33.040 --> 34:34.680
like about $600 bucks.

34:34.680 --> 34:39.040
So just, if you're really that insane that you would buy a console for this, seriously,

34:39.040 --> 34:44.200
just go buy the real arcade game, I mean, there you go.

34:44.200 --> 34:48.840
Alright, before we get to some gaming news tonight, let's talk about some housekeeping

34:48.840 --> 34:49.840
tonight.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.000
We're gonna do a contest soon to give away the code for Banjo-Kazooie.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.640
We were supposed to do it last week, but we're gonna retool it to be something that both

34:56.640 --> 34:59.320
our live and our podcast listeners can do.

34:59.320 --> 35:03.480
So we're not gonna be doing it tonight, but there will be something probably next week,

35:03.480 --> 35:08.000
and we'll kind of give you more details on that when everybody's back and when it's not

35:08.000 --> 35:10.200
the holidays.

35:10.200 --> 35:16.640
Also, I don't think we have a lot else to talk about in housekeeping tonight, just the

35:16.640 --> 35:24.000
stuff with our Facebook, of course, we have OL Army on Facebook, MySpace at username OrangeLoungeRadio,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.540
and LiveJournal at OrangeLounge.

35:26.540 --> 35:31.720
So unless you can think of anything for housekeeping tonight, as far as news goes, but not a lot

35:31.720 --> 35:33.560
going on with the show otherwise.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.560
Same old, same old.

35:35.560 --> 35:42.760
No, I can't think of anything other than Burger King Tender Crisp sandwiches aren't that great.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.760
Nice.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.760
Alright, we're gonna get into the news tonight.

35:45.760 --> 35:52.920
Oh, before we get into the news tonight, you know, we usually do our little thing on Bobby

35:52.920 --> 35:58.200
Show before we go live, you know, Bobby Black Wolf, the man who we follow on all games radio

35:58.200 --> 35:59.520
live, Sunday nights.

35:59.520 --> 36:03.560
I don't know if you guys heard of there was some weird little like cryptic message.

36:03.560 --> 36:07.120
And I tried to ask Bobby about it, but he's like, totally ignoring my text.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.320
But I'm trying to figure out like what that website was like, I don't know, did you guys

36:10.320 --> 36:11.320
hear it?

36:11.320 --> 36:18.160
It was something like flive.net or something FNG live, I couldn't hear it all, but I don't

36:18.160 --> 36:19.160
know.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.040
I'll have to go back and download it and check it out, something weird going on.

36:23.040 --> 36:27.520
Alright, let's get into the news and tell Bobby to stop ignoring me, this is very rude,

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
Bobby.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.520
Alright, I'm calling you out.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.400
Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki, why don't you start off.

36:33.400 --> 36:39.040
Okay, well, a couple weeks ago, the brand new download content for Grand Theft Auto

36:39.040 --> 36:40.920
4 was announced.

36:40.920 --> 36:47.800
Grand Theft Auto's Lost and the Damned, or Lost and Damned I guess, which is gonna revolve

36:47.800 --> 36:52.120
around the biker gang that was in Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.400
And would be a brand new thing, I guess a brand new story mode, doesn't really add anything

36:56.400 --> 37:02.340
like I wanted to it, like tanks and crap, but hey, new story, sweet.

37:02.340 --> 37:07.320
It was going to be released in February.

37:07.320 --> 37:13.320
Right now though, what's interesting is GameStop has the download content available to purchase

37:13.320 --> 37:20.560
on their website, which is supposed to be released in February on the 17th.

37:20.560 --> 37:24.400
And so apparently you'll be able to buy this redemption card at GameStop.

37:24.400 --> 37:32.240
I mean, talk about a way to whore that out, but here's a hint folks, if you go to GameStop

37:32.240 --> 37:33.600
you're gonna pay sales tax.

37:33.600 --> 37:37.320
If you buy it online, you're not gonna have to pay sales tax, at least you shouldn't have

37:37.320 --> 37:39.520
to pay a sales tax.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.160
So don't buy it from GameStop.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.320
That's pretty easy right there.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.760
Don't some states charge you sales tax even on the download stuff?

37:46.760 --> 37:49.300
Well in that case it doesn't matter then.

37:49.300 --> 37:54.760
But then again, it costs you gas to drive down the GameStop.

37:54.760 --> 37:58.560
Gas is cheap right now, have you noticed?

37:58.560 --> 38:02.880
In the two weeks we've been off, gas dropped a dollar, what are you talking about?

38:02.880 --> 38:07.260
It's still a cost, and even after all that, it's just to buy a code that you would enter

38:07.260 --> 38:08.680
in to download it anyway.

38:08.680 --> 38:15.560
So just save yourself the time, save them the ego of being able to pre-order cards.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.360
I mean, that's sad.

38:18.360 --> 38:21.160
Just go buy it online.

38:21.160 --> 38:24.880
Why do you even need to buy the GameStop?

38:24.880 --> 38:29.200
Well maybe it's just the conv- you know what, it's- well wait, when is this coming out?

38:29.200 --> 38:30.200
I was gonna say February.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.040
Oh never mind, I was gonna say so people could buy it as a Christmas present.

38:33.040 --> 38:37.280
So they can pre-order more stuff, so they can get you to turn in some games that pre-order

38:37.280 --> 38:41.320
download content, so they can get another five bucks from you.

38:41.320 --> 38:47.240
I'm sorry, but the fact that you would pay for download content as a store and then go

38:47.240 --> 38:49.800
home and download it is just stupid.

38:49.800 --> 38:54.500
According to me, I mean, what do I know though?

38:54.500 --> 38:57.360
Well maybe somebody doesn't have internet capability or what have you.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.800
Then you wouldn't buy the download content!

38:58.800 --> 38:59.800
This isn't a disc!

38:59.800 --> 39:02.800
It's a card with a code that you enter it in online and download it!

39:02.800 --> 39:03.800
It's stupid!

39:03.800 --> 39:05.840
Alright, I guess, I guess, fine.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.120
It's absolutely retarded.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.000
Zushi says free poster at Gamestop?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.480
Woo hoo!

39:11.480 --> 39:12.480
Free poster!

39:12.480 --> 39:17.240
Okay, well if they've- well if they got a free poster then I better go down there right

39:17.240 --> 39:18.240
now!

39:18.240 --> 39:20.800
Sorry I can't do the rest of the show, I gotta get my free poster.

39:20.800 --> 39:25.040
Well look, look, look, hey I like free things and maybe I am- in fact I would be probably

39:25.040 --> 39:28.840
one of the three people who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

39:28.840 --> 39:32.760
And if you actually want to order Grand Theft Auto 4 pre-order, if you want to do it for

39:32.760 --> 39:38.060
your PC, order Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, you can actually get a free copy of Grand

39:38.060 --> 39:40.720
Theft Auto Vice City just for placing the pre-order.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.360
This is all via Steam, so Valve and Rockstar Games teamed up, and if you pre-order Grand

39:45.360 --> 39:53.280
Theft Auto 4 PC via Steam, then Vice City will be free!

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
Well that's awesome!

39:54.280 --> 39:57.720
Which by the way you gotta do it like right now because Grand Theft Auto 4 releases like

39:57.720 --> 39:59.640
what Tuesday on PC?

39:59.640 --> 40:06.160
That's awesome except Anadras was way better anyways, and Vice City this time is really

40:06.160 --> 40:07.160
old.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.080
I don't know.

40:09.080 --> 40:17.680
Just buy Grand Theft Auto 4, you don't even need like extra stuff for it.

40:17.680 --> 40:27.520
So anyways, speaking of other things, Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC has the ever infamous secure

40:27.520 --> 40:28.520
ROM in it now.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.680
Well thankfully though, there's not going to be as much limitation as some of these

40:32.680 --> 40:34.240
other games.

40:34.240 --> 40:39.960
There is no limit on concurrent installations, but you will have to authenticate it once

40:39.960 --> 40:46.200
you've installed it, and you'll have to I guess authenticate it again if you reinstall

40:46.200 --> 40:47.200
it.

40:47.200 --> 40:52.800
So it's basically just to make sure that the CD-ROM I guess is, I don't know, in your drive

40:52.800 --> 40:54.840
when you're playing the game or something like that.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.720
Something stupid.

40:56.720 --> 41:02.360
But I can't help but think this is probably going to be cracked next week already.

41:02.360 --> 41:08.960
I mean, secure ROM has really been no obstacle for a lot of people anyways.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.280
It's quite a controversial thing, I mean it's not just the limited installations is pissing

41:12.280 --> 41:15.760
people off, but the whole you know that whole thing and I don't know whether you would call

41:15.760 --> 41:19.260
it a rumor if it's a proven fact or what, but the whole like you know that it might

41:19.260 --> 41:21.520
screw up your drive.

41:21.520 --> 41:25.960
Well I already have it installed in my system and nothing's messed up so far, so yeah it

41:25.960 --> 41:28.200
doesn't really matter for me.

41:28.200 --> 41:34.360
But then again I'm not buying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV.

41:34.360 --> 41:38.440
Dark Tetsuya relays an interesting comment, he said it's like I told the people at Game

41:38.440 --> 41:42.880
Politics, considering how hard secure ROM is to get rid of, I'd rather take my chances

41:42.880 --> 41:47.560
with Trojans and Keyloggers.

41:47.560 --> 41:54.040
You just, you know, have a trusted place to download your wares I guess.

41:54.040 --> 41:58.040
I guess so, although you shouldn't be advocating piracy, I don't think we should be advocating

41:58.040 --> 41:59.240
secure ROM either.

41:59.240 --> 42:04.160
I'm not advocating piracy, I'm just saying I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.600
Because you already have it on 360, what do you need it on PC for, right?

42:08.600 --> 42:12.600
I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.120
Well yeah because I do have it, I've already finished it, there's no reason for me to actually

42:16.120 --> 42:21.640
play this on PC other than it looks prettier and well you know I do have a game PC now,

42:21.640 --> 42:24.200
might as well put games on it.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.920
Alright, I gotcha.

42:27.920 --> 42:32.640
You're just looking forward to all the hacking that people can do with Grand Theft Auto IV.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.800
Can secure ROM prevent that?

42:34.800 --> 42:38.080
Or do you think that they wouldn't bother because that's kind of the reason why people

42:38.080 --> 42:39.520
get it on PC is to screw with it?

42:39.520 --> 42:45.780
No, it's not going to affect it at all because secure ROM only really protects the main executable

42:45.780 --> 42:46.780
for it.

42:46.780 --> 42:53.320
The data files are what's going to be modified to whatever you want to do with it.

42:53.320 --> 42:57.000
Make naked people run around, I don't know, whatever floats your boat I guess.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.480
Alright, before we get into more gaming news tonight, what did we miss last week?

43:00.480 --> 43:01.960
Do we miss some stuff last week?

43:01.960 --> 43:05.640
I know we weren't here and the one thing that comes to mind, the big story I know we were

43:05.640 --> 43:08.860
going to cover last week before the plug got pulled on the show was the whole PETA Cookie

43:08.860 --> 43:09.860
Mama thing.

43:09.860 --> 43:13.240
Oh yeah, PETA did a little spoof on Cookie Mama.

43:13.240 --> 43:18.000
They have, apparently they don't really care about people's trademarks or anything like

43:18.000 --> 43:19.720
that because it's parody.

43:19.720 --> 43:23.560
But I mean, seriously, it's just.

43:23.560 --> 43:27.640
It was really just an overall excuse to get people to watch the video that's embedded

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
there.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.440
And Majesco had a really cute response to it where they actually quoted Mama and I thought

43:31.440 --> 43:33.960
that was very cute what they did.

43:33.960 --> 43:40.280
But as far as PETA goes, love them or hate them, it's working.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.400
People are talking about it.

43:41.400 --> 43:45.960
And I'll tell you what, probably hundreds and thousands of people saw that video that

43:45.960 --> 43:49.320
wouldn't have before simply because it did tie into video games.

43:49.320 --> 43:53.320
So love them or hate them, they did what they had to do.

43:53.320 --> 43:57.040
And it worked for all intents and purposes, I suppose.

43:57.040 --> 44:01.720
As much as I don't necessarily agree, you know, it's not that I don't agree with PETA

44:01.720 --> 44:08.520
100%, but, well, you know what I mean, I'm all for treating animals nice and all that

44:08.520 --> 44:13.720
stuff but I think that particular organization sometimes goes a little bit too far and they'll

44:13.720 --> 44:16.720
kind of stop at nothing to get their message across.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.320
But the more we talk about it, the more free publicity they're getting, so whatevs.

44:20.320 --> 44:24.840
But I just wanted to say Majesco had a very cute response to it and props to them.

44:24.840 --> 44:30.320
I was going to say that there was another story that I think is kind of big and sort

44:30.320 --> 44:32.240
of kind of got blown over a little bit.

44:32.240 --> 44:38.560
Eidos, once again back in the spotlight, for trying to fix their Metacritic scores for

44:38.560 --> 44:40.680
Tomb Raider Underworld.

44:40.680 --> 44:48.160
Apparently, and they sort of blew, you know, tried to make it blow over, but apparently

44:48.160 --> 44:55.880
they were telling their UK press outlets that they could not post bad scores, low review

44:55.880 --> 44:56.880
scores.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.640
It says, that's right, we're trying to manage review scores at the request of Eidos.

45:00.640 --> 45:05.180
When asked why, the spokesperson said just that we're trying to get the Metacritic rating

45:05.180 --> 45:12.200
to be high and the brand manager in the US that's handling all the Tomb Raider has asked

45:12.200 --> 45:15.380
that we just manage the scores before the game is out.

45:15.380 --> 45:20.380
Really, just ensure that we don't put people off from buying the game basically.

45:20.380 --> 45:27.920
So basically, the positive reviews can go out but the lower scored reviews have to wait.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.080
That's not the first time I've heard of something like that though and not, I mean, that's the

45:31.080 --> 45:35.360
first time I've heard of the Metacritic spin on it but I've definitely heard of companies

45:35.360 --> 45:37.520
saying like, you know, well what review are you going to give it?

45:37.520 --> 45:39.800
Oh, well if you're going to give it a high review then you can post it early.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.960
You can break the embargo but if you're not going to give it a high review then you have

45:42.960 --> 45:45.160
to wait till, you know, the street date.

45:45.160 --> 45:50.360
That's kind of messed up and there's probably a good reason why that a low review might

45:50.360 --> 45:57.000
be, you know, warrant this game but apparently the Tomb Raider Underworld version for the

45:57.000 --> 46:02.560
Wii has a glitch at the end of the game that prevents you from finishing it.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.800
If you, I don't know exactly the circumstances but apparently from what I heard is if you

46:06.800 --> 46:12.960
kill certain soldiers or whatever in the wrong order that there will be a lever that's supposed

46:12.960 --> 46:19.080
to be there that you're supposed to pull won't be there somehow and apparently there's no

46:19.080 --> 46:24.120
way to fix that at all and Eidos' workaround is that they will just give you a save that's

46:24.120 --> 46:27.280
past that point.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.440
How do they give you a save?

46:30.440 --> 46:32.240
You have to go download it off the internet and you have to do this.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.360
Oh, because I'm sure everybody can just do that.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.360
Yeah.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.360
I think it's really annoying.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
Interesting.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.200
I'm just kind of trying to check out the Metacritic scores.

46:40.200 --> 46:43.160
78 is the current score on the PlayStation 3 version.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.160
That's not bad.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.960
That's not a bad score all things considered.

46:45.960 --> 46:47.280
Look at the Wii version.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.940
Wii version has a 68.

46:48.940 --> 46:50.440
That's not too bad.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.800
That's actually not a horrible score.

46:52.800 --> 46:56.320
It's in the yellow but it's not horrible.

46:56.320 --> 47:01.320
But see at the same time that makes me wonder though it's like if this glitch does actually

47:01.320 --> 47:05.800
exist in a game where you can't finish the game how many of these getting like sevens

47:05.800 --> 47:07.200
and eights?

47:07.200 --> 47:12.160
Well maybe there's a very specific order you have to do things to glitch it.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.880
No apparently it's pretty easy to do.

47:13.880 --> 47:18.860
You have to do a very specific order not to glitch it is what it anyways they have a workaround

47:18.860 --> 47:22.660
or some way that you're supposed to play the game in order not to glitch it either way

47:22.660 --> 47:25.320
this glitch shouldn't exist in the game.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.120
But you know I'm sure they played through the game enough.

47:28.120 --> 47:31.200
So guess what Wii game speaking now that I'm just happen to be on Metacritic right now

47:31.200 --> 47:35.760
guess what Wii game has the lowest Metacritic score out of anything out there and what it

47:35.760 --> 47:37.400
is?

47:37.400 --> 47:44.160
A 28 for this game called Game Party 2 by Midway.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.160
Oh yeah.

47:45.160 --> 47:48.160
It's known as more game party overseas.

47:48.160 --> 47:55.440
It's got lawn darts, bean bags, horseshoes the highest score was a 35 from GameSpot and

47:55.440 --> 48:02.120
most places are giving it like a 20 and they're just it's unoriginal it's based there basically

48:02.120 --> 48:04.520
everybody says it's a shit game.

48:04.520 --> 48:08.840
It's unoriginal it's also dirt cheap it's 20 bucks and that sold actually pretty well

48:08.840 --> 48:09.840
from what I remember.

48:09.840 --> 48:13.320
But that's 20 bucks that honestly you know despite all the crap I gave it earlier it's

48:13.320 --> 48:18.920
20 bucks that's better spent on Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix.

48:18.920 --> 48:22.440
And honestly you know despite the hard time I gave Street Fighter 2 I mean it still is

48:22.440 --> 48:27.480
Street Fighter 2 which is better than like 80% of the Wii games out there right now if

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
not more.

48:28.480 --> 48:37.600
Some of the other stuff from last week there was a new update to the Wii that broke the

48:37.600 --> 48:43.480
Twilight hack and all that stuff and also targeted modded save files and some other

48:43.480 --> 48:45.240
stuff.

48:45.240 --> 48:50.800
And apparently yeah there it was you know bad and what did enhance those it added I

48:50.800 --> 48:55.360
guess the ability to use USB keyboards during in the Mii channel or something like that

48:55.360 --> 48:57.400
for when you're typing stuff.

48:57.400 --> 49:03.640
What's funny though is it got re-broken again a few days later by hackers and they released

49:03.640 --> 49:07.760
a new version of the Twilight update or the Twilight hack that allowed you to install

49:07.760 --> 49:08.760
the homebrew channel.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.760
But still though thanks for trying.

49:11.760 --> 49:18.920
And then finally one last thing a couple things that were kind of interesting new arcade games

49:18.920 --> 49:26.480
and Guitar Hero apparently is coming to the arcade and the weirdest part about it is Konami

49:26.480 --> 49:33.080
is helping them by partnering up with Activision to actually make the hardware for the game.

49:33.080 --> 49:39.840
It's apparently going to be based around Guitar Hero 3's engine and it's being developed by

49:39.840 --> 49:45.200
Roth Thrills who did I guess some of the big buck hunter games.

49:45.200 --> 49:49.760
So I don't know they've got a little bit of experience there.

49:49.760 --> 49:53.400
There is going to be some online functionality with it.

49:53.400 --> 49:56.800
No word if they're going to actually have any additional songs or if it's just going

49:56.800 --> 50:05.000
to be stuff from Guitar Hero 3 but the hardware itself looks like the kind of the world tour

50:05.000 --> 50:08.280
guitars but with arcade parts.

50:08.280 --> 50:13.520
So look for those essentially that were hoping that Konami would one day bring Guitar Freaks

50:13.520 --> 50:16.680
out to the US forget it.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
Forget it.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.700
It's done.

50:19.700 --> 50:25.100
These folks at Activision and Neversoft and well I guess you can't say Neversoft but Activision

50:25.100 --> 50:30.440
and so forth and Red Octane have their mouths firmly planted on Konami's cock where it ought

50:30.440 --> 50:35.440
to be because it's kind of where the idea came from in the first place one could argue

50:35.440 --> 50:41.320
and Konami likes it and you know they're getting theirs from it so it's you know it's a win

50:41.320 --> 50:43.120
win deal all around.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.280
This is what it's going to be.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.280
Yeah.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.460
Take it or leave it.

50:46.460 --> 50:50.600
And of course they say that that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be a Guitar Freaks game

50:50.600 --> 50:56.120
but that this basically means that there's not going to be a Guitar Freaks game I mean more or less.

50:56.120 --> 50:59.520
Then all the other games that were being shown off as well American Idol they're going to

50:59.520 --> 51:04.040
have a game that you can record your performances and burn it off to a DVD.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
That's crap.

51:05.040 --> 51:10.240
And then finally something that some people might actually care about BeatMania 2DX16

51:10.240 --> 51:14.280
Empress was finally released in arcades and has a lot of fun stuff with that lots of new

51:14.280 --> 51:21.940
songs and hopefully a few that will actually make it over here someday some machines.

51:21.940 --> 51:29.240
And then lastly EA apparently is teaming up with Gamestop and it's an idea that they're

51:29.240 --> 51:37.900
throwing around right now they're offering people a season pass according to a survey

51:37.900 --> 51:42.320
that's been sent out they were throwing out the idea of having like an EA Sports season

51:42.320 --> 51:47.160
pass where someone would buy this for say a twenty dollar enrollment fee and what would

51:47.160 --> 51:53.120
it do is it would cut thirty three percent of the cost from all EA Sports games are purchased

51:53.120 --> 51:54.360
in that year.

51:54.360 --> 51:58.640
So if you bought the pass and you say you're a person that buys you know the Madden's NCAA

51:58.640 --> 52:04.380
football and all that stuff you would save you know thirty three percent off each game.

52:04.380 --> 52:07.600
Which I mean it's not a bad deal if you think about it because you're actually saving you

52:07.600 --> 52:11.640
know twenty bucks a game about.

52:11.640 --> 52:17.000
So if you buy a lot of games or if you even buy one game with this deal I mean it's worth

52:17.000 --> 52:21.960
it to do it because you actually break even with the first game and then you start saving

52:21.960 --> 52:28.520
money with the second game but once again they get you to buy more than one game so.

52:28.520 --> 52:33.160
This is the solution for a weakening economy I suppose get you get you hooked in early

52:33.160 --> 52:38.840
season pass deals I guess that's how it's going to go all right because see here's the

52:38.840 --> 52:45.440
other thing with the season pass is that you say for example you may have bought NBA 2K

52:45.440 --> 52:53.360
you know 10 or whatever next year well now say if you buy the season pass for like Madden

52:53.360 --> 52:57.120
or something like that and you're thinking about buying an NBA game you might be more

52:57.120 --> 53:01.440
likely to buy NBA Live 09 because now you're saving twenty bucks.

53:01.440 --> 53:07.040
True true interesting I guess we'll see how this plays out but I'm not much of a sports

53:07.040 --> 53:09.640
game fan so it's not like it's a deal I'm going to take but I know there are people

53:09.640 --> 53:13.300
out there that might just want to jump on the deal because the deal is a deal and if

53:13.300 --> 53:18.000
you are a person that buys these games is this isn't necessarily bad news and this isn't

53:18.000 --> 53:21.960
an enemy if you are a person to buy sports games think about it this way get with your

53:21.960 --> 53:26.960
friends one person buys that you know or chip in for the season pass and you just have one

53:26.960 --> 53:31.480
person buy all your games and there you go save a lot of money work the system but I

53:31.480 --> 53:35.600
don't know if this is actually going to happen but we'll see all right we will see what happens

53:35.600 --> 53:40.640
wow so it sounds like it was a pretty busy busy week last week yes and here I was spending

53:40.640 --> 53:44.920
my gaming time watching Netflix on the 360 and I watched a documentary about gay bars

53:44.920 --> 53:50.500
in Mississippi no kidding I'm telling you they have everything they have documentaries

53:50.500 --> 53:57.520
on everything on Netflix everything I started a documentary about Walmart I haven't finished

53:57.520 --> 54:01.800
it yet but it's a documentary about nothing but Walmart the high price of yeah yeah it's

54:01.800 --> 54:05.860
like an anti Walmart thing but you know I'm trying to watch it with an open mind I'm not

54:05.860 --> 54:09.400
a fan of Walmart in the first place and it really has nothing to do with this whole blob

54:09.400 --> 54:13.760
it's just I just think Walmart's kind of dirty that's my biggest problem maybe it's just

54:13.760 --> 54:19.080
the one here but yeah so I thought I'd check out the document documentaries on everything

54:19.080 --> 54:23.860
on Netflix everything all right well we were talking a little bit about Street Fighter

54:23.860 --> 54:30.000
2 during our gaming week and it's interesting to kind of coincide with the Street Fighter

54:30.000 --> 54:35.420
2 turbo HD remix they're actually doing a lot of different promotional stuff you may

54:35.420 --> 54:40.440
remember with pinball effects they had a special table for it they have special themes out

54:40.440 --> 54:47.440
for Xbox your you know Xbox dashboard and I think there's some on the PlayStation Network

54:47.440 --> 54:55.120
as well well also coming to your favorite sack puppet game LittleBigPlanet is getting

54:55.120 --> 55:03.600
four Street Fighter 2 skins they're gonna have a Chung Li a guile looks like Zangief

55:03.600 --> 55:09.980
and Ryu and those are all gonna be available soon apparently it's actually been leaked

55:09.980 --> 55:14.140
out but they have the pictures online and I'd say that's pretty conclusive if you ask

55:14.140 --> 55:19.840
me but uh you know matter of time before these are released I could see maybe even next week

55:19.840 --> 55:27.360
so got me and I'm sure they're gonna be probably about like five bucks or something because

55:27.360 --> 55:32.120
they're usually about two bucks a skin yeah I don't know how I feel about paying for LittleBigPlanet

55:32.120 --> 55:36.680
skins I don't know it's just a little silly I just download all the free ones yeah I don't

55:36.680 --> 55:41.200
know the free ones to get the turkey stuck on your head no I forget to get that one I

55:41.200 --> 55:44.880
got the the Venus flytrap one those last one I remember they also have one that's a TV

55:44.880 --> 55:49.060
stuck on their head to be honest I haven't played a lot of LittleBigPlanet lately thanks

55:49.060 --> 55:53.960
to WorldWarCraft but I'm you know and just real life too I mean just this I was gone

55:53.960 --> 55:57.080
for the past four days I know I didn't talk a whole lot about this we didn't talk a lot

55:57.080 --> 56:00.120
about what was going on in our real lives this week but I've been gone for a few days

56:00.120 --> 56:03.760
I was in LA I know a lot of people kind of do different things for Thanksgiving and I

56:03.760 --> 56:07.680
hope everybody in the US had a good Thanksgiving and and even those that don't live in the

56:07.680 --> 56:11.580
US so they don't celebrate Thanksgiving and you know hope you've had a good time watching

56:11.580 --> 56:17.000
the antics that go on here on the day after Thanksgiving on Black Friday which is like

56:17.000 --> 56:22.720
Canada's Boxing Day but without any significance whatsoever it's a completely fabricated made

56:22.720 --> 56:27.240
up by the company's holiday and it's like speaking of Walmart and did you hear about

56:27.240 --> 56:32.480
the poor person that got trampled to death at Walmart like this is I price pay for going

56:32.480 --> 56:38.120
the wall nobody I talked to the high price for low prices nobody I talked to you're horrible

56:38.120 --> 56:42.640
nobody I talked to will admit to going out on Black Friday so who's buying stuff I didn't

56:42.640 --> 56:47.740
go out on Black Friday I went out to breakfast on Black Friday that's in and we had a hard

56:47.740 --> 56:51.360
time trying to find a place to park in the damn parking lot you know what it was a parking

56:51.360 --> 56:58.160
lot for Mervins you know what's big about Mervins they all went out of business like

56:58.160 --> 57:04.960
they're not even doing anything for Black Friday except further liquidations so I went

57:04.960 --> 57:09.060
to a theme park for Black Friday and I actually had a lot of freaking fun it was it was fairly

57:09.060 --> 57:13.960
empty and I got to ride some pretty awesome coasters those of you from SoCal X2 is awesome

57:13.960 --> 57:22.480
just wanted to get that out there anyhow sorry let's talk about more gaming news and you

57:22.480 --> 57:26.380
know I did dog on the soundtrack for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix but you know

57:26.380 --> 57:30.920
what hey the people at OC Remix do a lot of great remixes and although I didn't enjoy

57:30.920 --> 57:35.380
these remixes in the particular game I think these might be kind of fun to listen to outside

57:35.380 --> 57:41.980
of the game and if you want to you can download the remix soundtrack for free it's available

57:41.980 --> 57:46.780
right there at Overclocked Remix if you go over to ocremix.org you can download the soundtrack

57:46.780 --> 57:51.240
for free and you know what despite the hard time I gave this game earlier is very hard

57:51.240 --> 57:55.180
to complain about something that's free so props to all these folks who you know spent

57:55.180 --> 57:59.120
their time putting it together and don't get too mad at me because I I dogged it in the

57:59.120 --> 58:03.540
game earlier I do think it's a good thing they're putting it out there for free so thanks

58:03.540 --> 58:09.980
guys also speaking of Street Fighter 2 HD Remix if you live in Europe you have a little

58:09.980 --> 58:12.820
more time to think about whether you want to purchase it or not especially if you're

58:12.820 --> 58:18.780
a PlayStation owner no worries for you Xbox 360 folks but the game was delayed on PlayStation

58:18.780 --> 58:25.220
Network it was released in North America as scheduled the day before it came out on Xbox

58:25.220 --> 58:32.380
360 European 360 owners hopefully got the game a little late I don't know if it actually

58:32.380 --> 58:36.380
ended up coming out at all hopefully somebody in chat can clarify it but it was delayed

58:36.380 --> 58:41.540
there in Europe just you know funny now that I think of it is you know before they were

58:41.540 --> 58:46.860
thinking I think they've got it by now just you know well I was just saying you know I

58:46.860 --> 58:51.740
was wondering why they were releasing the PlayStation 3 version a day before you know

58:51.740 --> 58:57.680
the Xbox 360 but now that we think about it that they don't have a demo for the PS3 version

58:57.680 --> 59:02.060
people don't know that it sucks and so you know that kind of goes back to your theory

59:02.060 --> 59:06.900
that that's why they kind of rushed the demo for it and maybe you know one extra day without

59:06.900 --> 59:14.180
the demo people can't try it and I don't think it's necessarily that Capcom thinks the game

59:14.180 --> 59:17.900
sucks because it's getting good reviews you know obviously I'm just missing something

59:17.900 --> 59:22.980
and you know I guess for the fighting fan diehard all the little tweaks they've done

59:22.980 --> 59:28.060
with the game and so on to balance and so on make it worth it for them which is fine

59:28.060 --> 59:32.100
keep in mind I am not a hardcore fighting game fan or if I ever confessed to be but

59:32.100 --> 59:36.620
I do enjoy the occasional fighter I I actually do enjoy the Mortal Kombat games I know that

59:36.620 --> 59:42.340
makes me weird but whatever Soul Calibur especially love Soul Calibur games are a lot of fun anyhow

59:42.340 --> 59:48.100
whatever sorry I'm getting off track that's right something else coming to the PlayStation

59:48.100 --> 59:55.220
Network which has been teased before I think by us Soldner X which was a PC game originally

59:55.220 --> 01:00:00.520
available I think mainly on like playasia.com I remember tons of advertisements for it pretty

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.860
awesome looking HD you know classic shooter game and they do have it available it's gonna

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:17.460
be coming apparently next week for $10 and it should be you know of course full HD you

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:22.660
know 1080p two op or two player co-op support leaderboards and trophies support and it looks

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:27.460
fantastic so that should be coming out I think actually that's this Thursdays when that's

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:33.500
we'll be making out oh yep on the fourth for $10 so definitely worth checking it out especially

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.760
if you're like a fan like you know grottiest or something like that really cool looking

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.940
game I would love to check this game out but sing star Abba I mean I I just I'm not gonna

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:46.220
have time you know I got dancing queen to sing to my heart's content personally I just

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.180
haven't really been downloading anything on the PlayStation Network because they don't

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.580
have those prepaid cards and you know I don't like buying my points I like trading in crap

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:59.900
that I don't want for points and I thought they did now I thought they did all the cards

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:05.140
now in certain stores I don't think GameStop has them yet which is kind of weird I mean

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:12.040
it's like Walgreens has them but GameStop doesn't this kind of weird well let's talk

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.840
about some releases around the world that are gonna be coming out in this next week

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.780
and we'll start off with Japan and what's coming out there on December the 4th on the

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:27.160
Xbox 360 fallout 3 gets its Japanese version this week so check that out Saints Row 2 also

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.100
gets a Japanese release on December 4th so if you live in Japan I want to check out one

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.080
of Loki's favorite games Saints Row 2 is where it's at on the 360 this is one of those rare

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:42.780
cases of usually we we like to cover Japanese release dates because they get them before

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:48.780
we do but here's a rare case of they're getting it after we do which is always kind of interesting

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.960
on the PlayStation 3 Assassin's Creed is getting a price reduction but if you want some new

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.700
games you can check out Pro Yaku Spirits 5 Kanziban is coming out as well as Saints Row

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.900
2 on the PlayStation 3 both on December 4th if you want to look at some other consoles

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:09.020
like the Nintendo Wii you can get Wii Speak comes out on December 4th it's the standalone

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:16.100
thing there Cooking Mama 2 Taehan Mamawa Oshio Gashi comes out from Taito Cooking Mama 2

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.500
in Japan on the Nintendo Wii and if you want to check this game out 428 is the name of

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:28.580
the game 428 Fusa Sarita Shibuade comes out and that's an interactive graphic novel yeah

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.540
it's like that looks kind of neat actually it's actually looks like a perfect score from

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:38.920
Famitsu really yeah perfect 40 out of 40 yet you don't hear much about now here now here's

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.460
a game that looks like it could work for a hardcore game oh it's got like live cutscenes

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.980
mixed in it and stuff so it this isn't a game that they can really release here at all now

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.100
without some major overhaul they have the reasoning yeah reshoot everything that's too

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.820
bad because there's a game that might be something that us American we hardcore gamers are looking

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.780
for and unfortunately I'll have to understand Japanese I guess hey PlayStation 2 Dragon

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.900
Ball Z Infinite World comes out on December 4th on the PlayStation 2 yet another pachinko

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:15.340
game it's volume 11 of pachislot koryuku series and yes it's another Evangelion PlayStation

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:23.020
pachinko game Rio Road also comes out that's R-O-D-E Road Rio Road comes out in regular

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:29.780
and limited edition flavors on the PlayStation 2 this week and it looks to be an adventure

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.860
game but kind of with some role-playing elements coming out over there kind of almost looks

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:38.500

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.420
week of December and sadly that is like the most populated week of the month well it makes

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.460
sense I think everybody blew their load in November because they wanted to make Black

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.680
Friday so the rest of the month it's all kind of crap it's gonna it's gonna really slow

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:21.900
down now until April I well we do have something because you know Street Fighter IV January

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.500
and all that you would be surprised actually January and February are looking pretty decent

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.720
especially February right now interesting I think some of the game companies have figured

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:35.900
out hey no one releases games in February that would be a perfect place to put our games

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.740
interesting Capcom for example they have a ton of stuff coming out in those two months

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.020
there all right fair enough fair enough all right well hey you know if you're not looking

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.520
to get new games you can still continue to supplement the ones you have from download

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.740
content and in January Fallout 3 is going to be getting some new download content people

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.420
look Fallout 3 is one of those games I probably won't have the time to check out and until

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:03.620
January so this will be just in time for that but there's a def excuse me definitely people

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.580
out there that love their Fallout 3 I don't know if Loki's one of them or not I haven't

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.860
gotten the plate yet I know it's just so much so much we're doing right now but hey there's

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.200
gonna be some more download content coming to the 360 and the PC versions right now nothing

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.920
said about the PlayStation 3 but I can't imagine it won't come within time these expansions

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:27.340
are plotted for January Operation Anchorage which is like where you go into like a military

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:35.300
simulation and you actually get to save Anchorage Alaska from Chinese communist invaders no

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:41.060
not Sarah Palin I guess it's in the Fallout story the pit you get to go to a raider town

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:47.220
called the pit which is outside of Pittsburgh get it the pit ha that's coming out in February

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.360
and then broken steel is coming out in March at least it's not we get to join the Brotherhood

01:09:51.360 --> 01:10:00.140
of Steel and forget it I how can I follow a 90210 joke fable 2 is getting some download

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:05.420
content as well they just announced the brand new island that they're adding called not

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:11.700
whole island and it's gonna feature a bunch of cool stuff they're gonna have three unique

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:20.860
quests and three unique dungeons you can unravel the mystical secrets of the resurrection shrine

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.580
plus they're gonna have some new outfits like an armored knight outfit an assassin a barbarian

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:34.480
leather-clad biker the hell and six new weapons a dozen of unique potions that I guess will

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.240
drastically alter your appearance new weapon customization I guess I have new augments

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:48.060
and 30 or 50 additional leaderboards and along with that they're gonna have actually some

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:52.780
free download content as well in case you don't want to buy it and of course that not

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:59.140
whole pack is gonna be 800 Microsoft points can I just say though that not whole is a

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.540
terrible name because it makes me think of a very naughty place because not whole sounds

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:09.660
too much like balloon not you know what I mean like it's that's a really bad bad name

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:18.300
for an expansion back not whole island with the biker outfit yeah I'm just saying yo you

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.860
thought Animal Crossing was gay I'm just saying yes and apparently I guess the free download

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.620
pack they're gonna have is some stuff I guess teasing from the main download thing they're

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.840
gonna have knights boots assassins gloves a special weight loss potion and a collectible

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.340
silver book and you'll also want to download that in case you don't want to buy this content

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:47.380
so you can play co-op with people that do and that might be good too there's a rumor

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:57.060
now that fable 2 will be hitting PCs sometime soon apparently an inside source claims that

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:02.120
they've heard some information I guess from someone at lion head that fable 2 would be

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:09.540
coming to PCs on February 15th I don't see why they wouldn't release it on PC they did

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:15.100
with the original fable and it was after the Xbox version came out so it makes sense why

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.360
not if they're trying to make games for windows more and more popular why not exactly makes

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.580
sense it does make sense well hey Loki since you're you know a really big fan of Animal

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:30.700
Crossing I bet you're a big fan of C-man and C-man is going to be getting a type of release

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:36.540
on the iPhone apparently all right it's not the actual C-man game which yeah you remember

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:39.820
C-man 2 we were talking about that a while ago you know that whole game where you actually

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:46.060
raise your own it just has a funny name because we're what four years old it's a game called

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:52.820
Gabo and it's actually a reworked version of C-man 2 apparently this is all coming from

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:59.740
Yoot Saito's blog and he's the guy who he invented C-man if you can believe it and apparently

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:06.820
I guess it's still like a like a year away it's a it's a ways off for this game but they

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.360
have actually a little demo on the blog that you can look at which is kind of interesting

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.780
so if you're a if you're a big fan of this series which you know the series did have

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:20.740
its fans despite our whole little five-year-old joking and it's just interesting to see the

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.780
iPhone kind of get more and more and more games you know there there was some rumor

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.140
out there that the iPhone has crossed like 10,000 different apps I think that's a little

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:31.860
high but there's definitely a lot of stuff available on the iPhone now there's always

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:41.720
room for C-men on an iPhone exactly anyways there was a rumor that I may have talked about

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:49.620
a few weeks ago I don't remember or do I about the new 360s will be coming out actually shipping

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:57.580
now apparently with onboard memory that's right the new arcade systems are supposedly

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:03.740
shipping with the new Jasper chipset which is a promises I guess a cooler 65 nanometer

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:11.180
GPU on the motherboard and they have expanded the onboard flash to 256 megabytes which would

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:20.320
be enough for you know storing the new next box or next Xbox experience so I guess going

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.180
forwards of course going to be pre-loaded on all the different systems you can also

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.260
use that space for game saves or whatever else you want to use it for it's just like

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:35.260
an extra you know 200 megs of space which is kind of cool and apparently I think the

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:40.180
arcade system still will be coming with an external 256 megabyte memory card so they're

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:48.980
kind of doubling the onboard space with that which is kind of and new is always good but

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:55.140
you've known this for a while now haven't you maybe I don't know just say you tell me

01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:02.860
I'm just saying all right anyhow let's move on to some other news and close out this statement

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:09.820
here pretty soon professor Layton professor Layton you know the old popular DS game well

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:16.620
what's interesting about this apparently professor Layton has been scheduled to be released as

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:20.580
a movie yes that's right professor Layton the first movie is going to be coming out

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:28.100
in January of 2010 in Japan so there you go and if you don't know this series Studio Ghibli

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:33.000
definitely kind of influenced these games so it's probably not much of a surprise they

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.700
didn't make the game they just influenced the games it's not a big surprise that these

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:42.640
this is going to be made into a movie eventually but you'll have to get a sub or something

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.660
if you want to watch it here in the US or just pray that it'll come out here eventually

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.820
I don't know yeah I mean they've had with like at least three or four different releases

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:56.280
in that series in Japan it's just we haven't seen them all over here yet so it makes sense

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.460
and they're insanely popular over there heck I mean they made an Animal Crossing movie

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.920
over there too remember just to answer game grew's thing in chat is Studio Ghibli making

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:10.220
it no they are not I was just saying that the games are Studio Ghibli-esque that's it

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.540
just a just a comparison don't want to alarm anybody that's all don't be alarmed that's

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:21.620
right do not be alarmed okay all right um let's see we're going to get into now the

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:27.460
classic game of the week and it's a little different tonight because Dark Soccer is not

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.780
here tonight but we can't let this segment die when she's not here either Loki or I

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:36.220
will steal the segment and that's exactly what's going to happen tonight so in the absence

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.680
of Dark Soccer I will be taking over tonight because it's been a little while since Loki

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.360
or I have gotten to steal this segment and I believe Loki had the last one a while ago

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.480
now so now it's my turn tonight to pick a classic game of the week that I think you

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.000
all ought to be playing and I'm going to really dig deep tonight because I've been promising

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.980
for quite some time that if I ever get to do another classic video game of the week

01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.260
I would pick something from the Commodore 64 this is exactly what I've picked tonight

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.860
is a game from my childhood that I remember from a long time ago it's a game called Lazy

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:10.620
Jones is tonight's classic game of the week now the interesting thing about Lazy Jones

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:14.580
is that it was like it was a game that was kind of made up of all these other smaller

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:20.380
games that kind of came together in this big entity it was like it was like WarioWare back

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:24.300
before there was WarioWare if this makes any sense at all and like yeah we're looking at

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:28.540
a video of this game in progress here on here in the studio and you can see like this mini

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:32.780
game you are stabbing turkeys coming off a conveyor belt with a giant fork and you have

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:38.620
to avoid stabbing the telephone that's randomly bouncing around the screen it was just so

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:43.900
awesomely random but anyway look Lazy Jones was originally I believe actually made for

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:50.820
the MSX it actually was ported to MSX Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum and the Einstein system it

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:56.700
was a game written by David Whittaker the Spectrum version was just a port though basically

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:01.340
Lazy Jones is made up of 15 smaller games and you're in this giant hotel and you basically

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:06.140
walk around here trying to avoid some of the monsters in the hotel while you sneak into

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:11.820
these rooms and play different video games the video games are somewhat inspired by other

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:17.700
games there are definitely games that are like Frogger like Space Invader in here but

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:23.020
there's also some games that have funny names like there's a game in here called 99 Red

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:27.020
Balloons this is a game where you just have red balloons that continually go up towards

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.460
the top of the screen you try to get a hold of a couple of the balloons and you're able

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:34.220
to do that then you can get up to the top and give a woman a big kiss and then you get

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.780
a balloon to go back down where you go up and down by grabbing these different balloons

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.820
and none of these games go on a particularly long time you just play the game for about

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:46.340
a minute until the clock runs out and your score basically transfers to the larger score

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:50.960
that you have so this game is really wacky and just kind of takes us back to a time when

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.400
you know really really was only one person that made games but the other thing that kind

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.420
of made Lazy Jones special at least to me was the fact that it had a really unique soundtrack

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.140
and I know you can kind of hear it in the background

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:08.900
this is definitely kind of its own little thing actually I want to play for you one

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:13.180
clip in particular from the game Lazy Jones by David Whittaker and I want to see if it

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:26.620
sounds familiar to you at all here's a clip from the game

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.900
now that's a clip from the Lazy Jones game that came out years ago did that sound familiar

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:40.140
to anybody at all yeah it actually was sampled years later in 1999 by a band it was actually

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:54.220
sampled by the group Zombie Nation current craft 400 oh yeah it's the same song so kind

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:59.340
of funny because the game was you know originally made with the C64 sound chip in it and it's

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:05.340
that kind of unique noise that is still used today so there you go so back to the clip

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.500
here a little bit you know I think one reason I just really remember this game was you know

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.120
like I say it was really awesome to have one video game with all these mini games in it

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.860
and you could just kept trying to really increase your score in the mini games because some

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:21.760
of them were really hard because some of them would end like just once you've died and once

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.600
you would be done with it so you I find it was really trying to push myself to get higher

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.600
scores in the game by getting higher scores than other little mini games it was pretty

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:35.220
awesome so you know again and it's kind of cool I see a lot of people lighting up in

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.740
chat like oh that's kind of a random fact that it went inspired this song

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:41.860
like 15 years later after the game first came out

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.940
what maybe like 14 years later when did this game come out I think 84 I want to

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.740
say yeah 84 is in this game first came out by the way this game did not get

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:52.940
that great reviews when it came out it's it's definitely a game I'm picking for

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.100
nostalgia purposes so there you go

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:00.420
that's my classic video game of the week lazy Jones

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:04.980
oh yeah here's the random there's two random door because only 15 minigames

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.820
will like 18 doors there's random things you'll walk into as well like there's a

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.060
broom closet that you'll randomly walk into and then a potty and you watch your

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:16.500
guy go to the bathroom not like it's not explicitly or gross but he just like

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:22.940
walks in there and flush and then walks out it's so random but there it is lazy

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:28.020
Jones for the Commodore 64 my classic game of the week and stowing away on a

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:33.460
dark soccer's classic game of the week segment she'll be back next week with

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.580

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.180

with a Wii talk a little chrono trigger and talk some PC games which we don't

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.660

01:21:50.660 --> 01:22:00.660
more of orange lounge radio and we're back here on orange lounge radio on this

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:06.180
lovely Sunday evening November the 30th of 2008 one more month left in the year

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:11.260
if you can believe it tomorrow be in the 1st of December and then 2009 will be

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.220
here before you know it which will hopefully be a much better year than

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.940
2008 in my opinion yeah I'm not just talking about games I'm talking about

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.620
personally and all that stuff as well so anyhow we have plenty more game news to

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.340
cover in this segment then we want to get to your calls on the skype line at

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:28.220
1 877 game olr we'll get to that in a little while but first we have some more

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.060
gaming news Loki start us off just looking me here tonight by the way Dark

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.020
Sakura has a night off

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:41.060
yes there is a new mystery title being worked on by monster games apparently

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:48.780
there was some speculation apparently of what they're gonna be working on and

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:55.260
it's no surprise the monster games works on basically racing titles and the last

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:59.180
racing title they worked on was excite truck here so far excite truck too

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:07.100
because I really awesome however though you know I believe because Nintendo

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:13.260
would not be so kind as to release an excite truck to so soon is probably

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.940
going to be at zero would be my guess

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:23.580
who is not necessarily bad excite truck was awesome I even think about that so

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:29.740
you keep that kind of you know awesome control you know what I don't mind if

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:33.420
they release an excite truck too because I would be there lined up at midnight

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:38.660
already the game that game was awesome I truck absolutely most favorite game of

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.900
the week ever I do think f0 has got to come out sooner rather than later I'm

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:48.860
even though the AXGX thing I guess must have disappointed some folks I love f0

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:54.700
gx that's an amazing game I I really hope as game grew says chat f0 wx be

01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:01.300
awesome or as a deaf says in chat chat at orange dot com dot com excite truck

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:06.820
to excite yourself I think it's a trick to be harder don't even need to know

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.580
this is one of those games that I would hope that they don't go back and try to

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:14.180
tweak too much of it just add a lot more tracks add the ability to download new

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:19.580
tracks later on maybe four player you know split-screen multiplayer or

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:26.340
four-player you know multiplayer over the we Wi-Fi service just stuff like

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.140
that it's really simple stuff they don't really need to go too crazy with it

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.820
maybe improve the graphics hey good on f0 you could have up to 30 people in a

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.300
race on the GX I don't know if they could do that online that would be

01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:40.020
pretty awesome that would be pretty cool long as you can't cheat like you know

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:43.620
Mario Kart everybody cheats well I would have a feeling they probably would be

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:48.260
able to cheat somehow but yeah gs68 says it perfectly in chat f0 we needs to not

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:53.380
have exploits dammit f0 X has wall raping f0 GX has space flying and snaking

01:24:53.380 --> 01:25:02.100
and so on so hopefully yeah hopefully it's whatever it is it's probably gonna

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.900
be awesome because like I said excite truck was awesome f0 be really cool I'm

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:12.100
hoping for another excite trucker f0 game if it's something new great you

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:18.820
know news always you know optimistically good I guess all right well this maybe

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:22.840
this will be something they announce at e3 maybe that's why they have a big

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.460
secret and then they have been working on for two years now so that's true

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:30.360
because what have you seen since excite truck that's why you haven't seen excite

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.100
truck too and do you think it would take them two years to make a psych truck to

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:39.180
I'm hoping it is that's maybe if they're gonna make it super awesome maybe do you

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:43.340
think it might be randomly a non racing game or do you think no I don't think

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:47.300
this company only makes racing games all right that's good because you know what

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:53.420
they know how to make a good racing game so I'm optimistic all right I hope it

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.540
pays off well hey um you know what's interesting you know Capcom has been

01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.320
porting a lot of their titles to different systems lately like you know

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:05.380
you see super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix ps3 and Xbox 360 bionic commando

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:10.300
rearmed Xbox 360 PlayStation Network Street Fighter 4 you know Resident Evil

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.780
5 these games are all coming out to the two big systems but they will not come

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:18.180
out on the Wii yet people seem to be demanding it which is kind of

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:22.380
interesting well um Capcom has actually kind of put out a statement about why

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:26.380
these games are not coming out on the Wii quote part of the reason HD remix and

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.100
bionic commando rearmed or digital is because we don't believe that the right

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:33.380
content for the retail channel the economics will be highly unfavorable as

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.060
compared to their digital counterparts counterparts and we wear we're finding

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:41.020
only works for titles built from the ground up for we wear as the lead skew

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:45.980
given the file size restrictions Street Fighter 2 couldn't ever be we wear even

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:51.140
at 480p the file size is just too large given the storage restrictions for we

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.960
wear theoretically it could be discs based but there are no plans at the

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.080
moment here you go and the beyonds mean how good-looking would it really be if

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.180
you took like an HD title and downscaled at the 480p it's just not even worth

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.020
redoing especially when you consider that isn't Super Street Fighter 2

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:13.900
already available I mean granted it's not turbo but whatever close enough like

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:18.740
already available in the god what I've even forgot what it's called virtual

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:24.140
console yes and also in Japan you remember next week we get Street Fighter

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:31.700
versus was it Tatsunoko whatever oh yeah Capcom versus yeah see that's what you

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.380
need to be playing on there they port that over and do something with it you

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.100
know that'd be pretty awesome all right well there you go moving on to stuff

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.260
going on on the DS hey chrono trigger is coming out on the DS here it just came

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.860
out this week I don't know I don't know anybody personally that picked it up I

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.340
I'm curious I haven't got I haven't played I did enjoy chrono trigger but I

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:53.340
stopped to finish file has he for on the DS I got a lot of DS playing to do well

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.340
on in Europe of course they got screwed and they don't have the game yet

01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.780
apparently though it is coming out in February that's what some sources have

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.700
told Eurogamer is that the game is supposed to be making its way out there

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:09.940
in February this of course the new chrono trigger DS version with the new

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:15.340
dungeon the new ending to screen display touchscreen controls Wi-Fi multiplayer

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:20.900
and so on and so on I don't get why it takes longer I don't get it it's it's

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:25.380
already localized so what's the delay for the only thing I can think of is

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:30.620
this time of year as far as duplication goes a lot of the plants that duplicate

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:35.620
games are at full capacity right now and if they're thinking that they're not

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.380
going to be able to duplicate this game enough to have adequate supplies for

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.580
Europe and North America or whatever other territories they're trying to

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:49.260
cover that might be why there's a delay for Europe that because Nintendo and

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:52.060
every other game company hates Europe for some reason I don't know why let me

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.340
go back actually to the last story because we have a little bit of a delay

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.260
between when we say things when our term comments on it because of the you know

01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.260
internet encoding and everything but I want to get this comment from chat

01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.340
because I think it's a good chat at orange on twitter.com VX Jason XV says

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:09.020
the only people clamoring for Street Fighter HD remix on the Wii are the 13

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.500
14 15 year olds who don't have the money for their own systems and only have the

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.300
family Wii and won't be getting the 360 or ps3 is a gift or anything hmm good

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:25.460
point and get a job I don't know go out and get a job just wait seriously I mean

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.060
if you if there's anything you'll be learned from this whole Street Fighter

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:35.180
you know turbo HD remix thing is it pays to wait because if you bought the

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:41.820
original Super Street Fighter 2 turbo or whatever on Xbox Live Arcade now there's

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.060
a new one that's coming out that's better it's like crap I just wasted

01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.100
money on that remember if you wait you know for things to get ironed out there

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.620
will be a version that will be coming to the Wii I'm sure just have to be patient

01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.540
that is a nation now I'll get a job something else that might be coming to

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.460
the Wii and once again this kind of goes back to the chrome trigger thing hours

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:10.300
and why they couldn't just bring it over the localizations done already disaster

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:17.260
day of crisis maybe coming to North America apparently one person was

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:22.900
emailing Nintendo customer support I guess regarding whether they would have

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.060
a chance to actually play this game in North America and the response back was

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:29.260
hello I am pleased to report that disaster day of crisis has been

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:34.260
announced for North America but no release date yet and then they you know

01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:40.620
for future reference go to our website I mean I don't see why they wouldn't

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:45.500
because it's a Nintendo game it takes no effort on their part to bring it over

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:50.980
here I mean all the works done already at the same time though what if the dude

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:54.660
was wrong you know I think that people a lot of people are putting a lot of stock

01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:59.540
in what this you know rep says what if they made a mistake well if they made a

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:03.900
mistake then yeah I could see but my point is it's done it's already been

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:09.980
released in Europe so it's translated already they've got it done it's just it

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:14.580
bring it over if it's in English already you can bring it over here I'll see what

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:20.460
the big while you're at it how about mother three right am i right translation

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:25.300
hasn't been done over there I have with uh there's a duty it's better

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:29.700
it's coming out right well there's the fan fan done one yes but there's not an

01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:33.380
actual cart release because if there was a car release it wouldn't matter because

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:38.500
people will be importing that bitch like crazy it's just this is already done I

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.820
mean it's just I don't know why they wouldn't bring it over here other than

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:48.620
maybe it didn't perform that well and I don't see why they wouldn't I mean come

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:54.100
on it's better than we music didn't mother three come out in the UK no I

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:57.700
thought it did no why did I think if it did everyone wouldn't be bitching

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.580
because they would be importing it all right I'm just crazy there's yeah

01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.540
because there wouldn't be an issue with why would even have to do a fan

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.820
translation then because it's already done for them there would be no more

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:16.700
bitching all right well um apparently we and we fit have been a big cause of part

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:21.380
of the Black Friday chaos on the most popular products out there on Black

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:24.100
Friday this year and of course if you've never heard of this you probably don't

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:27.380
live in the US Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where people go

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:32.180
fucking nuts over sales just in time for Christmas is basically Canada's Boxing

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:39.700
Day without any any sort of a fit it's all a consumer holiday specifically

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.340
whereas I think there's actually some reason for it in Canada but here no it's

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:48.540
just it's all it was all made up by the stores number one most popular product

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:54.980
on Black Friday was the Nintendo Wii console there you go big surprise number

01:32:54.980 --> 01:33:00.940
five we fit was the number five biggest product on Black Friday not surprised a

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:05.220
I'm not surprised you know people play it for a while they'll be all excited

01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:10.980
about it and then they'll put it away but I bet it's a bunch of parent parents

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.980
also buying it for their fat kids right I don't know about that

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:20.900
fat kids won't play that exercise game vxj snacks V says I thought Boxing Day

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.180
was December 26 yes it is instead of the day of Thanksgiving they have the day

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:28.660
after Christmas but same same idea it's chaos at the stores but I don't I don't

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:33.060
hear about Canadian massacre at Walmart on Boxing Day either so just you know

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:37.860
Canadians are smart not to shop at Walmart exactly well not just that

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:43.260
they're I'm assuming you know a little more civil because they didn't trample

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:48.780
each other yeah sorry apparently there's some news

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:57.820
that rate or rare may do a new killer instincts game you know how fucking

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:01.900
often does this rumor come up what now what now is provoked the new killer

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:10.860
instinct of the week rumor well basically this is coming from you know

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:16.540
there's studio manager Matt better edge and he says a killer instinct is an IP

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:21.140
that is finally remembered and we may do something with it but it's a tricky

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.620
market to be like the old killer instinct so basically we would have to

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.460
blow it out your ass just tell us already is there or is there not gonna

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:36.640
be a game quit cock teasing us are you gonna do it or not look rare are you

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.980
listening is somebody from rare listening to the show knock it off stop

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:45.540
playing with my emotions just tell us already is the game coming out or just

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:50.580
say no it's not happening stop getting your damn hopes up go away be honest

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:56.060
stop with that awesome so I don't really care if it comes out and to be honest I

01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:01.140
don't really care about most things that rare puts out so no I gotta say it is

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:04.980
pretty awesome I I love me some killer instinct I really do this white is you

01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:16.460
god it just doesn't I don't care kid vs. final come on this game was awesome well

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.260
they would have to put a lot of work into it and as long as they throw in

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:24.700
cameo as an unlockable character savvy weird and you could brutally murder her

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:32.860
and that'd be funny all right anyhow um why why our chat says I'm from rare our

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.860
official announcement is that there will be an official announcement made in an

01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:42.860
undisclosed time in our own heads there you go anyhow I am so angsty every time

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.540
I hear this rumor about a freaking new killer instinct game because seems like

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.420
every other week there's some cryptic goddamn quote coming out of somebody's

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:54.020
mouth from rare that cock teases a new killer instinct game and I'm getting the

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.780
more angsty the more and more time that goes by they won't announce something

01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:11.660
already so you know what this means

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:19.180
look you can start us off tonight Stark soccer is not here F you to popcap games

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:25.500
I was busy transferring all my saves and all my information from my old 20 gig

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:30.420
hard drive to my new 120 gig hard drive for my xbox 360 because I bought the

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.260
hard drive used I do not have a transfer cable that can facilitate just

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:38.100
transferring everything in all one foul swoop so I've actually used memory cards

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:44.100
and can you guess what two saves would not fucking transfer on their Zula and

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:49.860
bejeweled to both popcap games and why the fuck will they not transfer over all

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:53.340
the other games for all the other systems including some of the popcap

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:59.060
games transfer just fine but for some reason but jeweled to and Zuma have to

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:04.220
be which happened to be the two the wife has to have exactly and so and they will

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.800
not transfer I put something on their Twitter you know saying hey what the

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.220
fuck you know why is this not working they're like well we're looking into it

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:15.460
which means blah blah blah complaint go away hold on now now I know now you

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.300
know despite this whole thing the yelling at rare I know there are

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.940
actually people from popcap games that do listen to this fair program catch the

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.860
bitch that patches so they will move well maybe this is the first time they're

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.140
finding out about it this is a that's an odd error I mean that's not something

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.980
that I think you could have foresight into either that's just an that's a an

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:37.380
error out of the blue yeah and that sounds like Microsoft's involved somehow

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:42.240
too but well no it is strange that it is just those two games no I mean limitation

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:48.700
is that you can only transfer files to a memory card with the same profile so for

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:53.340
example I had to have a profile signed in on the one console with the old hard

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.540
drive and logged in as being that had another console logged in as me as well

01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:02.780
I just you know copy of the profile and I had to transfer you know from the one

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.980
profile to the memory card back to my profile on the other system and it will

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.620
allow you do that won't allow you like say transfer from a different profile or

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:15.220
something like that because you can't do that but those are the only two games

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.700
that we just would not let me transfer them at all you know what else would

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:23.540
not let me transfer it hexa HD would not let me transfer that game to the other

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.740
hard drive and see that's one of Microsoft's own games so you think

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.420
there's there's something on a deeper level going on here it's I think you

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.260
have misdirected anger well that they won't even let me redownload that's

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:40.420
stupid so not that I really play that game but it's still come on man all

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:43.840
right so like if I deleted that game somehow by accident then that would

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.000
never be able to get it back all right my F use of the week I don't really have

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.500
a lot I want to say I'm F you to F you to alcohol for being so nummy because I

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:59.220
have my first little sip of alcohol in like seven months the other day I had I

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.940
said I would have a glass of wine on Thanksgiving and I had a pinot noir

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:09.180
Thanksgiving evening and it's I was literally buzzed after one glass of wine

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:12.780
because my tolerance has dropped that much from not drinking so remember kids

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:17.740
don't drink and drive drink responsibly blah blah blah but I missed wine I

01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:24.220
really did then I had a Guinness the next night there you go

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:27.620

things we don't normally talk about here on the show that's PC gaming news alright

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.660
you know the game fear this is a pretty popular game that came out and there

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:26.940
actually was console as well as a PC but I think it was pretty well known for the

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:33.740
PC fear to project origin is the sequel to this game it's apparently being

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.620
banned in Australia was just recently refused classification by the

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:41.980
Australians classifications board don't they ban nowadays due to high violence

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:47.260
apparently Warner's trying to kind of assess the situation and they are right

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:51.700
now appealing with the ACB and trying to figure out their options I'm trying to

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:54.980
get fear to released in Australia was supposed to be coming out February 11th

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:58.660
in Australia and they're hoping they can turn that around but you might have to

01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:03.020
like import an underground copy of this game if you want to play this over in

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:10.100
Australia just by the ps3 version region free there well it's also PC is region

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:18.380
free to write exactly are you alright let's get to the mailbag guy it's the

01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.500
part of the show every week or we like to take some time to interact with you

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:26.660
guys you guys send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm and we take some

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:35.660
time to read our favorites here on the air

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:43.020
I'm opening up the mailbag right now and I hate it when we get freaking spam

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:48.620
email did somebody sign us up for spam email this is like a hahaha thing

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:54.940
jerks now I think spiders signed us up for spam email it sucks don't we disguise

01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:59.620
our emails on the side I don't remember yeah but they still find a way ah yyr

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.820
sent us an email wants to know please tell us what the meaning of life is

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:13.020
thanks Loki what is the meaning of life to live you can make the easy 42 joke

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:17.660
here or I could give you like a serious deep in answer but this is a show about

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:21.580
dick and fart jokes I don't know if it would fit in here I'll let me put it

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:24.700
this way the meaning of life is to have impact on others that's what I believe

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:28.980
meaning there was a good quote and I hate to say this from kung fu Panda and

01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:35.820
oh great all right no it's actually it was actually pretty good it was they

01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:43.180
were talking about was it the past is history the future is a mystery and the

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:48.980
and the present is a gift because it's the present

01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:56.020
wow that's way too deep for this program all right moving on we have another

01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:03.860
email from Katakos also sometimes goes by Reese Lord Katakos wants to say

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:08.660
congratulations on episode 300 even though it's not over 9000 but yeah you

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.500
guys and girls just keep on going so you can get to 9001 to be a prodigy right

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:16.700
now we're at 50% but that's halfway there PS Rob you need to get a hundred

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:19.660
percent healed come to the server Illidan and I'll use healing wave on

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.980
you and you'll be good to go just a general note to wow players out there

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:27.700
I'm not changing servers I mean I don't mean to be rude but I have a guild of

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:31.860
real-life friends where I'm at on Raven Crest as much as the community calls

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.980
that server Raven fail because we have no progression whatsoever on our server

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:40.140
it's pretty sad when our social guild is like one of the top 10 horde raiding

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.500
guilds on the entire server and we kind of sleep our way through I don't mean

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.400
like literally but you know we just we don't you know we we're very casual in

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.900
our approach it's not say we don't work out we're very casual in our approach

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:55.100
and we've managed to clear quite a bit of stuff as a guild these are most of

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.300
the death cake people you remember a fantasy 11 yes I remember I was gonna

01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:03.740
say that we have over 9,000 minutes worth of programming so there you go

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:09.420
that's true that's true that's a good way to look at it if you can't yeah I

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:13.260
don't if you count up like all the to-go podcasts and all that stuff when we were

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:17.020
doing like almost five hours a night for a little while remember that we yeah do

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.460
a three and a half hour show than an hour long podcast oh my god those are

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:27.960
the days right well anyway how was an email there from I'm not sure what the

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:34.700
point was but hey whatever we have an email from Fabrice in Belgium wants to

01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.860
say hello and I hope there's a show tonight and this was written last week

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:41.500
when there was no show so I want to apologize to Fabrice from Belgium I'm

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:45.780
sorry he says anyways he puts that in quotes

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:52.380
anyways like Loki style I'm planning on buying a pinball machine in the future

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.900
as I understand the best pinball machines are arguably the Adams family

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:59.740
and Terminator 2 but I'm a big fan of Sega this will probably be a question

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:03.260
for dark soccer which is the best Sega pinball machine she's not here tonight

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:07.260
but if she were I bet you anything she would say World Cup 98 because I I'm

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.700
almost positive that was a Sega table and that's like her favorite machine of

01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:15.760
all time so I'm I'm I'm 99% certain that would be her answer I know they're

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.620
not the best machines by far but I'm too big of a Sega fan to let this pass by is

01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:23.980
Independence Day any good I'll probably have a chance to buy that one I do not

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.980
know much about that table you're right dark soccer be the expert that one did

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.500
you remember that being good no did Sega do the Jurassic Park one I like that one

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:37.620
I don't remember they did that I was gonna say they should have a sonic

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:40.420
spinball table wouldn't it be awesome that would be kind of awesome with a

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:45.740
blue pinball well they're cute I don't know um you know I'm and and thanks to

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:48.740
Fabrice I'm sorry the real pinball expert isn't here tonight to answer the

01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:51.860
question I'll have to ask her for next week boy boy you just struck out on

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:54.900
first we didn't do a show the night you were gonna stay up and listen and I

01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.900
really apologize for that and then the night you have your question read on air

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:03.420
dark soccer is not even here to answer it did take a do Jurassic Park that was

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:09.340
that was a fun I don't remember we'll have to ask her next week hopefully I

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:15.100
remember let's go to another email it's from Dan shadow hey guys survived the

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:19.220
gaming season what surprised you the most personally left for dead blew me

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:23.040
away I'm gonna be up in the area next weekend which I believe is this weekend

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.140
whoops maybe we can meet up I'd like to meet you all oops well hopefully he

01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:31.880
comes back because apparently he didn't make it out tonight because we were off

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:37.540
last week and didn't even ever get to our emails are bad here's our last email

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:42.340
tonight from cheeseburger hey well I want to buy my dad a PlayStation 3 for

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:46.500
Christmas that's pretty ambitious we just got a 52 inch plasma LCD TV and all

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.860
we have is crappy cable where do you guys and girls think is the best place

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.380
to buy it all I want is the blu-ray player and don't intend on playing any

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:58.220
games websites are ok options too as long as I can use my unverified PayPal

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:03.340
account whoo in that case you might just want to go for a used PlayStation 3 from

01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:08.140
my eBay why not well if you're buying it online yeah or even just like a retail

01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:11.460
store probably online you get a little bit of a discount because you're if

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.140
you're buying news or something and it might actually work out a little better

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:19.060
well if you're trying to buy a 20 or 60 you're probably gonna have to pay more

01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:25.620
than you know $500 for it but you know keep an eye out for the Christmas ads

01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:30.420
and stuff because I know ps3 systems are moving pretty good but not as fast or

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:34.340
not selling out right away and stuff and you might get some good deals hopefully

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:39.380
well too bad you weren't really you know stalking amazon.com because they had

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:44.340
that $1.99 deal for a while there with the limited supply ring get a ps3 a

01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:50.380
little big planet in a movie something else to keep in mind too is that you

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:54.700
know how I said the Black Friday is like a totally corporate invented holiday

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:58.640
that they had they also have now the online retail community is inventing

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.900
their own holiday in response and it's called Cyber Monday and it's tomorrow so

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:07.740
tomorrow would be a good day to kind of check your big retailer websites to look

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:10.780
for big deals and the reason why they wait until Monday is because a lot of

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:14.180
people do their online shopping at work and Monday's the first day back to work

01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:17.420
for most people including myself so you're gonna see a lot of good deals on

01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:20.940
Cyber Monday online if that's where you're looking to buy things so I keep

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:26.000
an eye out keep it out and don't be afraid to use sites like frugal you know

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.540
Google's shopping site to look for good deals you know ps3 is a ps3 is ps3

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:34.880
cheap-ass gamer anyone so that well that's a good site too especially with

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:39.700
like games you know yeah so keep an eye out there you go it's funny I was

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:43.860
looking in chat they're talking about commander keen they actually have

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:49.300
ported a clone of commander keen for the weeds in their homebrew community now

01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:55.180
you can download a commander keen for the Wii that's kind of neat I got one

01:50:55.180 --> 01:51:01.180
more email from Rob with two B's about the Wii and says this one's for Matt I

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:05.820
recently upgraded my Wii firmware guess what my SD card was completely wiped

01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:09.500
clean this is a shame because I don't have a homebrew channel or anything on

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:13.300
it did you hear of anything similar I had painstakingly backed up my game

01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:16.540
channel so that I wouldn't need to download them again some I deleted from

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:22.220
my Wii memory because the incredible daunting size of we wear grr argh well

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:27.540
here's the thing I didn't update my system at all because I don't connect to

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:31.740
their you know internet for I don't connect to the store because to be

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:35.980
honest I don't buy anything on there and there's nothing I need to download and

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:42.460
if I wanted to download I'm not buying it but I don't really pirate virtual

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:46.340
console games because I don't have time to play any of them so there's no point

01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:49.900
for me to do that so the only update I did was the update that came with Animal

01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:56.740
Crossing and I think the update was only for the we speak stuff so you know

01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:00.220
unless I get a we speak microphone I'll need to update it for the we speak

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:05.620
channel which I probably still wouldn't do because I wouldn't use that so no I

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:10.980
haven't updated it yet although if you are if you have updated it I believe

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:16.780
there is a new Twilight hack out now for the 3.4 firmware and you can download

01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.660
that and redo all your stuff if you need it it sounds to me though that Rob is

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:24.460
not into this whole hacking homebrew thing at all like me like I just I'm

01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:28.300
just not into it because I don't yeah I don't have time you know so why did he

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:33.300
does his SD card get picked on well I don't know why it wiped your SD card

01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:38.460
unless you had modified saves on there or something but you know unless they're

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:42.780
trying to get you to update it I don't understand why they would want you to

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:51.140
re-download everything that doesn't make any sense but yeah Nintendo sucks what

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:54.580
it what's it the Twilight hack is what they call it now yeah see now I'm gonna

01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:59.300
think it's about vampires that sparkle well I'm with Rob D in chat does it come

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.780
with a hotmail vampire I don't even play far enough to use finally princess but

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:09.420
yeah the new Twilight hack is out and they're saying that even if that gets

01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:16.700
fixed there's team twizers or tweezers or whatever they're called so there's

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:20.580
other games that they've already figured out exploits to that you know can be

01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:27.580
used instead of Twilight Princess so this by all means is not an end all

01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.700
right well that's gonna do it for tonight's mailbag if you want to send

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.940
us an email dark soccer will hopefully be back next week to read your emails

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:40.500
mailbag orange launch radio.com all right other fun stuff that's going to be

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:46.100
going on here well this isn't really fun but fun calm the company behind you know

01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:51.580
such wonderful games like the age of Conan well they've had to cut staff

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:58.740
apparently you know hard times have been had and last Tuesday they actually had

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:06.180
to caught a bunch of their staff which is interesting but I know a lot of the

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:12.020
companies have been hit hard especially with the economy and stuff and fun calm

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:17.380
said that they have actually cut 70% of their staff yikes

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:21.400
well plus just age of Conan I don't think lived up to expectations I think

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.880
there were a lot of people that bought that played the one-month trial and

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.940
didn't stay with it yeah I could see that bummer I was going to check out the

01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.860
game but just kind of never got around to it no now it seems to be going the

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:36.720
way of tabula rasa which is kind of sad to it there's a lot of MMOs out there

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:41.100
and Warcraft is kind of owning a lot of them in the face only very few are able

01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:44.580
to hold their own against it I'll tell you what though if you like God of War

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:49.660
and you own a 360 we'll have never an opportunity to play God of War on the

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:54.740
360 you should check out Conan their actual Conan game that they released

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:59.180
because it is such a blatant ripoff of God of War it's not even funny but

01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:05.100
there's boobies and lots of blood and that's all you really need all right

01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:12.940
that's all you need hey PC games really old PC games but really classic PC games

01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:19.500
Starcraft is over 10 years old and just got patched this past week to patch one

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:24.940
point one six came out for Starcraft on some of the big changes they made in the

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:29.020
game I mean these are this is still a pretty major patch now in-game chat will

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:33.700
actually save in the replays so you can relive every f you it's cool the actual

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.060
match that's pretty cool also this is pretty important Starcraft will now only

01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:42.420
use as much central processing power as it needs to run smoothly because

01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:45.060
obviously in the past 10 years there's been a lot of upgrades and changes to

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.700
our computers Starcraft no lead no longer needs to hog all your memory so

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:52.460
it'll only use as much as it needs there's some other tiny little exploits

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.580
too it does some little exploits with the zerg race especially that were

01:55:56.580 --> 01:56:02.100
fixed but that's that's that's great the blizzard is still patching this game 10

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:07.940
years later and we have somebody chat VX takes me is like I've been waiting for

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:14.980
that and Korea rejoices there you go but this is you know what's neat about that

01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:18.940
is going to make a lot of people go back and relook at Starcraft you know it's

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.460
it's a great it's just like the burnout paradise thing is a great way to keep

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:26.540
your game alive even after maybe it's some kind of being being cut out

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:31.780
yeah well there's some interesting stuff coming out of course some more download

01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:35.580
content for rock band and you know the weekly stuff this week actually have a

01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:40.700
new free track that you can download which is the track headphones on by

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:45.140
Miranda Cosgrove that's going to be released alongside a bunch of other

01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:52.340
songs including children the are you dead yet by the children of bottom looks

01:56:52.340 --> 01:57:00.380
like a Finley with Toto II possible and these are all European bands by the way

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:07.100
and then this is kind of weird naked brothers band they've got a body I occupy

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:12.660
and I don't want to go to school I guess crossing over to the Nickelodeon crowd

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:21.540
there platter oh why to with hey poco rock and roll squeeze with tempted Tokyo

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:28.660
hotel with ready set go that's pretty cool and all American rejects with real

01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:33.220
world and it should be noted that all these are for 80 Microsoft points

01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:41.820
usual 160 and they're only on sale I believe for the month of December so

01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:46.100
after that they will go back up to their normal price but sales everywhere for

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.620
the holiday season we have a lot of sales actually on the PlayStation Network

01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.380
is a bunch of tiles are half off you know I do I do I didn't even talk about

01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:57.100
my gaming we've got to play echo chrome my friend has a game echo chrome what

01:57:57.100 --> 01:58:03.580
what a strange little puzzle game it's kind of fun but I don't know it's I I

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:07.580
think it's now the right price five dollars but I notice I have all these

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:11.660
like user-created levels and things it's a pretty chill game is a good way to put

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:15.620
it to chill chill out game I was another thing I played this week while I was

01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:21.220
waiting for my family to get done eating Thanksgiving stuff I was playing flow

01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:25.340
remember that game oh yeah yeah yeah I went back and played a little bit of

01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:29.500
that because now he's like what's that it's a lot of relaxing music there I'm

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:33.580
like yeah it's this game flow you move the controller around she's like I don't

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:40.900
want to have to move the controller around like that like too bad then in

01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:47.340
other news apparently obsessive gamers are not necessarily addicted to games

01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:53.740
apparently 90% of hardcore gamers do not have a legitimate addiction problem this

01:58:53.740 --> 01:59:00.300
is coming from a brand new survey mainly focused on I think some of the Wow

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:05.940
players and stuff of course there's all sorts of disorders out there but you

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:09.340
know some people just take their hobbies a little bit more seriously than others

01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:14.220
but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't stop although sometimes I

01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:22.460
think I can't stop so maybe I have a problem or not I'm not playing well so

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:26.060
that's already saying something hey wait a minute we try to say but J but every

01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:29.860
time I power on the Xbox there you are in Saints Row table I'm gonna play that

01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:35.060
until I'm done with it and then once I'm done with it then whatever you'll move

01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:38.740
on to something else yeah well you know I'm so sad dark soccer isn't here

01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:42.380
because I purposely planned this story to come after the story about addicts

01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:46.260
and it's obsessive gamers and she's not even here to make fun I'm a little sad

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:52.940
but you guys can fill in for her three new downloadable scenario expansions

01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:58.420
have been announced for Final Fantasy 11 yes Shane gonna go back well you know

01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.100
what's interesting about these expansions is that that they're not

02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:06.340
there's no new classes there's no new you know there's not a lot of big things

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:10.060
that are expanded here their story expansions they're only gonna be

02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:14.260
downloadable through the play online viewer and they are all supposed to come

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:17.820
out in spring 2009 I'm sorry I take that back the first one is supposed to come

02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:21.780
out in spring 2009 with the other two following the first one is called called

02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:27.220
a crystalline prophecy ode of life bestowing apparently it's where a giant

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:31.140
crystal appears in the skies above Juno and it makes all these unexplained

02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.140
things happen and so on and so on the other scenarios that are gonna happen a

02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:41.740
moogle kupodata kudata get basically kupodata evil and small doses which

02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:44.100
sounds like it's gonna center all around the moogles which I'm sure will be

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.980
extremely popular and then the third will be called a shantoto ascension the

02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:53.020
legend torn her empire born is the third one coming out you know all things

02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.900
considered despite the crap I've given this game ever since I've quit when you

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:59.500
consider how long this game has been out now because when did we start playing

02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:04.140
this game 2003 I think a while and it was out in Japan a year before that I

02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:08.580
mean this game has been going for quite a while the US October 28 2003 in fact I

02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:13.260
kind of wish they would update it you know what I mean like I wish they'd

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:18.180
kind of overhaul the engine to make it kind of you know newer gen graphics and

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.940
all that stuff make it I don't think they release a new file fancy online

02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:27.700
game do you would you go back you think I don't know oh I fixed it that's that's

02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:31.900
the first effort well you know I hear this whole level sync thing really

02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:35.940
helped like you know you know that whole thing where basically if you're a level

02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:40.860
75 you can downgrade yourself in level and all your gear will scale so that you

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:44.060
can level up with your level 40 friend who can't find a party because he's

02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:48.360
level 40 yeah and level with them and you both gain experience see that'd be

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.260
nice that's that and I'm like oh my god that's what that game needed three

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:57.700
fucking years ago level down to like level one just grind down there hell

02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:04.620
yeah I know exactly it'd be awesome so I got that's too hard to go over there

02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:09.480
I'm just gonna keep hacking up bunnies interesting comments from chat as well

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:13.020
with the whole attic thing ospher and chat says I throw gamers and while

02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:16.140
players in two different categories I'm already starting to get a little

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:21.060
offended here ospher says like I have a friend whose behavior completely

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:24.980
transforms when he plays well bye-bye social interaction otherwise he's just

02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:29.900
fine when playing other games no he is kind of a social game though you know in

02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:34.620
a way I mean I you real life there's an old saying though you know amongst

02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:40.980
people who know better real life greater than Wow so you know I don't I don't put

02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:45.540
Wow first before realized commitment Final Fantasy online just felt really

02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:50.500
different it was like kind of it was it was cool because like when I first

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:55.220
started it was like oh my god you know you think when you first get to the

02:02:55.220 --> 02:03:01.460
first force and stuff it's so big and then you you're like oh there's planes

02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:04.820
beyond that's like holy crap it's actually discovering like the world

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:08.020
stuff and then you go through all of it and it's like yeah like the first time

02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:11.300
you board an airship you're like this is so fucking epic and you know just all

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:15.500
this of the I will never forget the first time getting on a ship in Final

02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:19.040
Fantasy 11 and then pirates fucking attacked the ship and I was like oh my

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.020
god this is so scary and I was like I had to like having to run into the

02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:24.020
basement of the ship and lock yourself in there

02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:28.460
well jaywalking yeah while the higher level characters were taking out the

02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:32.700
things but I thought that was so amazing how like you would basically be forced

02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:35.100
to work together with the other players to take out the threat or you're all

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:40.220
die basically neat or you have to lock yourself in the basement like a scared

02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:43.820
little kid like I did of course and I do some of those area effect spells and it

02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:49.020
might still hit you anyway that's right swipe back into the corner and cry curl

02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:55.580
into slash fetal all right gosh that's gonna do it believe it or not for

02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:58.620
tonight's gaming news it was a little bit of a slow news week this week but hey

02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:02.100
that just leaves us some time to get to your call so one eight seven seven game

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:06.460
olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio while we wait for some

02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:15.140
calls any last-minute things you want to talk about Loki um maybe well you can

02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:18.140
think about it cuz we got a call coming in hello you're on orange launch radio

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:26.500
who's this oh it's spazinator spazinator what's on your mind dude um this may be

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:32.860
kind of a downer for the show but I'm not camera with sound right here and I

02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:38.740
could use a little help from the all games radio you know audience at large

02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:48.460
specifically any watchers that may be in the puffle area what's up if I if I had

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:54.660
mentioned to Loki in a private message earlier in the week on xbox live I just

02:04:54.660 --> 02:05:03.700
recently had my PlayStation 3 stolen and I'm hoping that any ball no letters out

02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:09.140
there there may be in the puffle area may have heard or heard and seen

02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:15.300
something to grapevine you know maybe rumor seen someone that normally doesn't

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:23.660
have a PlayStation 3 on them and could relay any information to the puffle you

02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:29.460
know police department specifically district me basically any kind of lead

02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:34.540
would be great cuz well it's kind of like twofold for me a is not exactly

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:42.260
something I can easily replace and be well it should be fairly evident that

02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:49.620
I'm disabled and the PlayStation 3 X is like a coping skill for me and in

02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:54.740
dealing with my disability and subsequently we have to answer well

02:05:54.740 --> 02:06:09.380
I'm really sorry to hear about the PlayStation getting stolen you know and

02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:13.820
and unfortunately I worry because you know we don't have too big a listenership

02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:16.980
all throughout the world that's you know we have a few listeners here and there

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:21.660
but I'm hoping maybe the right personal here but here's my thought do you maybe

02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:25.580
have a PlayStation that signs on to the PlayStation network automatically like

02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:29.260
whenever I turn on my PlayStation it signs on the PS Network automatically

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:32.540
yeah well that way I could kind of like as long as you only have one user will

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:37.740
do that otherwise it will sit in the select user screen type thing yeah

02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:44.260
technically my profile did and the key thing was a it had my credit card

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:52.180
information on that and there were and because of that I I really did two things

02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:59.100
hey I canceled my credit card and no idea but I was able to remote access my

02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:06.740
account using my PSP to change the password on my my PlayStation Network

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:13.020
account that way no one could get on to the profile and buy anything any chance

02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:16.660
that you called Sony and see I don't know if they would do this but maybe if

02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:20.580
you've told them what happened see what the last IP was to access it I don't

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:23.340
know I'm reaching here I don't know what you can do in these scenarios but that

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:26.340
that would be my first thought is to call Sony and see when the last time

02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:32.740
that thing signed in was oh well I did bring this up and in fact I stopped up

02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:39.700
the same thing and the only thing they can do is if I were to have left my

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:45.100
password as was the only thing they could do is see if anyone would try to

02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:53.260
input their own credit card information onto my profile and and if they did no

02:07:53.260 --> 02:08:00.540
no you know I would have their no name and address and whatnot but at the same

02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:05.780
time is I'm not totally sure but I think it's trying yes because if they input

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:11.340
their credit card information chances are they could also change my password

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:17.900
too and get them even I won't be able to access my own account you know that

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.660
seems a little weak from Sony I think they'd be a little more they could do to

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:25.140
help in the situation but maybe they need a police report or something to be

02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:27.420
able to do it I have no idea unfortunately I've never been in the

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:33.020
situation but well buddy I I hope it I hope it helps for whatever reason again

02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:38.540
if anybody has heard of anything about this I you know let us know and we'll

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:42.420
forward it over to spazz nator or just contact the police for heaven's sake you

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:45.780
know if you know that you know and this goes in general I mean I guess we could

02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:50.220
kind of turn this into a more of a community thing for everybody in all

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:54.100
parts of the u.s. because unfortunately these gamers like spazz nator in the

02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:58.540
cold if we support you know purchasing these stolen systems and things like

02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:02.420
that so if you know of these things going on do the right thing and and let

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:15.700
police people know so all right well we're hoping for you spazz nator keep us

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:25.100
posted all right good good luck buddy bye what a bummer I'm not gonna ask how

02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.540
it was stolen I hope like the house didn't get broken into or something

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:31.460
like that but yikes not a fun situation higher on

02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:35.460
orange launch radio who's this time of day orange lounge radio land it's Jason

02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:38.260
hey Jason I hope you have some better news the last call was a little bit of a

02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:42.240
downer yeah I was hearing bits and pieces because I was helping Ryan with

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:45.780
something and trying to make sure all the volumes are set nicely in here and

02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:51.300
whatnot how is I just wait wait wait how is Ryan how is she doing she's busy

02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:54.780
she's in school now I guess I know she used to listen to show back in the day

02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:58.740
but hasn't had enough time lately but let her know we said hello they said

02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:03.060
hello oh yeah she's listening over my shoulder

02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:08.740
wonderful wonderful yes what's in your mind Jason that's Starcraft news was

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:13.900
really good to hear yeah I saw you get all excited in chat I mean this is

02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:17.620
something that dates back to when I lived in New Mexico in like I don't know

02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:24.820
maybe 2001 or 2000 I did maybe 10 years ago Jason how old this game is but when

02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:28.500
I remember that the thing that sticks out most of my mind this is gonna be the

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.020
weirdest thing I've ever really said but the thing that sticks out most in my

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:38.820
mind is just how just how far back reaching this goes in the sense that the

02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:44.560
the the fact that online replays were able to be saved at I don't know 1.03 or

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.340
something like that when that feature came out that was amazing especially

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:53.740
because the file size for any average game was less than 10k yeah that when I

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:56.460
first did it I played a couple games with some people and then I went back

02:10:56.460 --> 02:11:00.060
and watched the replays I was like well wait a second I was discussing I was

02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:03.140
discussing with them strategy and whatnot I want to see that too never could

02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:10.460
they just now put this in that's my high school life coming back to say hey I'm

02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:16.460
cool again isn't that weird like why would they add that now of all things

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:20.500
isn't that but I mean they still they still have leagues people are still all

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:25.860
over battle net I think I mentioned it on the show when I got Starcraft working

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:29.700
on my macbook again and that was a that was a good day I went through yeah it's

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:33.600
when the Starcraft 2 news was coming out well I got Starcraft working on my mac

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.980
again and I started playing through the campaigns again it was fun it still is

02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:41.380
one of the other little features in the patch we didn't mention is that now you

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:45.420
can use slash R to reply directly to the person you last talked to that's another

02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:49.380
new feature in the patch that's a Warcraft thing which I thought was kind

02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:53.380
of funny because that's exactly what you do and Wow to reply to a surprise I know

02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:57.820
I know a synergy amongst the thing and speaking of Wow I know you didn't call

02:11:57.820 --> 02:12:01.100
the talk Wow but I've got to mention this the armory got a huge upgrade this

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:04.580
week and those achievements that you've been getting on your character now you

02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:08.260
can look at them in the armory online but not only that like if I were to look

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:11.300
like I got a show Loki this because he's a big achievement horse so he'd kind of

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.180
think this is funny but I'm explaining what I'm doing I'm going to the armory

02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:17.860
right now and I'm looking up the achievements for my character okay and

02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:21.020
like you look at this it breaks down exactly which achievements I have and

02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.940
what categories and all that but not just that like if I want to look at a

02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:27.420
particular achievement let's say like general okay here's one achievement I've

02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:32.780
been going for lately is to all the squirrels I've loved before show the

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:36.340
critters of Azeroth how much you slash love them so you get a ten point

02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:39.620
achievement if you're able to find every little creature among in Azeroth and

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:44.500
type slash love right well not only is the armory tracking that I have that

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:50.260
achievement enough but if I click on it it shows exactly which six I've slash

02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:55.620
loved and which ones I have yet to do that's fairly comprehensive see

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:59.180
integration like this is a great thing it's always cool you know ten years

02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:04.340
delayed in Starcraft case but anything like this to integrate that much you

02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.260
don't have to start up the entire game just to see this information it's almost

02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:10.700
always a good thing to have and I also want to show Loki this I can put in my

02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:17.420
ex-boyfriend's account and compare and I can see right there that no no but I

02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:22.060
can I can see just I can notice that I have 360 more achievement points than he

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:27.420
does and that makes me feel better about myself awesome no Rob's not an

02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:36.020
achievement for no not at all no I'm just sad and pathetic anyway so back to

02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:42.700
Starcraft any anything else you want to share about what's going on I'm I just

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:45.380
want to see what the Starcraft 2 requirements are going to be I mean I'm

02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:48.820
it's not like it's coming out holiday season or anything so I shouldn't be

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:52.500
jumping the gun or anything but it's going to be wasn't it either that or

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:57.460
Diablo 3 that isn't actually likely before to 2010 now I yeah I think I

02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:01.140
remember hearing something about that but yeah that makes sense I bet you we

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:04.740
seized I bet you will finally get Starcraft 2 next year I mean it was

02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:09.100
playable at PAX for heaven's sake it will probably be out next year just in

02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:12.580
time for the holidays and then you'll probably get Diablo 3 in 2010 I mean

02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:17.140
it's time late to buy three games what we've already beat that topic to death

02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:21.860
I got consider we're one month away from 2009 and 2010 doesn't seem that far off

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:25.220
because that's probably when we're gonna see Final Fantasy 13 as well this year

02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:32.020
went by so fast yeah it was it was a crazy year all right buddy we're gonna

02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:35.980
let you go to get two more calls all right such is life all right have a

02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:42.940
going buddy my books bite our very own webmaster VX chase next to me you know

02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.820
that's something I should get done during the holidays because that's

02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:48.860
something I wanted to do last holiday but I was too lazy to do it was to get

02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:53.580
around to a redoing the website hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:14:53.580 --> 02:15:02.460
hey hey dark Tetsuya what's up buddy not a whole lot I wanted to call in last

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:08.460
week because of where I was but there was no show yeah failed I know no I saw

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:15.300
the pictures in your live journal tell us about the trip you went on well we

02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:20.580
usually we go to Pismo every year for Thanksgiving but we couldn't make it

02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:27.620
this year so instead we went to San Francisco for the weekend and where

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:33.540
exactly did you go in San Francisco a few different places there were there

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:39.580
was a well now when we saw the Black Museum so what I wanted to call about

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:49.060
was this all this incredible arcade that I got to go to mm-hmm there was a whole

02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:55.260
bunch of old games like like this link I'm posting there's an old arcade it's a

02:15:55.260 --> 02:16:01.420
pinball game which which which arcade was this at because I go to San

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:05.100
Francisco quite often and I I for some reason have decided to never see I

02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:09.140
somehow have never seeked this place out you know I know the Pier 39 arcade and

02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:12.220
some of those other things but where exactly was this now did you find it oh

02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:21.220
man I don't I don't remember that I'd have to ask about it but well what made

02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:28.860
you think to go there I don't know it's my mom's suggestion huh interesting

02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:32.780
would have thunk it I know I guess sometimes parents can be pretty cool

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:37.140
well where can I see the pictures of your trip maybe I'll have to try to

02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:44.140
figure out where it's at and go take my own visit at some point oh yeah where

02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:51.780
are the pictures that can we look can you link it in chat so we can all take a

02:16:51.780 --> 02:17:08.580
peek yeah awesome um anything else you want to share about your week well yeah

02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:12.940
go for it one of the games I was playing one of the games I was playing in that

02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:20.380
San Francisco was the old 1976 game death ray oh yeah this game oh man

02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:23.460
that's an old old game I think I remember that coming up on the show not

02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:28.460
that long ago it's okay what would you what'd you think you'd you got to play

02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:35.220
that and what'd you think yeah I thought it was pretty cool I even I even made a

02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:44.860
remake for the PC I have to dig that up and link it in chat to hmm you know and

02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:47.980
this I think was an old game that was one of the first like controversial

02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:51.340
games because I see you remember like you're really over people it's also

02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:57.460
original better movie yeah yeah exactly exactly so well cool

02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:01.620
sounds like you had a pretty interesting and historical week so I look forward to

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:05.340
digging through the pictures and seeing what the folks who aren't local San

02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:08.340
Francisco are missing out on and I might just have to check that out myself at

in your mind buddy oh well it is always cutting out hey can you hear me or

torrents whatever up whoa hello all right no okay I'm hanging up let's do

02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:12.340

02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:17.100
there gs68 okay let's try to shit again all right it sounds a little better this

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:25.980
time what is on your mind gs68 well okay besides that I get around to playing

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:36.860
well echo I think there might be an audio thing going on go ahead shit all

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:48.900
right I agree fuck this shit hi radio who's this oh wow he got a little

02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:54.820
frustrated what's on your mind buddy who's this okay this is Oscar hey

02:19:54.820 --> 02:20:00.580
Oscar what's on your mind sorry I tuned in a little bit late time if you covered

02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:05.100
this story or not but did you see that part where it was talking this is on

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:09.340
joystick there's an article about the Zelda director saying he wouldn't quit

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:13.940
until he surpasses Ocarina of Time like you won't quit working with the Zelda

02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:24.380
series you know what fuck this shit sorry I had to use that good but I was

02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:29.020
wondering what do you guys think needs to happen and there's all the series to

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:32.940
make it surpass Ocarina of Time or do you think there's already been a game

02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:40.060
in the series that's better I think the way they can make it better is to fuck

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:46.300
the shit no um that's just not gonna get old I don't know why I'm so mature yes I

02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:49.700
think there is a game that has surpassed Ocarina of Time and it's called the

02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:54.780
Legend of Zelda link to the past so in my opinion he can quit already because

02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:59.500
he already made the better game really I have a friend that likes links to the

02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:04.300
past the best too but I don't know just for me Ocarina of Time is still the best

02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:14.340
I like he was also talking in terms of sales too mm-hmm you know I think it's

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:19.020
gonna be tricky to do I think you Twilight Princess was pretty darn good I

02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:23.740
mean it would I think it really showed with the Wii games could it could be

02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:28.180
pretty awesome although you know that game was kind of originally designed for

02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:31.480
the GameCube so I think what it really might take to really knock people's

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:35.100
socks off is to kind of take that same approach but with a Zelda game that is

02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:39.220
designed for the system it's gonna be out for and it'll probably be this we

02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:43.580
HD thing that'll be out in 2010 or 2011 which will be a port of a Wii game

02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:49.020
because you know they do a Wii version and a Wii HD version you know I wouldn't

02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:54.780
be surprised if we see a play on Wii Wind Waker game I would like to see a

02:21:54.780 --> 02:22:02.180
Wind Waker game that wasn't in you know world that was flooded with water it was

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:06.620
just you know spoiler but you know in Wind Waker you actually go under the

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:10.700
ocean you find out oh my god it's Hyrule but flooded and it looks pretty awesome

02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:16.260
and I'm like why the fuck couldn't they have just done this you know and made it

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:19.900
really cool it's kind of like Wind Waker to me is kind of like Mega Man Legends

02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:24.420
was there's another game that needs more you know I'm thinking if Zelda wants to

02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:29.220
really really expand its audience and really cater to many people are crossing

02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:32.260
different types the game that's just persist no no what you what you do you

02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:36.540
just need to add a few things into the game you need to add kiddich matches you

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:44.260
need to add vampires that sparkle and you need to add Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus

02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:47.700
somehow and then did that's that's how you would reach into Nintendo's other

02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:52.980
markets I think Miley Cyrus as Princess Zelda I think there's huge market

02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:59.700
ability in this so basically and stuff a wolf link turns into a sexy vampire guy

02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:04.140
and then so I'll just start singing see you again I think I think we're on to

02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:07.940
something here and then then he then he sparkles and we just talk about how

02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:18.220
beautiful he is and that's okay waiting at midnight all right I I don't know you

02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:21.940
know honestly the thing that's gonna make Zelda better is something we

02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:26.460
haven't thought of yet that's my cryptic answer I mean it really is it's

02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:33.700
something we have real controls that is like what with Loki said about when

02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:38.780
waker I think it'd be cool like if they made a Wii version of it like you know

02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:42.100
how like you conducted with the one waker you could actually probably do

02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:45.660
that with the Wii remote and that'd be just something interesting you know and

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:49.540
I I know a lot of people hated the look of when waker I thought it looked really

02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:53.540
cool and with the cell shading and everything if they just had applied that

02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:56.860
much effort to the game and actually made it like a traditional Zelda game

02:23:56.860 --> 02:24:01.220
hell you can almost do something that was not necessarily a remake of but like

02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:06.780
a links with links awakening or whatever it's all the three you know I mean dude

02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:14.020
whatever happened to links crossbow training I put it in a CD case to where

02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:18.620
it would be forgotten forever remember what was what the hell was that thing

02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:23.020
called it came with a zapper we zapper whatever happened to the we zapper

02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:28.500
there's games that actually use it like Call of Duty that world war uses it I

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.980
say but we need we need like in the next Zelda game we need more links crossbow

02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.580
training with sniper rifles and cannons and things that are more explosive than

02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:43.820
a stupid crossbow Zelda Call of Zelda oh my god that's wrong but no seriously

02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:48.780
they could just do you know they're the first thing they're probably gonna do is

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:54.220
just do that play on we think for Wind Waker and then you'll probably see a new

02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:58.620
Zelda game yeah unfortunately I don't think it's gonna be on the Wii I agree

02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:02.720
with why we are in check coming soon super links crossbow training turbo HD

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:11.900
remix they do come out like a we HD they're just gonna remake all the stupid

02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:15.500
games that were on the Wii and they're gonna make them all HD now and you'll

02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:21.580
buy them anyway that's right all right Oscar we're gonna let you go but thanks

02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:25.180
so much for the call and you know I know you really didn't get an answer out of

02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:30.520
us but I think it's because probably I sure there could be a game that one day

02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.460
surpasses Zelda if they just want to put the effort into it and hopefully they

02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:38.940
will and appease as hardcore gamers we'll see I think you were right though

02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:42.740
when you said that it would have to be something that we haven't seen in a game

02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:47.500
yet like the thing with Ocarina of Time for me was just how expansive it was

02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:51.620
like that that feeling I got when I first stepped out in the Hyrule field I

02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:56.540
was just like holy crap there's so much to do and maybe there's something to be

02:25:56.540 --> 02:26:02.020
said for the potential of a Zelda MMO I don't know maybe a little weird but you

02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:08.860
know when in doubt sparkles yeah have a good one buddy all right see you all

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:11.660
right that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight thanks so much for you

02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:15.140
guys calls you didn't get through I'm sorry but you know I send us an email

02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:18.700
mailbag at orange on traded calm and we'll take more calls next week last

02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:21.580
minute stories to get out of the way before we take off tonight there was a

02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:26.460
bunch of rumors coming out about stuff coming from Sony apparently this was

02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:30.740
leaked from some sort of Sony staff meeting some of the stuff we've been

02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:36.460
hearing about over and over now a little big planet on the PSP Motorstorm on the

02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:43.040
PSP apparently are in the works maybe as early as next year you know I'm not

02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:47.300
surprised they need something because there's nothing really coming out on the

02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:52.400
PSP they said that Motorstorm was shown off on the PSP but it was target footage

02:26:52.400 --> 02:27:02.500
and not the actual game also there was supposedly you know God of War 3 stuff

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:07.820
shown apparently it's you know really awesome looking and uncharted 2 also

02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:11.180
shown you mean not big surprises they're gonna make it a second uncharted game

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:17.020
and kills unto stuff was shown off as well so yeah that's kind of interesting

02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:22.220
another interesting thing would be the PSP 3000 system a new system that came

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:30.060
out one of the things about that was it was pretty impossible to hack the custom

02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:35.780
firmwares on well now it's even easier to do that because a mod group has

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:42.620
actually released a new tool now called the PSP light blue tool and what it is

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:48.820
is it's a memory card that will act like the Pandora's battery and will allow you

02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:56.500
to add the custom firmwares to your system and what's funny is it will sell

02:27:56.500 --> 02:28:02.460
for 30 bucks and apparently it came out last weekend so that's kind of neat then

02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:08.100
finally we know about gardening mama that's going to be coming to you know

02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:14.760
the DS soon well there's a new trademark being made title is trademark pet shop

02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:21.260
mama and it is actually a port of a DS game that's apparently available now I'm

02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:25.620
really if I think mama might have to be euthanized I think mama's I got a lot of

02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:33.060
mama's getting spread too thin yeah pet shop mana ghatari is the port of the

02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:37.260
game is being ported and has everything from penguin washing to apparently a

02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:41.860
bear that's jumping in the air that's interesting another game though that is

02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:46.940
being ported and thankfully coming to the United States finally track mania

02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:53.820
DS will be coming thanks to Atlas March 17th to the US so that's pretty cool

02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:59.020
this track mania is all sorts of awesome I would like to see a mama game where

02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:11.020
mama is trapped in Silent Hill fix this mama mama's brothel stripping mama you

02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:15.500
know it's funny I don't think mama here's something I would just like to

02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:20.340
bring up where the fuck's PlayStation home I thought it should have been a

02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:27.620
release by now it's coming out December 31st 1159 technically there's the

02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:31.180
version 1.0 and they said that everybody in the PlayStation Underground got an

02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:34.220
invite I'm part of PlayStation Underground I still haven't gotten an

02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:39.220
invite so that's apparently a lie and to be honest I really couldn't care less

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:43.780
but I'm just kind of curious you know that they promise it's supposed to be

02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:48.180
here for 2008 are they so white you didn't get into home so what fuck that

02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:52.300
shit I really don't care I like I said you know yeah fuck that shit but I just

02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:57.740
think it's funny though that they still haven't come out with something you know

02:29:57.740 --> 02:30:01.540
even though they've been teasing this for over two years and hell it's still

02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:05.100
in the commercials you know they're teasing for the PlayStation 3 look at

02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:08.420
all these cool games you can play on it including PlayStation home no you can't

02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:14.740
you cannot play that I love what joshi16 in chat says Britney mama where you get

02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:19.460
to neglect your kids for points you were teasing home back in January in December

02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:26.020
of last year when you know with the new PlayStation 3 commercials with what was

02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:33.140
it a ladies and gentlemen I don't know it's sad all right well that's it for

02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:36.140
last minute stories and that's it for the show here tonight orange launch

02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:39.140

video game right hits done right hits done anyway we're gonna go around and

02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:23.660
get everybody's final thoughts we'll start with well I guess we'll go to um

02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:29.900
Loki I'm gonna try to play some more games this week and it's gonna suck

02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:37.540
because my co-workers leaving and my boss procrastinated on having me learn

02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:42.660
his territory and you know the accounts I'm gonna take over until I don't know

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:50.980
tomorrow and he leaves on Tuesday so way to be proactive my final thought is

02:31:50.980 --> 02:31:55.580
thank you Aaron for putting us in the credits of snake 360 I thought that was

02:31:55.580 --> 02:32:00.100

02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:05.060
that really it says special thanks orange launch radio whoo so we we now

02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:08.460
not only do we have a gamer pick on Xbox Live and now we are actually mentioned

02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.300
in a downloadable game so well well now we just need to take that big step and

02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:16.340
actually get the orange launch radio game released on Xbox 360 I don't know I

02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:19.060
don't know who we have to blow to make that happen but we might we might have

02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:22.740
to get working on that might be a new year's resolution for oh nine I don't

02:32:22.740 --> 02:32:28.220
know what you think it's just you know it I've thought about it a few times now

02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:34.060
and it's just when you actually get down to figuring it out game developments

02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:37.660
really hard and it makes something game development is hard to make something

02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:41.620
really good takes a lot of time and it's just like holy crap that's a lot is hard

02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:48.700
right Loki yes all right well thankfully what you cannot make yourself you steal

02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:55.740
