14107	24791	Tonight, November 30th, 2008, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC gets controversial DRM, a 10-year-old game gets a new patch, and could Sackboy soon become a Street Fighter?
32347	35089	And we're back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35130	40915	We are that show on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41015	42456	My name is Rob Roberts.
42896	46059	Not joining us tonight, sadly, is DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46099	47060	She is out tonight.
47640	48741	Hopefully, we'll be back next week.
49422	51144	Also joining us, say, well, why am I saying hopefully?
51164	53025	I mean, she better be back next week or we're going to be in trouble.
53666	55748	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
55868	56128	Hello.
56428	57049	How are you doing, Loki?
57469	59111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
75512	76934	You should tell them how you got injured
91449	91710	DarkSakura
109343	110504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
129895	135582	I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much because, you know, when we were doing this race, we were running.
135862	139106	I mean, everybody that was racing was really into it, and it was a lot of fun.
139126	140888	My roommate did an awesome job with the whole thing.
140908	145913	I gotta say, it was very... You should have done it, Loki, except you probably wouldn't have been able to do it because you would have been...
148277	148717	Like me.
149397	150518	No, I don't get out of breath.
150578	153219	My legs get sore before I get out of breath.
153239	160081	That's what ultimately happened to me is that actually I started getting sore in the area where I had my surgery and I had to come home and take painkillers.
160141	160701	It was so bad.
161521	163862	So I ended up passing out pretty much during the time we had the show.
163942	171024	So a little embarrassing, yeah, but we've all done dumb shit that sometimes takes us out of our other commitments.
171084	173785	Yeah, last week I went and played Airsoft and I...
175125	177347	I think Poison Oak, but I don't know if it's Poison Oak.
177447	177987	It doesn't itch.
178147	180869	God, I hope you didn't bring that in this house.
180929	181870	Luckily, I think I'm immune.
181890	184031	I've never had it, but I don't want it now.
184792	186913	I've never had it either, so I don't know if it's Poison Oak.
186993	193598	It just looks like a rash on my arm where I was crawling through brush and grass and stuff like that.
194558	198521	Who knows what it is, but it just made a rash and doesn't really itch.
199622	202784	I thought Poison Oak is really itchy and spreads like crazy, but...
204577	205237	I don't know, whatever.
205738	206238	It was fun, though.
206318	207579	We shot each other with guns.
207819	210301	Hey, shooting each other is always fun.
210621	216005	You know what's interesting is what I ended up doing last week instead of the show is I was kind of like waking up in the night.
216365	221108	I actually was using the Xbox 360 to kind of check out Netflix and all the streaming movies.
221148	227773	And one thing I am loving, obscure-ass documentaries that you can only find on Netflix.
228293	229614	Seriously, I watched a couple of them.
229714	233476	I watched, get this, there was a documentary I watched on Netflix
235118	241083	strippers that they were these girls that turned to stripping to make ends meet after Hurricane Katrina.
242321	244622	and the movie was called... Well, that's weird and specific.
244682	244982	I know.
245202	249744	The movie was called Hurricane Strip was the name of the movie and I'm like, I have to watch this.
250804	252045	Like, how obscure is that?
252105	252665	Seriously, right?
253105	253705	But here's the thing.
254005	268431	The movie itself kind of was dumb because on one hand, you had a documentary about Hurricane Katrina and then, you know, which was very powerful to see that imagery and impactful, you know, it was obviously a terrible tragedy that happened, you know, you know,
269051	269433	DarkSakura.com
275437	276898	Why do women want to strip?
277218	278539	Well, for money and attention.
278779	280080	Okay, we could have told you that.
280440	286523	It really never, for me, it never tied it into why did they feel the need to do it because of Hurricane Katrina or anything like that.
286783	288584	It felt like I was watching two completely different movies.
288644	293187	They probably started off making a documentary about strippers and it was just too whatever.
293587	295628	And then all of a sudden Hurricane Katrina happened.
295648	297609	They're like, hey, there we go.
297689	299350	That's how we can tie this into it.
299750	303973	And people are interested in Hurricane Katrina so they will watch our crappy movie.
304913	307335	or it will end up free on Netflix someday.
307375	307895	Who knows?
308375	309596	It was not good.
309836	311977	Seriously, don't waste your time with it.
312157	323044	I know it's like, hey, strippers, or hey, interesting documentary on Hurricane Katrina, but I'm sure there are plenty of more informative documentaries on Hurricane Katrina that are much more powerful than this, which was kind of garbage.
323344	324004	It was just garbage.
325205	325666	DarkSakura.com
342475	344617	I really only played Saints Row 2.
344777	345938	I've been playing a lot of Saints Row 2.
346118	346878	I'm done with it.
347018	349080	I'm almost 100% complete with the game.
358906	360087	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
376361	379423	Um, I don't like the new friends list on there.
379443	383346	I think it's too hard to find, you know, what people are playing at.
383426	385487	It takes me forever to scroll through that list.
385808	392332	Whereas, you know, I can just hit the button, you know, guide button again and just pull up my friends list and it just has a drop down of what people are playing.
392372	394173	So I can look at it at a glance real quick.
394894	397115	Um, I do like the community games.
397175	397976	Those are pretty fun.
399237	399337	Um,
401104	408270	I kind of like the new shop, how they have it set up with where you can see screenshots and box art and stuff like that for the games.
408310	408930	That's kind of neat.
412923	419148	It does seem to be a little harder just to browse stuff sometimes, but I'm just getting used to it.
419408	421590	Yeah, that's kind of my thoughts on it.
421690	424632	I really love the new features.
424652	426193	The avatars are cute.
426893	428154	Netflix is awesome.
428234	429795	Community games are awesome.
430176	440223	So I appreciate that Microsoft tried to modernize everything, which sounds weird because not only is the Xbox an old system, but they're basically trying to put some of these new stuff in an all-new package.
440603	441144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
458686	460147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
486889	489310	I don't like the... So there's a lot of problems.
489490	490850	I can't say it's a negative thing.
490870	492711	You know, NXT overall is a positive thing.
493211	496972	I just think some things are a little more difficult when they don't need to be.
497112	498532	I don't like all the advertisements on there.
498572	506135	Like, for example, when you first bring it up, it's like what's going on in Xbox and stuff like that, and they have all this crap that I gotta scroll through.
506155	508015	It's just... You know, that's kind of annoying.
508055	509056	I wish I could take that away.
509716	511676	I love the little intro video when you first install it.
511696	512517	That's pretty awesome.
513377	513477	Um...
516155	519058	Don't you think gold users shouldn't have to see as many of those ads?
520659	521300	I understand.
521340	525124	Some of them are for their little inside Xbox videos and things.
525144	527506	I don't mind it because it's free stuff.
527767	528267	At least it's not...
533072	533873	Flash here.
534333	537656	Is your IQ smarter than Sarah Palin and all the stuff you see on the internet?
537676	538877	At least it's not that bad.
539017	539958	It's just small gripes.
540658	547784	Now, going to the community games, I did play... I tried to play everything on there, or at least a lot of it.
547944	548465	Jeez.
548925	549666	It's taking you a while.
549946	552168	Well, I haven't gotten to play everything.
552188	554830	A lot of it I downloaded and I looked at it again.
554850	555090	I'm like...
556775	559096	Uh, I don't want that, you know, I'm just deleting that.
559536	561996	But, um, I ended up buying a couple of them.
562036	564437	I bought a Weapon of Choice, which is awesome.
564477	571558	It's kind of like a Contra-type game, which is really weird weapons and weird characters and enemies and stuff that you fight.
571878	572978	Um, so that's kind of neat.
572998	573759	It's kind of quirky.
574439	580800	Um, and then the other one, I don't know why I bought it, but it was kind of fun, was, um, I think it was like, um...
582245	584686	SignSurfing, and that was kind of cool.
585106	590307	It's just really simple, just a little fun mess around game, which is kind of neat.
590487	594768	The word puzzle one, I kind of thought about buying that, but I haven't gotten a chance to yet.
595328	599369	And then I just go on there every time I'm on there usually.
599389	603770	If I'm on there for an extended period of time, I'll look to see the new ones that have come up and stuff like that.
605410	608711	But as I was complaining before when we were talking to Bobby...
610991	614194	Some of the graphics, it looks really unpolished.
615335	620458	A lot of it looks like the games aren't done and they're just putting them up to see if they can make any money off of them.
621739	622120	I don't know.
622460	623521	It's just really bad.
623681	631267	Even some of these independent developers and stuff, like some of the Japanese ones, like we've talked about in Warning Forever and
631647	632147	Thanks for watching!
656997	666383	Now, other than that, like I said, Saints Row 2, playing through that, it's getting to the point now where I'm just doing the 100% stuff so I can finish the entire game.
669144	673627	Playing Grand Theft Auto 4 now because everyone got hooked on that because they thought for some reason that...
675182	675743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
691659	693160	Thanks for watching!
708570	709110	Thanks for watching!
726451	726791	I don't know.
726831	729192	That game is very sad.
729633	733514	It's very sad because they didn't do anything to it.
733795	740838	And they, in fact, actually took things out of... If you played the original GameCube one, you'll know that they had a fountain and stuff like that.
741118	742659	Well, now you have to buy those things.
742719	745760	And I think that was the way it was in Wild World.
745961	746541	I can't remember.
746621	750583	But it's still sad that they took stuff out and they made stuff simpler.
750823	752184	And there's no reason for it.
752264	752724	It's not...
754284	754864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
770273	771194	The Wii for Wii Sports
791523	793144	I laugh every time I see the commercial.
793424	795045	Oh, I hear there's a new boutique in town.
795706	796806	God, you're stupid!
796906	801850	I mean, are you excited about a store in a fictional city in a game?
802170	803030	I mean, come on!
803070	805852	You know, I can appreciate what Nintendo's trying to do.
805912	815098	I mean, even though they have gotten pigeonholed as the casual game company and the one that's catering to women, and rightfully so, let's face it, they're selling like crazy.
815678	839189	and if it helps enable more people that usually wouldn't play games to play games I'm okay with it I'm okay with Nintendo reaching out to a different audience as gay as it might make you feel okay well here's the thing though is their games like as of after Mario Kart basically that's come out all the games have been released by Nintendo haven't sold very well and
839269	841590	And it's been going downhill fast.
841990	843590	Especially the fourth quarter stuff.
843690	846491	Wario Land Shake It, surprisingly, didn't sell very well.
847751	849752	Wii Music, well, we don't even need to go there.
850112	853753	And Animal Crossing, surprisingly, not that big of a seller.
853873	857194	It's just people realize that they haven't changed anything.
857254	860695	And the people that don't realize it are the people that probably aren't going to buy it anyways.
860715	861956	What about the overall picture?
861996	865597	Because the pool's getting pretty diluted out there when you look at all the third-party titles.
865657	866457	I mean, is it just because...
866977	872038	People that would have bought Animal Crossing are instead tempted by these cheaper budget games that are shovelware?
872338	875438	I don't think so, because there's nothing really competing with those genres of games.
875719	880619	Like, Wario Land Shaky doesn't really have any good side-scrolling platformers that are competing with it.
881059	885620	Wii Music, maybe Guitar Hero would have competed with it, but I think Wii Music was bad to begin with.
886060	894142	And Animal Crossing, really the only thing that kind of compares to it that came out around the same time is My Sims Kingdom, which sold even worse than, you know, Animal Crossing.
894222	895222	So, I don't think...
896124	900344	I think you'll do pretty well, but right now they haven't given us any hope to...
902592	903613	There's nothing really different.
903653	904193	That's the problem.
904233	905593	It's like, oh my god.
905613	908434	I've got to read some comments from chat here.
909195	913116	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com, of course, always our other guest here on the program.
913156	917478	The fourth guest, or tonight, they've been promoted to third guest because DarkSakura's not here tonight.
918378	921200	GameGuru says, how do we know City Folk isn't selling well?
921220	922120	We don't have an MPD.
922520	924321	But you have a little kind of an insider perspective on it.
924341	925261	Well, just from what I've seen.
925421	926922	And it could be selling very well.
927102	929603	On a grander scale, but from what you are seeing, it is not.
929743	932024	I mean, we're selling out, but it's just not...
933356	934816	There wasn't that many to begin with.
955702	959765	I think Nintendo's made a lot of very disappointing decisions in the past two years.
960286	963188	And a lot of that has affected the hardcore gamers like you and me.
963868	967971	And it just kind of goes right into what Acidic Vampire says in chat.
968252	971494	Nintendo is reaching out to other people but neglecting the hardcore gamers frown.
971794	973696	And that's kind of my issue.
974949	975790	And the whole thing... Right there.
975870	984679	Yeah, and my thing was, too, is before with the GameCube, when they were done with the GameCube and they're developing the Wii and they're promoting the Wii, it's like, listen, the Wii is for everybody.
984739	992087	The Wii system is not... We're not going to be pigeonholed in being known as a company that puts out games only for children.
992147	993849	We are trying to appeal to everybody.
994912	1023125	but they're not they're just doing the same thing that they've been doing before they're just complaining that everyone sees them as a company that puts out you know games for like you know too many family games and too many uh just casual games and well complain all you want but that's what you're doing and here's here's the other thing too i can respect what nintendo does from a business perspective which is what i'm kind of saying with these commercials and things it's like you know as a business move it's it's a smart idea and it's something new but at the same time on a personal level i can still kind of go but it sucks
1023365	1024186	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1039478	1044540	and hardcore gamers kind of push the Wii to be so in demand in the first place.
1044640	1057745	And Nintendo's going to need them if they launch another system or an upgraded version of the Wii, which is kind of my fear is what's going to happen is that we're going to see the next system that comes out of Nintendo is going to be, and it could be as soon as next year, maybe 2010.
1058225	1062927	I would say no later than 2010, you're going to see it Wii HD or something where Nintendo
1063187	1072035	Now they're going to start catering into all those features, you know, but their big selling point is going to be, but it's also a Wii, just like the Wii was also a GameCube, you know what I mean?
1073016	1087710	So, you know, I think to get that support, they're going to need to win us hardcore gamers back, and the more you push us away, and the more that Xbox and even now Sony starts to woo us over, which who would have thought that would have happened a few years ago, that we'd be talking...
1088010	1100095	So great about Sony, but whereas Nintendo's been making a lot of disappointing decisions this year, Sony's been making a lot of I can't say great decisions, but satisfying decisions.
1100115	1100795	Let's put it that way.
1100975	1103796	We're content with Sony right now.
1103976	1104676	Let me just put it this way.
1104696	1109398	I know what's coming up for the first two months of 2009 from Nintendo, and it's sad.
1110138	1111879	I mean, it's sad if you own a Wii.
1111899	1112659	Let me put it that way.
1113820	1116181	If you own a DS, you might not be so disappointed, but
1117532	1121914	Seriously, this is the trend that they're doing now is let's start remaking GameCube games.
1123015	1124756	Can you put any less effort into that?
1124856	1125656	I mean, seriously.
1127017	1134501	What, we got Play for Wii Mario Tennis and Play for Wii Pikmin is the first two games of next year for the Wii.
1137297	1137858	Woohoo!
1137898	1138598	With Pikmin!
1138698	1139459	Oh, awesome!
1139539	1140760	It's Pikmin all over again!
1140860	1146685	Well, we're gonna get to a story later tonight about that there's a surprise cooking over at Nintendo, one of their developers.
1146845	1151588	Is it possible that Nintendo is setting the stage to really knock our socks off next E3?
1153029	1153790	They better.
1155351	1156392	That's all I'm saying.
1156892	1159634	I have a feeling next E3 it's gonna be about the DSi.
1161456	1161556	And I...
1163234	1175617	I hope that they do something good because, man, my bar for them is set so low right now, it's like, there's very little, maybe a new Zelda game, or F-Zero or something.
1177017	1179377	Or that Kid Icarus game that's been rumored for a long, long time.
1179397	1180478	Yeah, that'll never happen.
1180678	1183298	Well, I'm just saying, you want to win me back, here's some ways.
1184138	1186319	And they gotta be good, they can't be shovelware.
1186339	1188519	You shovelware Kid Icarus, I'm gonna be pissed.
1188539	1190300	I'm gonna be twice as pissed as I was before.
1191240	1192060	You gotta make it good.
1193518	1195640	Just stop being so stingy is what they need to do.
1197922	1201425	GameGuru says the thing is that the core gamer and the third party has abandoned Nintendo.
1201445	1209572	Yeah, we're going to get to one of the stories later tonight about how some of these companies are now starting to say, look, we're just not capable of doing what we wanted to do, so bye.
1209792	1211333	Yeah, but the core gamer's finicky, okay?
1211353	1214316	If they come out with a really kick-ass game, they're going to come right back, okay?
1214416	1215097	So it...
1215797	1216478	It doesn't matter.
1230023	1257678	interview in look into as to why do game blogs and even podcasters like us and so on find the need to nitpick the negative in every single game out there and I think it's centered around Mirror's Edge and how Mirror's Edge is really getting these reviews that are just all over the map you know some people are giving it oh my god best game ever etc etc and some people are saying and just really nitpicking the shit out of the game you know are people doing it just to
1259372	1261093	Be negative on something.
1262273	1263794	You know, fucking Power Trip is what they are.
1264174	1266855	They're getting treated like royalty, getting promo shit sent to them.
1266875	1269397	They're getting basically blown by these game companies.
1270077	1275019	And then they're just like, oh, well, this game isn't as good as blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1275119	1279841	You know, and this is why I'm going to... You know, just like complain about little shit.
1279961	1283203	And that's probably because they're... You know, this is so ironic coming from you.
1284127	1312816	but you know what though I find fun in different things I mean like Earth Defense Force perfect example that game is absolute shit if you were to look at it like by you know graphics AI everything is god damn retarded in that game but it's fun and that's the whole point is that's really all that counts is if the game is fun who gives a crap if it's ugly it's fun that's the whole point but you just were sitting here dogging on the community games for having crappy graphics but they aren't fun either
1313596	1315097	Okay, alright then, alright, fine.
1315317	1324261	And seriously though, I mean, there are lines that, you know, can be crossed, you know, where it's like, okay, yeah, it might be fun, but seriously, man, that looks awful.
1324361	1326222	Just, I don't know.
1326822	1329084	Alright, any other games you've been playing this week?
1329104	1331285	We've kind of gotten on all these tangents, but it's been fine.
1332405	1333446	Any other games you've been playing this week?
1334046	1334146	Um...
1336358	1339661	No, but I've been using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player quite a bit.
1340422	1341783	Kung Fu Panda is pretty awesome.
1342784	1343084	Sweet.
1343925	1350010	Mamma Mia is coming out pretty soon, and Dark Knight, and SingStar ABBA.
1350510	1350710	Yes.
1350730	1352612	PlayStation 3 is this week, isn't it?
1352732	1353553	Yeah, I believe it is.
1353573	1354814	I'm excited.
1355354	1372268	well I was it I um someone had mentioned like I have pre-ordered right now one of the limited editions of Dark Knight with the stupid bat pod things I want a piece of crap for my desk you know like right now cool things to put on it so I will see if I actually buy that but
1373594	1375255	All right, games I've been playing this week.
1375555	1377396	Pretty much, you know, same old stuff.
1377437	1378717	I was talking about Netflix.
1378837	1380098	I did dive into community games.
1380158	1381019	I picked up Snake360.
1381359	1384721	You know, we had Aaron on last week who was really the dude behind Snake360.
1385361	1387582	And, you know, I had a good time with Snake360.
1387823	1396768	I really like that Aaron has pushed the limits of everything that you can kind of possibly do within the confines of what community games lets you do.
1397928	1400269	All these different modes, all these different maps
1419797	1430149	He's really kind of done a lot that you can do with this game when it comes to having the multiplayer, having the timed mode, having the pick up a certain number of pods in a level mode, having the different mazes.
1430489	1438358	And I think the soundtrack, it was really smart of him to pair up with Kyle Ward and his company and have the music because it
1438718	1439519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1460959	1463219	That's something that Microsoft just plain won't let him do.
1463760	1471121	But I worry for community games as a whole because I think there's going to be a lot of people that don't know so much about, you know, well, community games have all these restrictions to them.
1471441	1475102	And like he can't do online leaderboards because Microsoft won't let him.
1475142	1478642	But, you know, he's found a lot of very creative workarounds.
1478682	1479282	I'll give him that.
1479362	1483303	Instead of achievements, he has goals and the goals will unlock things.
1483363	1487684	Instead of the leaderboards, he has the online leaderboards where you go and put in the codes.
1488324	1490025	Thank you for watching!
1518104	1546491	you probably won't enjoy the game but I think as a local multiplayer especially is a lot of fun I crave it to be on Xbox Live and I'm kind of disappointed Microsoft won't let some of these games go to the next level I hope they will I hope some of these really good you know impressing community games such as you know Weapon to Choice I think is doing very well you mentioned it earlier and Bobby had the dude on his show tonight from Weapon to Choice maybe some of these guys will get to upgrade if they want to a full-on game I don't know
1547363	1549904	SuperStreetFighter2 Turbo HD Remix
1565229	1566231	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1581011	1583613	It's the same game you've had already!
1583693	1594459	And I know you already know this about Street Fighter 2, but to me it's a little bit insulting that they would charge $10 for that first game and then come around a year later and charge $10 for essentially the same game.
1594479	1594459	$15.
1595159	1600482	Well, yeah, an additional $5 or whatever you want to say for this game.
1600522	1603844	And yes, I realize Street Fighter 2 is a classic, but at the same time...
1605194	1612881	There's only so much you can do with it, and I think Street Fighter 4 is more of what, in my opinion, a redone Street Fighter 2 ought to be.
1613021	1613862	It's Street Fighter 4.
1614402	1615043	Here's the thing.
1615383	1619086	What do you get in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix that you didn't have before?
1619507	1628134	It's the same game with four new characters, of which, give or take, in my opinion, I guess I like Fei Long, but I don't know.
1628435	1629235	They're kind of give or take.
1629255	1631057	It isn't worth the five bucks to me.
1631617	1631677	Or...
1632877	1635998	So there's that and then there's the new graphics and the new sound.
1636018	1637458	And the rebalancing.
1637698	1638698	I'm going to say something here.
1638718	1642759	Well, the rebalancing for a casual fighter person like me is irrelevant.
1643119	1644260	The graphics aren't bad.
1644440	1645080	I'll give it that.
1645580	1646820	The HD is pretty cool.
1647120	1648821	The sprites are done fairly well.
1649321	1653462	Although it's not a smooth game because you still have...
1654062	1655063	Thank you for watching!
1671240	1671741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1687296	1710365	I appreciate what they tried to do with Street Fighter 2 I appreciate that they tried to go to the indie community and this OC remix thing and they actually got people to remix the songs but for me they don't work they don't match the mood of the original songs at all and I could tell this from the minute the character select screen came up I was like what did they do to the character select music this is awful
1711969	1729717	So, sorry, I know that statement's probably not going to make me popular amongst fans of the OC Remix circuit, and it's not to say that website hasn't done a lot of great things in the past, but I think it's left best these tracks that made it into this game as Remix, and I realize it's a whole play on that word, Remix, and da-da-da-da-da.
1730137	1732319	But it didn't work in the game at all for me.
1732759	1736241	And sound to me is very, very important in the game and the music.
1736562	1743447	And if you're going to try and rate me for $15 more based on nostalgia, I want my tunes to have some sense of nostalgia.
1743927	1749751	Yes, I realize I can revert to classic mode, but again, what are you trying to sell me?
1750632	1754395	If you just wanted to sell me the classic songs, you already sold that to me a year ago.
1755623	1766112	So I expect that these remixes are going to have some type of... Maybe I'm just bothered because I've heard remixes of these songs before that were more true to the originals and that were better for me.
1766552	1768914	But I did not like the soundtrack at all.
1769174	1776019	Call me names, tell me I'm hatin' if you want, but in this particular circumstance, I did not like the music.
1776060	1776420	I'm sorry.
1777281	1780963	I'm not a real big fan of Street Fighter 2 anyway, so I didn't even look at it.
1781244	1784226	I was just like, eh, 15 bucks, screw that.
1784686	1785287	I'm not going to buy it.
1786459	1787442	I'm not going to buy the original either.
1788205	1791416	Now if they came out with yet another Bionic Commando game, then yes, I would probably...
1792415	1795438	I think they are afraid if people check out this game, they're going to realize it's a waste of their money.
1821395	1826140	There's not enough here besides the continued whoring of your nostalgia.
1828262	1831965	God, I feel like I've been through that enough in the past two years thanks to Nintendo.
1833166	1833967	You know what I mean?
1834027	1834848	I gotta give them credit.
1834868	1836589	At least the sprites look good.
1836649	1839232	They put the effort into the graphics of the game and stuff.
1839272	1841253	It's not just blurry.
1841754	1841914	But, um...
1845250	1851975	But yeah, I mean, really, if you're not really... If you bought the first one on Xbox Live, you probably don't need to buy this either.
1853196	1856418	Honestly, don't bother with it on Xbox at all if you don't have the right controller.
1856718	1867626	Don't try to play this game with a regular Xbox 360 controller unless you have somehow been able to overcome that whole... I'm telling you, every bad thing you hear about the Xbox 360 controller is true for this.
1868826	1869127	Don't.
1870208	1875738	if you have to get it get it on PlayStation Network for the controller alone unless you have an arcade stick on 360 or something
1879860	1882982	And of course, folks in chat are completely disagreeing, which is fine.
1883022	1883923	I kind of expected that.
1884523	1890107	Hitstun says, but really, STHD is the definitive Street Fighter now, even more so than Street Fighter 4.
1890247	1892028	All fighting game players need to buy it.
1892989	1896071	Acidic Vampire says, that's what some movie studios do.
1896111	1899413	When they know a movie's going to suck, they don't release it to the press for advanced reviews.
1899813	1900334	Here's the weird thing.
1900354	1902135	I think the game overall is getting good reviews.
1902215	1905257	I realize I'm... And I'm not doing it for the sake of going against it.
1905357	1906758	I just personally... I did not like it.
1906778	1907138	I'm sorry.
1908759	1909500	No, I'm not sorry.
1909540	1910181	I didn't like it.
1910241	1910601	Deal with it.
1910821	1916306	But that's another thing, too, is this whole game review stuff, because they remember this all just like Chrono Trigger and stuff.
1916347	1917167	No offense.
1917187	1925695	Chrono Trigger is an awesome game and stuff, but they didn't really do too much to the DS game, and it's getting almost perfect scores and stuff.
1925735	1926636	It's kind of weird.
1927777	1929699	But it is Chrono Trigger, so it's pretty awesome.
1929719	1929859	But...
1931815	1941798	See, then HitStun goes on to say, if you don't have a 360, and I might be taking this out of context, I apologize, says, if you don't have a 360 or PS3, it's a good reason to buy the console just to get the game.
1941978	1944499	Oh, God, do I disagree with that comment.
1945900	1949521	If the game in question is Street Fighter, because it's really not.
1950041	1951222	Thanks for watching!
1972690	1981275	I haven't really priced them lately or at all, but I would be willing to bet you could probably get a full-size arcade cabinet with Street Fighter 2.
1982755	1984136	Probably wouldn't be that expensive.
1984436	1985857	I mean, that would be my guess.
1985957	1988578	Just the original Street Fighter 2 or whatever.
1989759	1992560	You might even be able to get it for just slightly more than $400.
1993861	1999203	If you're really that insane that you'd buy a console for a freaking downloadable game.
1999243	2000164	I mean, that's weird.
2002908	2006072	I have a comment that will piss off the Street Fighter fans even further.
2006993	2009636	Now this I will say just for the sake of pissing people off.
2009676	2010296	I'll admit this.
2010977	2016223	Playing Street Fighter 2 HD Remix almost made me want to go buy Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
2016323	2018646	That's how much I did not enjoy the game.
2019166	2020828	No, that's not right.
2021028	2022270	You think that's taking it too far?
2022510	2023431	That's taking it too far.
2023451	2024032	Taking it too far?
2026889	2028070	I'm getting yelled at by chat for that comment.
2028110	2028771	That was pretty bad.
2056534	2057234	Alright, look.
2058395	2060555	Let's get into some of tonight's game news.
2060575	2062256	Okay, see, here's what I'm saying right here.
2062316	2065637	Street Fighter 2, you can get a Street Fighter Alpha 2 arcade cabinet, $600.
2066097	2073439	So you better believe that you can get an original Street Fighter 2 machine, yeah, literally about $600.
2074640	2080901	So just, if you're really that insane that you would buy a console for this, seriously, just go buy the real arcade game.
2080941	2082242	There you go.
2085157	2089038	Alright, before we get to some gaming news tonight, let's talk about some housekeeping tonight.
2089078	2092220	We're going to do a contest soon to give away the code for Banjo-Kazooie.
2092620	2099162	We were supposed to do it last week, but we're going to retool it to be something that both our live and our podcast listeners can do.
2099282	2102783	So we're not going to be doing it tonight, but there will be something probably next week.
2103323	2108545	And we'll kind of give you more details on that when everybody's back and when it's not the holidays.
2109986	2110326	Also...
2113729	2116009	I don't think we have a lot else to talk about in housekeeping tonight.
2116049	2120051	Just the stuff with our Facebook, of course.
2120091	2125933	We have OL Army on Facebook, MySpace at username Orange Lounge Radio, and LiveJournal at Orange Lounge.
2126493	2132956	So, unless you can think of anything for housekeeping tonight as far as news goes, but not a lot going on with the show otherwise.
2133476	2134176	Same old, same old.
2135377	2135897	No, the...
2137515	2142479	No, I can't think of anything other than Burger King Tender Crisp sandwiches aren't that great.
2142919	2143099	Nice.
2144140	2145261	All right, we're going to get into the news tonight.
2145321	2147742	Oh, before we get into the news tonight.
2149840	2154223	We usually do our little thing on Bobby's show before we go live.
2154483	2158826	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who we follow on All Games Radio Live Sunday nights.
2159627	2162949	I don't know if you guys heard it, but there was some weird little cryptic message.
2163469	2166591	And I tried to ask Bobby about it, but he's totally ignoring my text.
2167032	2169213	But I'm trying to figure out what that website was.
2169393	2170734	I don't know, did you guys hear it?
2170774	2174556	It was something like FLive.net or something?
2174737	2175577	FNG Live?
2175897	2178319	I couldn't hear it all, but I don't know.
2179991	2181492	I'll have to go back and download it and check it out.
2182172	2182872	Something weird going on.
2183652	2184613	Alright, let's get into the news.
2184893	2186193	And tell Bobby to stop ignoring me.
2186333	2187754	This is very rude, Bobby.
2188554	2190134	Alright, I'm calling you out.
2190215	2192135	Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
2192215	2192995	Loki, why don't you start off?
2193336	2199718	Okay, well, a couple weeks ago, the brand new download content for Grand Theft Auto 4 was announced.
2200858	2205380	Grand Theft Auto's Lost and the Damned, or Lost and Damned, I guess.
2206500	2211146	Which is going to revolve around the biker gang that was in Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost.
2211987	2213489	And would be a brand new thing.
2214270	2215432	I guess a brand new story mode.
2215472	2218796	Doesn't really add anything like I wanted to it, like tanks and crap, but...
2220031	2221071	Hey, new story, sweet.
2222332	2226554	It was going to be released in February.
2227234	2239360	Right now, though, what's interesting is GameStop has the download content available to purchase on their website, which is supposed to be released in February on the 17th.
2240420	2244602	And so apparently you'll be able to buy this redemption card at GameStop.
2244862	2248324	I mean, talk about a way to whore that out, but...
2249602	2253487	Here's a hint folks, if you go to GameStop you're going to pay sales tax.
2253608	2255891	If you buy it online you're not going to have to pay sales tax.
2256492	2258354	At least you shouldn't have to pay a sales tax.
2259496	2260838	So don't buy it from GameStop.
2262039	2263221	That's pretty easy right there.
2264222	2266626	Don't some states charge you sales tax even on the download stuff?
2267216	2268636	Well, in that case, it doesn't matter then.
2269237	2274538	But then again, it costs you gas to drive down the GameStop.
2274578	2276158	Gas is cheap right now.
2276239	2276999	Have you noticed?
2278559	2281580	In the two weeks we've been off, gas dropped a dollar.
2281620	2282620	What are you talking about?
2282760	2283821	It's still a cost.
2283941	2288622	And even after all that, it's just to buy a code that you would enter in to download it anyway.
2288682	2290642	So just save yourself the time.
2291043	2291963	Save them the...
2292683	2295486	Ego of being able to pre-order cards.
2295686	2297567	I mean, that's sad.
2298148	2300490	Just go buy it online.
2301150	2302952	Why do you even need to buy the game sub?
2304794	2306715	Well, maybe it's just the convenience.
2306875	2307616	You know what?
2307976	2309237	Wait, when is this coming out?
2309658	2310038	February.
2310338	2310739	Oh, never mind.
2310779	2312660	I was going to say so people could buy it as a Christmas present.
2312841	2314282	No, so they can pre-order more stuff.
2314322	2320027	So they can get you to turn in some games as a pre-order download content so they can get another five bucks from you.
2321414	2329476	I'm sorry, but the fact that you would pay for download content at a store and then go home and download it is just stupid.
2331516	2333217	According to me, I mean, what do I know, though?
2334437	2337257	Well, maybe somebody doesn't have internet capability or what have you.
2337277	2338718	Then you wouldn't buy the download content!
2338738	2339558	This isn't a disc!
2339618	2342579	It's a card with a code that you enter it in online and download it!
2342679	2343599	It's stupid!
2344079	2345219	Yes, yes, fine.
2345759	2347040	It's absolutely retarded.
2347200	2349020	Zushi says free poster at GameStop.
2350080	2350968	Woohoo!
2351351	2352239	Free poster!
2353405	2357608	Okay, well, if they've got a free poster, then I better go down there right now.
2358308	2359409	Sorry, I can't do the rest of the show.
2359429	2360529	I've got to get my free poster.
2360689	2361350	Well, look, look, look.
2361430	2362570	Hey, I like free things.
2363931	2367994	In fact, I would be probably one of the three people who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
2368794	2380201	And if you actually want to order Grand Theft Auto 4, a pre-order, if you want to do it for your PC, order Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, you can actually get a free copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City just for placing the pre-order.
2380661	2391968	This is all via Steam, so Valve and Rockstar Games teamed up, and if you pre-order Grand Theft Auto 4 PC via Steam, then Vice City will be free.
2393229	2393989	Well, that's awesome.
2394169	2398992	Which, by the way, you've got to do it right now, because Grand Theft Auto 4 releases, like, what, Tuesday on PC?
2399493	2406497	That's awesome, except Anna Dreyas was way better anyways, and Vice City this time is really old.
2407638	2407938	I don't know.
2408988	2410170	Just buy Grand Theft Auto 4.
2410230	2412814	You don't even need extra stuff for it.
2417645	2428528	So anyways, speaking of other things, Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC has the ever infamous secure ROM in it now.
2428788	2433329	Thankfully though, there's not going to be as much limitation as some of these other games.
2434209	2441251	There is no limit on concurrent installations, but you will have to authenticate it once you've installed it.
2442331	2446254	And you'll have to, I guess, authenticate it again if you reinstall it.
2446574	2454458	So it's basically just to make sure that the CD-ROM, I guess, is... I don't know, in your drive when you're playing the game or something like that.
2454678	2455339	Something stupid.
2456560	2461743	But I can't help but think this is probably going to be cracked next week already.
2462523	2466826	I mean, Secure ROM has really been no obstacle for a lot of people...
2467819	2470000	Anyways, it's quite a controversial thing.
2470041	2474564	I mean, it's not just the limited installations is pissing people off, but the whole, you know, that whole thing.
2474584	2481008	And I don't know whether you would call it a rumor if it's a proven fact or what, but the whole like, you know, that it might screw up your drive.
2481468	2484430	Well, I already have it installed in my system and nothing's messed up so far.
2484550	2486832	So, yeah, it doesn't really matter for me.
2488112	2492756	But then again, I'm not buying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4.
2494438	2496540	DarkTetsuya relays an interesting comment.
2496841	2499123	He said, it's like I told the people at GamePolitics.
2499523	2504208	Considering how hard Securom is to get rid of, I'd rather take my chances with Trojans and Keyloggers.
2507551	2512416	You just, you know, have a trusted place to download your wares, I guess.
2514181	2516361	I guess so, although you shouldn't be advocating piracy.
2516401	2519222	I don't think we should necessarily be advocating secure ROM either.
2519322	2520722	I'm not advocating piracy.
2520742	2524103	I'm just saying I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC.
2524123	2525223	Because you already have it on 360.
2525263	2527363	What do you need it on PC for, right?
2528803	2531724	I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC.
2532524	2533784	Well, yeah, because I do have it.
2533824	2534704	I've already finished it.
2534804	2541606	There's no reason for me to actually play this on PC other than it looks prettier and, well, you know, I do have a game PC now.
2541626	2542906	I might as well put games on it.
2543386	2543706	All right.
2545169	2545990	All right, I got you.
2546010	2549693	So you're just looking forward to all the hacking.
2549873	2550173	Oh, yeah.
2550193	2552095	That's all I'm looking forward to.
2552575	2554077	Can Securum prevent that?
2554817	2559481	Or do you think that they wouldn't bother because that's kind of the reason why people get it on PC is to screw with it?
2559521	2566207	No, it's not going to affect it at all because Securum only really protects the main executable for it.
2566567	2571792	All the data files are what's going to be modified to whatever you want to do with it.
2573257	2574078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2590089	2593192	Oh yeah, PETA did a little spoof on Cookie Mama.
2593452	2607863	Apparently they don't really care about people's trademarks or anything like that because it's parody, but I mean, seriously, it's just... It was really just an overall excuse to get people to watch the video that's embedded there.
2608203	2612646	Majesco had a really cute response to it where they actually quoted Mama, and I thought that was very cute what they did.
2613867	2617690	But as far as PETA goes, love them or hate them, there ain't...
2619291	2619831	It's working.
2620071	2621232	People are talking about it.
2621372	2629254	And I'll tell you what, probably hundreds and thousands of people saw that video that wouldn't have before simply because it did tie into video games.
2629294	2632535	So love them or hate them, they did what they had to do.
2633195	2635936	And it worked for all intents and purposes, I suppose.
2637057	2642438	As much as I don't necessarily agree... It's not that I don't agree with PETA 100%, but...
2644659	2647142	I just wanted to say Majesco had a very cute response to it and props to them
2665000	2669124	I was going to say that there was another story that I think is kind of big.
2669824	2671746	The story kind of got blown over a little bit.
2672346	2679952	Eidos, once again back in the spotlight, for trying to fix their Metacritic scores for Tomb Raider Underworld.
2680353	2683835	Apparently, they sort of blew...
2685973	2686893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2711520	2712382	Thanks for watching!
2727851	2729752	That's not the first time I've heard of something like that, though.
2729772	2737538	I mean, that's the first time I've heard of the Metacritic spin on it, but I've definitely heard of companies saying, like, you know, well, what review are you going to give it?
2737558	2739779	Oh, well, if you're going to give it a high review, then you can post it early.
2739819	2740940	You can break the embargo.
2741320	2745083	But if you're not going to give it a high review, then you have to wait until, you know, the street date.
2745103	2753809	That's kind of messed up, and there's probably a good reason why that a low review might be, you know, warrant this game.
2753849	2757231	But apparently the Tomb Raider Underworld version for the Wii,
2758553	2759634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2787318	2788999	How do they give you a save?
2790419	2792060	You have to go download it off the internet.
2792200	2793901	Oh, because I'm sure everybody can just do that.
2794101	2794321	Yeah.
2795101	2796522	I think it's really annoying.
2796882	2797342	Interesting.
2797382	2800603	I'm just kind of trying to check out the Metacritic scores.
2800863	2803324	78 is the current score on the PlayStation 3 version.
2803344	2804005	That's not bad.
2804085	2806226	That's not a bad score, all things considered.
2806246	2806906	Look at the Wii version.
2807306	2807986	Wii version has a 68.
2808346	2809567	That's not too bad.
2810387	2812728	That's actually not a horrible score.
2812808	2814309	It's in the yellow, but it's...
2816238	2817239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2832316	2832376	A 28.
2832476	2832496	A 28.
2861387	2866110	Game Party 2 Midway Lawn Darts Beanbags Horseshoes Shit Game
2884494	2886156	It's unoriginal, it's also dirt cheap.
2886216	2889459	It's $20, and that sold actually pretty well, from what I remember.
2889499	2896325	But that's $20 that, honestly, you know, despite all the crap I gave it earlier, it's $20 that's better spent on Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix.
2898847	2906795	And honestly, you know, despite the hard time I gave Street Fighter 2, I mean, it still is Street Fighter 2, which is better than, like, 80% of the Wii games out there right now.
2907475	2907996	If not more.
2909689	2911070	Some of the other stuff from last week.
2911110	2919372	There was a new update to the Wii that broke the Twilight hack and all that stuff.
2919472	2923573	And also targeted modded save files and some other stuff.
2925114	2928475	And apparently, yeah, it was, you know, bad.
2928915	2936457	And what it did enhance, though, is it added, I guess, the ability to use USB keyboards in the Mi Channel or something like that for when you're typing stuff.
2937337	2938578	What's funny, though, is it got...
2939498	2967217	Rebroken again a few days later by hackers and they released a new version of the Twilight update or the Twilight hack that allowed you to install the Homebrew channel but still though thanks for trying and then finally one last thing a couple things that were kind of interesting new arcade games and Guitar Hero apparently is coming to the arcade and the weirdest part about it is Konami's helping them
2968277	2969158	Thanks for watching!
2987214	2989135	I don't know, they've got a little bit of experience there.
2989695	2992297	There is going to be some online functionality with it.
2993397	2998940	No word if they're going to actually have any additional songs or if it's just going to be stuff from Guitar Hero 3.
2999680	3006884	But the hardware itself looks like kind of the World Tour guitars but with arcade parts.
3008248	3015214	So look, for those essentially that were hoping that Konami would one day bring Guitar Freaks out to the US, forget it.
3016055	3016836	Forget it.
3016976	3017436	It's done.
3019598	3030749	These folks at Activision and Neversoft, well I guess you can't say Neversoft, but Activision and so forth and Red Octane have their mouths firmly planted on Konami's cock where it ought to be.
3031489	3034771	because it's kind of where the idea came from in the first place, one could argue.
3035311	3042194	And Konami likes it and they're getting theirs from it, so it's a win-win deal all around.
3043054	3043915	This is what it's going to be.
3045055	3045655	Take it or leave it.
3046356	3054780	And of course they say that that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be a Guitar Freaks game, but that basically means that there's not going to be a Guitar Freaks game, I mean, more or less.
3056040	3059822	Then all the other games that were being shown off as well, American Idol, they're going to have a
3060382	3061122	Beatmania 2DX 16 Empress
3084511	3090835	EA apparently is teaming up with GameStop and it's an idea that they're throwing around right now.
3090855	3094418	They're offering people a season pass.
3094778	3095919	According to a...
3097699	3106766	survey that's been sent out, they were throwing out the idea of having an EA Sports season pass where someone would buy this for, say, a $20 enrollment fee.
3106826	3113771	And what would it do is it would cut 33% of the cost from all EA Sports games that were purchased in that year.
3114332	3121257	So if you bought the pass and you say you're a person that buys the Maddens, the NCAA football, and all that stuff, you would save 33% off each game.
3124281	3145348	which I mean it's not a bad deal if you think about it because you're actually saving you know 20 bucks a game about so if you buy a lot of games or if you even buy one game with this deal I mean it's worth it to do it because you actually break even with the first game and then you start saving money with the second game but once again they get you to buy more than one game so
3148436	3150958	This is the solution for a weakening economy, I suppose.
3151038	3152779	Get you hooked in early.
3153279	3154240	Season pass.
3155260	3156441	I guess that's how it's going to go.
3157962	3160684	Because, see, here's the other thing about the season pass.
3161725	3169530	You say, for example, you may have bought NBA 2K10 or whatever next year.
3169870	3175433	Well, now, say if you buy the season pass for Madden or something like that, and you're thinking about buying an NBA game...
3176595	3176815	True, true.
3183433	3183833	Interesting.
3184734	3188856	I guess we'll see how this plays out, but I'm not much of a sports game fan, so it's not like it's a deal I'm going to take.
3188876	3197041	But I know there are people out there that might just want to jump on the deal, because a deal is a deal, and if you are a person that buys these games, this isn't necessarily bad news.
3197501	3201324	And if you are a person that buys sports games, think about it this way.
3201744	3202264	Get with your friends.
3202344	3208488	One person buys that, or chip in for the season pass, and you just have one person buy all your games.
3209048	3209408	There you go.
3209468	3209928	And there you go.
3209988	3210589	Save a lot of money.
3210609	3211189	Work the system.
3211569	3213570	I don't know if this is actually going to happen, but we'll see.
3214370	3214671	All right.
3214711	3215671	We will see what happens.
3216792	3217012	Wow.
3217032	3218912	So it sounds like it was a pretty busy week last week.
3219133	3219313	Yes.
3219633	3225676	And here I was spending my gaming time watching Netflix on the 360, and I watched a documentary about gay bars in Mississippi.
3226656	3227016	No kidding.
3228757	3229897	I'm telling you, they have everything.
3229917	3232018	They have documentaries on everything on Netflix.
3232539	3233079	Everything.
3234454	3236376	I started a documentary about Walmart.
3252296	3253417	That's my biggest problem.
3253437	3254377	Maybe it's just the one here.
3254958	3257079	But yeah, so I thought I'd check out the documentary.
3257099	3258540	The documentary is on everything.
3259261	3259721	On Netflix.
3259881	3260261	Everything.
3260542	3260862	Alright.
3261362	3265365	Well, we were talking a little bit about Street Fighter 2 during our gaming week.
3265885	3267866	And it's interesting.
3267886	3272610	It kind of coincided with the Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
3272730	3275291	They're actually doing a lot of different promotional stuff.
3275311	3277013	You may remember with Pinball FX.
3277413	3278834	They had a special table for it.
3278874	3281836	They have special themes out for Xbox.
3282896	3285737	and your Xbox Dashboard.
3285837	3287878	And I think there's some on the PlayStation Network as well.
3288238	3298961	Well, also coming to your favorite sack puppet game, LittleBigPlanet is getting four Street Fighter 2 skins.
3298981	3304383	They're going to have a Chun-Li, a Guile, looks like Zangief, and Ryu.
3305243	3320121	and those are all going to be available soon apparently it's actually been leaked out but they have the pictures online and I'd say that's pretty conclusive if you ask me but you know matter of time before these are released I could see maybe even next week so
3321971	3322291	Got any?
3323252	3327093	And I'm sure they're going to be probably about like five bucks or something.
3327313	3328714	Because they're usually about two bucks a skin.
3329454	3332635	Yeah, I don't know how I feel about paying for the LittleBigPlanet skins.
3332815	3333316	I don't.
3333576	3334736	It's just a little silly.
3334796	3335897	I just download all the free ones.
3336237	3337437	Yeah, I download the free ones too.
3337457	3339558	Did you get the turkey stuck on your head?
3339578	3341059	No, I forgot to get that one.
3341279	3343000	I got the Venus Flytrap one.
3343020	3343900	That was the last one I remember getting.
3343920	3345721	They also have one that's a TV stuck on their head.
3345941	3350163	To be honest, I haven't played a lot of LittleBigPlanet lately thanks to World of Warcraft.
3350203	3350963	But, you know.
3351604	3352445	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3376627	3377488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3390188	3397575	I didn't go out on Black Friday I went out to breakfast on Black Friday and we had a hard time trying to find a place to park in the damn parking lot and you know what it was a parking lot for?
3412888	3413429	Mervins!
3414089	3415310	You know what's big about Mervins?
3415991	3417172	They all went out of business.
3418112	3421355	They're not even doing anything for Black Friday except further liquidations.
3424738	3427920	So I went to a theme park for Black Friday and I actually had a lot of freaking fun.
3428541	3431323	It was fairly empty and I got to ride some pretty awesome coasters.
3431343	3434065	Those of you from SoCal, X2 is awesome.
3434465	3435406	Just wanted to get that out there.
3436164	3436744	Anyhow, sorry.
3440006	3442667	Let's talk about more gaming news.
3442727	3446950	I did dog on the soundtrack for Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, but you know what?
3446970	3456014	The people at OC Remix do a lot of great remixes, and although I didn't enjoy these remixes in the particular game, I think these might be kind of fun to listen to outside of the game.
3457035	3460917	If you want to, you can download the remix soundtrack for free!
3461457	3463878	It's available right there at Overclocked Remix.
3463898	3467380	If you go over to ocremix.org you can download the soundtrack for free.
3467780	3468380	And you know what?
3468420	3472662	Despite the hard time I gave this game earlier, it is very hard to complain about something that's free.
3473022	3476204	So props to all these folks who spent their time putting it together.
3476704	3479726	And don't get too mad at me because I dogged it in the game earlier.
3480106	3481967	I do think it's a good thing they're putting it out there for free.
3483334	3484855	Thanks guys.
3485015	3493718	Also, speaking of Street Fighter 2 HD Remix, if you live in Europe, you have a little more time to think about whether you want to purchase it or not, especially if you're a PlayStation owner.
3494339	3499301	No worries for you Xbox 360 folks, but the game was delayed on PlayStation Network.
3500581	3506022	It was released in North America as scheduled the day before it came out on Xbox 360.
3507003	3511144	European 360 owners hopefully got the game a little late.
3511244	3513604	I don't know if it actually ended up coming out at all.
3514204	3517305	Hopefully somebody in chat can clarify it, but it was delayed there in Europe.
3517325	3519206	It's funny now that I think of it.
3519226	3520486	I think they've got it by now, just so you know.
3524187	3539134	Well, I was just saying, I was wondering why they were releasing the PlayStation 3 version a day before the Xbox 360, but now that we think about it, that they don't have a demo for the PS3 version, people don't know that it sucks.
3539334	3544317	And so, you know, that kind of goes back to your theory that that's why they kind of rushed the demo for it.
3545617	3548839	And maybe, you know, one extra day without the demo, people can't try it and...
3550891	3556535	I don't think it's necessarily that Capcom thinks the game sucks because it's getting good reviews.
3556635	3558896	Obviously, I'm just missing something.
3559417	3566802	I guess for the fighting fan diehard, all the little tweaks they've done with the game and so on to balance and so on make it worth it for them, which is fine.
3568163	3573426	Keep in mind, I am not a hardcore fighting game fan, nor have I ever confessed to be, but I do enjoy the occasional fighter.
3574167	3576328	I actually do enjoy the Mortal Kombat games.
3576368	3577649	I know that makes me weird, but whatever.
3577969	3579170	Soul Calibur, especially.
3579270	3580111	Love Soul Calibur games.
3580131	3580611	They're a lot of fun.
3582072	3582332	Anyhow.
3583452	3583752	Whatever.
3583932	3584853	Sorry, I'm getting off track.
3584873	3586073	That's alright.
3586093	3591235	Something else coming to the PlayStation Network, which has been teased before, I think, by us.
3591996	3598018	Soldner X, which was a PC game, originally available, I think, mainly on PlayAsia.com.
3598058	3600059	I remember tons of advertisements for it.
3600379	3605901	Pretty awesome looking HD classic shooter game.
3606402	3607442	They do have it available.
3607682	3609203	It's going to be coming, apparently...
3610283	3623711	Next week for $10, and it should be, of course, full HD, 1080p, two-player co-op support, leaderboards, and trophy support, and it looks fantastic.
3624272	3625172	So that should be coming out.
3625192	3628174	I think actually that's this Thursday is when we'll be making it out.
3628254	3631416	Oh, yep, on the 4th for $10.
3631957	3635819	So definitely worth checking it out, especially if you're a fan of Gradius or something like that.
3636159	3637020	Really cool-looking game.
3637660	3640341	I would love to check this game out, but SingStar ABBA.
3641241	3642421	I'm not going to have time.
3643281	3645542	I've got Dancing Queen to sing to my heart's content.
3645682	3651263	Personally, I just haven't really been downloading anything on the PlayStation Network because they don't have those prepaid cards.
3651283	3652964	I don't like buying my points.
3653004	3657465	I like trading in crap that I don't want for points.
3657785	3658605	I thought they did now.
3658905	3660185	I thought they did have the cards now.
3660425	3663006	In certain stores, I don't think GameStop has them yet.
3663706	3664509	GameStop GameStop GameStop
3670928	3676894	Well, let's talk about some releases around the world that are going to be coming out in this next week.
3676954	3681278	And we'll start off with Japan and what's coming out there on December the 4th on the Xbox 360.
3681979	3685963	Fallout 3 gets its Japanese version this week, so check that out.
3686023	3689666	Saints Row 2 also gets a Japanese release on December 4th.
3689706	3693910	So if you live in Japan and want to check out one of Loki's favorite games, Saints Row 2 is where it's at.
3694691	3694891	On the PS3
3710431	3721656	Assassin's Creed is getting a price reduction, but if you want some new games, you can check out ProYaku Spirits 5 Kanzaban is coming out as well as Saints Row 2 on the PlayStation 3, both on December 4th.
3722256	3727919	If you want to look at some other consoles like the Nintendo Wii, you can get Wii Speak comes out on December 4th.
3727999	3729460	It's the standalone thing there.
3729900	3735282	Cooking Mama 2, Taihan Mama wa Oshiyogashi comes out from Taito.
3735362	3736463	Cooking Mama 2 in Japan.
3736923	3737844	on the Nintendo Wii.
3738344	3741986	And if you want to check this game out, 428 is the name of the game.
3742006	3746049	428, Fusa Sarita Shibuya Day comes out.
3746149	3748271	An interactive graphic novel.
3748471	3750332	Yeah, that looks kind of neat, actually.
3750552	3751553	It looks like real actors.
3751593	3753194	It got a perfect score from Famitsu.
3753474	3753934	Really?
3754135	3755275	Yeah, perfect.
3755315	3755856	40 out of 40.
3756336	3758277	Yet you don't hear much about it.
3758478	3761480	Now here's a game that looks like it could work for a hardcore game.
3761560	3764502	Oh, it's got live cutscenes mixed in it and stuff.
3765512	3767934	So this isn't a game that they can really release here at all.
3768915	3770237	Not without some major overhaul.
3770257	3772058	They have to reshoot everything.
3772799	3778024	That's too bad because there's a game that might be something that us American, we hardcore gamers are looking for.
3779454	3781335	Unfortunately, I'll have to understand Japanese, I guess.
3781375	3786457	Hey, PlayStation 2, Dragon Ball Z, Infinite World comes out on December 4th on PlayStation 2.
3786998	3788218	Yet another Pachinko game.
3788258	3791120	It's Volume 11 of Pachisla Koryuku series.
3791780	3795342	And yes, it's another Evangelion PlayStation.
3796543	3797023	Pachinko Game.
3797564	3798985	Real Road also comes out.
3799025	3801027	That's R-O-D-E Road.
3801527	3806371	Real Road comes out in regular and limited edition flavors on the PlayStation 2 this week.
3806531	3811336	And it looks to be an adventure game but kind of with some role playing elements.
3812967	3814407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3839207	3841648	and it's kind of a busy week on the Nintendo DS.
3841708	3843229	Another Pachinko game there as well.
3843809	3846410	Hajime no Ippo, The Fighting comes out as well.
3847090	3847551	Busy, busy.
3847911	3851692	And as far as the PSP goes, I don't think there's a whole lot.
3851892	3855154	Oh no, they got a big, big game coming out this week in Japan on PSP.
3855414	3857075	One big release, one big, big game.
3857655	3859556	Loco Roco 2 comes out this week in Japan.
3860056	3860536	Yay!
3860556	3862117	That's a big, big title there in Japan.
3862859	3863841	DarkSakura.com
3877009	3881052	SingStar Classics Animal Crossing Let's Go to the City Prince of Persia PlayStation 3
3905507	3908428	and Nintendo DS all this next week in Europe.
3908608	3915470	And also, if you're a Fire Emblem fan, that's a big title coming out on the DS as well as some Dragon Ball Z titles, Dragon Ball Z Origins.
3916090	3919972	And lastly, one PC title I want to get out there, Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods.
3920212	3922092	Those are your Europe release dates this week.
3922633	3923833	Filling in for Dark Sakura tonight.
3924233	3924553	All right.
3925033	3929574	U.S., not a whole lot coming out this week, but this is the biggest week of December.
3930214	3930994	That's pretty sad.
3931114	3936955	But this week we have Destroy Humans, Path of the Theron on Xbox 360.
3938756	3939256	Let's see.
3939376	3944797	Neopets Puzzle Adventure on PC, DS, and Wii, I believe.
3945637	3948097	Mushroom Men, Rise of the Fungi for DS.
3948958	3950718	Nancy Drew, The White Wolf on the Wii.
3952019	3967319	SlingoQuest on the DS Mushroom and the Spore Wars on the Wii Prince of Persia on PS3 and Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC MyFitnessCoach on the Wii
3969014	3973198	Tales of Despereaux on the PS2, Wii, and DS.
3973579	3976822	The last game from Brash because they went under.
3977483	3977903	Fun, fun.
3978684	3981467	My Fun Facts Coach from Ubisoft.
3982248	3986252	Wordfish from Ubisoft, both on the DS there.
3986752	3991377	Kingdom Hearts Chains of Memories on PlayStation 2.
3992718	3997141	SingStar Abba Vampire Story Ski and Shoot Prince of Persia The Fallen King DS
4016696	4019118	and Animal Boxing on the DS.
4019178	4020359	I remember that Destiny game.
4020519	4022441	Kind of a weird looking thing.
4022721	4023402	Family Party 30.
4024503	4025223	Great games.
4026024	4030708	That's from Game Factory and I think it's actually a port of a simple series game from the...
4033570	4039573	Dreamer Puppy Trainer King of Fighters Orochi Saga on the Wii
4049418	4052041	Happy Cooking on the DS from Ubisoft Spray
4064187	4066028	Some crappy French games.
4066208	4068309	Emma at the Farm and Emma in the Mountains.
4068570	4069790	I love your description.
4070231	4071631	It's just some crappy French games.
4071651	4072712	They are really bad.
4072792	4073733	It's for little girls.
4073753	4075474	It's really bad.
4076114	4078395	And then Bigfoot Collision Course on the Wii.
4078855	4083578	And that is it for the first week of December.
4083618	4086480	And sadly, that is the most populated week of the month.
4087162	4087863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4106064	4106524	Thanks for watching!
4123328	4130092	Alright, well, hey, if you're not looking to get new games, you can still continue to supplement the ones you have from download content.
4130232	4134855	And in January, Fallout 3 is going to be getting some new download content.
4135216	4140859	Fallout 3 is one of those games I probably won't have the time to check out until January, so this will be just in time for that.
4142810	4143511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4163849	4174734	Operation Anchorage, which is where you go into a military simulation and you actually get to save Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese communist invaders.
4175294	4176214	No, not Sarah Palin.
4176974	4178155	I guess it's in the Fallout story.
4178995	4179455	The Pit.
4179996	4183577	You get to go to a raider town called The Pit, which is outside of Pittsburgh.
4183777	4184017	Get it?
4184157	4184538	The Pit?
4185118	4185318	Ha!
4186218	4189199	That's coming out in February, and then Broken Steel is coming out in March.
4189580	4192281	That's where you get to join the Brotherhood of Steel.
4193657	4195145	and forget it.
4195406	4196210	How can I follow a 90210 joke?
4198551	4201033	Fable 2 is getting some download content as well.
4201593	4206276	They just announced the brand new island that they're adding called Knothole Island.
4207197	4209819	And it's going to feature a bunch of cool stuff.
4210499	4214662	They're going to have three unique quests and three unique dungeons.
4215282	4219745	You can unravel the mystical secrets of the Resurrection Shrine.
4220826	4222807	Plus they're going to have some new outfits.
4223548	4227871	Like an armored knight outfit, an assassin, a barbarian, leather clad biker.
4228912	4229652	What the hell?
4230333	4244026	And six new weapons, a dozen of unique potions that I guess will drastically alter your appearance, new weapon customization, I guess they're going to have new augments, and 50 additional leaderboards.
4245809	4251490	and along with that they're going to have actually some free download content as well in case you don't want to buy it.
4251810	4257151	And of course that Knothole pack is going to be 800 Microsoft points.
4257491	4265053	Can I just say though that Knothole is a terrible name because it makes me think of a very naughty place because Knothole sounds too much like Balloon Knot.
4265533	4266853	You know what I mean?
4266913	4271274	That's a really bad, bad name for an expansion pack.
4272074	4274315	Knothole Island with the biker outfit.
4275942	4277083	I'm just saying, yo.
4278244	4279925	You thought Animal Crossing was gay.
4280005	4280686	I'm just saying.
4281006	4289411	Yes, and apparently, I guess the free download pack they're going to have is some stuff, I guess, teasing from the main download thing.
4289431	4295716	They're going to have Knight's Boots, Assassin's Gloves, a special weight loss potion, and a collectible silver book.
4297357	4302140	And you'll also want to download that in case you don't want to buy this content so you can play co-op with people that do.
4303925	4305166	And that might be good too.
4306826	4311869	There's a rumor now that Fable 2 will be hitting PCs sometime soon.
4311909	4323994	Apparently, an inside source claims that they've heard some information, I guess from someone at Lionhead, that Fable 2 would be coming to PCs on February 15th.
4326417	4327158	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4341491	4342311	Thanks for watching!
4363496	4363936	Teehee!
4364077	4365298	Heeheehee!
4365398	4369601	It's a game called Gabo, and it's actually a reworked version of Seaman 2, apparently.
4370462	4377807	This is all coming from Yut Saito's blog, and he's the guy who invented Seaman, if you can believe it.
4378428	4383572	And apparently, I guess it's still like a year away?
4384353	4385654	It's a ways off for this game.
4386494	4390998	But they have actually a little demo on the blog that you can look at, which is kind of interesting.
4392307	4399132	So, if you're a big fan of this series, which, you know, the series did have its fans, despite our whole little five-year-old joking.
4399813	4402455	And it's just interesting to see the iPhone kind of get more and more and more games.
4402475	4406638	You know, there was some rumor out there that the iPhone has crossed like 10,000 different apps.
4406658	4410822	I think that's a little high, but there's definitely a lot of stuff available on the iPhone now.
4411502	4413484	There's always room for C-Men on an iPhone.
4413544	4414104	Exactly.
4416826	4418948	Anyways, there was a rumor...
4420677	4422539	That I may have talked about a few weeks ago.
4422739	4423640	I don't remember.
4424500	4424941	Or do I?
4425762	4428584	About the new 360s that will be coming out.
4429025	4431106	Actually shipping now, apparently.
4432307	4433789	With onboard memory.
4434289	4434650	That's right.
4434690	4440094	The new arcade systems are supposedly shipping with the new Jasper chipset.
4440134	4445319	Which promises a cooler 65 nanometer GPU on the motherboard.
4445800	4446400	And they have...
4447541	4456950	expanded the onboard flash to 256 megabytes, which would be enough for storing the new Xbox experience.
4459733	4463496	So I guess going forward, it's of course going to be preloaded on all the different systems.
4463897	4467981	You can also use that space for game saves or whatever else you want to use it for.
4468001	4469022	It's just like an extra...
4470420	4472161	200 megs of space, which is kind of cool.
4472801	4484123	And apparently, I think the arcade system still will be coming with an external 256 megabyte memory card, so they're kind of doubling the onboard space with that, which is kind of neat.
4485004	4486044	And new is always good.
4488825	4490545	But you've known this for a while now, haven't you?
4491105	4491325	Maybe.
4492005	4492426	I don't know.
4494366	4495086	You tell me.
4496907	4497587	Alright, anyhow...
4500000	4502903	Professor Layton, the first movie is going to be coming out in January of 2010.
4523218	4524159	in Japan.
4524299	4525000	So there you go.
4525120	4530184	And if you don't know this series, Studio Ghibli definitely kind of influenced these games.
4530244	4532486	So it's probably not much of a surprise.
4532986	4533707	They didn't make the game.
4533727	4534888	They just influenced the games.
4536029	4540152	It's not a big surprise that this is going to be made into a movie eventually.
4540553	4546518	But you'll have to get a sub or something if you want to watch it here in the US or just pray that it'll come out here eventually.
4546738	4547799	I don't know.
4547819	4552861	Yeah, because they've had at least three or four different releases in that series in Japan.
4553422	4555323	It's just we haven't seen them all over here yet.
4555483	4558284	So it makes sense, and they're insanely popular over there.
4558645	4561446	Heck, I mean, they made an Animal Crossing movie over there too, remember?
4561646	4565148	Just to answer GameGuru's thing in chat, is Studio Ghibli making it?
4565688	4566629	No, they are not.
4566669	4569250	I was just saying that the games are Studio Ghibli-esque.
4569831	4570151	That's it.
4570851	4571512	Just a comparison.
4571972	4572872	Don't want to alarm anybody.
4573573	4573893	That's all.
4574636	4575216	Don't be alarmed.
4604403	4608705	So now it's my turn tonight to pick a classic game of the week that I think you all ought to be playing.
4610186	4617630	And I'm going to really dig deep tonight because I've been promising for quite some time that if I ever get to do another classic video game of the week, I would pick something from the Commodore 64.
4617690	4623594	This is exactly what I've picked tonight as a game from my childhood that I remember from a long time ago.
4623654	4627176	It's a game called Lazy Jones is tonight's classic game of the week.
4628775	4638460	Now, the interesting thing about Lazy Jones is that it was a game that was kind of made up of all these other smaller games that kind of came together in this big entity.
4638520	4643102	It was like WarioWare back before there was WarioWare, if this makes any sense at all.
4643482	4656028	And yeah, we're looking at a video of this game in progress here in the studio, and you can see this minigame, you are stabbing turkeys coming off a conveyor belt with a giant fork, and you have to avoid stabbing the telephone that's randomly bouncing around the screen.
4657942	4659184	and DarkSakura.com
4674401	4675202	The Spectrum Version
4689418	4692139	The video games are somewhat inspired by other games.
4692179	4697302	There are definitely games that are like Frogger, like Space Invader in here.
4697602	4699283	But there's also some games that have funny names.
4699323	4703584	Like there's a game in here called 99 Red Balloons.
4704045	4707806	This is a game where you just have red balloons that continually go up towards the top of the screen.
4707826	4713449	You try to get a hold of a couple of the balloons, and if you're able to do that, then you can get up to the top and give a woman a big kiss.
4713809	4741117	and then you get a balloon to go back down where you go up and down by grabbing these different balloons and none of these games go on a particularly long time you just play the game for about a minute until the clock runs out and your score basically transfers to the larger score that you have so this game is really wacky and just kind of takes us back to a time when you know really really was only one person that made games but the other thing that kind of made Lazy Jones special at least to me was the fact that it had a really unique soundtrack and I know you can kind of hear it in the background
4745996	4747137	is definitely kind of its own little thing.
4747517	4752039	Actually, I want to play for you one clip in particular from the game Lazy Jones by David Whitaker.
4752079	4754500	I want to see if it sounds familiar to you at all.
4754540	4755321	Here's a clip from the game.
4755401	4756021	Here we go.
4766567	4770109	Now that's a clip from the Lazy Jones game that came out years ago.
4770149	4771570	Did that sound familiar to anybody at all?
4771950	4772171	Yeah.
4772411	4776573	Yeah, it actually was sampled years later in 1999 by a band.
4779655	4782257	It was actually sampled by the group Zombie Nation.
4782997	4783578	Current craft 400.
4792424	4793625	Oh, yeah, it's the same song.
4793685	4801627	So, kind of funny, because the game was, you know, originally made with the C64 sound chip in it, and it's that kind of unique noise that is still used today.
4802127	4803227	So, there you go.
4803948	4805968	So, back to the clip here a little bit.
4805988	4812850	You know, I think one reason I just really remember this game was, you know, like I said, it was really awesome to have one video game that had, like, all these mini-games in it.
4813170	4816931	And you just kept trying to really increase your score in the mini-games, because some of them were really hard.
4817271	4819232	Because some of them would end, like...
4820132	4821013	Thanks for watching!
4841846	4842326	Thank you for watching!
4861195	4865980	Oh yeah, here's the random... There's two random doors, because there's only 15 minigames, so like 18 doors.
4866381	4871807	There's random things you'll walk into as well, like there's a broom closet that you'll randomly walk into, and then a potty.
4872488	4873949	And you watch your guy go to the bathroom.
4874009	4878575	Not explicitly or gross, but he just walks in there and then walks out.
4878775	4879536	It's so random.
4880257	4881298	But, there it is!
4882779	4893915	Lazy Jones for the Commodore 64 my classic game of the week and stowing away on a DarkSakura's classic game of the week segment she'll be back next week with her own pick
4894687	4896968	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
4897468	4903630	And when we come back, we'll have plenty more in Part B. We're going to talk about the Nintendo Wii a little bit and some of the top secret things going on with the Wii.
4904010	4907391	Talk a little Chrono Trigger and talk some PC games, which we don't talk about enough.
4907751	4909192	And we'll also open up the mailbag.
4909372	4912593	All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4918837	4923988	And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 30th of 2008.
4924930	4927035	One more month left in the year, if you can believe it.
4927075	4928719	Tomorrow will be on the 1st of December.
4929736	4931136	DarkSakura has the night off.
4953982	4955403	However though,
4984985	4993909	I believe, because Nintendo would not be so kind as to release an Excite Truck 2 so soon, it's probably going to be F-Zero.
4995690	4996390	Would be my guess.
4997751	5001412	Which is not necessarily bad, because Excite Truck was awesome.
5001733	5003233	I didn't even think about that.
5003393	5006515	So you keep that kind of awesome control...
5008581	5009061	You know what?
5009141	5014804	I don't mind if they release an Excite Truck 2 because I would be there lined up at midnight ready to buy that game.
5014844	5015824	That game was awesome.
5016564	5019546	Excite Truck, absolutely most favorite game of the Wii ever.
5020006	5022627	I do think F-Zero's gotta come out sooner rather than later.
5023007	5026749	Even though the AXGX thing, I guess, must have disappointed some folks.
5027049	5029290	I love F-Zero GX.
5029330	5030230	That's an amazing game.
5030851	5035232	I really hope... Yeah, as GameGuru says in chat, F-Zero WX would be awesome.
5036013	5036053	Um...
5036973	5041277	or as Actdeft says in chat, chat.orangeentree.com Excite Truck 2.
5041697	5042578	Excite yourself.
5043599	5045300	I think Excite Truck 2 would be awesome.
5045320	5050985	You don't even need to... This is one of those games that I would hope that they don't go back and try to tweak too much of it.
5051025	5052386	Just add a lot more tracks.
5052827	5055209	Add the ability to download new tracks later on.
5055629	5064677	Maybe four-player split-screen multiplayer or four-player multiplayer over the Wi-Fi service.
5065919	5066559	Just stuff like that.
5066599	5067380	Just really simple stuff.
5067400	5069120	They don't really need to go too crazy with it.
5069380	5070761	Maybe improve the graphics a little bit.
5070801	5074162	Hey, on F-Zero, you could have up to 30 people in a race on the GX.
5074463	5075963	I don't know if they could do that online.
5076023	5076924	That would be pretty awesome.
5076944	5077704	That would be pretty cool.
5077724	5078724	As long as you can't cheat.
5079725	5081305	Like, you know, Mario Kart, everybody cheats.
5081586	5084807	Well, I would have a feeling they probably would be able to cheat somehow.
5085087	5087028	Yeah, GS68 says it perfectly in chat.
5087268	5089349	F-Zero Wii needs to not have exploits, damn it.
5089769	5091350	F-Zero X has wall raping.
5091510	5094131	F-Zero GX has space flying and snaking and so on.
5095754	5102616	So, um, hopefully, yeah, hopefully it's, whatever it is, it's probably going to be awesome.
5102756	5106497	Because, like I said, Excite Truck was awesome, F-Zero would be really cool.
5107557	5109518	I'm hoping for another Excite Truck or F-Zero game.
5109718	5116660	If it's something new, great, you know, news always, you know, optimistically good, I guess.
5118722	5121912	Maybe this will be something they announce at E3.
5122012	5123115	Maybe that's why it's such a big secret.
5123155	5124881	And they have been working on it for two years now.
5126158	5128319	That's true, because what have you seen since Excite Truck?
5129159	5130560	That's why you haven't seen Excite Truck 2.
5130620	5132961	And do you think it would take them two years to make Excite Truck 2?
5133281	5134461	I'm hoping it is F-Zero.
5134501	5134981	Maybe.
5135322	5138303	If they're going to make it super awesome, maybe.
5139043	5142004	Do you think it might be randomly a non-racing game?
5142244	5142884	Or do you think no?
5142944	5143505	I don't think so.
5143525	5145425	This company only makes racing games.
5145886	5147346	And that's good, because you know what?
5147406	5148987	They know how to make a good racing game.
5151222	5152003	I'm optimistic.
5179045	5183726	Well, Capcom has actually kind of put out a statement about why these games are not coming out on the Wii.
5203532	5206914	Street Fighter 2 couldn't ever be WiiWare even at 480p.
5207314	5211396	The file size is just too large given the storage restrictions for WiiWare.
5211776	5215238	Theoretically, it could be discs-based, but there are no plans at the moment.
5216038	5216458	Here you go.
5216959	5223081	And to be honest, I mean, how good-looking would it really be if you took, like, an HD title and downscaled it to 480p?
5223201	5224242	It's just not even worth...
5225931	5226492	Thanks for watching!
5237192	5239113	God, I even forgot what it's called, Virtual Console.
5239393	5247056	Yes, and also in Japan, you remember next week we get Street Fighter versus, was it Tatsunoko or whatever?
5247497	5247797	Oh, yes.
5247857	5250298	Or Capcom versus, yeah.
5250738	5252759	See, that's what you need to be playing on there.
5253039	5256240	They port that over and do something with it, that'd be pretty awesome.
5257315	5258096	All right, well, there you go.
5258516	5260277	Moving on to stuff going on on the DS.
5260398	5262719	Hey, Chrono Trigger is coming out on the DS here.
5262900	5263920	It just came out this week.
5264301	5265762	I don't know anybody personally that picked it up.
5266342	5266903	I'm curious.
5267103	5267984	I haven't played it.
5268044	5271467	I did enjoy Chrono Trigger, but I still have to finish Final Fantasy IV on the DS.
5271507	5272608	I got a lot of DS playing to do.
5273228	5277129	Well, in Europe, of course, they got screwed and they don't have the game yet.
5277789	5280990	Apparently, though, it is coming out in February.
5281750	5286392	That's what some sources have told Eurogamer, is that the game is supposed to be making its way out there in February.
5286852	5296835	This, of course, the new Chrono Trigger DS version with the new dungeon, the new ending, two-screen display, touchscreen controls, Wi-Fi multiplayer, and so on and so on.
5297816	5299116	I don't get why it takes so long.
5299877	5300397	I don't get it.
5300877	5303858	It's already localized, so what's the delay for?
5304238	5319742	The only thing I can think of is this time of year, as far as duplication goes, a lot of the plants that duplicate games are at full capacity right now, and if they're thinking that they're not going to be able to duplicate this game enough to have adequate supplies...
5320182	5320703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5339620	5342021	But I want to get this comment from chat because I think it's good.
5343342	5356509	VXJasonXV says, The only people clamoring for Street Fighter HD Remix on the Wii are the 13, 14, 15 year olds who don't have the money for their own systems and only have the family Wii and won't be getting the 360 or PS3 as a gift or anything.
5357209	5357589	Good point.
5359330	5360391	Get a job!
5360411	5361752	I don't know.
5362672	5363593	Go out and get a job.
5363793	5364453	Just wait.
5364653	5365554	Seriously, I mean...
5367385	5392448	if there's anything you can learn from this whole Street Fighter Turbo HD remix thing is it pays to wait because if you bought the original Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo or whatever on Xbox Live Arcade now there's a new one that's coming out that's better it's like crap, I just wasted money on that remember if you wait for things to get ironed out there will be a version that will be coming to the Wii I'm sure
5394366	5397507	Just have to be patient.
5398008	5398708	Or get a job.
5399388	5404210	Something else that might be coming to the Wii, and once again, this kind of goes back to the Chrono Trigger thing.
5404250	5406491	I don't understand why they couldn't just bring it over.
5406631	5408672	The localization's done already.
5409853	5413354	Disaster Day of Crisis may be coming to North America.
5413875	5421078	Apparently, one person was emailing Nintendo customer support, I guess, regarding
5422276	5422556	and DarkSakura.
5439700	5442922	I don't see why they wouldn't because it's a Nintendo game.
5443522	5446663	It takes no effort on their part to bring it over here.
5447884	5448904	All the work's done already.
5449545	5451726	At the same time, though, what if the dude was wrong?
5452486	5456748	I think a lot of people are putting a lot of stock in what this rep says.
5456928	5458189	What if they made a mistake?
5458869	5481617	well if they made a mistake then yeah i could see but my point is it's done it's already been released in europe so it's translated already they've got it done it's just it bring it over if it's in english already you can bring it over here i'll see what the big while you're at it how about mother three right am i right translation hasn't been done over there
5483486	5485128	It's better than Wii Music
5511843	5513485	Didn't Mother 3 come out in the UK?
5513785	5513885	No.
5514446	5515066	I thought it did.
5515527	5518810	No, if it did, everyone wouldn't be bitching because they would be importing it.
5518930	5519851	Alright, I'm just crazy.
5519871	5526417	Yeah, because there wouldn't be an issue with why would they even have to do a fan translation then because it's already done for them.
5527238	5528359	There would be no more bitching.
5530962	5538267	Alright, well, apparently, We and WeFit have been a big cause of part of the Black Friday chaos.
5538928	5550556	The most popular products out there on Black Friday this year, and of course, if you've never heard of this, you probably don't live in the U.S., Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where people go fucking nuts over sales just in time for Christmas.
5550616	5553778	It's basically Canada's Boxing Day without any...
5557181	5562185	It's all a consumer holiday, specifically, whereas I think there's actually some reason for it in Canada.
5562525	5565287	But here, no, it was all made up by the stores.
5566208	5572033	Number one most popular product on Black Friday was the Nintendo Wii console.
5573294	5574615	Not a big surprise.
5574755	5579579	Number five Wii Fit was the number five biggest product on Black Friday.
5580199	5581060	Not surprised, eh?
5581781	5582583	I'm not surprised.
5583083	5586830	People will play it for a while and they'll be all excited about it and then they'll put it away.
5589074	5593302	But I bet it's a bunch of parents also buying it for their fat kids, right?
5594043	5594764	I don't know about that.
5595922	5597823	Fat Kids won't play that exercise game.
5599184	5601986	VXJSNXV says, I thought Boxing Day was December 26th.
5602066	5602647	Yes, it is.
5602747	5604788	Instead of the day of Thanksgiving, they have the day after Christmas.
5604808	5606169	But same idea.
5606749	5607930	It's chaos at the stores.
5607970	5611873	But I don't hear about Canadian Massacre at Walmart on Boxing Day either.
5613814	5615796	Canadians are smart not to shop at Walmart.
5615816	5616236	Exactly.
5616976	5618057	Well, not just that.
5618618	5623741	I'm assuming a little more civil because they didn't trample each other.
5624922	5625062	Yeah.
5625703	5625923	Sorry.
5627304	5633729	Apparently there's some news that Rare may do a new Killer Instincts game.
5635510	5639312	You know... How fucking often does this rumor come up?
5639613	5640153	What now?
5640253	5643816	What now has provoked the new Killer Instinct of the Week rumor?
5645397	5648018	Well, basically this is coming from...
5650680	5664384	You know, their studio manager, Matt Betteridge, and he says, Killer Instinct is an IP that is fondly remembered and we may do something with it, but it's a tricky market to be like the old Killer Instinct.
5665324	5666665	So basically, we would have to...
5667185	5668465	Thank you for watching!
5690530	5695394	I don't remember it being that awesome, so I don't really care if it comes out.
5695414	5698497	And to be honest, I don't really care about most things that Rare puts out.
5699217	5701799	So... No, I gotta say, it is pretty awesome.
5702300	5703661	I love me some Killer Instinct.
5703721	5704201	I really do.
5704241	5707544	That's why it pisses me off.
5708805	5710967	God, it just doesn't... I don't care.
5711047	5712968	Orchid vs. Spinal.
5713629	5714970	Come on, this game was awesome.
5716371	5718493	Well, they would have to put a lot of work into it, and...
5719628	5722752	As long as they throw in Cameo as an unlockable character because that would be weird.
5723452	5725415	And you could brutally murder her and that would be funny.
5727057	5727797	Alright, anyhow.
5730801	5732763	YYR in chat says, I'm from Rare.
5733104	5737549	Our official announcement is that there will be an official announcement made at an undisclosed time in our own heads.
5738250	5738610	There you go.
5740515	5753229	Anyhow, I am so angsty every time I hear this rumor about a freaking new Killer Instinct game because it seems like every other week there's some cryptic goddamn quote coming out of somebody's mouth from Rare that cock-teases a new Killer Instinct game.
5753569	5757233	And I'm getting the more angsty, the more and more time that goes by and they won't announce something already.
5757353	5758955	So, you know what this means.
5774551	5776852	Loki, you can start us off tonight, because DarkSakura's not here.
5778113	5779453	FQ to PopCap Games.
5780494	5789298	I was busy transferring all my saves and all my information from my old 20GB hard drive to my new 120GB hard drive for my Xbox 360.
5789778	5798182	Because I bought the hard drive used, I do not have a transfer cable that can facilitate just transferring everything in all one foul swoop, so I had to actually use memory cards.
5798682	5802424	And can you guess what two saves would not fucking transfer on there?
5803504	5829834	Zuma and Bejeweled 2 both PopCap games and why the fuck will they not transfer over all the other games for all the other systems including some of the PopCap games transfer just fine but for some reason Bejeweled 2 and Zuma have to be a little bit which happen to be the two the wife has to have exactly and so and they will not transfer I put something on their Twitter you know saying hey what the fuck you know why is this not working they're like
5830234	5831315	Well, we're looking into it.
5831515	5834177	Which means, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, complain, complain, complain.
5834237	5835318	Hold on, hold on.
5835378	5841763	Now, I know, despite this whole thing, me yelling at Rare, I know there are actually people from PopGapGames that do listen to this fair program here.
5841783	5842363	Patch the bitch.
5842463	5843224	That's what we need to do.
5843284	5844745	Patch this so that it will move.
5844805	5846446	Well, maybe this is the first time they're finding out about it.
5846466	5848087	That's an odd error.
5848328	5852150	I mean, that's not something that I think you could have foresight into either.
5852231	5855033	That's just an error out of the blue.
5855513	5858455	And that sounds like Microsoft's involved somehow, too.
5858495	5859416	It is strange that it is...
5859716	5861137	Just those two games.
5861177	5868441	Normally the limitation is that you can only transfer files to a memory card with the same profile.
5868481	5877726	So for example, I had to have a profile signed in on one console with the old hard drive and logged in as me and then had another console logged in as me as well.
5877807	5880348	I just copied the profile.
5881088	5887112	And I had to transfer from one profile to the memory card back to my profile on the other system.
5887714	5888475	and it will allow you to do that.
5888495	5892960	It won't allow you to transfer from a different profile or something like that because you can't do that.
5894181	5897242	But those were the only two games that would not let me transfer them at all.
5897462	5899622	You know what else would not let me transfer it?
5899782	5904163	Hexic HD would not let me transfer that game to the other hard drive.
5904564	5906264	And see, that's one of Microsoft's own games.
5906324	5909445	So you think there's something on a deeper level going on here.
5910105	5911785	I think you have misdirected anger.
5912466	5914146	Well, that they won't even let me re-download.
5914166	5914886	That's stupid.
5914986	5918307	So not that I really play that game, but it's still, come on, man.
5920730	5924933	So like if I deleted that game somehow by accident, then I would never be able to get it back.
5926774	5929376	Alright, my FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot.
5929416	5934219	I want to say FU to alcohol for being so nummy.
5934239	5938582	Because I had my first little sip of alcohol in like seven months the other day.
5938862	5942405	I said I would have a glass of wine on Thanksgiving and I had a Pinot Noir.
5943484	5944225	Thanks for watching!
5971081	5978488	Well, it's kind of interesting that we're coming off of the FUs of the week to this, but there's a brand new website called Bad Hacks.
5978808	5992421	It's badhacks.net, and it features a collection of ROM hacks that are, well, basically sexist, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, pro, and occasionally slightly amusing.
5994062	5997965	and apparently you can download all sorts of really bad hacks on there.
5999627	6005151	Some of the interesting stuff on the list here and I'm just going to kind of go down the list real quick.
6006052	6006793	Let's see here.
6009521	6034211	BabyMaker, BastardMaster, DeadBubbleBubble, DickAndMilk, DickKids, DickTales, FuckersQuest, GauntletXXX, GayGhostFuckers2, Homocop, InnerCityRansom, KillerMan, LittleRemo, TheChildAbuser, MarioNude, MegaCrap, MegaFag, MetalQueer,
6035414	6048102	Naked Little Mermaid, Naked Samus, Nazi Dr. Mario, Nude Punch-Out, Orgy Time, Pot Man 3, and then some of these really elaborate ones.
6048482	6049462	Happy Scrappy!
6051123	6058227	Super Nazi Penis Cartel Freedom Fighters Leet, and, uh, South Park Zelda.
6058548	6059368	Oh, that's not bad.
6060208	6062410	Um, what else here?
6062690	6062770	Uh,
6064645	6070737	Super Mario World Chaos Complex, Sex Pot Racing, fun fun stuff.
6071986	6075488	So, is it just me or is it a really fucking slow news week or something?
6075508	6076569	I mean, what the fuck?
6076609	6077530	Why is this news?
6077770	6078410	Seriously.
6078570	6079911	It's a really fucking slow news week.
6079931	6082033	People have too much fucking time on their hands.
6082073	6083974	You can also play Super Goatsy Brothers.
6084915	6087616	Oh, yippee, hooray, hi, yay, yip.
6088317	6089117	I'm so excited.
6089138	6093360	But yeah, there's lots of interesting stuff on there.
6093781	6095742	As if you couldn't find enough of these on your normal websites.
6095762	6097343	Wow, there's a whole website.
6098023	6099504	There's an entire website about it.
6099524	6100645	What's this God Hates You?
6100725	6101486	What's that a hack of?
6103987	6108369	Oh, it's like a... Is it a Bible game that they hacked or something?
6109609	6112291	Spiritual Warfare is... Okay, interesting.
6113411	6115132	Babymaker, what's that a hack of?
6115872	6116473	Dig Dug!
6116713	6117573	Oh, okay.
6117613	6118774	That's gonna be classy.
6123556	6123976	Fun times.
6125116	6125477	Anyways.
6125497	6128218	So, yeah.
6128278	6128418	Yeah.
6131042	6131722	Alright, whatever.
6132443	6133784	Look, let's talk about PC.
6133984	6138226	Look, if it's going to be a slow news week, then why don't we talk about some things we don't normally talk about here on the show.
6138246	6139487	That's PC gaming news.
6139907	6141247	Alright, you know the game Fear?
6142088	6143469	This was a pretty popular game that came out.
6143769	6147311	Actually, it was console as well as PC, but I think it was pretty well known for the PC.
6148071	6152093	Fear 2 Project Origin is the sequel to this game.
6152874	6154714	It's apparently being banned in Australia.
6154735	6158196	It was just recently refused classification by the Australian Classifications Board.
6158737	6159477	Don't they ban now?
6159937	6173423	Due to high violence, apparently Warner's trying to assess the situation, and they are right now appealing with the ACB and trying to figure out their options, trying to get Fear 2 released in Australia.
6173443	6175624	It was supposed to be coming out February 11th in Australia.
6176204	6183467	They're hoping they can turn that around, but you might have to import an underground copy of this game if you want to play this over in Australia.
6184208	6186048	Just buy the PS3 version.
6186389	6187049	It's region-free.
6189234	6190995	PC is region free too, right?
6191015	6191495	Exactly.
6192255	6192775	There you go.
6194416	6198036	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
6198156	6202898	It's the part of the show every week where we like to take some time to interact with you guys.
6202958	6208699	You guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we take some time to read our favorites here on the air.
6208719	6208699	... ...
6217259	6219179	I'm opening up the mailbag right now.
6221180	6223540	I hate it when we get freaking spam email.
6224440	6226761	Did somebody sign us up for spam email?
6226781	6228441	This is like a ha-ha-ha thing.
6229401	6229781	Jerks.
6230521	6233722	No, I think Spider signed us up for spam email.
6233902	6234402	It sucks.
6234422	6235982	Don't we disguise our emails on the side?
6236023	6236563	I don't remember.
6236783	6238143	Yeah, but they still find a way.
6239243	6242924	YYR sent us an email and wants to know, please tell us what the meaning of life is.
6243124	6243404	Thanks.
6244702	6245862	Loki, what is the meaning of life?
6247003	6247583	To live.
6251345	6253365	You can make the easy 42 joke here.
6253986	6258687	Or I could give you like a serious deep answer, but this is a show about dick and fart jokes.
6258707	6259848	I don't know if it would fit in here.
6261155	6263897	Let me put it this way, the meaning of life is to have impact on others.
6264117	6265238	That's what I believe the meaning of life is.
6289918	6291718	Wow, that's way too deep for this program.
6294979	6298020	Moving on, we have another email from Katakos.
6299780	6301641	Also, sometimes it goes by Reese.
6302601	6307622	Lord Katakos wants to say congratulations on episode 300, even though it's not over 9,000.
6308422	6312363	But yeah, you guys and girls just keep on going so you can get to 9,001 to be a prodigy.
6312443	6314324	Right now we're at 50%, but that's halfway there.
6315285	6315705	P.S.
6315785	6317407	Rob, you need to get 100% healed.
6317467	6320510	Come to the server Illidan and I'll use Healing Wave on you and you'll be good to go.
6321211	6323073	Just a general note to WoW players out there.
6323153	6324335	I'm not changing servers.
6324435	6325356	I mean, I don't mean to be rude.
6325676	6330201	But I have a guild of real life friends where I'm at on Ravencrest.
6330842	6335127	As much as the community calls that server Raven Fail because we have no progression whatsoever on our server.
6335787	6343068	It's pretty sad when our social guild is like one of the top 10 horde rating guilds on the entire server and we kind of sleep our way through.
6344229	6348969	I don't mean like literally, but we're very casual in our approach.
6349009	6349829	It's not to say we don't work hard.
6349849	6353590	We're very casual in our approach and we've managed to clear quite a bit of stuff as a guild.
6353610	6357111	These are most of the Death Cake people you remember from Final Fantasy XI.
6357191	6358291	Yes, I remember.
6359031	6363812	I was going to say that we have over 9,000 minutes worth of programming, so there you go.
6363832	6364492	That's true.
6364992	6365693	That's true.
6365713	6369736	That's a good way to look at it.
6369916	6376302	If you count up all the to-go podcasts and all that stuff, when we were doing almost five hours a night for a little while, remember that?
6376342	6379244	We'd do a three-and-a-half-hour show, then an hour-long podcast.
6379284	6379865	Oh, my God.
6380265	6381206	Those were the days, right?
6383648	6386651	Anyway, how was an email there from...
6387455	6389737	I'm not sure what the point was, but hey, whatever.
6390838	6393800	We have an email from Fabrice in Belgium.
6394440	6396722	Wants to say hello and I hope there's a show tonight.
6396802	6398984	And this was written last week when there was no show.
6399044	6401405	So I want to apologize to Fabrice from Belgium.
6401445	6402266	I'm sorry.
6403167	6405909	He says, anyways... He puts that in quotes.
6406449	6407049	Anyways...
6409239	6409939	Like Loki style.
6410239	6416501	I'm planning on buying a pinball machine in the future as I understand the best pinball machines are arguably the Addams Family and Terminator 2.
6417162	6418382	But I'm a big fan of Sega.
6418762	6420463	This will probably be a question for DarkSakura.
6420503	6422023	Which is the best Sega pinball machine?
6422543	6428905	She's not here tonight, but if she were, I bet you anything she would say World Cup 98 because I'm almost positive that was the Sega table.
6429445	6431146	And that's like her favorite machine of all time.
6431166	6433907	So I'm 99% certain that would be her answer.
6435509	6439532	I know they're not the best machines by far, but I'm too big of a Sega fan to let this pass by.
6440052	6441553	Is Independence Day any good?
6441593	6443174	I'll probably have a chance to buy that one.
6443734	6445055	I do not know much about that table.
6445075	6446035	You're right, DarkSakura would be the expert.
6446056	6446876	I don't think I played that one.
6446936	6447196	Did you?
6447236	6448077	Do you remember that being good?
6448457	6448697	No.
6449197	6450878	Did Sega do the Jurassic Park one?
6450918	6451599	I like that one.
6452715	6453616	I don't remember if they did that.
6454156	6458639	I was going to say they should have a Sonic spinball table.
6458659	6459380	Wouldn't that be awesome?
6459400	6461421	That would be kind of awesome with a blue pinball.
6461781	6462442	Wouldn't that be cute?
6462922	6464743	I don't know.
6465384	6466224	And thanks to Fabrice.
6466244	6469146	I'm sorry the real pinball expert isn't here tonight to answer the question.
6469166	6470387	I'll have to ask her for next week.
6470427	6471928	Boy, you just struck out.
6472349	6473289	First, we didn't do a show.
6473329	6475891	The night you were going to stay up and listen, and I really apologize for that.
6476271	6481355	And then the night you have your question read on air, DarkSakura's not even here to answer it.
6482100	6483200	Did Sega do Jurassic Park?
6483220	6484121	That was a fun promotion.
6484381	6484981	I don't remember.
6487801	6489042	We'll have to ask her next week.
6489082	6491642	Hopefully I remember.
6491702	6492743	Let's go to another email.
6492843	6494143	It's from Dan Shadow.
6494203	6495883	Hey guys, survived the gaming season?
6495923	6497124	What surprised you the most?
6497984	6499544	Personally, Left 4 Dead blew me away.
6500004	6503165	I'm going to be up in the area next weekend, which I believe is this weekend.
6503185	6503665	Whoops.
6503925	6504625	Maybe we can meet up.
6504665	6505626	I'd like to meet you all.
6506266	6506486	Oops.
6507654	6513843	Well, hopefully he comes back because apparently he didn't make it out tonight because we were off last week and didn't even ever get to our emails.
6514804	6516645	are bad.
6516726	6519267	Here's our last email tonight from Cheeseburger.
6519888	6522730	Hey, OLR, I want to buy my dad a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.
6522750	6523451	That's pretty ambitious.
6524071	6527614	We just got a 52-inch plasma LCD TV and all we have is crappy cable.
6527994	6530536	Where do you guys and girls think is the best place to buy it?
6531036	6533818	All I want is the Blu-ray player and don't intend on playing any games.
6533898	6538742	Websites are okay options too as long as I can use my unverified PayPal account.
6539382	6544066	Ooh, in that case, you might just want to go for a used PlayStation 3 from eBay.
6544659	6545799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6568439	6568719	DarkSakura,
6587458	6587959	Cyber Monday, Tomorrow
6602859	6621336	so tomorrow would be a good day to kind of check your big retailer websites to look for big deals and the reason why they wait until Monday is because a lot of people do their online shopping at work and Monday's the first day back to work for most people including myself so you're going to see a lot of good deals on Cyber Monday online if that's where you're looking to buy things so keep an eye out
6622381	6622701	Keep an eye out.
6623082	6628670	And don't be afraid to use sites like Frugal, Google's shopping site, to look for good deals.
6628970	6630553	You know, a PS3 is a PS3 is a PS3.
6630573	6631614	Cheap-ass gamer.
6631774	6635440	Well, that's a good site, too, especially with games.
6636421	6637142	So keep an eye out.
6637963	6638284	There you go.
6639239	6653765	it's funny, I was looking in chat they were talking about Commander Keen they actually have ported a clone of Commander Keen for the Wii, it's in their homebrew community now, you can download Commander Keen for the Wii that's kind of neat
6654605	6661086	I got one more email from Rob with two B's about the Wii and says, this one's for Matt.
6661467	6663227	I recently upgraded my Wii firmware.
6663347	6663867	Guess what?
6663927	6666448	My SD card was completely wiped clean.
6666848	6669668	This is a shame because I don't have a homebrew channel or anything on it.
6669688	6670869	Did you hear of anything similar?
6671569	6675310	I had painstakingly backed up my game channel so that I wouldn't need to download them again.
6675710	6679651	Some I deleted from my Wii memory because of the incredible daunting size of WiiWare.
6679751	6680751	Grr, argh.
6681672	6691024	Um, well, here's the thing, um, I didn't update my system at all because I don't connect to their, you know, internet for, I don't connect to the store.
6691344	6697252	Because to be honest, I don't buy anything on there and there's nothing I need to download and if I wanted to download...
6697912	6698612	Thanks for watching!
6716959	6724021	Unless I get a WeSpeak microphone, I'll need to update it for the WeSpeak channel, which I probably still wouldn't do because I wouldn't use that.
6724561	6726662	So, no, I haven't updated it yet.
6727142	6738985	Although, if you have updated it, I believe there's a new Twilight hack out now for the 3.4 firmware, and you can download that and redo all your stuff if you need to.
6739165	6743948	It sounds to me, though, that Rob is not into this whole hacking homebrew thing at all, like me.
6744428	6747329	I'm just not into it because I don't have time.
6747629	6750051	So why did his SD card get picked on?
6750551	6760216	Well, I don't know why it wiped your SD card unless you had modified saves on there or something, but unless they're trying to get you to update it.
6761677	6763938	I don't understand why they would want you to re-download everything.
6763978	6764858	That doesn't make any sense.
6765659	6765919	But, um...
6768561	6770482	Yeah, Nintendo sucks.
6791680	6795262	There's Team Twizers or Tweezers or whatever they're called.
6796442	6803026	So there's other games that they've already figured out exploits to that can be used instead of Twilight Princess.
6803106	6805988	So this by all means is not an end.
6807589	6809190	Alright, well that's going to do it for tonight's Mailbag.
6809230	6813032	If you want to send us an email, DarkSakura will hopefully be back next week to read your emails.
6816966	6821407	Alright, other fun stuff that's going to be going on here.
6821807	6828268	Well, this isn't really fun, but FunCom, the company behind such wonderful games like The Age of Conan.
6829349	6831749	Well, they've had to cut staff.
6831789	6839271	Apparently, hard times have been had, and last Tuesday they actually had to...
6841673	6844615	Well, plus just Age of Conan I don't think lived up to expectations.
6844635	6851619	I think there were a lot of people that bought that, played the one month trial, and didn't stay with it.
6851639	6853000	Yeah, I could see that.
6868035	6870784	I was going to check out the game, but just kind of never got around to it.
6871005	6873493	Now it seems to be going the way of Tabula Rasa, which is kind of sad.
6875378	6879480	There's a lot of MMOs out there and Warcraft is kind of owning a lot of them in the face.
6880181	6882302	Only very few are able to hold their own against it.
6882322	6898650	I'll tell you what though, if you like God of War and you own a 360 and will have never an opportunity to play God of War on the 360, you should check out Conan, the actual Conan game that they released because it is such a blatant ripoff of God of War, it's not even funny.
6898890	6902952	But there's boobies and lots of blood and that's all you really need.
6904835	6905957	Alright, that's all you need.
6906678	6908500	Hey, PC games.
6909101	6912826	Really old PC games, but really classic PC games.
6913306	6919234	StarCraft is over 10 years old and just got patched this past week to patch 1.16.
6921357	6924458	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6948650	6950271	So it'll only use as much as it needs.
6950812	6952853	There's some other tiny little exploits, too.
6952913	6957697	It does some little exploits with the Zerg race, especially, that were fixed.
6957757	6963261	But that's great that Blizzard is still patching this game 10 years later.
6964822	6968484	And we have somebody in chat, VXXXV, is like, I've been waiting for that.
6970005	6971286	And Korea rejoices.
6971466	6972007	There you go.
6974197	6975098	You know what's neat about that?
6975178	6979120	It's going to make a lot of people go back and re-look at StarCraft.
6979460	6980841	It's just like the Burnout Paradise thing.
6980881	6986024	It's a great way to keep your game alive even after maybe it's kind of been cut out.
6988450	6994212	While there's some interesting stuff coming out, of course, some more download content for Rock Band, the weekly stuff.
6994892	7002193	This week they actually have a new free track that you can download, which is the track Headphones On by Miranda Cosgrove.
7003014	7009115	That's going to be released alongside a bunch of other songs, including Are You Dead Yet?
7009175	7010355	by the Children of Bottom.
7012236	7016837	Looks like Finley with Tato E. Possible.
7018190	7020472	and these are all European bands, by the way.
7023053	7025294	And then this is kind of weird, Naked Brothers Band.
7025374	7029517	They've got Body I Occupy and I Don't Want to Go to School.
7030537	7032839	I guess crossing over to the Nickelodeon crowd there.
7034260	7037782	Pilatero Y2 with Hey Poco Rock and Roll.
7038895	7044998	Squeeze with Tempted, Tokyo Hotel with Ready, Set, Go.
7045418	7046079	That's pretty cool.
7046559	7049180	And All American Rejects with Real World.
7049841	7060246	And it should be noted that all these are for 80 Microsoft points instead of the usual 160, and they're only on sale, I believe, for the month of December.
7061658	7064040	So after that, they will go back up to their normal price.
7064500	7066962	Sales everywhere for the holiday season.
7067042	7071386	Well, yeah, they had a lot of sales actually on the PlayStation Network, and so there's a bunch of titles that were half off.
7071406	7071726	That's right.
7071826	7075029	You know, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week, but I got to play Echo Chrome.
7075069	7076310	My friend has a game, Echo Chrome.
7077444	7079427	What a strange little puzzle game.
7080268	7082491	It's kind of fun, but I don't know.
7082851	7084854	I think it's now the right price, $5.
7086657	7089301	But I noticed they have all these user-created levels and things.
7089361	7090622	It's a pretty chill game.
7091023	7091724	That's a good way to put it.
7091764	7092886	It's a chill, chill-out game.
7093806	7101348	I was playing Flow.
7101628	7102408	Remember that game?
7102428	7103249	Oh, yeah.
7103289	7103929	Yeah, yeah.
7103949	7107350	I went back and played a little bit of that because Nellie's like, what's that?
7107450	7109330	It's a lot of relaxing music there.
7109390	7111591	I'm like, yeah, it's this game Flow.
7111611	7112771	You move the controller around.
7112791	7114992	She's like, I don't want to have to move the controller around like that.
7115572	7116572	I'm like, too bad.
7119533	7119613	Um...
7120512	7127494	Then in other news, apparently obsessive gamers are not necessarily addicted to games.
7127754	7133556	Apparently 90% of hardcore gamers do not have a legitimate addiction problem.
7133596	7141579	This is coming from a brand new survey mainly focused on I think some of the WoW players and stuff.
7142219	7144480	Of course there's all sorts of disorders out there.
7146175	7152280	Some people just take their hobbies a little bit more seriously than others, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't stop.
7153681	7157865	Sometimes I think I can't stop, so maybe I have a problem.
7159386	7159726	Or not.
7161647	7163529	I'm not playing well, so that's already saying something.
7163549	7165771	Hey, wait a minute, what are you trying to say?
7165851	7168833	Every time I power on the Xbox, there you are in Saints Row 2.
7168953	7172476	I'm only going to play that until I'm done with it, and then once I'm done with it, then...
7174312	7174912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7198070	7202852	Well, you know what's interesting about these expansions is that there's no new classes.
7203272	7207334	There's not a lot of big things that are expanded here.
7207374	7208815	They're story expansions.
7209475	7215038	They're only going to be downloadable through the PlayOnline viewer, and they are all supposed to come out in spring 2009.
7215778	7216918	I'm sorry, I take that back.
7216958	7220600	The first one is supposed to come out in spring 2009 with the other two following.
7220620	7224822	The first one is called A Crystalline Prophecy, Ode of Life Bestowing.
7225502	7227344	A Shantoto Ascension, The Legend Torn, Her Empire Born
7252105	7253166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7272839	7278701	I wish they'd overhaul the engine to make it newer, gen graphics and all that stuff.
7278941	7282321	I don't think I could take it if they released a new Final Fantasy Online game.
7283322	7284402	Would you go back, you think?
7284622	7285142	I don't know.
7285342	7287123	If they fixed it.
7287243	7288503	That's the first effort.
7288523	7292284	Well, you know, I hear this whole level sync thing really helped.
7294088	7305836	That whole thing where basically if you're a level 75, you can downgrade yourself in level and all your gear will scale so that you can level up with your level 40 friend who can't find a party because he's level 40 and level with them.
7306056	7307336	And you both gain experience.
7307997	7308617	See, that'd be nice.
7308877	7313020	And I'm like, oh my god, that's what that game needed three fucking years ago.
7313040	7317483	I would just level down to level 1 and just grind down there.
7317603	7318143	Hell yeah.
7318423	7319224	I know, exactly.
7319264	7320044	It'd be awesome.
7320945	7321105	So...
7327966	7334468	I throw gamers and WoW players in two different categories.
7335148	7338149	I'm already starting to get a little offended here.
7338989	7342691	I have a friend whose behavior completely transforms when he plays WoW.
7343031	7344311	Bye-bye social interaction.
7344371	7346252	Otherwise, he's just fine when playing other games.
7347861	7350703	Wow is kind of a social game though, you know, in a way.
7352704	7358187	There's an old saying though, amongst people who know better, real life greater than wow.
7358747	7363230	So I don't put wow first before real life commitments.
7363430	7366071	Final Fantasy Online just felt really different.
7366111	7366972	It was like kind of...
7368112	7382081	It was cool because when I first started, it was like, oh my god, you know, you think when you first get to the first force and stuff, it's so big, and then you're like, oh, there's planes beyond that.
7382101	7387185	It's like, holy crap, it's actually discovering the world and stuff, and then you go through all of it, and then it's like, eh.
7387405	7391548	Like the first time you board an airship, you're like, this is so fucking epic, and you know, just all this.
7392168	7394150	I will never forget the first time getting on a ship.
7395083	7421154	in Final Fantasy XI and then pirates fucking attacked the ship and I was like, oh my god, this is so scary and I was like having to run into the basement of the ship and lock yourself in there while the higher level characters were taking out the things but I thought that was so amazing how you would basically be forced to work together with the other players to take out the threat or you all die, basically it was neat or you have to lock yourself in the basement like a scared little kid like I did
7421613	7424876	Of course, and they do some of those area effect spells and it might still hit you anyway.
7424896	7425336	That's right.
7425796	7428138	Swipe back into the corner and cry.
7428859	7430160	Curl into it slash fetal.
7433462	7436344	Alright, gosh, that's going to do it, believe it or not, for tonight's gaming news.
7436384	7446792	It was a little bit of a slow news week this week, but hey, that just leaves us some time to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio while we wait for some calls.
7446852	7448794	Any last minute things you want to talk about, Loki?
7450835	7450895	Um...
7453419	7453939	Maybe.
7454540	7456541	Well, you can think about it, because we've got a call coming in.
7456901	7458182	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7458202	7458642	Who's this?
7460103	7461644	Oh, it's Spazinator.
7462484	7463304	Spazinator.
7463345	7464245	What's on your mind, dude?
7466106	7482255	This may be kind of a downer for the show, but I'm kind of a wit's end right here, and I could use a little help from the All Games Radio audience at large, specifically any listeners that may be in the Buffalo area.
7483189	7507477	As I had mentioned to Loki in a private message earlier in the week on Xbox Live, I just recently had my PlayStation 3 stolen, and I'm hoping that any listeners out there that may be in the Buffalo area may have heard
7508268	7533397	or seeing something through Grapevine, maybe Rumor, seeing someone that normally doesn't have a PlayStation 3 on them and could relay any information to the Buffalo Police Department, specifically District E. Basically, any kind of lead would be great because, well, it's kind of like too full for me.
7533717	7537218	A, it's not exactly something I can easily replace.
7538155	7559441	and B, while it should be fairly evident that I'm disabled and the PlayStation 3 X is like a coping skill for me in dealing with my disability and subsequently after my disability has been acted up and I've been getting
7561870	7563171	and some things like that.
7589645	7592807	So that way I could kind of like... As long as you only have one user, it will do that.
7592847	7595808	Otherwise, it will sit in the select user screen type thing.
7597329	7600531	Yeah, technically my profile did.
7601391	7606314	And the key thing was it had my credit card information on there.
7606654	7611797	And because of that, I really did two things.
7613140	7627658	Hey, I canceled my credit card and no idea if I was able to remote access my account using my PSP to change the password on my PlayStation Network account.
7627738	7632004	That way no one could get onto the profile and buy anything.
7632549	7639791	Any chance that you called Sony and see, I don't know if they would do this, but maybe if you've told them what happened, see what the last IP was to access it?
7640191	7640732	I don't know.
7640772	7641452	I'm reaching here.
7641692	7647454	I don't know what you can do in these scenarios, but that would be my first thought, is to call Sony and see when the last time that thing signed in was.
7647474	7656537	Well, I did bring this up, and in fact, I thought up the same thing, and the only thing they can do is,
7658277	7669187	If I were to have left my password as was, the only thing they could do is see if anyone would try to input their own credit card information onto my profile.
7670228	7680958	And if they did, I would have their name and address and whatnot, but at the same time as
7681867	7697620	I'm not totally sure, but I think it's kind of iffy because if they input their credit card information, chances are they could also change my password too, and even I won't be able to access my own account, you know?
7697840	7699842	That seems a little weak from Sony.
7699882	7702944	I think there'd be a little more they could do to help in this situation.
7702964	7705627	Maybe they need a police report or something to be able to do it.
7705647	7706527	I have no idea.
7706547	7708269	Unfortunately, I've never been in this situation, but...
7709329	7712572	Well, buddy, I hope it helps for whatever reason.
7712812	7722660	Again, if anybody has heard of anything about this, let us know and we'll forward it over to Spazinator or just contact the police for heaven's sake.
7723821	7724982	And this goes in general.
7725102	7731287	I mean, I guess we could kind of turn this into more of a community thing for everybody in all parts of the U.S.
7731327	7735531	because unfortunately it leaves gamers like Spazinator in the cold if we support...
7736031	7738713	You know, purchasing these stolen systems and things like that.
7738753	7743558	So if you know of these things going on, do the right thing and let police people know.
7744618	7745559	Yeah, really.
7746360	7747581	Well, thanks for your support.
7747601	7749262	It's definitely appreciated.
7749362	7753506	Hopefully I'll get some good news soon, you know.
7753866	7755448	Alright, well we're hoping for you, Spazinator.
7755488	7756068	Keep us posted.
7757289	7757830	I will do.
7758110	7759231	Alright, good luck, buddy.
7760452	7760952	Alright, bye-bye.
7761032	7761252	Bye.
7762233	7762814	Ah, what a bummer.
7764414	7765661	I'm not going to ask how it was stolen.
7765681	7767932	I hope the house didn't get broken into or something like that.
7769238	7770839	Yikes, not a fun situation.
7771079	7772060	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7772080	7772440	Who's this?
7773040	7774921	Time of day, Orange Lounge Radio land.
7774962	7775442	It's Jason.
7775762	7776362	Hey, Jason.
7776382	7777243	I hope you have some better news.
7777283	7778624	The last call was a little bit of a downer.
7779204	7786128	Yeah, I was hearing bits and pieces because I was helping Ryan with something and trying to make sure all the volumes are set nicely in here and whatnot.
7786328	7787329	How is Ryan?
7787609	7788670	Wait, wait, wait.
7788730	7789410	How is Ryan?
7789430	7790011	How is she doing?
7790451	7791291	She's busy.
7791431	7792192	She's in school now.
7793293	7797135	I know she used to listen to the show back in the day but hasn't had enough time lately, but let her know we said hello.
7798456	7798876	They said hello.
7800103	7800984	Oh, she's right there.
7801024	7801324	Hello.
7801584	7803025	Yeah, she's listening over my shoulder.
7803225	7804245	Ah, wonderful, wonderful.
7805286	7805966	What's on your mind, Jason?
7807107	7810709	That StarCraft news was really good to hear.
7810949	7812790	I saw you get all excited in chat.
7813331	7818374	I mean, this is something that dates back to when I lived in New Mexico in like, I don't know, maybe 2001 or 2002?
7819394	7820775	Maybe 10 years ago, Jason?
7821755	7822856	With how old this game is?
7823156	7823997	Well, not that early, but...
7824657	7845265	When I remember, the thing that sticks out most in my mind, this is going to be the weirdest thing I've ever really said, but the thing that sticks out most in my mind is just how far back reaching this goes in the sense that the fact that online replays were able to be saved at, I don't know, 1.03 or something like that.
7845826	7851388	When that feature came out, that was amazing, especially because the file size for any average game was less than 10k.
7853360	7857385	And then when I first did it, I played a couple games with some people, and then I went back and watched the replays.
7857405	7858467	I was like, well, wait a second.
7858887	7861731	I was discussing with them strategy and whatnot.
7861751	7862552	I want to see that too.
7862732	7863213	Never could.
7863614	7865957	They just now put this in.
7867238	7871304	That's my high school life coming back to say, hey, I'm cool again.
7872483	7873524	Isn't that weird?
7873584	7876645	Like, why would they add that now, of all things?
7876765	7878366	Isn't that so strange?
7894949	7898153	I started playing through the campaigns again, and it was fun, it still is.
7898353	7906383	One of the other little features in the patch we didn't mention is that now you can use slash R to reply directly to the person you last talked to, that's another new feature in the patch.
7906823	7912010	That's a Warcraft thing, which I thought was kind of funny, because that's exactly what you do in WoW, to reply to people.
7912030	7913031	How much of a surprise, woo!
7913311	7913911	I know, I know.
7914531	7915711	Synergy amongst the thing.
7916031	7919292	And speaking of WoW, I know you didn't call the talk WoW, but I've got to mention this.
7919312	7926273	The Armory got a huge upgrade this week, and those achievements that you've been getting on your character, now you can look at them in the Armory online.
7926633	7932034	But not only that, like, if I were to look, like, I've got to show Loki this, because he's a big achievement whore, so he'd kind of think this is funny.
7932494	7933414	But I'm explaining what I'm doing.
7933434	7937735	I'm going to the Armory right now, and I'm looking up the achievements for my character, okay?
7937895	7938675	And, like, look at this.
7938715	7942636	It breaks down exactly which achievements I have and what categories and all that, but not just that.
7943137	7946126	If I want to look at a particular achievement, let's say general.
7946627	7949014	Here's one achievement I've been going for lately is...
7950765	7952426	to all the squirrels I've loved before.
7952526	7955208	Show the critters of Azeroth how much you slash love them.
7955528	7960912	So you get a 10-point achievement if you're able to find every little creature in Azeroth and type slash love, right?
7961273	7972300	Well, not only is the armory tracking that I have that achievement enough, but if I click on it, it shows exactly which six I've slash loved and which ones I have yet to do.
7972801	7974202	That's fairly comprehensive.
7975760	8004917	integration like this is a great thing it's always 10 years delayed in StarCraft's case but anything like this to integrate that much you don't have to start up the entire game just to see this information it's almost always a good thing to have and I also want to show Loki this I can put in my ex-boyfriend's account and compare and I can see right there no no but I can see just I can notice that I have 360 more achievement points than he does and that makes me feel better about myself awesome there you go
8006482	8008282	No, Rob's not an achievement whore.
8008362	8009863	No, not at all.
8013563	8014824	No, I'm just sad and pathetic.
8015404	8016924	Anyway, so back to StarCraft.
8016984	8020005	Anything else you want to share about what's going on?
8021085	8024806	I just want to see what the StarCraft 2 requirements are going to be.
8025146	8034548	I mean, it's not like it's coming out holiday season or anything, so I shouldn't be jumping the gun or anything, but it's going to be... Wasn't it either that or Diablo 3 that isn't actually likely before 2010?
8036879	8040100	Yeah, I think I remember hearing something about that, but yeah, that makes sense.
8040540	8044221	I bet you we see, I bet you we'll finally get StarCraft 2 next year.
8044281	8046962	I mean, it was playable at PAX, for heaven's sake.
8047442	8051144	It will probably be out next year, just in time for the holidays, and then you'll probably get Diablo 3 in 2010.
8052521	8054962	Just in time to buy three games.
8055662	8057622	But we've already beat that topic to death.
8057662	8064303	Consider we're one month away from 2009 and 2010 doesn't seem that far off because that's probably when we're going to see Final Fantasy XIII as well.
8064503	8067224	This year went by so fast.
8068204	8070144	Yeah, it was a crazy year.
8071225	8071745	All right, buddy.
8071765	8073345	We're going to let you go to get to more calls, all right?
8073925	8074985	Such is life.
8075425	8075706	All right.
8075866	8076446	Have a good one, buddy.
8076986	8077386	Bye, folks.
8077826	8077986	Bye.
8080236	8080756	Not a whole lot.
8080876	8082998	I wanted to call in last week because of where I was.
8105645	8107787	Yeah, failed, I know.
8107867	8109988	No, I saw the pictures in your live journal.
8110028	8111349	Tell us about the trip you went on.
8113210	8116713	And where exactly did you go in San Francisco?
8116793	8117513	Oh, a few different places.
8117533	8117893	There was a
8135874	8143363	Oh man, well we saw the Blacks Museum, so what I wanted to call about was this incredible arcade that I got to go to.
8148629	8156598	There was a whole bunch of old games, like this link I'm posting is an old arcade, it's an old pinball game.
8158689	8160771	Which arcade was this at?
8160791	8167056	Because I go to San Francisco quite often, and I, for some reason, have decided to never seek, I somehow have never seeked this place out.
8167357	8171861	You know, I know the Pier 39 arcade and some of those other things, but where exactly was this, and how did you find it?
8172862	8174703	Oh, man, I don't remember.
8175144	8182190	I'd have to ask about it, but... Well, what made you think to go there?
8182210	8185753	I don't know, it was my mom's suggestion.
8188542	8189623	Who would have thunk it?
8189943	8190163	Oh, yeah.
8190263	8191104	Oh, on my photo bucket.
8191144	8191244	Yeah.
8191264	8191464	Awesome.
8216862	8218223	Anything else you want to share about your week?
8221046	8227372	Well, yeah.
8229474	8229954	Go for it.
8230014	8235760	One of the games I was playing, one of the games I was playing in San Francisco was the old 1976 game Death Race.
8238808	8239909	Oh, yeah, this game.
8240089	8241809	Oh, man, that's an old, old game.
8241849	8244030	I think I remember that coming up on the show not that long ago.
8244390	8247552	So, okay, what did you think?
8247672	8249552	You got to play that, and what did you think?
8250693	8252914	Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.
8252934	8257095	I even made a remake for the PC.
8257916	8262358	I'll have to dig that up and link it in chat, too.
8263278	8263458	Hmm.
8264568	8266589	Dark Tattoo, you have a good one, buddy.
8266629	8267690	We're going to take some more calls.
8294796	8295276	Take care, bud.
8295716	8295916	Bye.
8324799	8325559	Oh, he's cutting out.
8325619	8326560	Hey, can you hear me?
8326820	8327700	You're cutting out a little bit.
8328340	8331861	If you have any other things running, like torrents, whatever.
8332881	8333161	Whoa.
8335322	8335782	Hello?
8335802	8337563	No!
8340363	8341344	Okay, I'm hanging up.
8342384	8343004	Let's do this.
8345565	8347085	I don't usually do this, but we'll try this.
8347105	8347945	This will sometimes help.
8352327	8352727	Hey there, GS68?
8354611	8355752	Okay, let's try this shit again.
8355992	8357373	Alright, it sounds a little better this time.
8357433	8358694	What is on your mind, GS68?
8360655	8367440	Well... Okay... Besides that, I'll get around to playing... Well, Echo.
8370142	8371783	I think there might be an audio thing going on.
8371823	8372104	Go ahead.
8372144	8372724	Fuck this shit.
8374825	8377307	Alright.
8377647	8378108	I agree.
8378228	8379089	Fuck this shit.
8380269	8381670	Hi, you're on Works Launch Radio.
8381730	8382231	Who's this?
8384747	8386048	Oh wow, what happened at year 68?
8388529	8389809	He got a little frustrated.
8390930	8391770	What's on your mind, buddy?
8391810	8392270	Who's this?
8393231	8394351	Okay, this is Osfer.
8394771	8396292	Hey Osfer, what's on your mind?
8398253	8399814	Sorry I tuned in a little bit late.
8399834	8401454	I don't know if you covered this story or not.
8401674	8405716	But did you see that part where it was talking... This was on Joystick.
8405796	8411519	It was an article about the Zelda director saying he wouldn't quit until he surpasses Ocarina of Time.
8412379	8414300	Like he wouldn't quit working with the Zelda series.
8420817	8430766	I was wondering, what do you guys think needs to happen in the Zelda series to make it surpass Ocarina of Time?
8430986	8435290	Or do you think there's already been a game in the Zelda series that's better than Ocarina of Time?
8438009	8464419	I think the way they can make it better is to fuck the shit no um it's just not gonna get old I don't know why I'm so immature yes I think there is a game that has surpassed Ocarina of Time and it's called The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past so in my opinion he can quit already because he already made the better game really I have a friend that likes A Link to the Past the best too but I don't know just for me Ocarina of Time is still the best
8466496	8469764	He was also talking in terms of sales, too.
8473282	8475444	You know, I think it's going to be tricky to do.
8475464	8478886	I think Twilight Princess was pretty darn good.
8479466	8484530	I mean, I think it really showed what the Wii games could be pretty awesome.
8485510	8488852	Although, you know, that game was kind of originally designed for the GameCube.
8489213	8497598	So I think what it really might take to really knock people's socks off is to kind of take that same approach, but with a Zelda game that is designed for the system it's going to be out for.
8497939	8500560	And it'll probably be this Wii HD thing that'll be out in 2010 or 2011.
8502301	8506424	Which will be a port of a Wii game, because they'll do a Wii version and a Wii HD version.
8507064	8512007	I wouldn't be surprised if we see a play on Wii Wind Waker game.
8514249	8521693	I would like to see a Wind Waker game that wasn't in a world that was flooded with water.
8522033	8522574	It was just...
8523768	8531037	Spoiler, but in Wind Waker you actually go under the ocean and you find out, oh my god, it's Hyrule but flooded and it looks pretty awesome.
8531838	8536745	And I'm like, why the fuck couldn't they have just done this and made it really cool?
8537326	8539529	It's kind of like Wind Waker to me is kind of like Mega Man Legends was.
8541513	8542573	There's another game that needs more.
8542793	8548575	You know, I'm thinking if Zelda wants to really, really expand its audience and really cater to many people out there.
8548595	8549255	Zelda Crossing.
8549275	8549835	Different types.
8549955	8551096	The game that's just persistent.
8551136	8551416	No, no.
8551456	8553836	What you do, you just need to add a few things into the game.
8553856	8555417	You need to add kidditch matches.
8556457	8558698	You need to add vampires that sparkle.
8560218	8561239	And you need to add...
8562859	8566382	So basically, instead of a wolf, Link turns into a sexy vampire guy, and then Zelda just starts singing See You Again.
8583259	8584640	I think we're on to something here.
8584960	8588941	And then he sparkles, and we just talk about how beautiful he is.
8590181	8591461	I've been waiting at midnight.
8591861	8598083	I don't know.
8598163	8602904	You know, honestly, the thing that's going to make Zelda better is something we haven't thought of yet.
8604045	8605385	That's my cryptic answer.
8605485	8606185	I mean, it really is.
8606385	8607306	It's something we haven't thought of yet.
8607326	8608246	Steering wheel controls.
8611055	8614179	That is something like what Loki said about Wind Waker.
8614680	8618565	I think it would be cool if they made a Wii version of it.
8618605	8620667	You know how you conducted with the Wind Waker?
8620687	8621168	You could actually...
8621755	8625037	Probably do that with the Wii Remote, and that would be just something interesting.
8625057	8626779	Dude, whatever happened to Link's crossbow training?
8650521	8650801	Easy.
8650821	8655145	I put it in a CD case to where it would be forgotten.
8656185	8657326	Forever.
8657426	8658968	What the hell was that thing called?
8659048	8660909	The Wii Zapper.
8661409	8662931	Whatever happened to the Wii Zapper?
8663991	8666133	There's games that actually use it, like Call of Duty.
8668335	8676401	In the next Zelda game, we need more Link's crossbow training with sniper rifles and cannons and things that are more explosive than a stupid crossbow.
8676421	8677061	Call of Zelda?
8677081	8677422	Yeah.
8681195	8681695	Oh my god.
8682216	8682876	That's wrong.
8682976	8691940	But no, seriously, they could just do, you know, the first thing they're probably going to do is just do that play on Wii thing for Wind Waker.
8692541	8694922	And then you'll probably see a new Zelda game.
8695942	8697963	Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be on the Wii.
8698363	8699704	I agree with YYR in chat.
8699744	8700304	Coming soon.
8700665	8703226	Super Links Crossbow Training Turbo HD Remix.
8707822	8710124	And you know what they're going to do when they do come out with a Wii HD?
8710144	8715068	They're just going to remake all the stupid games that were on the Wii, and they're going to make them all HD now.
8715148	8716929	And you'll buy them anyway, because you're a consumer horror.
8716949	8717550	And people will buy them.
8717890	8718450	That's right.
8719511	8736425	All right, Osfer, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, and I know you really didn't get an answer out of us, but I think it's because probably, sure, there could be a game that one day surpasses Zelda if they just want to put the effort into it, and hopefully they will, and appease us hardcore gamers.
8736505	8736825	We'll see.
8738106	8743050	I think you were right, though, when you said that it would have to be something that we haven't seen in a game yet.
8744071	8747613	Like, the thing with Ocarina of Time for me was just how expansive it was.
8748214	8754919	Like, that feeling I got when I first stepped out into Hyrule Field, I was just like, holy crap, there's so much to do.
8755680	8758642	Maybe there's something to be said for the potential of a Zelda MMO.
8759462	8759963	I don't know.
8760283	8763145	It may be a little weird, but, you know, when in doubt, sparkles.
8764326	8765067	Yeah, sure.
8765347	8766067	Have a good one, buddy.
8767368	8767849	All right, see ya.
8768815	8770717	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8771077	8772158	Thanks so much for your guys' calls.
8772178	8773860	If you didn't get through, I'm sorry.
8774220	8778003	But you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeonstrater.com and we'll take more calls next week.
8778604	8780826	Last minute stories to get out of the way before we take off tonight.
8781326	8785470	There was a bunch of rumors coming out about stuff coming from Sony.
8785790	8788993	Apparently this was leaked from some sort of Sony staff meeting.
8790054	8791415	Some of the stuff we've been hearing about...
8792776	8793416	over and over now.
8793777	8795177	LittleBigPlanet on the PSP.
8795677	8800158	MotorStorm on the PSP apparently are in the works maybe as early as next year.
8802879	8803859	I'm not surprised.
8804460	8808001	They need something because there's nothing really coming out on the PSP.
8808841	8813882	They said that MotorStorm was shown off on the PSP, but it was target footage and not the actual game.
8816383	8818064	Also, there was supposedly...
8821463	8823024	God of War 3 stuff shown.
8823184	8825545	Apparently it's really awesome looking.
8826005	8828406	Uncharted 2 also shown.
8828426	8833168	Not a big surprise that they're going to make a second Uncharted game and Kills in 2 stuff was shown off as well.
8834228	8835349	So, yeah.
8836149	8837050	That's kind of interesting.
8837630	8841391	Another interesting thing would be the PSP 3000 system.
8841411	8842532	The new system that came out.
8842632	8849015	One of the things about that was it was pretty impossible to hack the
8849815	8850956	Custom Firmwares on.
8851016	8861683	Well, now it's even easier to do that because a mod group has actually released a new tool now called the PSP Light Blue Tool.
8862163	8873411	And what it is, is it's a memory card that will act like the Pandora's battery and will allow you to add the custom firmwares to your system.
8874091	8879155	And what's funny is it will sell for $30 and apparently it came out last weekend.
8879895	8881016	So that's kind of neat.
8882396	8889020	Then finally, we know about Gardening Mama that's going to be coming to the DS soon.
8889100	8892382	Well, there's a new trademark being made.
8892402	8901047	The title is Trademark Pet Shop Mama, and it is actually a port of a DS game that's apparently available now.
8901787	8903829	I think Mama might have to be euthanized.
8904049	8906350	I think Mama's getting spread too thin.
8908631	8919298	Pet Shop Monogatari is the game that's being ported and has everything from penguin washing to apparently a bear that's jumping in the air.
8919678	8920359	That's interesting.
8920899	8932186	Another game though that is being ported and thankfully coming to the United States finally, Trackmania DS will be coming thanks to Atlus March 17th to the US.
8933207	8935909	So that's pretty cool because Trackmania is all sorts of awesome.
8937506	8940607	I would like to see a Mama game where Mama is trapped in Silent Hill.
8941608	8942608	Fix this, Mama!
8945770	8946670	Mama's brothel.
8949291	8949991	Stripping Mama?
8950992	8951652	You know what's funny?
8952052	8952713	Milfing Mama?
8954033	8955894	Here's something I would just like to bring up.
8956854	8958375	Where the fuck's PlayStation Home?
8959625	8961066	I thought it should have been released by now.
8981107	8984229	I'm just kind of curious, you know, that they promised it's supposed to be here for 2008.
8984409	8985730	So what?
8986130	8986610	So what?
8986630	8987451	You didn't get into Home.
8987511	8987851	So what?
8987891	8988491	Fuck that shit.
8988771	8989532	I really don't care.
8990112	8991573	Like I said, you know, yeah, fuck that shit.
8991613	8999997	But I just think it's funny, though, that they still haven't come out with something, you know, even though they've been teasing this for over two years.
9000478	9002499	And hell, it's still in the commercials.
9002559	9004420	You know, they're teasing for the PlayStation 3.
9004920	9007662	Look at all these cool games you can play on it, including PlayStation Home.
9007882	9008642	No, you can't.
9008702	9009783	You cannot play that.
9011127	9016209	I love what Joshi16 in chat says, Brittany Mama, where you get to neglect your kids for points.
9016569	9027292	They were teasing home back in January and December of last year with the new PlayStation 3 commercials with, what was it, Ladies and Gentlemen.
9028273	9028593	I don't know.
9029273	9029653	It's sad.
9031579	9036505	Alright, well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then that's it for the show here tonight on Orange Launch Radio.
9036525	9040269	I know it was a little bit shorter, but that's what happens when you take a co-host out for a night.
9040589	9043733	But thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting us as you do every week.
9043753	9047037	Hey, remember, if you like your Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.
9047097	9048338	Tell two friends about the show.
9048358	9049259	That's really how we...
9050400	9052721	Spread the word about the show because we are an independent podcast.
9052741	9056582	We don't have any big name magazines or big websites backing us.
9056642	9059302	It's just us as it always has been for the past seven years.
9060163	9062803	And without fans, we're nothing.
9063324	9063984	We're just crap.
9064664	9067505	So we appreciate you guys and your support.
9067665	9072226	Even if you disagree with me on your particular views on a video game.
9072306	9073086	Right, HitStun?
9074006	9074787	Right, HitStun?
9076047	9076327	Anyway.
9078063	9079785	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9096866	9104836	and the accounts I'm going to take over until, I don't know, tomorrow when he leaves on Tuesday.
9104936	9107339	So, way to be proactive!
9109970	9114073	My final thought is thank you, Aaron, for putting us in the credits of Snake360.
9114193	9116055	I thought that was pretty cool.
9117396	9118397	I forgot to tell you about that.
9118557	9121739	In the credit screen, it says special thanks.
9121839	9125182	Orange Launch Radio, woo!
9125302	9129505	Not only do we have a gamer pick on Xbox Live, but now we are actually mentioned in a downloadable game.
9129565	9130186	So we're all...
9130766	9135511	Now we just need to take that big step and actually get the Orange Lounge Radio game released on Xbox 360.
9136012	9140036	I don't know who we have to blow to make that happen, but we might have to get working on that.
9140056	9141477	That might be a New Year's resolution for 09.
9141797	9143299	I don't know what you think.
9144669	9148391	It's just, you know, I've thought about it a few times now.
9148931	9156134	And it's just when you actually get down to figuring it out, game development's really hard.
9156174	9157015	Game development is hard.
9157035	9159296	And to make something really good takes a lot of time.
9159356	9161317	And it's just like, holy crap, that's a lot of time.
9161337	9162577	Art is hard, right, Loki?
9162797	9163117	Yes.
9163358	9163598	All right.
9164418	9168940	Well, thankfully, what you cannot make yourself, you steal.
9169480	9170401	Oh, my gosh.
9171388	9173109	Alright, that's it.
9173190	9175972	We're going to say goodnight and get on out of here.
9176432	9179475	We'll see you next week on Orange Lounge Radio for another great show.
9180155	9182817	Until next time, until next week, fuck this shit.
