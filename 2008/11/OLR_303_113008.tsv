0	20920	Today, November 30th, 2008, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC gets controversial DRM, a 10 year old
20920	32480	game gets a new patch, and could Sackboy soon become a street fighter?
32480	35800	And we're back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, we are that show on
35800	41040	the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41040	46320	My name is Rob Roberts, not joining us tonight sadly is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summer, she is
46320	49560	out tonight, hopefully we'll be back next week.
49560	52720	Also joining us, why am I saying hopefully, she better be back next week or we're going
52720	53800	to be in trouble.
53800	55800	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
55800	56800	Hello.
56800	57800	How you doing, Loki?
57800	58800	Good.
58800	63900	And it's just Loki night tonight, which is kind of odd having come off a week of no show,
63900	67800	apologies for there not being a show, and man if you're listening on the podcast you
67800	72400	got double screwed because you had to wait forever for episode 302 to hit the feed, but
72400	76360	I was having some problems getting the file back and forth, and so it really caused a
76360	79960	big delay just with the holiday and everything, but hopefully y'all have just taken some time
79960	84240	away to enjoy the holiday, you know, relax a little bit, and now we really start to get
84240	87500	towards the really effed up part of the year.
87500	88500	You're grinning like a madman, Loki.
88500	90920	You should tell them how you got injured.
90920	95680	Okay, the reason why there was no show last week, for one, Dark Sakura was out of town,
95680	99920	she was stuck out of town, but usually if one of us is gone, the show will go on.
99920	103360	But then two of us ended up being gone last week because I kind of hurt myself, and it's
103360	108160	really stupid, but my roommate decided to put on his own version of The Amazing Race.
108160	109160	You know that show on TV?
109160	110160	Yeah.
110160	113160	Yeah, you know, it's on the same time, I think, as we do our show, so I shouldn't be encouraging
113160	117680	people to watch it, but we TiVo it, so you know, it's a lot of fun, it's a good show.
117680	121840	He did a local version here in Sacramento, and I signed up to do this like, you know,
121840	125440	months ago before I had had my surgery, and I just kind of thought, you know, after talking
125440	128760	to the doctor, he said I'd be okay to resume all physical activity after two weeks.
128760	133400	Well, I think I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much because, you know, when
133400	137900	we were doing this race, we were running, I mean, everybody that was racing was really
137900	141000	into it, and it was a lot of fun, my roommate did an awesome job with the whole thing, I
141000	143800	gotta say, it was very, you should have done it low-key, except you probably wouldn't have
143800	148360	been able to do it because you would have been...
148360	149360	Like me, after...
149360	153180	No, I don't get out of breath, my legs get sore before I get out of breath.
153180	157000	That's what ultimately happened to me, is that actually I started getting sore in the
157000	160680	area where I had my surgery and I had to come home and take, like, painkillers, it was so
160680	161680	bad.
161680	164520	So I ended up passing out pretty much during the time we had the show, so...
164520	167920	A little embarrassing, yeah, but, you know, we've all done dumb shit that sometimes takes
167920	170720	us out of, you know, our other commitments, so...
170720	176480	Yeah, last week I went and played Airsoft, and I got, I think, poison oak, but I don't
176480	177480	know if it's poison oak.
177480	178480	It doesn't itch, so that's...
178480	180920	God, I hope you didn't bring that in this house.
180920	184400	Luckily, I think I'm immune, I've never had it, but I don't want it now.
184400	187680	I don't, I've never had it either, so I don't know if it's poison oak, it's just, it looks
187680	193560	like a rash on my arm, where I was crawling through, like, brush and grass and stuff like
193560	194560	that, so...
194560	198280	Who knows, you know, what it is, but, you know, I just made a rash and it doesn't really
198280	199520	itch, so...
199520	204440	I thought poison oak is really itchy and spreads like crazy, but...
204440	205440	I don't know, whatever.
205440	206440	It was fun, though.
206440	207760	We shot each other with guns.
207760	210120	Hey, shooting each other is always fun, so...
210120	213580	It was, you know what's interesting is what I ended up doing last week instead of the
213580	217880	show is I was kind of, like, waking up in the night, I actually was using the Xbox 360
217880	221760	to kind of check out Netflix, you know, and all the streaming movies, and one thing I
221760	227800	am loving, obscure-ass documentaries that you can only find on Netflix.
227800	232800	Seriously, I watched a couple of them, I watched, get this, there was a documentary I watched
232800	239440	on Netflix about strippers that, they were these girls that turned to stripping to make
239440	241560	ends meet after Hurricane Katrina.
241560	248160	And the movie was called, I know, the movie was called Hurricane Strip was the name of
248160	253160	the movie, and I'm like, I have to watch this, how obscure is that, seriously, right?
253160	258400	But here's the thing, the movie itself kind of was dumb, because on one hand you had a
258400	263600	documentary about Hurricane Katrina, and then, you know, which was very powerful to see that
263600	269200	imagery and impactful, you know, it was obviously a terrible tragedy that happened, you know,
269200	270200	years ago when it happened.
270200	276400	But then on the other hand, you had this documentary about strippers, and like, why do women want
276400	277400	to strip?
277400	280520	Well, for money and attention, you know, okay, we could have told you that.
280520	284720	It really never, for me, it never tied it into why did they feel the need to do it because
284720	288060	of Hurricane Katrina or anything like that, like, it felt like I was watching two completely
288060	289060	different movies.
289060	290060	In a blender.
290060	293680	They probably started out making a documentary about strippers and it was just too, whatever,
293680	297840	and then all of a sudden Hurricane Katrina happened, they're like, hey, there we go,
297840	302480	that's how we can tie this into it, and people are interested in Hurricane Katrina, so they
302480	304040	will watch our crappy movie.
304040	308840	Or it will end up free on Netflix someday, you know, who knows?
308840	309840	It was not good.
309840	312000	Like seriously, don't waste your time with it.
312000	315960	I know it's like, you're like, hey, strippers, or hey, interesting documentary on Hurricane
315960	319800	Katrina, but I'm sure there are plenty of more informative documentaries on Hurricane
319800	325360	Katrina that are much more powerful than this, which was kind of garbage, it was just garbage.
325360	330100	But there's some other good stuff out there that is worth watching, but maybe if I ever
330100	333240	have a Netflix review show, I'll talk about that someday.
333240	334680	But for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
334680	337840	We can review some of the games we've been playing this week, and I definitely have one
337840	338840	I want to talk about.
338840	342320	I don't know about you, Loki, how was your gaming week?
342320	346040	I really only played scenes for a two, I mean, I've been playing a lot of scenes for a two,
346040	349300	I'm done with it, I'm almost 100% complete with the game.
349300	353480	By the way, he's not lying, like every time I've logged on to Netflix this week to watch
353480	358920	something, I see Loki and his little avatar there in Saints Row 2, which, by the way,
358920	361560	we haven't talked really, because we weren't here last week, we haven't gotten to talk
361560	365240	a lot about NXT, the new Xbox experience, I don't know what your thoughts are on it,
365240	368880	I guess I've already talked about Netflix and how much I love that, that's an awesome
368880	371100	addition, but what are you thinking about NXT?
371100	377000	There's some things I like, the avatars are kind of neat.
377000	382720	I don't like the new friends list on there, I think it's too hard to find what people
382720	386560	are playing, it takes me forever to scroll through that list, whereas, you know, I can
386560	391200	just hit the guide button again and just pull up my friends list and it just has a drop
391200	395200	down on what people are playing, so I can look at it at a glance real quick.
395200	400880	I do like the community games, those are pretty fun.
400880	406080	I kind of like the new shop, how they have it set up with where you can see screenshots
406080	412680	and box art and stuff like that for the games, that's kind of neat.
412680	418520	It does seem to be a little harder just to browse stuff sometimes, but I'm just getting
418520	420520	used to it.
420520	426880	That's kind of my thoughts on it, I really love the new features, the avatars are cute,
426880	433240	Netflix is awesome, community games are awesome, so I appreciate that Microsoft tried to modernize
433240	436480	everything, which sounds weird because not only is the Xbox an old system, but they're
436480	441080	basically trying to put some of these new stuff in an all new package, but I'm not sure
441080	444720	I like the navigation, I think it is kind of a hard thing to navigate, especially compared
444720	449580	to the old one, it's kind of hard to find some things in there, which I don't like.
449580	453360	And I don't know about you, I was kind of expecting a little more out of that whole
453360	458320	party system, like I actually thought it was going to be like you would actually have rooms
458320	462140	that you would actually be walking the avatars around, like I don't know why I got this impression,
462140	465060	so maybe I was just setting myself up for disappointment, but I didn't think it would
465060	468560	just be, oh, when I'm looking at the friends list, I'll just see all the people they're
468560	470160	playing with's avatars too.
470160	471160	That's true, yeah.
471160	472160	It'll come out later, who knows.
472160	476400	Well, that's true, it may, and it sounds like they've kind of built on the back end a chance
476400	480040	to be expansive, and some of these things like the photo party, you know, as silly as
480040	483800	that application is, it does show you that it's very easy for them to push out these
483800	486800	new features that you can just download and use.
486800	487800	I don't like the-
487800	491760	So there's a lot of problems, I can't say it's a negative thing, you know, NXC overall
491760	496580	is a positive thing, I just think some things are a little more difficult when they don't
496580	497580	need to be.
497580	500120	I don't like all the advertisements on there, like for example, when you first bring it
500120	504440	up it's like the what's going on in the Xbox and stuff like that, and they have all this
504440	508160	crap that I gotta scroll through, it's just, you know, that's kind of annoying, I wish
508160	509160	I could take that away.
509160	515600	I love the little intro video when you first install it, that's pretty awesome.
515600	516600	I don't know.
516600	519560	Don't you think gold users shouldn't have to see as many of those ads?
519560	524680	You know, I understand, some of them are for, you know, like their little inside Xbox videos
524680	529160	and things, I don't mind it, because it's free stuff, you know, I know.
529160	535520	It's just, it's, at least it's not, you know, Flash here, you know, your IQ is smarter than
535520	539000	Sarah Palin and all the stuff you see on the internet, at least it's not that bad, you
539000	540000	know what I mean?
540000	541000	It's just small gripes.
541000	546680	Now going to the community games, I did play, I tried to play everything on there, or at
546680	547920	least a lot of it.
547920	550080	Geez, it's taken you a while.
550080	554360	Well, I haven't gotten to play everything, a lot of it, you know, I downloaded and I
554360	559660	looked at it again, I'm like, ehhh, I don't want that, you know, I'm just deleting that.
559660	564480	But I ended up buying a couple of them, I bought a weapon of choice, which is awesome,
564480	569780	it's kind of like a Contra type game, which is really weird weapons and weird characters
569780	572200	and enemies and stuff that you fight.
572200	575520	So that's kind of neat, it's kind of quirky.
575520	579960	And then the other one, I don't know why I bought it, but it was kind of fun was, I think
579960	585200	it was like sign surfing, and that was kind of cool.
585200	590480	It's just really simple, just a little fun, like, mess around game, which is kind of neat.
590480	594280	The word puzzle one, I kind of thought about buying that, but I haven't gotten a chance
594280	599280	to yet, and then I just go on there every, you know, every time I'm on there, usually
599280	602320	if I'm on there for an extended period of time, I'll look to see the new ones that have
602320	605540	come up and stuff like that.
605540	612320	As I was complaining before on when we were talking to Bobby, some of the graphics, it
612320	617720	looks really unpolished, just a lot of it looks like the games aren't done and they're
617720	621520	just putting them up to see if they can make any money off of them.
621520	623800	I don't know, it's just really bad.
623800	629080	Even some of these independent developers and stuff, like some of the Japanese ones,
629080	633800	like we were talking about in Warning Forever, just really simple freeware games that are
633800	637720	pretty popular out there, they have the polish and the graphics on there, it's just, if these
637720	641520	people took a little bit more time on their games, I think they'd be a little bit better,
641520	647880	but for some reason, it just looks really bad, just even, I don't know, the textures
647880	651480	are bad for like the 90s type stuff.
651480	654240	I don't know, it's just not the same polish that you would see in like a shareware game
654240	656960	or something like that.
656960	662800	Now other than that, like I said, Saints Row 2, playing through that, just getting to the
662800	669280	point now where I'm just doing the 100% stuff so I can finish the entire game.
669280	672760	Playing Grand Theft Auto 4 now because everyone got hooked on that because they thought for
672760	679040	some reason that they can't beat me in Saints Row 2, so let's try Grand Theft Auto 4 and
679040	681700	I'm starting a new run on that, so that's kind of cool.
681700	688600	We did an hour long marathon during the week last week and I ended up winning that, that
688600	690480	was kind of fun.
690480	697080	And the other games have been, not really playing, but I've watched a lot of my wife
697080	701120	playing Animal Crossing, haven't gotten, you see, because every time she's done playing
701120	704400	it, she's already done everything in the town, it's like, well shit, I can't go play the
704400	709040	game now because you've already shaken all the trees, dug up everything, you know, fished
709040	713680	the rivers clean or whatever, it's just, I don't know, I played it actually the other
713680	719800	day during the Harvest Festival thing and did the Harvest Furniture which, sad to find
719800	727240	out it's all girly crap, so I ended up selling all of it, but I don't know, that game is
727240	734200	very sad, it's just, it's very sad because they didn't do anything to it and they in
734200	738720	fact actually took things out of like, say if you played the original GameCube one, you'll
738720	742160	know that they have like a fountain and stuff like that, well now you have to buy those
742160	747700	things and I think that was the way it was in Wild World, I can't remember, but it's
747700	751980	still sad that they took stuff out and they made stuff simpler and there's no reason for
751980	757760	it, it's not, I don't know, they could have added so much to this and it would have been
757760	762700	very little effort on their part, but once again, they don't want to put the effort in
762700	769760	if they don't think that it needs to be done for the, you know, mom and pops that are buying,
769760	771360	you know, the Wii for Wii Sports.
771360	773200	Have you seen the commercials for Animal Crossing?
773200	774200	Yes I have.
774200	775200	Oh my god.
775200	776200	Yes I have.
776200	782080	I swear to god it makes me feel like I'm playing a chick game, it's just seriously, not that
782080	787840	there's anything wrong with that, it's just, it makes the game so damn casual, as if you
787840	792720	needed to be told that it was a casual game, it's just like, I laugh every time I see the
792720	797640	commercial, oh I hear there's a new boutique in town, god you're stupid, I mean, are you
797640	802080	excited about a store in a fictional city in a game?
802080	803080	I mean come on.
803080	806960	You know, I can appreciate what Nintendo's trying to do, I mean even though they have
806960	811360	gotten pigeonholed as the casual game company and the, you know, the one that's catering
811360	816940	to women, and rightfully so, let's face it, they're selling like crazy, and if it helps
816940	822020	enable more people that usually wouldn't play games to play games, I'm okay with it, I'm
822020	825520	okay with Nintendo reaching out to a different audience as gay as it might make you feel.
825520	833720	Okay, well here's the thing though, is their games, as of after Mario Kart basically that's
833720	839740	come out, all the games that have been released by Nintendo haven't sold very well, and it's
839740	845240	been going downhill fast, especially the fourth quarter stuff, Wario Land Shake It surprisingly
845240	850920	didn't sell very well, Wii Music, well we don't even need to go there, and Animal Crossing
850920	856800	surprisingly not that big of a seller, it's just people realize that they haven't changed
856800	860000	anything, and the people that don't realize it are the people that probably aren't going
860000	861000	to buy it anyways.
861000	864040	What about the overall picture, because the pool's getting pretty diluted out there when
864040	867620	you look at all the third party titles, I mean is it just because people that would
867620	872280	have bought Animal Crossing are instead tempted by these cheaper budget games that are shovelware?
872280	875800	I don't think so, because there's nothing really competing with those genres of games,
875800	879680	like Wario Land Shake It doesn't really have any good side-scrolling platformers that are
879680	884040	competing with it, Wii Music, maybe Guitar Hero would have competed with it, but I think
884040	887880	Wii Music was bad to begin with, and Animal Crossing really the only thing that kind of
887880	892360	compares to it that came out around the same time is My Sims Kingdom, which sold even worse
892360	898160	than Animal Crossing, so I don't think, I think it'll do pretty well, but right now
898160	904240	they haven't given us any hope to like, there's nothing really different, that's the problem,
904240	906920	it's like, oh my god, and then the next-
906920	910800	Okay, I gotta read some comments from chat here, chat.orangelandtrudy.com, of course
910800	914360	always our other guest here on the program, the fourth guest, or tonight, they've been
914360	919560	promoted to third guest, because Dark Soccer is not here tonight, Game Guru says, how do
919560	923360	we know City Folk isn't selling well, we don't have an MPD, but you have a little, kind of
923360	924360	an insider perspective on it.
924360	927240	Well, I just, from what I've seen, and it could be selling very well, but from what
927240	928240	I've seen-
928240	929680	On a grander scale, but from what you are seeing, it is not.
929680	935440	I mean, we're selling out, but it's just not, there wasn't that many to begin with to sell
935440	938560	out from, we didn't, you know, buy it that heavy.
938560	944480	Okay, let's see, looking at Biohaze20 said, wasn't Rob anti-Nintendo, or am I missing
944480	945480	something here?
945480	949760	No, I'm not anti-Nintendo, just like I was never anti-Sony when I was mad at the PlayStation
949760	955960	3, and that was getting the bane of everything I had negative to say, you know, it's just
955960	960360	that I think Nintendo's made a lot of very disappointing decisions in the past two years,
960360	964920	and a lot of that has affected the hardcore gamers like you and me, and you know, and
964920	968960	it just kind of goes right into what Acidic Vampire says in chat, Nintendo is reaching
968960	975000	out to other people and neglecting the hardcore gamers frown, and that's kind of my issue.
975000	976000	And the whole thing-
976000	977000	Right there.
977000	980200	Yeah, and my thing was too, is before with the GameCube, when they were done with the
980200	983360	GameCube and they're developing the Wii and they're promoting the Wii, it's like, listen,
983360	987560	the Wii is for everybody, the Wii system is not, we're not going to be pigeonholed in
987560	992740	being, you know, known as a company that puts out games only for like children, we are trying
992740	997000	to appeal to everybody, but they're not, they're just doing the same thing that they've been
997000	1000420	doing before, they're just complaining that everyone sees them as a company that puts
1000420	1006400	out, you know, games for like, you know, too many family games and too many just casual
1006400	1009680	games, and well, complain all you want, but that's what you're doing.
1009680	1013800	And here's the other thing too, I can respect what Nintendo does from a business perspective,
1013800	1016840	which is what I'm kind of saying with these commercials and things, it's like, you know,
1016840	1020660	as a business move, it's a smart idea and it's something new, but at the same time on
1020660	1025400	a personal level, I can still kind of go, but it sucks, you know, because for me personally,
1025400	1031960	the selfish gamer in me wants something else, you know, wants the Wii to have been HD capable
1031960	1036880	in the first place and, you know, and so on and so on, you know, from that perspective.
1036880	1043720	And also I kind of think that, you know, hardcore gamers kind of push the Wii to be so in demand
1043720	1047960	in the first place and Nintendo's going to need them if they, you know, launch another
1047960	1051240	system or an upgraded version of the Wii, which is kind of my fear is what's going to
1051240	1054600	happen is that we're going to see the next system that comes out of Nintendo is going
1054600	1060200	to be, and it could be as soon as next year, maybe 2010, I would say no later than 2010,
1060200	1064360	you're going to see it Wii HD or something where now they're going to start catering
1064360	1068240	into all those features, you know, but their big selling point is going to be, but it's
1068240	1073080	also a Wii, just like the Wii was also a GameCube, you know what I mean?
1073080	1077840	So you know, I think to get that support, they're going to need to win us hardcore gamers
1077840	1084240	back and the more you push us away and the more that Xbox and even now Sony starts to
1084240	1087080	woo us over, which who would have thought that would have happened a few years ago that
1087080	1091360	we'd be talking so great about Sony, but whereas Nintendo has been making a lot of disappointing
1091360	1098720	decisions this year, Sony has been making a lot of, I can't say great decisions, but
1098720	1103340	satisfying decisions, let's put it that way, you know, they're, we're content with Sony
1103340	1104340	right now.
1104340	1105340	Let me just put it this way.
1105340	1109600	They're coming out for the first two months of 2009 from Nintendo and it's sad.
1109600	1113800	I mean, it's sad if you own a Wii, let me put it that way.
1113800	1119160	If you own a DS, you might not be so disappointed, but seriously, this is the trend that they're
1119160	1123080	doing now is let's start remaking GameCube games.
1123080	1124760	Can you put any less effort into that?
1124760	1132000	I mean seriously, what we got, but play for Wii Mario Tennis and play for Wii Pikmin is
1132000	1136880	the first two games of next year for the Wii.
1136880	1137880	I mean, woo!
1137880	1138880	With Pikmin!
1138880	1139880	Oh, awesome!
1139880	1140880	It's Pikmin all over again.
1140880	1144280	Well, we're going to get to a story later tonight about that there's something, a surprise
1144280	1146820	cooking over at Nintendo, one of their developers.
1146820	1153080	Is it possible that Nintendo is setting the stage to really knock our socks off next E3?
1153080	1155560	They better.
1155560	1156760	That's all I'm saying.
1156760	1161480	I have a feeling next E3 it's going to be about the DSi.
1161480	1169080	And I hope that they do something good because, man, my bar for them is set so low right now,
1169080	1177040	it's like there's very little, maybe a new Zelda game, or F-Zero or something.
1177040	1179440	Or that Kid Icarus game that's been rumored for a long, long time.
1179440	1180440	Yeah, that'll never happen.
1180440	1184200	Well, I'm just saying, you want to win me back, here's some ways.
1184200	1185200	And they've got to be good.
1185200	1186380	It can't be shovelware.
1186380	1189600	You shovelware Kid Icarus, I'm going to be pissed, I'm going to be twice as pissed as
1189600	1190600	I was before.
1190600	1192600	You've got to make it good.
1192600	1193600	Well, anyway.
1193600	1198040	Just stop being so stingy is what they need to do.
1198040	1201280	Game Guru says the thing is that the core gamer and the third party's abandoned Nintendo.
1201280	1205600	Yeah, we're going to get to another story later tonight about how some of these companies
1205600	1209080	are now starting to say, look, Louise is not capable of doing what we wanted to do, so
1209080	1210080	bye.
1210080	1211080	Yeah, but the core gamer's finicky, okay?
1211080	1214440	If they come out with a really kick-ass game, they're going to come right back, okay?
1214440	1216440	So it doesn't matter.
1216440	1217440	That's a damn good point.
1217440	1219760	The core gamers are extremely finicky.
1219760	1223520	I mean, God, this even ties into something else that kind of came up while we were gone.
1223520	1224520	We've kind of missed a lot.
1224520	1226320	It was a pretty busy time of the year.
1226320	1235660	But there was this whole interview and look into as to why do game blogs and even podcasters
1235660	1240480	like us and so on find the need to nitpick the negative in every single game out there.
1240480	1244480	And I think it's centered around Mirror's Edge and how Mirror's Edge is really getting
1244480	1248400	these reviews that are just all over the map.
1248400	1252520	Some people are giving it, oh my God, best game ever, et cetera, et cetera.
1252520	1255960	And some people are saying, and just really nitpicking the shit out of the game.
1255960	1261360	You know, are people doing it just to be negative on something?
1261360	1264240	They're not fucking Power Trip is what they are.
1264240	1266920	They're getting treated like royalty, getting promo shit sent to them.
1266920	1270120	They're getting basically blown by these game companies.
1270120	1275120	And then they're just like, oh, well, this game isn't as good as buh buh buh buh buh,
1275120	1276120	you know?
1276120	1278320	And this is why I'm going to nitp- meh meh meh meh meh.
1278320	1281520	You know, just like I'm playing about little shit, and that's probably because they're-
1281520	1284200	You know, this is so ironic coming from you.
1284200	1285560	But you know what, though?
1285560	1287320	I find fun in different things.
1287320	1290960	I mean, like Earth Defense Force, perfect example, that game is absolute shit.
1290960	1297520	If you were to look at it, like, by, you know, graphics, AI, everything is goddamn retarded
1297520	1298520	in that game.
1298520	1299520	But it's fun.
1299520	1303120	And that's the whole point is that's really all that counts is if the game is fun.
1303120	1304720	Who gives a crap if it's ugly?
1304720	1305720	It's fun.
1305720	1306720	That's the whole point.
1306720	1310960	You just were sitting here dogging on the community games for having crappy graphics.
1310960	1311960	Exactly.
1311960	1312960	But they aren't fun either.
1312960	1313960	Okay.
1313960	1314960	All right, then.
1314960	1315960	All right, fine.
1315960	1320280	And seriously, though, I mean, there are lines that, you know, can be crossed, you know,
1320280	1324520	where it's like, okay, yeah, it might be fun, but seriously, man, that looks awful.
1324520	1326520	Just, I don't know.
1326520	1327840	All right.
1327840	1329080	Any other games you've been playing this week?
1329080	1332440	We've kind of gone on all these tangents, but it's been fine.
1332440	1336120	Any other games you've been playing this week?
1336120	1337120	No.
1337120	1340480	I've been using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player quite a bit.
1340480	1342200	Katung Pupan is pretty awesome.
1342200	1343200	Sweet.
1343200	1345720	Mamma Mia is coming out pretty soon.
1345720	1352600	Dark Knight and Sing Star Abba on PlayStation 3 is this week, isn't it?
1352600	1354000	Yeah, I believe it is.
1354000	1355200	Oh, I'm excited.
1355200	1360880	Well, I, was it, I, someone had mentioned, like, I have pre-ordered right now one of
1360880	1365600	the limited editions of Dark Knight with the stupid Batpod thing because I want a piece
1365600	1370440	of crap for my desk, you know, like, running out of cool things to put on it.
1370440	1373640	So we'll see if I actually buy that, but, I don't know.
1373640	1377400	All right, games I've been playing this week, pretty much, you know, same old stuff.
1377400	1378760	I was talking about Netflix.
1378760	1380120	I did dive into community games.
1380120	1381120	I picked up Snake 360.
1381120	1385480	You know, we had Aaron on last week, who was the, really the dude behind Snake 360, and,
1385480	1388160	you know, I had a good time with Snake 360.
1388160	1393380	I really like that Aaron has pushed the limits of everything that you can kind of possibly
1393380	1396920	do within the confines of what community games lets you do.
1396920	1400680	Like, you know, he just has all these different modes, all these different maps.
1400680	1406680	You know, when you take a really basic game, you know, Snake is not the most complicated
1406680	1407680	game.
1407680	1410980	You know, it's basically an evolved Atari 2600 game, right?
1410980	1415200	Surround evolved into the cell phone snake game evolved into what we have here now, Snake
1415200	1419600	360, right, with some, with Tron Light Cycles mixed in there somewhere.
1419600	1423480	You know, he's really kind of done a lot that you can do with this game when it comes to
1423480	1427680	having the multiplayer, having the timed mode, having the, you know, pick up a certain number
1427680	1430520	of pods in a level mode, having the different mazes.
1430520	1436020	And I think the soundtrack, it was really smart of him to pair up with, you know, Kyle
1436020	1441200	Ward and his company and have the music, because it adds a certain uniqueness to the game,
1441200	1443100	which is kind of cool.
1443100	1448440	The only drawbacks to Snake 360 are out of this guy's control.
1448440	1452640	The biggest problems I have with the game is that when I'm playing these multiplayer
1452640	1455560	modes, I'm kind of like, this would be so much more fun if I could play it on Xbox Live
1455560	1458760	with people across, you know, the nation.
1458760	1463960	But I realize at the same time, that's something that Microsoft just plain won't let him do.
1463960	1467180	But I worry for community games as a whole, because I think there's going to be a lot
1467180	1470140	of people that don't know so much about, you know, well, community games have all these
1470140	1471520	restrictions to them.
1471520	1475240	And like, he can't do online leaderboards, because Microsoft won't let them.
1475240	1479560	But you know, he's found a lot of very creative workarounds, I'll give him that.
1479560	1483560	Instead of achievements, he has goals, and the goals will unlock things.
1483560	1488440	Instead of the leaderboards, he has the online leaderboards where you go and put in the codes.
1488440	1493320	Instead of, you know, he's done some very creative workarounds, especially when he considered
1493320	1498360	this is for all intents and purposes a launch title for community games.
1498360	1502340	So it's definitely worth your $5 if you're a fan of like 80s arcade games that were very
1502340	1503640	basic and to the point.
1503640	1505580	I think you'll find that this is pretty extensive.
1505580	1510100	But if you think a game like Snake is going to bore you, like, you know, you don't play
1510100	1514840	it for more than 5 seconds on the cell phone, or you have a very short attention span, there's
1514840	1517400	not going to be a lot here for you, I don't think.
1517400	1519600	I think you probably won't enjoy the game.
1519600	1523440	But I think as a local multiplayer, especially, it's a lot of fun.
1523440	1528160	I crave it to be on Xbox Live, and I'm kind of disappointed Microsoft won't let some of
1528160	1529680	these games go to the next level.
1529680	1530680	I hope they will.
1530680	1535720	I hope some of these really good, you know, impressing community games, such as, you know,
1535720	1537160	Weapon of Choice I think is doing very well.
1537160	1541480	You mentioned it earlier, Bobby had the dude on his show tonight from Weapon of Choice.
1541480	1546080	Maybe some of these guys will get to upgrade if they want to a full on game.
1546080	1549440	I don't know, we'll see.
1549440	1552760	But it's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of like old school 80s games,
1552760	1554360	like, you know, arcade games.
1554360	1556020	It's fun.
1556020	1559320	Not worth your time whatsoever, I'm sorry, I know I'm going to piss a lot of people off
1559320	1560320	with this.
1560320	1563080	Another Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix is poop.
1563080	1565520	I didn't like it one bit.
1565520	1567760	I checked it out on PlayStation Network when it came out.
1567760	1571360	My friend actually bought it, so I did get to take a look at the full version.
1571360	1572840	I didn't even look at the demo first.
1572840	1576240	I didn't realize that the Xbox 360 demo was as handicapped as it was.
1576240	1579560	I actually kind of did most of my play on this game on PlayStation Network, and I'll
1579560	1581120	tell you what.
1581120	1585320	It's the same game you've had already, and I know you already know this about Street
1585320	1589800	Fighter II, but to me it's a little bit insulting that, you know, they would charge $10 for
1589800	1594100	that first game and then come around a year later and charge $10 for essentially the same
1594100	1595200	game.
1595200	1601260	You have an additional $5 or whatever you want to say for this game, and yes, I realize
1601260	1606620	Street Fighter II is a classic, but at the same time, there's only so much you can do
1606620	1611920	with it, and I think Street Fighter IV is more of what, in my opinion, a redone Street
1611920	1614480	Fighter II ought to be, is Street Fighter IV.
1614480	1615480	Here's the thing.
1615480	1619560	What do you get in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix that you didn't have before?
1619560	1626400	It's the same game with four new characters, of which, you know, give or take, in my opinion.
1626400	1628480	I guess I like Fei Long, but I don't know.
1628480	1629880	They're kind of give or take.
1629880	1635280	It isn't worth the $5 to me, or so there's that, and then there's the new graphics and
1635280	1636280	the new sound.
1636280	1637560	And the rebalancing.
1637560	1638880	I'm going to say something here.
1638880	1643160	Well, the rebalancing for a casual fighter person like me is irrelevant.
1643160	1644400	The graphics aren't bad.
1644400	1645400	I'll give it that.
1645400	1647140	The HD is pretty cool.
1647140	1649320	The sprites are done fairly well.
1649320	1655600	Although, it's not a smooth game, because you still have very, you know, but I understand
1655600	1658840	you can't do that without breaking the original mechanics of Street Fighter, but don't expect
1658840	1662320	that the game is necessarily going to run smoother or look that much smoother, because,
1662320	1665700	you know, the sprites are just prettier, and that's about it, okay?
1665700	1670640	And I'm being corrected by chat, because five new characters when you count, Akuma, but
1670640	1671640	whatever.
1671640	1672640	But here's the thing, okay?
1672640	1675700	Now I'm going to make a statement that's really not going to make me popular, but the other
1675700	1682880	thing that, you know, you have besides the new graphics is the new sound, and the soundtrack
1682880	1683880	sucks.
1683880	1690840	Like, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate what they tried to do with Street Fighter
1690840	1691840	2.
1691840	1695640	I appreciate that they tried to go to the indie community and this OC remix thing, and
1695640	1700240	they actually got people to remix the songs, but for me, they don't work.
1700240	1704640	They don't match the mood of the original songs at all, and I could tell this from the
1704640	1706480	minute the character select screen came up.
1706480	1709400	I was like, what did they do to the character select music?
1709400	1712000	This is awful!
1712000	1715480	So sorry, I know that statement's probably not going to make me popular amongst fans
1715480	1720280	of the OC remix circuit, and it's not to say that website hasn't done a lot of great things
1720280	1726640	in the past, but I think it's left best these tracks that made it into this game as remix,
1726640	1731000	and I realize it's a whole play on that word, remix, and da-da-da-da-da, but it didn't work
1731000	1735800	in the game at all for me, and sound to me is very, very important in the game and the
1735800	1741040	music, and if you're going to try and rate me for $15 more based on nostalgia, I want
1741040	1743480	my tunes to have some sense of nostalgia.
1743480	1750600	Yes, I realize I can revert to classic mode, but again, what are you trying to sell me?
1750600	1754040	If you just wanted to sell me the classic songs, you already sold that to me a year
1754040	1755040	ago!
1755040	1760440	So, I expect that these remixes are going to have some type of, maybe I'm just bothered
1760440	1765120	because I've heard remixes of these songs before that were more true to the originals,
1765120	1769240	and that were better for me, but I did not like the soundtrack at all, you know?
1769240	1775240	Call me names, tell me I'm hatin' if you want, but in this particular circumstance, I did
1775240	1777080	not like the music, I'm sorry.
1777080	1781080	I'm not a real big fan of Street Fighter II anyway, so I didn't even look at it.
1781080	1786760	I was just like, eh, $15, screw that, I'm not going to buy it, I'm not going to buy
1786760	1787760	the original either.
1787760	1791400	Now, if they came out with yet another Bionic Commando game, then yes, I would probably,
1791400	1794160	shit, I gotta go back and play the Bionic Commando again.
1794160	1799440	So, it nearly came out later this whole thing on the Xbox 360, how the demo on Xbox 360
1799440	1804160	only was local multiplayer, and like, so if you're a solo player, you can't do crap with
1804160	1808200	the demo, and you know, I was talking about this on Bobby's show, I don't know if he
1808200	1812440	has, hopefully you're listening to him too, but I kind of theorized this might be because
1812440	1815480	Capcom didn't want to do a demo for this game.
1815480	1819400	I think they are afraid if people check out this game, they're going to realize it's
1819400	1821280	a waste of their money.
1821280	1827040	That there's not enough here besides the continued whoring of your nostalgia, which,
1827040	1833200	God, I feel like I've been through that enough in the past two years thanks to Nintendo.
1833200	1834200	You know what I mean?
1834200	1837880	But I gotta give them credit, at least the sprites look good, they put the effort into
1837880	1843480	the graphics of the game and stuff, it's not just blurry, you know.
1843480	1850480	But yeah, I mean really, if you're not really, if you bought the first one on Xbox Live,
1850480	1852760	you probably don't need to buy this either.
1852760	1856960	Honestly, don't bother with it on Xbox at all if you don't have the right controller.
1856960	1860880	Don't try to play this game with a regular Xbox 360 controller unless you have somehow
1860880	1865560	been able to overcome that whole, I'm telling you, every bad thing you hear about the Xbox
1865560	1869040	360 controller is true for this.
1869040	1874360	Don't, if you have to get it, get it on PlayStation Network for the controller alone, unless you
1874360	1879880	have an arcade stick on 360 or something.
1879880	1883840	And of course, folks in chat are completely disagreeing, which is fine, I kind of expected
1883840	1884840	that.
1884840	1889480	Hitstun says, but really, STHD is the definitive Street Fighter now even more so than Street
1889480	1893560	Fighter IV, all fighting game players need to buy it.
1893560	1897000	Acidic Vampire says, that's what some movie studios do, when they know a movie's going
1897000	1899440	to suck, they don't release it to the press for advanced reviews.
1899440	1903600	Well, here's the weird thing, I think the game overall is getting good reviews, I realize,
1903600	1906680	and I'm not doing it for the sake of going against it, I just personally, I did not like
1906680	1907680	it, I'm sorry.
1907680	1910840	No, I'm not sorry, I didn't like it, deal with it.
1910840	1914560	But that's another thing too, is this whole game review stuff, because they remember,
1914560	1918000	and this all just like Chrono Trigger and stuff, no offense, Chrono Trigger is an awesome
1918000	1923520	game and stuff, but they didn't really do too much to the DS game, and it's getting
1923520	1925760	like almost perfect scores and stuff.
1925760	1927800	It's kind of weird.
1927800	1932040	But you know, it is Chrono Trigger, so it's pretty awesome.
1932040	1935840	Then Hitstun goes on to say, if you don't have a 360, and I might be taking this out
1935840	1940280	of context, I apologize, says, if you don't have a 360 or PS3, it's a good reason to buy
1940280	1941880	the console just to get the game.
1941880	1945860	Oh god, do I disagree with that comment.
1945860	1950800	If the game in question is Street Fighter, because it's really not.
1950800	1955720	You can't put games out there like LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid IV, and say, those are the
1955720	1962160	reasons, those are the reasons to get a PlayStation 3, and then Gears 2, Fable 2, countless games
1962160	1963160	on 360.
1963160	1967480	Dude, if you're going to buy a console, and you're going to spend like $300 on a console,
1967480	1976800	or $400 in the case of a PS3, I haven't really priced them lately, or at all, but I would
1976800	1981100	be willing to bet you could probably get a full-size arcade cabinet with Street Fighter
1981100	1982100	2.
1982100	1986600	It probably wouldn't be that expensive, I mean, that would be my guess, just the original
1986600	1989760	Street Fighter 2, or whatever.
1989760	1994760	You might even be able to get it for just slightly more than $400, if you're really
1994760	1999560	that insane that you'd buy a console for a freaking downloadable game, I mean that's
1999560	2003240	weird.
2003240	2007000	I have a comment that'll piss off the Street Fighter fans even further.
2007000	2011240	Now this I will say, just for the sake of pissing people off, I'll admit this, playing
2011240	2016920	Street Fighter 2 HD Remix almost made me want to go buy Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
2016920	2019160	That's how much I did not enjoy the game.
2019160	2021040	No, that's not right.
2021040	2022640	You think that's taking it too far?
2022640	2023640	That's taking it too far.
2023640	2026840	Taking it too far?
2026840	2036880	I mean, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is, cannot even begin to be compared to Marvel
2036880	2037880	vs. Capcom.
2037880	2042600	It's just like, on another subpar level, I don't even know.
2042600	2048520	But it's really sad, and that's insulting to me, and I don't even like either one of
2048520	2051040	those games, really.
2051040	2055000	I'm getting yelled at by chat for that comment, that was pretty bad.
2055000	2060440	Alright, look, let's get into some of tonight's games.
2060440	2062480	Okay, see, here's what I'm saying right here.
2062480	2067620	Street Fighter 2, you can get Street Fighter Alpha 2 Arcade Cabinet, $600.
2067620	2073040	So you better believe that you can get an original Street Fighter 2 machine, yeah, they're
2073040	2074680	like about $600 bucks.
2074680	2079040	So just, if you're really that insane that you would buy a console for this, seriously,
2079040	2084200	just go buy the real arcade game, I mean, there you go.
2084200	2088840	Alright, before we get to some gaming news tonight, let's talk about some housekeeping
2088840	2089840	tonight.
2089840	2092000	We're gonna do a contest soon to give away the code for Banjo-Kazooie.
2092000	2096640	We were supposed to do it last week, but we're gonna retool it to be something that both
2096640	2099320	our live and our podcast listeners can do.
2099320	2103480	So we're not gonna be doing it tonight, but there will be something probably next week,
2103480	2108000	and we'll kind of give you more details on that when everybody's back and when it's not
2108000	2110200	the holidays.
2110200	2116640	Also, I don't think we have a lot else to talk about in housekeeping tonight, just the
2116640	2124000	stuff with our Facebook, of course, we have OL Army on Facebook, MySpace at username OrangeLoungeRadio,
2124000	2126540	and LiveJournal at OrangeLounge.
2126540	2131720	So unless you can think of anything for housekeeping tonight, as far as news goes, but not a lot
2131720	2133560	going on with the show otherwise.
2133560	2135560	Same old, same old.
2135560	2142760	No, I can't think of anything other than Burger King Tender Crisp sandwiches aren't that great.
2142760	2143760	Nice.
2143760	2145760	Alright, we're gonna get into the news tonight.
2145760	2152920	Oh, before we get into the news tonight, you know, we usually do our little thing on Bobby
2152920	2158200	Show before we go live, you know, Bobby Black Wolf, the man who we follow on all games radio
2158200	2159520	live, Sunday nights.
2159520	2163560	I don't know if you guys heard of there was some weird little like cryptic message.
2163560	2167120	And I tried to ask Bobby about it, but he's like, totally ignoring my text.
2167120	2170320	But I'm trying to figure out like what that website was like, I don't know, did you guys
2170320	2171320	hear it?
2171320	2178160	It was something like flive.net or something FNG live, I couldn't hear it all, but I don't
2178160	2179160	know.
2179160	2183040	I'll have to go back and download it and check it out, something weird going on.
2183040	2187520	Alright, let's get into the news and tell Bobby to stop ignoring me, this is very rude,
2187520	2188520	Bobby.
2188520	2190520	Alright, I'm calling you out.
2190520	2193400	Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki, why don't you start off.
2193400	2199040	Okay, well, a couple weeks ago, the brand new download content for Grand Theft Auto
2199040	2200920	4 was announced.
2200920	2207800	Grand Theft Auto's Lost and the Damned, or Lost and Damned I guess, which is gonna revolve
2207800	2212120	around the biker gang that was in Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost.
2212120	2216400	And would be a brand new thing, I guess a brand new story mode, doesn't really add anything
2216400	2222340	like I wanted to it, like tanks and crap, but hey, new story, sweet.
2222340	2227320	It was going to be released in February.
2227320	2233320	Right now though, what's interesting is GameStop has the download content available to purchase
2233320	2240560	on their website, which is supposed to be released in February on the 17th.
2240560	2244400	And so apparently you'll be able to buy this redemption card at GameStop.
2244400	2252240	I mean, talk about a way to whore that out, but here's a hint folks, if you go to GameStop
2252240	2253600	you're gonna pay sales tax.
2253600	2257320	If you buy it online, you're not gonna have to pay sales tax, at least you shouldn't have
2257320	2259520	to pay a sales tax.
2259520	2262160	So don't buy it from GameStop.
2262160	2264320	That's pretty easy right there.
2264320	2266760	Don't some states charge you sales tax even on the download stuff?
2266760	2269300	Well in that case it doesn't matter then.
2269300	2274760	But then again, it costs you gas to drive down the GameStop.
2274760	2278560	Gas is cheap right now, have you noticed?
2278560	2282880	In the two weeks we've been off, gas dropped a dollar, what are you talking about?
2282880	2287260	It's still a cost, and even after all that, it's just to buy a code that you would enter
2287260	2288680	in to download it anyway.
2288680	2295560	So just save yourself the time, save them the ego of being able to pre-order cards.
2295560	2298360	I mean, that's sad.
2298360	2301160	Just go buy it online.
2301160	2304880	Why do you even need to buy the GameStop?
2304880	2309200	Well maybe it's just the conv- you know what, it's- well wait, when is this coming out?
2309200	2310200	I was gonna say February.
2310200	2313040	Oh never mind, I was gonna say so people could buy it as a Christmas present.
2313040	2317280	So they can pre-order more stuff, so they can get you to turn in some games that pre-order
2317280	2321320	download content, so they can get another five bucks from you.
2321320	2327240	I'm sorry, but the fact that you would pay for download content as a store and then go
2327240	2329800	home and download it is just stupid.
2329800	2334500	According to me, I mean, what do I know though?
2334500	2337360	Well maybe somebody doesn't have internet capability or what have you.
2337360	2338800	Then you wouldn't buy the download content!
2338800	2339800	This isn't a disc!
2339800	2342800	It's a card with a code that you enter it in online and download it!
2342800	2343800	It's stupid!
2343800	2345840	Alright, I guess, I guess, fine.
2345840	2347120	It's absolutely retarded.
2347120	2350000	Zushi says free poster at Gamestop?
2350000	2351480	Woo hoo!
2351480	2352480	Free poster!
2352480	2357240	Okay, well if they've- well if they got a free poster then I better go down there right
2357240	2358240	now!
2358240	2360800	Sorry I can't do the rest of the show, I gotta get my free poster.
2360800	2365040	Well look, look, look, hey I like free things and maybe I am- in fact I would be probably
2365040	2368840	one of the three people who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
2368840	2372760	And if you actually want to order Grand Theft Auto 4 pre-order, if you want to do it for
2372760	2378060	your PC, order Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, you can actually get a free copy of Grand
2378060	2380720	Theft Auto Vice City just for placing the pre-order.
2380720	2385360	This is all via Steam, so Valve and Rockstar Games teamed up, and if you pre-order Grand
2385360	2393280	Theft Auto 4 PC via Steam, then Vice City will be free!
2393280	2394280	Well that's awesome!
2394280	2397720	Which by the way you gotta do it like right now because Grand Theft Auto 4 releases like
2397720	2399640	what Tuesday on PC?
2399640	2406160	That's awesome except Anadras was way better anyways, and Vice City this time is really
2406160	2407160	old.
2407160	2409080	I don't know.
2409080	2417680	Just buy Grand Theft Auto 4, you don't even need like extra stuff for it.
2417680	2427520	So anyways, speaking of other things, Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC has the ever infamous secure
2427520	2428520	ROM in it now.
2428520	2432680	Well thankfully though, there's not going to be as much limitation as some of these
2432680	2434240	other games.
2434240	2439960	There is no limit on concurrent installations, but you will have to authenticate it once
2439960	2446200	you've installed it, and you'll have to I guess authenticate it again if you reinstall
2446200	2447200	it.
2447200	2452800	So it's basically just to make sure that the CD-ROM I guess is, I don't know, in your drive
2452800	2454840	when you're playing the game or something like that.
2454840	2456720	Something stupid.
2456720	2462360	But I can't help but think this is probably going to be cracked next week already.
2462360	2468960	I mean, secure ROM has really been no obstacle for a lot of people anyways.
2468960	2472280	It's quite a controversial thing, I mean it's not just the limited installations is pissing
2472280	2475760	people off, but the whole you know that whole thing and I don't know whether you would call
2475760	2479260	it a rumor if it's a proven fact or what, but the whole like you know that it might
2479260	2481520	screw up your drive.
2481520	2485960	Well I already have it installed in my system and nothing's messed up so far, so yeah it
2485960	2488200	doesn't really matter for me.
2488200	2494360	But then again I'm not buying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV.
2494360	2498440	Dark Tetsuya relays an interesting comment, he said it's like I told the people at Game
2498440	2502880	Politics, considering how hard secure ROM is to get rid of, I'd rather take my chances
2502880	2507560	with Trojans and Keyloggers.
2507560	2514040	You just, you know, have a trusted place to download your wares I guess.
2514040	2518040	I guess so, although you shouldn't be advocating piracy, I don't think we should be advocating
2518040	2519240	secure ROM either.
2519240	2524160	I'm not advocating piracy, I'm just saying I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC.
2524160	2528600	Because you already have it on 360, what do you need it on PC for, right?
2528600	2532600	I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC.
2532600	2536120	Well yeah because I do have it, I've already finished it, there's no reason for me to actually
2536120	2541640	play this on PC other than it looks prettier and well you know I do have a game PC now,
2541640	2544200	might as well put games on it.
2544200	2547920	Alright, I gotcha.
2547920	2552640	You're just looking forward to all the hacking that people can do with Grand Theft Auto IV.
2552640	2554800	Can secure ROM prevent that?
2554800	2558080	Or do you think that they wouldn't bother because that's kind of the reason why people
2558080	2559520	get it on PC is to screw with it?
2559520	2565780	No, it's not going to affect it at all because secure ROM only really protects the main executable
2565780	2566780	for it.
2566780	2573320	The data files are what's going to be modified to whatever you want to do with it.
2573320	2577000	Make naked people run around, I don't know, whatever floats your boat I guess.
2577000	2580480	Alright, before we get into more gaming news tonight, what did we miss last week?
2580480	2581960	Do we miss some stuff last week?
2581960	2585640	I know we weren't here and the one thing that comes to mind, the big story I know we were
2585640	2588860	going to cover last week before the plug got pulled on the show was the whole PETA Cookie
2588860	2589860	Mama thing.
2589860	2593240	Oh yeah, PETA did a little spoof on Cookie Mama.
2593240	2598000	They have, apparently they don't really care about people's trademarks or anything like
2598000	2599720	that because it's parody.
2599720	2603560	But I mean, seriously, it's just.
2603560	2607640	It was really just an overall excuse to get people to watch the video that's embedded
2607640	2608640	there.
2608640	2611440	And Majesco had a really cute response to it where they actually quoted Mama and I thought
2611440	2613960	that was very cute what they did.
2613960	2620280	But as far as PETA goes, love them or hate them, it's working.
2620280	2621400	People are talking about it.
2621400	2625960	And I'll tell you what, probably hundreds and thousands of people saw that video that
2625960	2629320	wouldn't have before simply because it did tie into video games.
2629320	2633320	So love them or hate them, they did what they had to do.
2633320	2637040	And it worked for all intents and purposes, I suppose.
2637040	2641720	As much as I don't necessarily agree, you know, it's not that I don't agree with PETA
2641720	2648520	100%, but, well, you know what I mean, I'm all for treating animals nice and all that
2648520	2653720	stuff but I think that particular organization sometimes goes a little bit too far and they'll
2653720	2656720	kind of stop at nothing to get their message across.
2656720	2660320	But the more we talk about it, the more free publicity they're getting, so whatevs.
2660320	2664840	But I just wanted to say Majesco had a very cute response to it and props to them.
2664840	2670320	I was going to say that there was another story that I think is kind of big and sort
2670320	2672240	of kind of got blown over a little bit.
2672240	2678560	Eidos, once again back in the spotlight, for trying to fix their Metacritic scores for
2678560	2680680	Tomb Raider Underworld.
2680680	2688160	Apparently, and they sort of blew, you know, tried to make it blow over, but apparently
2688160	2695880	they were telling their UK press outlets that they could not post bad scores, low review
2695880	2696880	scores.
2696880	2700640	It says, that's right, we're trying to manage review scores at the request of Eidos.
2700640	2705180	When asked why, the spokesperson said just that we're trying to get the Metacritic rating
2705180	2712200	to be high and the brand manager in the US that's handling all the Tomb Raider has asked
2712200	2715380	that we just manage the scores before the game is out.
2715380	2720380	Really, just ensure that we don't put people off from buying the game basically.
2720380	2727920	So basically, the positive reviews can go out but the lower scored reviews have to wait.
2727920	2731080	That's not the first time I've heard of something like that though and not, I mean, that's the
2731080	2735360	first time I've heard of the Metacritic spin on it but I've definitely heard of companies
2735360	2737520	saying like, you know, well what review are you going to give it?
2737520	2739800	Oh, well if you're going to give it a high review then you can post it early.
2739800	2742960	You can break the embargo but if you're not going to give it a high review then you have
2742960	2745160	to wait till, you know, the street date.
2745160	2750360	That's kind of messed up and there's probably a good reason why that a low review might
2750360	2757000	be, you know, warrant this game but apparently the Tomb Raider Underworld version for the
2757000	2762560	Wii has a glitch at the end of the game that prevents you from finishing it.
2762560	2766800	If you, I don't know exactly the circumstances but apparently from what I heard is if you
2766800	2772960	kill certain soldiers or whatever in the wrong order that there will be a lever that's supposed
2772960	2779080	to be there that you're supposed to pull won't be there somehow and apparently there's no
2779080	2784120	way to fix that at all and Eidos' workaround is that they will just give you a save that's
2784120	2787280	past that point.
2787280	2790440	How do they give you a save?
2790440	2792240	You have to go download it off the internet and you have to do this.
2792240	2794360	Oh, because I'm sure everybody can just do that.
2794360	2795360	Yeah.
2795360	2796360	I think it's really annoying.
2796360	2797360	Interesting.
2797360	2800200	I'm just kind of trying to check out the Metacritic scores.
2800200	2803160	78 is the current score on the PlayStation 3 version.
2803160	2804160	That's not bad.
2804160	2805960	That's not a bad score all things considered.
2805960	2807280	Look at the Wii version.
2807280	2808940	Wii version has a 68.
2808940	2810440	That's not too bad.
2810440	2812800	That's actually not a horrible score.
2812800	2816320	It's in the yellow but it's not horrible.
2816320	2821320	But see at the same time that makes me wonder though it's like if this glitch does actually
2821320	2825800	exist in a game where you can't finish the game how many of these getting like sevens
2825800	2827200	and eights?
2827200	2832160	Well maybe there's a very specific order you have to do things to glitch it.
2832160	2833880	No apparently it's pretty easy to do.
2833880	2838860	You have to do a very specific order not to glitch it is what it anyways they have a workaround
2838860	2842660	or some way that you're supposed to play the game in order not to glitch it either way
2842660	2845320	this glitch shouldn't exist in the game.
2845320	2848120	But you know I'm sure they played through the game enough.
2848120	2851200	So guess what Wii game speaking now that I'm just happen to be on Metacritic right now
2851200	2855760	guess what Wii game has the lowest Metacritic score out of anything out there and what it
2855760	2857400	is?
2857400	2864160	A 28 for this game called Game Party 2 by Midway.
2864160	2865160	Oh yeah.
2865160	2868160	It's known as more game party overseas.
2868160	2875440	It's got lawn darts, bean bags, horseshoes the highest score was a 35 from GameSpot and
2875440	2882120	most places are giving it like a 20 and they're just it's unoriginal it's based there basically
2882120	2884520	everybody says it's a shit game.
2884520	2888840	It's unoriginal it's also dirt cheap it's 20 bucks and that sold actually pretty well
2888840	2889840	from what I remember.
2889840	2893320	But that's 20 bucks that honestly you know despite all the crap I gave it earlier it's
2893320	2898920	20 bucks that's better spent on Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix.
2898920	2902440	And honestly you know despite the hard time I gave Street Fighter 2 I mean it still is
2902440	2907480	Street Fighter 2 which is better than like 80% of the Wii games out there right now if
2907480	2908480	not more.
2908480	2917600	Some of the other stuff from last week there was a new update to the Wii that broke the
2917600	2923480	Twilight hack and all that stuff and also targeted modded save files and some other
2923480	2925240	stuff.
2925240	2930800	And apparently yeah there it was you know bad and what did enhance those it added I
2930800	2935360	guess the ability to use USB keyboards during in the Mii channel or something like that
2935360	2937400	for when you're typing stuff.
2937400	2943640	What's funny though is it got re-broken again a few days later by hackers and they released
2943640	2947760	a new version of the Twilight update or the Twilight hack that allowed you to install
2947760	2948760	the homebrew channel.
2948760	2951760	But still though thanks for trying.
2951760	2958920	And then finally one last thing a couple things that were kind of interesting new arcade games
2958920	2966480	and Guitar Hero apparently is coming to the arcade and the weirdest part about it is Konami
2966480	2973080	is helping them by partnering up with Activision to actually make the hardware for the game.
2973080	2979840	It's apparently going to be based around Guitar Hero 3's engine and it's being developed by
2979840	2985200	Roth Thrills who did I guess some of the big buck hunter games.
2985200	2989760	So I don't know they've got a little bit of experience there.
2989760	2993400	There is going to be some online functionality with it.
2993400	2996800	No word if they're going to actually have any additional songs or if it's just going
2996800	3005000	to be stuff from Guitar Hero 3 but the hardware itself looks like the kind of the world tour
3005000	3008280	guitars but with arcade parts.
3008280	3013520	So look for those essentially that were hoping that Konami would one day bring Guitar Freaks
3013520	3016680	out to the US forget it.
3016680	3017680	Forget it.
3017680	3019700	It's done.
3019700	3025100	These folks at Activision and Neversoft and well I guess you can't say Neversoft but Activision
3025100	3030440	and so forth and Red Octane have their mouths firmly planted on Konami's cock where it ought
3030440	3035440	to be because it's kind of where the idea came from in the first place one could argue
3035440	3041320	and Konami likes it and you know they're getting theirs from it so it's you know it's a win
3041320	3043120	win deal all around.
3043120	3044280	This is what it's going to be.
3044280	3045280	Yeah.
3045280	3046460	Take it or leave it.
3046460	3050600	And of course they say that that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be a Guitar Freaks game
3050600	3056120	but that this basically means that there's not going to be a Guitar Freaks game I mean more or less.
3056120	3059520	Then all the other games that were being shown off as well American Idol they're going to
3059520	3064040	have a game that you can record your performances and burn it off to a DVD.
3064040	3065040	That's crap.
3065040	3070240	And then finally something that some people might actually care about BeatMania 2DX16
3070240	3074280	Empress was finally released in arcades and has a lot of fun stuff with that lots of new
3074280	3081940	songs and hopefully a few that will actually make it over here someday some machines.
3081940	3089240	And then lastly EA apparently is teaming up with Gamestop and it's an idea that they're
3089240	3097900	throwing around right now they're offering people a season pass according to a survey
3097900	3102320	that's been sent out they were throwing out the idea of having like an EA Sports season
3102320	3107160	pass where someone would buy this for say a twenty dollar enrollment fee and what would
3107160	3113120	it do is it would cut thirty three percent of the cost from all EA Sports games are purchased
3113120	3114360	in that year.
3114360	3118640	So if you bought the pass and you say you're a person that buys you know the Madden's NCAA
3118640	3124380	football and all that stuff you would save you know thirty three percent off each game.
3124380	3127600	Which I mean it's not a bad deal if you think about it because you're actually saving you
3127600	3131640	know twenty bucks a game about.
3131640	3137000	So if you buy a lot of games or if you even buy one game with this deal I mean it's worth
3137000	3141960	it to do it because you actually break even with the first game and then you start saving
3141960	3148520	money with the second game but once again they get you to buy more than one game so.
3148520	3153160	This is the solution for a weakening economy I suppose get you get you hooked in early
3153160	3158840	season pass deals I guess that's how it's going to go all right because see here's the
3158840	3165440	other thing with the season pass is that you say for example you may have bought NBA 2K
3165440	3173360	you know 10 or whatever next year well now say if you buy the season pass for like Madden
3173360	3177120	or something like that and you're thinking about buying an NBA game you might be more
3177120	3181440	likely to buy NBA Live 09 because now you're saving twenty bucks.
3181440	3187040	True true interesting I guess we'll see how this plays out but I'm not much of a sports
3187040	3189640	game fan so it's not like it's a deal I'm going to take but I know there are people
3189640	3193300	out there that might just want to jump on the deal because the deal is a deal and if
3193300	3198000	you are a person that buys these games is this isn't necessarily bad news and this isn't
3198000	3201960	an enemy if you are a person to buy sports games think about it this way get with your
3201960	3206960	friends one person buys that you know or chip in for the season pass and you just have one
3206960	3211480	person buy all your games and there you go save a lot of money work the system but I
3211480	3215600	don't know if this is actually going to happen but we'll see all right we will see what happens
3215600	3220640	wow so it sounds like it was a pretty busy busy week last week yes and here I was spending
3220640	3224920	my gaming time watching Netflix on the 360 and I watched a documentary about gay bars
3224920	3230500	in Mississippi no kidding I'm telling you they have everything they have documentaries
3230500	3237520	on everything on Netflix everything I started a documentary about Walmart I haven't finished
3237520	3241800	it yet but it's a documentary about nothing but Walmart the high price of yeah yeah it's
3241800	3245860	like an anti Walmart thing but you know I'm trying to watch it with an open mind I'm not
3245860	3249400	a fan of Walmart in the first place and it really has nothing to do with this whole blob
3249400	3253760	it's just I just think Walmart's kind of dirty that's my biggest problem maybe it's just
3253760	3259080	the one here but yeah so I thought I'd check out the document documentaries on everything
3259080	3263860	on Netflix everything all right well we were talking a little bit about Street Fighter
3263860	3270000	2 during our gaming week and it's interesting to kind of coincide with the Street Fighter
3270000	3275420	2 turbo HD remix they're actually doing a lot of different promotional stuff you may
3275420	3280440	remember with pinball effects they had a special table for it they have special themes out
3280440	3287440	for Xbox your you know Xbox dashboard and I think there's some on the PlayStation Network
3287440	3295120	as well well also coming to your favorite sack puppet game LittleBigPlanet is getting
3295120	3303600	four Street Fighter 2 skins they're gonna have a Chung Li a guile looks like Zangief
3303600	3309980	and Ryu and those are all gonna be available soon apparently it's actually been leaked
3309980	3314140	out but they have the pictures online and I'd say that's pretty conclusive if you ask
3314140	3319840	me but uh you know matter of time before these are released I could see maybe even next week
3319840	3327360	so got me and I'm sure they're gonna be probably about like five bucks or something because
3327360	3332120	they're usually about two bucks a skin yeah I don't know how I feel about paying for LittleBigPlanet
3332120	3336680	skins I don't know it's just a little silly I just download all the free ones yeah I don't
3336680	3341200	know the free ones to get the turkey stuck on your head no I forget to get that one I
3341200	3344880	got the the Venus flytrap one those last one I remember they also have one that's a TV
3344880	3349060	stuck on their head to be honest I haven't played a lot of LittleBigPlanet lately thanks
3349060	3353960	to WorldWarCraft but I'm you know and just real life too I mean just this I was gone
3353960	3357080	for the past four days I know I didn't talk a whole lot about this we didn't talk a lot
3357080	3360120	about what was going on in our real lives this week but I've been gone for a few days
3360120	3363760	I was in LA I know a lot of people kind of do different things for Thanksgiving and I
3363760	3367680	hope everybody in the US had a good Thanksgiving and and even those that don't live in the
3367680	3371580	US so they don't celebrate Thanksgiving and you know hope you've had a good time watching
3371580	3377000	the antics that go on here on the day after Thanksgiving on Black Friday which is like
3377000	3382720	Canada's Boxing Day but without any significance whatsoever it's a completely fabricated made
3382720	3387240	up by the company's holiday and it's like speaking of Walmart and did you hear about
3387240	3392480	the poor person that got trampled to death at Walmart like this is I price pay for going
3392480	3398120	the wall nobody I talked to the high price for low prices nobody I talked to you're horrible
3398120	3402640	nobody I talked to will admit to going out on Black Friday so who's buying stuff I didn't
3402640	3407740	go out on Black Friday I went out to breakfast on Black Friday that's in and we had a hard
3407740	3411360	time trying to find a place to park in the damn parking lot you know what it was a parking
3411360	3418160	lot for Mervins you know what's big about Mervins they all went out of business like
3418160	3424960	they're not even doing anything for Black Friday except further liquidations so I went
3424960	3429060	to a theme park for Black Friday and I actually had a lot of freaking fun it was it was fairly
3429060	3433960	empty and I got to ride some pretty awesome coasters those of you from SoCal X2 is awesome
3433960	3442480	just wanted to get that out there anyhow sorry let's talk about more gaming news and you
3442480	3446380	know I did dog on the soundtrack for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix but you know
3446380	3450920	what hey the people at OC Remix do a lot of great remixes and although I didn't enjoy
3450920	3455380	these remixes in the particular game I think these might be kind of fun to listen to outside
3455380	3461980	of the game and if you want to you can download the remix soundtrack for free it's available
3461980	3466780	right there at Overclocked Remix if you go over to ocremix.org you can download the soundtrack
3466780	3471240	for free and you know what despite the hard time I gave this game earlier is very hard
3471240	3475180	to complain about something that's free so props to all these folks who you know spent
3475180	3479120	their time putting it together and don't get too mad at me because I I dogged it in the
3479120	3483540	game earlier I do think it's a good thing they're putting it out there for free so thanks
3483540	3489980	guys also speaking of Street Fighter 2 HD Remix if you live in Europe you have a little
3489980	3492820	more time to think about whether you want to purchase it or not especially if you're
3492820	3498780	a PlayStation owner no worries for you Xbox 360 folks but the game was delayed on PlayStation
3498780	3505220	Network it was released in North America as scheduled the day before it came out on Xbox
3505220	3512380	360 European 360 owners hopefully got the game a little late I don't know if it actually
3512380	3516380	ended up coming out at all hopefully somebody in chat can clarify it but it was delayed
3516380	3521540	there in Europe just you know funny now that I think of it is you know before they were
3521540	3526860	thinking I think they've got it by now just you know well I was just saying you know I
3526860	3531740	was wondering why they were releasing the PlayStation 3 version a day before you know
3531740	3537680	the Xbox 360 but now that we think about it that they don't have a demo for the PS3 version
3537680	3542060	people don't know that it sucks and so you know that kind of goes back to your theory
3542060	3546900	that that's why they kind of rushed the demo for it and maybe you know one extra day without
3546900	3554180	the demo people can't try it and I don't think it's necessarily that Capcom thinks the game
3554180	3557900	sucks because it's getting good reviews you know obviously I'm just missing something
3557900	3562980	and you know I guess for the fighting fan diehard all the little tweaks they've done
3562980	3568060	with the game and so on to balance and so on make it worth it for them which is fine
3568060	3572100	keep in mind I am not a hardcore fighting game fan or if I ever confessed to be but
3572100	3576620	I do enjoy the occasional fighter I I actually do enjoy the Mortal Kombat games I know that
3576620	3582340	makes me weird but whatever Soul Calibur especially love Soul Calibur games are a lot of fun anyhow
3582340	3588100	whatever sorry I'm getting off track that's right something else coming to the PlayStation
3588100	3595220	Network which has been teased before I think by us Soldner X which was a PC game originally
3595220	3600520	available I think mainly on like playasia.com I remember tons of advertisements for it pretty

3646220	3649180	haven't really been downloading anything on the PlayStation Network because they don't
3649180	3654580	have those prepaid cards and you know I don't like buying my points I like trading in crap
3654580	3659900	that I don't want for points and I thought they did now I thought they did all the cards
3659900	3665140	now in certain stores I don't think GameStop has them yet which is kind of weird I mean
3665140	3672040	it's like Walgreens has them but GameStop doesn't this kind of weird well let's talk
3672040	3676840	about some releases around the world that are gonna be coming out in this next week

3687160	3691100	gets a Japanese release on December 4th so if you live in Japan I want to check out one
3691100	3696080	of Loki's favorite games Saints Row 2 is where it's at on the 360 this is one of those rare
3696080	3702780	cases of usually we we like to cover Japanese release dates because they get them before
3702780	3708780	we do but here's a rare case of they're getting it after we do which is always kind of interesting
3708780	3712960	on the PlayStation 3 Assassin's Creed is getting a price reduction but if you want some new
3712960	3718700	games you can check out Pro Yaku Spirits 5 Kanziban is coming out as well as Saints Row

3748580	3752540	it's like that looks kind of neat actually it's actually looks like a perfect score from
3752540	3758920	Famitsu really yeah perfect 40 out of 40 yet you don't hear much about now here now here's
3758920	3763460	a game that looks like it could work for a hardcore game oh it's got like live cutscenes
3763460	3768980	mixed in it and stuff so it this isn't a game that they can really release here at all now
3768980	3773100	without some major overhaul they have the reasoning yeah reshoot everything that's too
3773100	3777820	bad because there's a game that might be something that us American we hardcore gamers are looking
3777820	3782780	for and unfortunately I'll have to understand Japanese I guess hey PlayStation 2 Dragon
3782780	3787900	Ball Z Infinite World comes out on December 4th on the PlayStation 2 yet another pachinko

4022100	4028700	thing Family Party 30 great games that's from Game Factory and I think it's actually a port

4061340	4068460	game for the Wii some crappy French games Emma at the Farm and Emma in the Mountains
4068460	4073300	I love your description that's just some crappy French they are really bad it's for little
4073300	4082740	girls it's really bad and then Bigfoot Collision Course on the Wii and that is it for the first
4082740	4087420	week of December and sadly that is like the most populated week of the month well it makes
4087420	4090460	sense I think everybody blew their load in November because they wanted to make Black
4090460	4094680	Friday so the rest of the month it's all kind of crap it's gonna it's gonna really slow
4094680	4101900	down now until April I well we do have something because you know Street Fighter IV January
4101900	4106500	and all that you would be surprised actually January and February are looking pretty decent
4106500	4110720	especially February right now interesting I think some of the game companies have figured
4110720	4115900	out hey no one releases games in February that would be a perfect place to put our games
4115900	4120740	interesting Capcom for example they have a ton of stuff coming out in those two months
4120740	4125020	there all right fair enough fair enough all right well hey you know if you're not looking
4125020	4129520	to get new games you can still continue to supplement the ones you have from download
4129520	4134740	content and in January Fallout 3 is going to be getting some new download content people
4134740	4138420	look Fallout 3 is one of those games I probably won't have the time to check out and until
4138420	4143620	January so this will be just in time for that but there's a def excuse me definitely people
4143620	4147580	out there that love their Fallout 3 I don't know if Loki's one of them or not I haven't
4147580	4150860	gotten the plate yet I know it's just so much so much we're doing right now but hey there's
4150860	4155200	gonna be some more download content coming to the 360 and the PC versions right now nothing
4155200	4160920	said about the PlayStation 3 but I can't imagine it won't come within time these expansions
4160920	4167340	are plotted for January Operation Anchorage which is like where you go into like a military
4167340	4175300	simulation and you actually get to save Anchorage Alaska from Chinese communist invaders no
4175300	4181060	not Sarah Palin I guess it's in the Fallout story the pit you get to go to a raider town
4181060	4187220	called the pit which is outside of Pittsburgh get it the pit ha that's coming out in February
4187220	4191360	and then broken steel is coming out in March at least it's not we get to join the Brotherhood
4191360	4200140	of Steel and forget it I how can I follow a 90210 joke fable 2 is getting some download
4200140	4205420	content as well they just announced the brand new island that they're adding called not
4205420	4211700	whole island and it's gonna feature a bunch of cool stuff they're gonna have three unique
4211700	4220860	quests and three unique dungeons you can unravel the mystical secrets of the resurrection shrine
4220860	4226580	plus they're gonna have some new outfits like an armored knight outfit an assassin a barbarian
4226580	4234480	leather-clad biker the hell and six new weapons a dozen of unique potions that I guess will
4234480	4240240	drastically alter your appearance new weapon customization I guess I have new augments
4240240	4248060	and 30 or 50 additional leaderboards and along with that they're gonna have actually some
4248060	4252780	free download content as well in case you don't want to buy it and of course that not
4252780	4259140	whole pack is gonna be 800 Microsoft points can I just say though that not whole is a
4259140	4263540	terrible name because it makes me think of a very naughty place because not whole sounds
4263540	4269660	too much like balloon not you know what I mean like it's that's a really bad bad name
4269660	4278300	for an expansion back not whole island with the biker outfit yeah I'm just saying yo you
4278300	4283860	thought Animal Crossing was gay I'm just saying yes and apparently I guess the free download
4283860	4289620	pack they're gonna have is some stuff I guess teasing from the main download thing they're
4289620	4294840	gonna have knights boots assassins gloves a special weight loss potion and a collectible
4294840	4300340	silver book and you'll also want to download that in case you don't want to buy this content
4300340	4307380	so you can play co-op with people that do and that might be good too there's a rumor
4307380	4317060	now that fable 2 will be hitting PCs sometime soon apparently an inside source claims that
4317060	4322120	they've heard some information I guess from someone at lion head that fable 2 would be
4322120	4329540	coming to PCs on February 15th I don't see why they wouldn't release it on PC they did
4329540	4335100	with the original fable and it was after the Xbox version came out so it makes sense why
4335100	4339360	not if they're trying to make games for windows more and more popular why not exactly makes
4339360	4344580	sense it does make sense well hey Loki since you're you know a really big fan of Animal
4344580	4350700	Crossing I bet you're a big fan of C-man and C-man is going to be getting a type of release
4350700	4356540	on the iPhone apparently all right it's not the actual C-man game which yeah you remember
4356540	4359820	C-man 2 we were talking about that a while ago you know that whole game where you actually
4359820	4366060	raise your own it just has a funny name because we're what four years old it's a game called
4366060	4372820	Gabo and it's actually a reworked version of C-man 2 apparently this is all coming from
4372820	4379740	Yoot Saito's blog and he's the guy who he invented C-man if you can believe it and apparently
4379740	4386820	I guess it's still like a like a year away it's a it's a ways off for this game but they
4386820	4392360	have actually a little demo on the blog that you can look at which is kind of interesting
4392360	4396780	so if you're a if you're a big fan of this series which you know the series did have
4396780	4400740	its fans despite our whole little five-year-old joking and it's just interesting to see the
4400740	4403780	iPhone kind of get more and more and more games you know there there was some rumor
4403780	4407140	out there that the iPhone has crossed like 10,000 different apps I think that's a little
4407140	4411860	high but there's definitely a lot of stuff available on the iPhone now there's always
4411860	4421720	room for C-men on an iPhone exactly anyways there was a rumor that I may have talked about
4421720	4429620	a few weeks ago I don't remember or do I about the new 360s will be coming out actually shipping
4429620	4437580	now apparently with onboard memory that's right the new arcade systems are supposedly
4437580	4443740	shipping with the new Jasper chipset which is a promises I guess a cooler 65 nanometer
4443740	4451180	GPU on the motherboard and they have expanded the onboard flash to 256 megabytes which would
4451180	4460320	be enough for you know storing the new next box or next Xbox experience so I guess going
4460320	4464180	forwards of course going to be pre-loaded on all the different systems you can also
4464180	4468260	use that space for game saves or whatever else you want to use it for it's just like
4468260	4475260	an extra you know 200 megs of space which is kind of cool and apparently I think the
4475260	4480180	arcade system still will be coming with an external 256 megabyte memory card so they're
4480180	4488980	kind of doubling the onboard space with that which is kind of and new is always good but
4488980	4495140	you've known this for a while now haven't you maybe I don't know just say you tell me
4495140	4502860	I'm just saying all right anyhow let's move on to some other news and close out this statement
4502860	4509820	here pretty soon professor Layton professor Layton you know the old popular DS game well
4509820	4516620	what's interesting about this apparently professor Layton has been scheduled to be released as
4516620	4520580	a movie yes that's right professor Layton the first movie is going to be coming out
4520580	4528100	in January of 2010 in Japan so there you go and if you don't know this series Studio Ghibli
4528100	4533000	definitely kind of influenced these games so it's probably not much of a surprise they
4533000	4537700	didn't make the game they just influenced the games it's not a big surprise that these
4537700	4542640	this is going to be made into a movie eventually but you'll have to get a sub or something
4542640	4546660	if you want to watch it here in the US or just pray that it'll come out here eventually
4546660	4550820	I don't know yeah I mean they've had with like at least three or four different releases
4550820	4556280	in that series in Japan it's just we haven't seen them all over here yet so it makes sense
4556280	4560460	and they're insanely popular over there heck I mean they made an Animal Crossing movie
4560460	4564920	over there too remember just to answer game grew's thing in chat is Studio Ghibli making
4564920	4570220	it no they are not I was just saying that the games are Studio Ghibli-esque that's it
4570220	4575540	just a just a comparison don't want to alarm anybody that's all don't be alarmed that's
4575540	4581620	right do not be alarmed okay all right um let's see we're going to get into now the
4581620	4587460	classic game of the week and it's a little different tonight because Dark Soccer is not
4587460	4591780	here tonight but we can't let this segment die when she's not here either Loki or I
4591780	4596220	will steal the segment and that's exactly what's going to happen tonight so in the absence
4596220	4599680	of Dark Soccer I will be taking over tonight because it's been a little while since Loki
4599680	4603360	or I have gotten to steal this segment and I believe Loki had the last one a while ago
4603360	4607480	now so now it's my turn tonight to pick a classic game of the week that I think you
4607480	4613000	all ought to be playing and I'm going to really dig deep tonight because I've been promising
4613000	4615980	for quite some time that if I ever get to do another classic video game of the week
4615980	4620260	I would pick something from the Commodore 64 this is exactly what I've picked tonight
4620260	4624860	is a game from my childhood that I remember from a long time ago it's a game called Lazy
4624860	4630620	Jones is tonight's classic game of the week now the interesting thing about Lazy Jones
4630620	4634580	is that it was like it was a game that was kind of made up of all these other smaller
4634580	4640380	games that kind of came together in this big entity it was like it was like WarioWare back
4640380	4644300	before there was WarioWare if this makes any sense at all and like yeah we're looking at
4644300	4648540	a video of this game in progress here on here in the studio and you can see like this mini
4648540	4652780	game you are stabbing turkeys coming off a conveyor belt with a giant fork and you have
4652780	4658620	to avoid stabbing the telephone that's randomly bouncing around the screen it was just so
4658620	4663900	awesomely random but anyway look Lazy Jones was originally I believe actually made for
4663900	4670820	the MSX it actually was ported to MSX Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum and the Einstein system it
4670820	4676700	was a game written by David Whittaker the Spectrum version was just a port though basically
4676700	4681340	Lazy Jones is made up of 15 smaller games and you're in this giant hotel and you basically
4681340	4686140	walk around here trying to avoid some of the monsters in the hotel while you sneak into
4686140	4691820	these rooms and play different video games the video games are somewhat inspired by other
4691820	4697700	games there are definitely games that are like Frogger like Space Invader in here but
4697700	4703020	there's also some games that have funny names like there's a game in here called 99 Red
4703020	4707020	Balloons this is a game where you just have red balloons that continually go up towards
4707020	4710460	the top of the screen you try to get a hold of a couple of the balloons and you're able
4710460	4714220	to do that then you can get up to the top and give a woman a big kiss and then you get
4714220	4717780	a balloon to go back down where you go up and down by grabbing these different balloons
4717780	4721820	and none of these games go on a particularly long time you just play the game for about
4721820	4726340	a minute until the clock runs out and your score basically transfers to the larger score
4726340	4730960	that you have so this game is really wacky and just kind of takes us back to a time when
4730960	4735400	you know really really was only one person that made games but the other thing that kind
4735400	4739420	of made Lazy Jones special at least to me was the fact that it had a really unique soundtrack
4739420	4741140	and I know you can kind of hear it in the background
4741140	4748900	this is definitely kind of its own little thing actually I want to play for you one
4748900	4753180	clip in particular from the game Lazy Jones by David Whittaker and I want to see if it
4753180	4766620	sounds familiar to you at all here's a clip from the game
4766620	4770900	now that's a clip from the Lazy Jones game that came out years ago did that sound familiar
4770900	4780140	to anybody at all yeah it actually was sampled years later in 1999 by a band it was actually
4780140	4794220	sampled by the group Zombie Nation current craft 400 oh yeah it's the same song so kind
4794220	4799340	of funny because the game was you know originally made with the C64 sound chip in it and it's
4799340	4805340	that kind of unique noise that is still used today so there you go so back to the clip
4805340	4808500	here a little bit you know I think one reason I just really remember this game was you know
4808500	4813120	like I say it was really awesome to have one video game with all these mini games in it
4813120	4815860	and you could just kept trying to really increase your score in the mini games because some
4815860	4821760	of them were really hard because some of them would end like just once you've died and once
4821760	4825600	you would be done with it so you I find it was really trying to push myself to get higher
4825600	4830600	scores in the game by getting higher scores than other little mini games it was pretty
4830600	4835220	awesome so you know again and it's kind of cool I see a lot of people lighting up in
4835220	4838740	chat like oh that's kind of a random fact that it went inspired this song
4838740	4841860	like 15 years later after the game first came out
4841860	4844940	what maybe like 14 years later when did this game come out I think 84 I want to
4844940	4848740	say yeah 84 is in this game first came out by the way this game did not get
4848740	4852940	that great reviews when it came out it's it's definitely a game I'm picking for
4852940	4857100	nostalgia purposes so there you go
4857100	4860420	that's my classic video game of the week lazy Jones
4860420	4864980	oh yeah here's the random there's two random door because only 15 minigames
4864980	4868820	will like 18 doors there's random things you'll walk into as well like there's a
4868820	4873060	broom closet that you'll randomly walk into and then a potty and you watch your
4873060	4876500	guy go to the bathroom not like it's not explicitly or gross but he just like
4876500	4882940	walks in there and flush and then walks out it's so random but there it is lazy
4882940	4888020	Jones for the Commodore 64 my classic game of the week and stowing away on a
4888020	4893460	dark soccer's classic game of the week segment she'll be back next week with
4893460	4896580	her own pick all right that's gonna do it for part a of orange lounge radio
4896580	4899900	tonight and when we come back we'll have plenty more in part B we're gonna talk

4903180	4906820	with a Wii talk a little chrono trigger and talk some PC games which we don't
4906820	4910660	talk about enough and we'll also open up the mailbag all when we come back with
4910660	4920660	more of orange lounge radio and we're back here on orange lounge radio on this
4920660	4926180	lovely Sunday evening November the 30th of 2008 one more month left in the year
4926180	4931260	if you can believe it tomorrow be in the 1st of December and then 2009 will be
4931260	4933220	here before you know it which will hopefully be a much better year than
4933220	4936940	2008 in my opinion yeah I'm not just talking about games I'm talking about
4936940	4941620	personally and all that stuff as well so anyhow we have plenty more game news to
4941620	4944340	cover in this segment then we want to get to your calls on the skype line at
4944340	4948220	1 877 game olr we'll get to that in a little while but first we have some more
4948220	4952060	gaming news Loki start us off just looking me here tonight by the way Dark
4952060	4954020	Sakura has a night off
4954020	4961060	yes there is a new mystery title being worked on by monster games apparently
4961060	4968780	there was some speculation apparently of what they're gonna be working on and
4968780	4975260	it's no surprise the monster games works on basically racing titles and the last
4975260	4979180	racing title they worked on was excite truck here so far excite truck too
4979180	4987100	because I really awesome however though you know I believe because Nintendo
4987100	4993260	would not be so kind as to release an excite truck to so soon is probably
4993260	4996940	going to be at zero would be my guess
4996940	5003580	who is not necessarily bad excite truck was awesome I even think about that so
5003580	5009740	you keep that kind of you know awesome control you know what I don't mind if
5009740	5013420	they release an excite truck too because I would be there lined up at midnight
5013420	5018660	already the game that game was awesome I truck absolutely most favorite game of
5018660	5022900	the week ever I do think f0 has got to come out sooner rather than later I'm
5022900	5028860	even though the AXGX thing I guess must have disappointed some folks I love f0
5028860	5034700	gx that's an amazing game I I really hope as game grew says chat f0 wx be
5034700	5041300	awesome or as a deaf says in chat chat at orange dot com dot com excite truck
5041300	5046820	to excite yourself I think it's a trick to be harder don't even need to know
5046820	5049580	this is one of those games that I would hope that they don't go back and try to
5049580	5054180	tweak too much of it just add a lot more tracks add the ability to download new
5054180	5059580	tracks later on maybe four player you know split-screen multiplayer or
5059580	5066340	four-player you know multiplayer over the we Wi-Fi service just stuff like
5066340	5069140	that it's really simple stuff they don't really need to go too crazy with it
5069140	5072820	maybe improve the graphics hey good on f0 you could have up to 30 people in a
5072820	5076300	race on the GX I don't know if they could do that online that would be
5076300	5080020	pretty awesome that would be pretty cool long as you can't cheat like you know
5080020	5083620	Mario Kart everybody cheats well I would have a feeling they probably would be
5083620	5088260	able to cheat somehow but yeah gs68 says it perfectly in chat f0 we needs to not
5088260	5093380	have exploits dammit f0 X has wall raping f0 GX has space flying and snaking
5093380	5102100	and so on so hopefully yeah hopefully it's whatever it is it's probably gonna
5102100	5106900	be awesome because like I said excite truck was awesome f0 be really cool I'm
5106900	5112100	hoping for another excite trucker f0 game if it's something new great you
5112100	5118820	know news always you know optimistically good I guess all right well this maybe
5118820	5122840	this will be something they announce at e3 maybe that's why they have a big
5122840	5126460	secret and then they have been working on for two years now so that's true
5126460	5130360	because what have you seen since excite truck that's why you haven't seen excite
5130360	5133100	truck too and do you think it would take them two years to make a psych truck to
5133100	5139180	I'm hoping it is that's maybe if they're gonna make it super awesome maybe do you
5139180	5143340	think it might be randomly a non racing game or do you think no I don't think
5143340	5147300	this company only makes racing games all right that's good because you know what
5147300	5153420	they know how to make a good racing game so I'm optimistic all right I hope it
5153420	5157540	pays off well hey um you know what's interesting you know Capcom has been
5157540	5160320	porting a lot of their titles to different systems lately like you know
5160320	5165380	you see super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix ps3 and Xbox 360 bionic commando
5165380	5170300	rearmed Xbox 360 PlayStation Network Street Fighter 4 you know Resident Evil
5170300	5174780	5 these games are all coming out to the two big systems but they will not come
5174780	5178180	out on the Wii yet people seem to be demanding it which is kind of
5178180	5182380	interesting well um Capcom has actually kind of put out a statement about why
5182380	5186380	these games are not coming out on the Wii quote part of the reason HD remix and
5186380	5189100	bionic commando rearmed or digital is because we don't believe that the right
5189100	5193380	content for the retail channel the economics will be highly unfavorable as
5193380	5197060	compared to their digital counterparts counterparts and we wear we're finding
5197060	5201020	only works for titles built from the ground up for we wear as the lead skew
5201020	5205980	given the file size restrictions Street Fighter 2 couldn't ever be we wear even
5205980	5211140	at 480p the file size is just too large given the storage restrictions for we
5211140	5214960	wear theoretically it could be discs based but there are no plans at the
5214960	5220080	moment here you go and the beyonds mean how good-looking would it really be if
5220080	5224180	you took like an HD title and downscaled at the 480p it's just not even worth
5224180	5229020	redoing especially when you consider that isn't Super Street Fighter 2
5229020	5233900	already available I mean granted it's not turbo but whatever close enough like
5233900	5238740	already available in the god what I've even forgot what it's called virtual
5238740	5244140	console yes and also in Japan you remember next week we get Street Fighter
5244140	5251700	versus was it Tatsunoko whatever oh yeah Capcom versus yeah see that's what you
5251700	5255380	need to be playing on there they port that over and do something with it you
5255380	5259100	know that'd be pretty awesome all right well there you go moving on to stuff
5259100	5263260	going on on the DS hey chrono trigger is coming out on the DS here it just came
5263260	5265860	out this week I don't know I don't know anybody personally that picked it up I
5265860	5269340	I'm curious I haven't got I haven't played I did enjoy chrono trigger but I
5269340	5273340	stopped to finish file has he for on the DS I got a lot of DS playing to do well
5273340	5277340	on in Europe of course they got screwed and they don't have the game yet
5277340	5282780	apparently though it is coming out in February that's what some sources have
5282780	5285700	told Eurogamer is that the game is supposed to be making its way out there
5285700	5289940	in February this of course the new chrono trigger DS version with the new
5289940	5295340	dungeon the new ending to screen display touchscreen controls Wi-Fi multiplayer
5295340	5300900	and so on and so on I don't get why it takes longer I don't get it it's it's
5300900	5305380	already localized so what's the delay for the only thing I can think of is
5305380	5310620	this time of year as far as duplication goes a lot of the plants that duplicate
5310620	5315620	games are at full capacity right now and if they're thinking that they're not
5315620	5320380	going to be able to duplicate this game enough to have adequate supplies for
5320380	5323580	Europe and North America or whatever other territories they're trying to
5323580	5329260	cover that might be why there's a delay for Europe that because Nintendo and
5329260	5332060	every other game company hates Europe for some reason I don't know why let me
5332060	5335340	go back actually to the last story because we have a little bit of a delay
5335340	5338260	between when we say things when our term comments on it because of the you know
5338260	5341260	internet encoding and everything but I want to get this comment from chat
5341260	5344340	because I think it's a good chat at orange on twitter.com VX Jason XV says
5344340	5349020	the only people clamoring for Street Fighter HD remix on the Wii are the 13
5349020	5352500	14 15 year olds who don't have the money for their own systems and only have the
5352500	5357300	family Wii and won't be getting the 360 or ps3 is a gift or anything hmm good
5357300	5365460	point and get a job I don't know go out and get a job just wait seriously I mean
5365460	5370060	if you if there's anything you'll be learned from this whole Street Fighter
5370060	5375180	you know turbo HD remix thing is it pays to wait because if you bought the
5375180	5381820	original Super Street Fighter 2 turbo or whatever on Xbox Live Arcade now there's
5381820	5385060	a new one that's coming out that's better it's like crap I just wasted
5385060	5390100	money on that remember if you wait you know for things to get ironed out there
5390100	5395620	will be a version that will be coming to the Wii I'm sure just have to be patient
5395620	5400540	that is a nation now I'll get a job something else that might be coming to
5400540	5404460	the Wii and once again this kind of goes back to the chrome trigger thing hours
5404460	5410300	and why they couldn't just bring it over the localizations done already disaster
5410300	5417260	day of crisis maybe coming to North America apparently one person was
5417260	5422900	emailing Nintendo customer support I guess regarding whether they would have
5422900	5426060	a chance to actually play this game in North America and the response back was
5426060	5429260	hello I am pleased to report that disaster day of crisis has been
5429260	5434260	announced for North America but no release date yet and then they you know
5434260	5440620	for future reference go to our website I mean I don't see why they wouldn't
5440620	5445500	because it's a Nintendo game it takes no effort on their part to bring it over
5445500	5450980	here I mean all the works done already at the same time though what if the dude
5450980	5454660	was wrong you know I think that people a lot of people are putting a lot of stock
5454660	5459540	in what this you know rep says what if they made a mistake well if they made a
5459540	5463900	mistake then yeah I could see but my point is it's done it's already been
5463900	5469980	released in Europe so it's translated already they've got it done it's just it
5469980	5474580	bring it over if it's in English already you can bring it over here I'll see what
5474580	5480460	the big while you're at it how about mother three right am i right translation
5480460	5485300	hasn't been done over there I have with uh there's a duty it's better
5485300	5489700	it's coming out right well there's the fan fan done one yes but there's not an
5489700	5493380	actual cart release because if there was a car release it wouldn't matter because
5493380	5498500	people will be importing that bitch like crazy it's just this is already done I
5498500	5502820	mean it's just I don't know why they wouldn't bring it over here other than
5502820	5508620	maybe it didn't perform that well and I don't see why they wouldn't I mean come
5508620	5514100	on it's better than we music didn't mother three come out in the UK no I
5514100	5517700	thought it did no why did I think if it did everyone wouldn't be bitching
5517700	5520580	because they would be importing it all right I'm just crazy there's yeah
5520580	5523540	because there wouldn't be an issue with why would even have to do a fan
5523540	5527820	translation then because it's already done for them there would be no more
5527820	5536700	bitching all right well um apparently we and we fit have been a big cause of part
5536700	5541380	of the Black Friday chaos on the most popular products out there on Black
5541380	5544100	Friday this year and of course if you've never heard of this you probably don't
5544100	5547380	live in the US Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where people go
5547380	5552180	fucking nuts over sales just in time for Christmas is basically Canada's Boxing
5552180	5559700	Day without any any sort of a fit it's all a consumer holiday specifically
5559700	5563340	whereas I think there's actually some reason for it in Canada but here no it's
5563340	5568540	just it's all it was all made up by the stores number one most popular product
5568540	5574980	on Black Friday was the Nintendo Wii console there you go big surprise number
5574980	5580940	five we fit was the number five biggest product on Black Friday not surprised a
5580940	5585220	I'm not surprised you know people play it for a while they'll be all excited
5585220	5590980	about it and then they'll put it away but I bet it's a bunch of parent parents
5590980	5594980	also buying it for their fat kids right I don't know about that
5594980	5600900	fat kids won't play that exercise game vxj snacks V says I thought Boxing Day
5600900	5604180	was December 26 yes it is instead of the day of Thanksgiving they have the day
5604180	5608660	after Christmas but same same idea it's chaos at the stores but I don't I don't
5608660	5613060	hear about Canadian massacre at Walmart on Boxing Day either so just you know
5613060	5617860	Canadians are smart not to shop at Walmart exactly well not just that
5617860	5623260	they're I'm assuming you know a little more civil because they didn't trample
5623260	5628780	each other yeah sorry apparently there's some news
5628780	5637820	that rate or rare may do a new killer instincts game you know how fucking
5637820	5641900	often does this rumor come up what now what now is provoked the new killer
5641900	5650860	instinct of the week rumor well basically this is coming from you know
5650860	5656540	there's studio manager Matt better edge and he says a killer instinct is an IP
5656540	5661140	that is finally remembered and we may do something with it but it's a tricky
5661140	5666620	market to be like the old killer instinct so basically we would have to
5666620	5671460	blow it out your ass just tell us already is there or is there not gonna
5671460	5676640	be a game quit cock teasing us are you gonna do it or not look rare are you
5676640	5680980	listening is somebody from rare listening to the show knock it off stop
5680980	5685540	playing with my emotions just tell us already is the game coming out or just
5685540	5690580	say no it's not happening stop getting your damn hopes up go away be honest
5690580	5696060	stop with that awesome so I don't really care if it comes out and to be honest I
5696060	5701140	don't really care about most things that rare puts out so no I gotta say it is
5701140	5704980	pretty awesome I I love me some killer instinct I really do this white is you
5704980	5716460	god it just doesn't I don't care kid vs. final come on this game was awesome well
5716460	5720260	they would have to put a lot of work into it and as long as they throw in
5720260	5724700	cameo as an unlockable character savvy weird and you could brutally murder her
5724700	5732860	and that'd be funny all right anyhow um why why our chat says I'm from rare our
5732860	5735860	official announcement is that there will be an official announcement made in an
5735860	5742860	undisclosed time in our own heads there you go anyhow I am so angsty every time
5742860	5746540	I hear this rumor about a freaking new killer instinct game because seems like
5746540	5749420	every other week there's some cryptic goddamn quote coming out of somebody's
5749420	5754020	mouth from rare that cock teases a new killer instinct game and I'm getting the
5754020	5756780	more angsty the more and more time that goes by they won't announce something
5756780	5771660	already so you know what this means
5773660	5779180	look you can start us off tonight Stark soccer is not here F you to popcap games
5779180	5785500	I was busy transferring all my saves and all my information from my old 20 gig
5785500	5790420	hard drive to my new 120 gig hard drive for my xbox 360 because I bought the
5790420	5794260	hard drive used I do not have a transfer cable that can facilitate just
5794260	5798100	transferring everything in all one foul swoop so I've actually used memory cards
5798100	5804100	and can you guess what two saves would not fucking transfer on their Zula and
5804100	5809860	bejeweled to both popcap games and why the fuck will they not transfer over all
5809860	5813340	the other games for all the other systems including some of the popcap
5813340	5819060	games transfer just fine but for some reason but jeweled to and Zuma have to
5819060	5824220	be which happened to be the two the wife has to have exactly and so and they will
5824220	5827800	not transfer I put something on their Twitter you know saying hey what the
5827800	5831220	fuck you know why is this not working they're like well we're looking into it
5831220	5835460	which means blah blah blah complaint go away hold on now now I know now you
5835460	5838300	know despite this whole thing the yelling at rare I know there are
5838300	5841940	actually people from popcap games that do listen to this fair program catch the
5841940	5845860	bitch that patches so they will move well maybe this is the first time they're
5845860	5849140	finding out about it this is a that's an odd error I mean that's not something
5849140	5853980	that I think you could have foresight into either that's just an that's a an
5853980	5857380	error out of the blue yeah and that sounds like Microsoft's involved somehow
5857380	5862240	too but well no it is strange that it is just those two games no I mean limitation
5862240	5868700	is that you can only transfer files to a memory card with the same profile so for
5868700	5873340	example I had to have a profile signed in on the one console with the old hard
5873340	5877540	drive and logged in as being that had another console logged in as me as well
5877540	5882780	I just you know copy of the profile and I had to transfer you know from the one
5882780	5887980	profile to the memory card back to my profile on the other system and it will
5887980	5891620	allow you do that won't allow you like say transfer from a different profile or
5891620	5895220	something like that because you can't do that but those are the only two games
5895220	5898700	that we just would not let me transfer them at all you know what else would
5898700	5903540	not let me transfer it hexa HD would not let me transfer that game to the other
5903540	5906740	hard drive and see that's one of Microsoft's own games so you think
5906740	5910420	there's there's something on a deeper level going on here it's I think you
5910420	5914260	have misdirected anger well that they won't even let me redownload that's
5914260	5920420	stupid so not that I really play that game but it's still come on man all
5920420	5923840	right so like if I deleted that game somehow by accident then that would
5923840	5929000	never be able to get it back all right my F use of the week I don't really have
5929000	5934500	a lot I want to say I'm F you to F you to alcohol for being so nummy because I
5934500	5939220	have my first little sip of alcohol in like seven months the other day I had I
5939220	5942940	said I would have a glass of wine on Thanksgiving and I had a pinot noir
5942940	5949180	Thanksgiving evening and it's I was literally buzzed after one glass of wine
5949180	5952780	because my tolerance has dropped that much from not drinking so remember kids
5952780	5957740	don't drink and drive drink responsibly blah blah blah but I missed wine I
5957740	5964220	really did then I had a Guinness the next night there you go

6136420	6140100	things we don't normally talk about here on the show that's PC gaming news alright
6140100	6143660	you know the game fear this is a pretty popular game that came out and there
6143660	6146940	actually was console as well as a PC but I think it was pretty well known for the
6146940	6153740	PC fear to project origin is the sequel to this game it's apparently being
6153740	6156620	banned in Australia was just recently refused classification by the
6156620	6161980	Australians classifications board don't they ban nowadays due to high violence
6161980	6167260	apparently Warner's trying to kind of assess the situation and they are right
6167260	6171700	now appealing with the ACB and trying to figure out their options I'm trying to
6171700	6174980	get fear to released in Australia was supposed to be coming out February 11th
6174980	6178660	in Australia and they're hoping they can turn that around but you might have to
6178660	6183020	like import an underground copy of this game if you want to play this over in
6183020	6190100	Australia just by the ps3 version region free there well it's also PC is region
6190100	6198380	free to write exactly are you alright let's get to the mailbag guy it's the
6198380	6202500	part of the show every week or we like to take some time to interact with you
6202500	6206660	guys you guys send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm and we take some
6206660	6215660	time to read our favorites here on the air
6215660	6223020	I'm opening up the mailbag right now and I hate it when we get freaking spam
6223020	6228620	email did somebody sign us up for spam email this is like a hahaha thing
6228620	6234940	jerks now I think spiders signed us up for spam email it sucks don't we disguise
6234940	6239620	our emails on the side I don't remember yeah but they still find a way ah yyr
6239620	6242820	sent us an email wants to know please tell us what the meaning of life is
6242820	6253020	thanks Loki what is the meaning of life to live you can make the easy 42 joke
6253020	6257660	here or I could give you like a serious deep in answer but this is a show about
6257660	6261580	dick and fart jokes I don't know if it would fit in here I'll let me put it
6261580	6264700	this way the meaning of life is to have impact on others that's what I believe
6264700	6268980	meaning there was a good quote and I hate to say this from kung fu Panda and
6268980	6275820	oh great all right no it's actually it was actually pretty good it was they
6275820	6283180	were talking about was it the past is history the future is a mystery and the
6283180	6288980	and the present is a gift because it's the present
6288980	6296020	wow that's way too deep for this program all right moving on we have another
6296020	6303860	email from Katakos also sometimes goes by Reese Lord Katakos wants to say
6303860	6308660	congratulations on episode 300 even though it's not over 9000 but yeah you
6308660	6312500	guys and girls just keep on going so you can get to 9001 to be a prodigy right
6312500	6316700	now we're at 50% but that's halfway there PS Rob you need to get a hundred
6316700	6319660	percent healed come to the server Illidan and I'll use healing wave on
6319660	6322980	you and you'll be good to go just a general note to wow players out there
6322980	6327700	I'm not changing servers I mean I don't mean to be rude but I have a guild of
6327700	6331860	real-life friends where I'm at on Raven Crest as much as the community calls
6331860	6334980	that server Raven fail because we have no progression whatsoever on our server
6334980	6340140	it's pretty sad when our social guild is like one of the top 10 horde raiding
6340140	6344500	guilds on the entire server and we kind of sleep our way through I don't mean
6344500	6348400	like literally but you know we just we don't you know we we're very casual in
6348400	6350900	our approach it's not say we don't work out we're very casual in our approach
6350900	6355100	and we've managed to clear quite a bit of stuff as a guild these are most of
6355100	6359300	the death cake people you remember a fantasy 11 yes I remember I was gonna
6359300	6363740	say that we have over 9,000 minutes worth of programming so there you go
6363740	6369420	that's true that's true that's a good way to look at it if you can't yeah I
6369420	6373260	don't if you count up like all the to-go podcasts and all that stuff when we were
6373260	6377020	doing like almost five hours a night for a little while remember that we yeah do
6377020	6380460	a three and a half hour show than an hour long podcast oh my god those are
6380460	6387960	the days right well anyway how was an email there from I'm not sure what the
6387960	6394700	point was but hey whatever we have an email from Fabrice in Belgium wants to
6394700	6397860	say hello and I hope there's a show tonight and this was written last week
6397860	6401500	when there was no show so I want to apologize to Fabrice from Belgium I'm
6401500	6405780	sorry he says anyways he puts that in quotes
6405780	6412380	anyways like Loki style I'm planning on buying a pinball machine in the future
6412380	6415900	as I understand the best pinball machines are arguably the Adams family
6415900	6419740	and Terminator 2 but I'm a big fan of Sega this will probably be a question
6419740	6423260	for dark soccer which is the best Sega pinball machine she's not here tonight
6423260	6427260	but if she were I bet you anything she would say World Cup 98 because I I'm
6427260	6430700	almost positive that was a Sega table and that's like her favorite machine of
6430700	6435760	all time so I'm I'm I'm 99% certain that would be her answer I know they're
6435760	6439620	not the best machines by far but I'm too big of a Sega fan to let this pass by is
6439620	6443980	Independence Day any good I'll probably have a chance to buy that one I do not
6443980	6446980	know much about that table you're right dark soccer be the expert that one did
6446980	6451500	you remember that being good no did Sega do the Jurassic Park one I like that one
6451500	6457620	I don't remember they did that I was gonna say they should have a sonic
6457620	6460420	spinball table wouldn't it be awesome that would be kind of awesome with a
6460420	6465740	blue pinball well they're cute I don't know um you know I'm and and thanks to
6465740	6468740	Fabrice I'm sorry the real pinball expert isn't here tonight to answer the
6468740	6471860	question I'll have to ask her for next week boy boy you just struck out on
6471860	6474900	first we didn't do a show the night you were gonna stay up and listen and I
6474900	6479900	really apologize for that and then the night you have your question read on air
6479900	6483420	dark soccer is not even here to answer it did take a do Jurassic Park that was
6483420	6489340	that was a fun I don't remember we'll have to ask her next week hopefully I
6489340	6495100	remember let's go to another email it's from Dan shadow hey guys survived the
6495100	6499220	gaming season what surprised you the most personally left for dead blew me
6499220	6503040	away I'm gonna be up in the area next weekend which I believe is this weekend
6503040	6508140	whoops maybe we can meet up I'd like to meet you all oops well hopefully he
6508140	6511880	comes back because apparently he didn't make it out tonight because we were off
6511880	6517540	last week and didn't even ever get to our emails are bad here's our last email
6517540	6522340	tonight from cheeseburger hey well I want to buy my dad a PlayStation 3 for
6522340	6526500	Christmas that's pretty ambitious we just got a 52 inch plasma LCD TV and all
6526500	6529860	we have is crappy cable where do you guys and girls think is the best place
6529860	6533380	to buy it all I want is the blu-ray player and don't intend on playing any
6533380	6538220	games websites are ok options too as long as I can use my unverified PayPal
6538220	6543340	account whoo in that case you might just want to go for a used PlayStation 3 from
6543340	6548140	my eBay why not well if you're buying it online yeah or even just like a retail
6548140	6551460	store probably online you get a little bit of a discount because you're if
6551460	6555140	you're buying news or something and it might actually work out a little better
6555140	6559060	well if you're trying to buy a 20 or 60 you're probably gonna have to pay more
6559060	6565620	than you know $500 for it but you know keep an eye out for the Christmas ads
6565620	6570420	and stuff because I know ps3 systems are moving pretty good but not as fast or
6570420	6574340	not selling out right away and stuff and you might get some good deals hopefully
6574340	6579380	well too bad you weren't really you know stalking amazon.com because they had
6579380	6584340	that $1.99 deal for a while there with the limited supply ring get a ps3 a
6584340	6590380	little big planet in a movie something else to keep in mind too is that you
6590380	6594700	know how I said the Black Friday is like a totally corporate invented holiday
6594700	6598640	that they had they also have now the online retail community is inventing
6598640	6602900	their own holiday in response and it's called Cyber Monday and it's tomorrow so
6602900	6607740	tomorrow would be a good day to kind of check your big retailer websites to look
6607740	6610780	for big deals and the reason why they wait until Monday is because a lot of
6610780	6614180	people do their online shopping at work and Monday's the first day back to work
6614180	6617420	for most people including myself so you're gonna see a lot of good deals on
6617420	6620940	Cyber Monday online if that's where you're looking to buy things so I keep
6620940	6626000	an eye out keep it out and don't be afraid to use sites like frugal you know
6626000	6630540	Google's shopping site to look for good deals you know ps3 is a ps3 is ps3
6630540	6634880	cheap-ass gamer anyone so that well that's a good site too especially with
6634880	6639700	like games you know yeah so keep an eye out there you go it's funny I was
6639700	6643860	looking in chat they're talking about commander keen they actually have
6643860	6649300	ported a clone of commander keen for the weeds in their homebrew community now
6649300	6655180	you can download a commander keen for the Wii that's kind of neat I got one
6655180	6661180	more email from Rob with two B's about the Wii and says this one's for Matt I
6661180	6665820	recently upgraded my Wii firmware guess what my SD card was completely wiped
6665820	6669500	clean this is a shame because I don't have a homebrew channel or anything on
6669500	6673300	it did you hear of anything similar I had painstakingly backed up my game
6673300	6676540	channel so that I wouldn't need to download them again some I deleted from
6676540	6682220	my Wii memory because the incredible daunting size of we wear grr argh well
6682220	6687540	here's the thing I didn't update my system at all because I don't connect to
6687540	6691740	their you know internet for I don't connect to the store because to be
6691740	6695980	honest I don't buy anything on there and there's nothing I need to download and
6695980	6702460	if I wanted to download I'm not buying it but I don't really pirate virtual
6702460	6706340	console games because I don't have time to play any of them so there's no point
6706340	6709900	for me to do that so the only update I did was the update that came with Animal
6709900	6716740	Crossing and I think the update was only for the we speak stuff so you know
6716740	6720220	unless I get a we speak microphone I'll need to update it for the we speak
6720220	6725620	channel which I probably still wouldn't do because I wouldn't use that so no I
6725620	6730980	haven't updated it yet although if you are if you have updated it I believe
6730980	6736780	there is a new Twilight hack out now for the 3.4 firmware and you can download
6736780	6740660	that and redo all your stuff if you need it it sounds to me though that Rob is
6740660	6744460	not into this whole hacking homebrew thing at all like me like I just I'm
6744460	6748300	just not into it because I don't yeah I don't have time you know so why did he
6748300	6753300	does his SD card get picked on well I don't know why it wiped your SD card
6753300	6758460	unless you had modified saves on there or something but you know unless they're
6758460	6762780	trying to get you to update it I don't understand why they would want you to
6762780	6771140	re-download everything that doesn't make any sense but yeah Nintendo sucks what
6771140	6774580	it what's it the Twilight hack is what they call it now yeah see now I'm gonna
6774580	6779300	think it's about vampires that sparkle well I'm with Rob D in chat does it come
6779300	6784780	with a hotmail vampire I don't even play far enough to use finally princess but
6784780	6789420	yeah the new Twilight hack is out and they're saying that even if that gets
6789420	6796700	fixed there's team twizers or tweezers or whatever they're called so there's
6796700	6800580	other games that they've already figured out exploits to that you know can be
6800580	6807580	used instead of Twilight Princess so this by all means is not an end all
6807580	6809700	right well that's gonna do it for tonight's mailbag if you want to send
6809700	6812940	us an email dark soccer will hopefully be back next week to read your emails
6812940	6820500	mailbag orange launch radio.com all right other fun stuff that's going to be
6820500	6826100	going on here well this isn't really fun but fun calm the company behind you know
6826100	6831580	such wonderful games like the age of Conan well they've had to cut staff
6831580	6838740	apparently you know hard times have been had and last Tuesday they actually had
6838740	6846180	to caught a bunch of their staff which is interesting but I know a lot of the
6846180	6852020	companies have been hit hard especially with the economy and stuff and fun calm
6852020	6857380	said that they have actually cut 70% of their staff yikes
6857380	6861400	well plus just age of Conan I don't think lived up to expectations I think
6861400	6863880	there were a lot of people that bought that played the one-month trial and
6863880	6868940	didn't stay with it yeah I could see that bummer I was going to check out the
6868940	6871860	game but just kind of never got around to it no now it seems to be going the
6871860	6876720	way of tabula rasa which is kind of sad to it there's a lot of MMOs out there
6876720	6881100	and Warcraft is kind of owning a lot of them in the face only very few are able
6881100	6884580	to hold their own against it I'll tell you what though if you like God of War
6884580	6889660	and you own a 360 we'll have never an opportunity to play God of War on the
6889660	6894740	360 you should check out Conan their actual Conan game that they released
6894740	6899180	because it is such a blatant ripoff of God of War it's not even funny but
6899180	6905100	there's boobies and lots of blood and that's all you really need all right
6905100	6912940	that's all you need hey PC games really old PC games but really classic PC games
6912940	6919500	Starcraft is over 10 years old and just got patched this past week to patch one
6919500	6924940	point one six came out for Starcraft on some of the big changes they made in the
6924940	6929020	game I mean these are this is still a pretty major patch now in-game chat will
6929020	6933700	actually save in the replays so you can relive every f you it's cool the actual
6933700	6938060	match that's pretty cool also this is pretty important Starcraft will now only
6938060	6942420	use as much central processing power as it needs to run smoothly because
6942420	6945060	obviously in the past 10 years there's been a lot of upgrades and changes to
6945060	6948700	our computers Starcraft no lead no longer needs to hog all your memory so
6948700	6952460	it'll only use as much as it needs there's some other tiny little exploits
6952460	6956580	too it does some little exploits with the zerg race especially that were

7087580	7091660	like user-created levels and things it's a pretty chill game is a good way to put
7091660	7095620	it to chill chill out game I was another thing I played this week while I was
7095620	7101220	waiting for my family to get done eating Thanksgiving stuff I was playing flow
7101220	7105340	remember that game oh yeah yeah yeah I went back and played a little bit of
7105340	7109500	that because now he's like what's that it's a lot of relaxing music there I'm
7109500	7113580	like yeah it's this game flow you move the controller around she's like I don't
7113580	7120900	want to have to move the controller around like that like too bad then in
7120900	7127340	other news apparently obsessive gamers are not necessarily addicted to games
7127340	7133740	apparently 90% of hardcore gamers do not have a legitimate addiction problem this
7133740	7140300	is coming from a brand new survey mainly focused on I think some of the Wow
7140300	7145940	players and stuff of course there's all sorts of disorders out there but you
7145940	7149340	know some people just take their hobbies a little bit more seriously than others
7149340	7154220	but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't stop although sometimes I
7154220	7162460	think I can't stop so maybe I have a problem or not I'm not playing well so
7162460	7166060	that's already saying something hey wait a minute we try to say but J but every
7166060	7169860	time I power on the Xbox there you are in Saints Row table I'm gonna play that
7169860	7175060	until I'm done with it and then once I'm done with it then whatever you'll move
7175060	7178740	on to something else yeah well you know I'm so sad dark soccer isn't here
7178740	7182380	because I purposely planned this story to come after the story about addicts
7182380	7186260	and it's obsessive gamers and she's not even here to make fun I'm a little sad
7186260	7192940	but you guys can fill in for her three new downloadable scenario expansions
7192940	7198420	have been announced for Final Fantasy 11 yes Shane gonna go back well you know
7198420	7201100	what's interesting about these expansions is that that they're not
7201100	7206340	there's no new classes there's no new you know there's not a lot of big things
7206340	7210060	that are expanded here their story expansions they're only gonna be
7210060	7214260	downloadable through the play online viewer and they are all supposed to come
7214260	7217820	out in spring 2009 I'm sorry I take that back the first one is supposed to come
7217820	7221780	out in spring 2009 with the other two following the first one is called called
7221780	7227220	a crystalline prophecy ode of life bestowing apparently it's where a giant
7227220	7231140	crystal appears in the skies above Juno and it makes all these unexplained
7231140	7235140	things happen and so on and so on the other scenarios that are gonna happen a
7235140	7241740	moogle kupodata kudata get basically kupodata evil and small doses which
7241740	7244100	sounds like it's gonna center all around the moogles which I'm sure will be
7244100	7248980	extremely popular and then the third will be called a shantoto ascension the
7248980	7253020	legend torn her empire born is the third one coming out you know all things
7253020	7255900	considered despite the crap I've given this game ever since I've quit when you
7255900	7259500	consider how long this game has been out now because when did we start playing
7259500	7264140	this game 2003 I think a while and it was out in Japan a year before that I
7264140	7268580	mean this game has been going for quite a while the US October 28 2003 in fact I
7268580	7273260	kind of wish they would update it you know what I mean like I wish they'd
7273260	7278180	kind of overhaul the engine to make it kind of you know newer gen graphics and
7278180	7281940	all that stuff make it I don't think they release a new file fancy online
7281940	7287700	game do you would you go back you think I don't know oh I fixed it that's that's
7287700	7291900	the first effort well you know I hear this whole level sync thing really
7291900	7295940	helped like you know you know that whole thing where basically if you're a level
7295940	7300860	75 you can downgrade yourself in level and all your gear will scale so that you
7300860	7304060	can level up with your level 40 friend who can't find a party because he's
7304060	7308360	level 40 yeah and level with them and you both gain experience see that'd be
7308360	7312260	nice that's that and I'm like oh my god that's what that game needed three
7312260	7317700	fucking years ago level down to like level one just grind down there hell
7317700	7324620	yeah I know exactly it'd be awesome so I got that's too hard to go over there
7324620	7329480	I'm just gonna keep hacking up bunnies interesting comments from chat as well
7329480	7333020	with the whole attic thing ospher and chat says I throw gamers and while
7333020	7336140	players in two different categories I'm already starting to get a little
7336140	7341060	offended here ospher says like I have a friend whose behavior completely
7341060	7344980	transforms when he plays well bye-bye social interaction otherwise he's just
7344980	7349900	fine when playing other games no he is kind of a social game though you know in
7349900	7354620	a way I mean I you real life there's an old saying though you know amongst
7354620	7360980	people who know better real life greater than Wow so you know I don't I don't put
7360980	7365540	Wow first before realized commitment Final Fantasy online just felt really
7365540	7370500	different it was like kind of it was it was cool because like when I first
7370500	7375220	started it was like oh my god you know you think when you first get to the
7375220	7381460	first force and stuff it's so big and then you you're like oh there's planes
7381460	7384820	beyond that's like holy crap it's actually discovering like the world
7384820	7388020	stuff and then you go through all of it and it's like yeah like the first time
7388020	7391300	you board an airship you're like this is so fucking epic and you know just all
7391300	7395500	this of the I will never forget the first time getting on a ship in Final
7395500	7399040	Fantasy 11 and then pirates fucking attacked the ship and I was like oh my
7399040	7402020	god this is so scary and I was like I had to like having to run into the
7402020	7404020	basement of the ship and lock yourself in there
7404020	7408460	well jaywalking yeah while the higher level characters were taking out the
7408460	7412700	things but I thought that was so amazing how like you would basically be forced
7412700	7415100	to work together with the other players to take out the threat or you're all
7415100	7420220	die basically neat or you have to lock yourself in the basement like a scared
7420220	7423820	little kid like I did of course and I do some of those area effect spells and it
7423820	7429020	might still hit you anyway that's right swipe back into the corner and cry curl
7429020	7435580	into slash fetal all right gosh that's gonna do it believe it or not for
7435580	7438620	tonight's gaming news it was a little bit of a slow news week this week but hey
7438620	7442100	that just leaves us some time to get to your call so one eight seven seven game
7442100	7446460	olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio while we wait for some
7446460	7455140	calls any last-minute things you want to talk about Loki um maybe well you can
7455140	7458140	think about it cuz we got a call coming in hello you're on orange launch radio
7458140	7466500	who's this oh it's spazinator spazinator what's on your mind dude um this may be
7466500	7472860	kind of a downer for the show but I'm not camera with sound right here and I
7472860	7478740	could use a little help from the all games radio you know audience at large
7478740	7488460	specifically any watchers that may be in the puffle area what's up if I if I had
7488460	7494660	mentioned to Loki in a private message earlier in the week on xbox live I just
7494660	7503700	recently had my PlayStation 3 stolen and I'm hoping that any ball no letters out
7503700	7509140	there there may be in the puffle area may have heard or heard and seen
7509140	7515300	something to grapevine you know maybe rumor seen someone that normally doesn't
7515300	7523660	have a PlayStation 3 on them and could relay any information to the puffle you
7523660	7529460	know police department specifically district me basically any kind of lead
7529460	7534540	would be great cuz well it's kind of like twofold for me a is not exactly
7534540	7542260	something I can easily replace and be well it should be fairly evident that
7542260	7549620	I'm disabled and the PlayStation 3 X is like a coping skill for me and in
7549620	7554740	dealing with my disability and subsequently we have to answer well
7554740	7569380	I'm really sorry to hear about the PlayStation getting stolen you know and
7569380	7573820	and unfortunately I worry because you know we don't have too big a listenership
7573820	7576980	all throughout the world that's you know we have a few listeners here and there
7576980	7581660	but I'm hoping maybe the right personal here but here's my thought do you maybe
7581660	7585580	have a PlayStation that signs on to the PlayStation network automatically like
7585580	7589260	whenever I turn on my PlayStation it signs on the PS Network automatically
7589260	7592540	yeah well that way I could kind of like as long as you only have one user will
7592540	7597740	do that otherwise it will sit in the select user screen type thing yeah
7597740	7604260	technically my profile did and the key thing was a it had my credit card
7604260	7612180	information on that and there were and because of that I I really did two things
7612180	7619100	hey I canceled my credit card and no idea but I was able to remote access my
7619100	7626740	account using my PSP to change the password on my my PlayStation Network
7626740	7633020	account that way no one could get on to the profile and buy anything any chance
7633020	7636660	that you called Sony and see I don't know if they would do this but maybe if
7636660	7640580	you've told them what happened see what the last IP was to access it I don't
7640580	7643340	know I'm reaching here I don't know what you can do in these scenarios but that
7643340	7646340	that would be my first thought is to call Sony and see when the last time
7646340	7652740	that thing signed in was oh well I did bring this up and in fact I stopped up
7652740	7659700	the same thing and the only thing they can do is if I were to have left my
7659700	7665100	password as was the only thing they could do is see if anyone would try to
7665100	7673260	input their own credit card information onto my profile and and if they did no
7673260	7680540	no you know I would have their no name and address and whatnot but at the same
7680540	7685780	time is I'm not totally sure but I think it's trying yes because if they input
7685780	7691340	their credit card information chances are they could also change my password
7691340	7697900	too and get them even I won't be able to access my own account you know that
7697900	7701660	seems a little weak from Sony I think they'd be a little more they could do to
7701660	7705140	help in the situation but maybe they need a police report or something to be
7705140	7707420	able to do it I have no idea unfortunately I've never been in the
7707420	7713020	situation but well buddy I I hope it I hope it helps for whatever reason again
7713020	7718540	if anybody has heard of anything about this I you know let us know and we'll
7718540	7722420	forward it over to spazz nator or just contact the police for heaven's sake you
7722420	7725780	know if you know that you know and this goes in general I mean I guess we could
7725780	7730220	kind of turn this into a more of a community thing for everybody in all
7730220	7734100	parts of the u.s. because unfortunately these gamers like spazz nator in the
7734100	7738540	cold if we support you know purchasing these stolen systems and things like
7738540	7742420	that so if you know of these things going on do the right thing and and let
7742420	7755700	police people know so all right well we're hoping for you spazz nator keep us
7755700	7765100	posted all right good good luck buddy bye what a bummer I'm not gonna ask how
7765100	7767540	it was stolen I hope like the house didn't get broken into or something
7767540	7771460	like that but yikes not a fun situation higher on
7771460	7775460	orange launch radio who's this time of day orange lounge radio land it's Jason
7775460	7778260	hey Jason I hope you have some better news the last call was a little bit of a
7778260	7782240	downer yeah I was hearing bits and pieces because I was helping Ryan with
7782240	7785780	something and trying to make sure all the volumes are set nicely in here and
7785780	7791300	whatnot how is I just wait wait wait how is Ryan how is she doing she's busy
7791300	7794780	she's in school now I guess I know she used to listen to show back in the day
7794780	7798740	but hasn't had enough time lately but let her know we said hello they said
7798740	7803060	hello oh yeah she's listening over my shoulder
7803060	7808740	wonderful wonderful yes what's in your mind Jason that's Starcraft news was
7808740	7813900	really good to hear yeah I saw you get all excited in chat I mean this is
7813900	7817620	something that dates back to when I lived in New Mexico in like I don't know
7817620	7824820	maybe 2001 or 2000 I did maybe 10 years ago Jason how old this game is but when
7824820	7828500	I remember that the thing that sticks out most of my mind this is gonna be the
7828500	7831020	weirdest thing I've ever really said but the thing that sticks out most in my
7831020	7838820	mind is just how just how far back reaching this goes in the sense that the
7838820	7844560	the the fact that online replays were able to be saved at I don't know 1.03 or
7844560	7848340	something like that when that feature came out that was amazing especially
7848340	7853740	because the file size for any average game was less than 10k yeah that when I
7853740	7856460	first did it I played a couple games with some people and then I went back
7856460	7860060	and watched the replays I was like well wait a second I was discussing I was
7860060	7863140	discussing with them strategy and whatnot I want to see that too never could
7863140	7870460	they just now put this in that's my high school life coming back to say hey I'm
7870460	7876460	cool again isn't that weird like why would they add that now of all things
7876460	7880500	isn't that but I mean they still they still have leagues people are still all
7880500	7885860	over battle net I think I mentioned it on the show when I got Starcraft working
7885860	7889700	on my macbook again and that was a that was a good day I went through yeah it's
7889700	7893600	when the Starcraft 2 news was coming out well I got Starcraft working on my mac
7893600	7897980	again and I started playing through the campaigns again it was fun it still is
7897980	7901380	one of the other little features in the patch we didn't mention is that now you
7901380	7905420	can use slash R to reply directly to the person you last talked to that's another
7905420	7909380	new feature in the patch that's a Warcraft thing which I thought was kind
7909380	7913380	of funny because that's exactly what you do and Wow to reply to a surprise I know
7913380	7917820	I know a synergy amongst the thing and speaking of Wow I know you didn't call
7917820	7921100	the talk Wow but I've got to mention this the armory got a huge upgrade this
7921100	7924580	week and those achievements that you've been getting on your character now you
7924580	7928260	can look at them in the armory online but not only that like if I were to look
7928260	7931300	like I got a show Loki this because he's a big achievement horse so he'd kind of
7931300	7934180	think this is funny but I'm explaining what I'm doing I'm going to the armory
7934180	7937860	right now and I'm looking up the achievements for my character okay and
7937860	7941020	like you look at this it breaks down exactly which achievements I have and
7941020	7943940	what categories and all that but not just that like if I want to look at a
7943940	7947420	particular achievement let's say like general okay here's one achievement I've
7947420	7952780	been going for lately is to all the squirrels I've loved before show the
7952780	7956340	critters of Azeroth how much you slash love them so you get a ten point
7956340	7959620	achievement if you're able to find every little creature among in Azeroth and
7959620	7964500	type slash love right well not only is the armory tracking that I have that
7964500	7970260	achievement enough but if I click on it it shows exactly which six I've slash
7970260	7975620	loved and which ones I have yet to do that's fairly comprehensive see
7975620	7979180	integration like this is a great thing it's always cool you know ten years
7979180	7984340	delayed in Starcraft case but anything like this to integrate that much you
7984340	7987260	don't have to start up the entire game just to see this information it's almost
7987260	7990700	always a good thing to have and I also want to show Loki this I can put in my
7990700	7997420	ex-boyfriend's account and compare and I can see right there that no no but I
7997420	8002060	can I can see just I can notice that I have 360 more achievement points than he
8002060	8007420	does and that makes me feel better about myself awesome no Rob's not an
8007420	8016020	achievement for no not at all no I'm just sad and pathetic anyway so back to
8016020	8022700	Starcraft any anything else you want to share about what's going on I'm I just
8022700	8025380	want to see what the Starcraft 2 requirements are going to be I mean I'm
8025380	8028820	it's not like it's coming out holiday season or anything so I shouldn't be
8028820	8032500	jumping the gun or anything but it's going to be wasn't it either that or
8032500	8037460	Diablo 3 that isn't actually likely before to 2010 now I yeah I think I
8037460	8041140	remember hearing something about that but yeah that makes sense I bet you we
8041140	8044740	seized I bet you will finally get Starcraft 2 next year I mean it was
8044740	8049100	playable at PAX for heaven's sake it will probably be out next year just in

8133540	8139580	was a well now when we saw the Black Museum so what I wanted to call about
8139580	8149060	was this all this incredible arcade that I got to go to mm-hmm there was a whole
8149060	8155260	bunch of old games like like this link I'm posting there's an old arcade it's a
8155260	8161420	pinball game which which which arcade was this at because I go to San
8161420	8165100	Francisco quite often and I I for some reason have decided to never see I
8165100	8169140	somehow have never seeked this place out you know I know the Pier 39 arcade and
8169140	8172220	some of those other things but where exactly was this now did you find it oh

8248460	8255220	that and what'd you think yeah I thought it was pretty cool I even I even made a
8255220	8264860	remake for the PC I have to dig that up and link it in chat to hmm you know and
8264860	8267980	this I think was an old game that was one of the first like controversial
8267980	8271340	games because I see you remember like you're really over people it's also
8271340	8277460	original better movie yeah yeah exactly exactly so well cool

8281620	8285340	digging through the pictures and seeing what the folks who aren't local San
8285340	8288340	Francisco are missing out on and I might just have to check that out myself at

8304540	8309620	radio Loki do you have any last-minute stories yes I did oh never mind we got a
8309620	8315020	call hey you're on orange launch radio who's this it's gs68 hello gs68 what's
8315020	8326740	in your mind buddy oh well it is always cutting out hey can you hear me or
8326740	8330660	you're cutting out a little bit if you have any other things running like
8330660	8342700	torrents whatever up whoa hello all right no okay I'm hanging up let's do
8342700	8352340	this I don't usually do this but we'll try this this will sometimes help hey
8352340	8357100	there gs68 okay let's try to shit again all right it sounds a little better this
8357100	8365980	time what is on your mind gs68 well okay besides that I get around to playing
8365980	8376860	well echo I think there might be an audio thing going on go ahead shit all
8376860	8388900	right I agree fuck this shit hi radio who's this oh wow he got a little
8388900	8394820	frustrated what's on your mind buddy who's this okay this is Oscar hey
8394820	8400580	Oscar what's on your mind sorry I tuned in a little bit late time if you covered
8400580	8405100	this story or not but did you see that part where it was talking this is on
8405100	8409340	joystick there's an article about the Zelda director saying he wouldn't quit
8409340	8413940	until he surpasses Ocarina of Time like you won't quit working with the Zelda
8413940	8424380	series you know what fuck this shit sorry I had to use that good but I was
8424380	8429020	wondering what do you guys think needs to happen and there's all the series to
8429020	8432940	make it surpass Ocarina of Time or do you think there's already been a game
8432940	8440060	in the series that's better I think the way they can make it better is to fuck
8440060	8446300	the shit no um that's just not gonna get old I don't know why I'm so mature yes I
8446300	8449700	think there is a game that has surpassed Ocarina of Time and it's called the
8449700	8454780	Legend of Zelda link to the past so in my opinion he can quit already because
8454780	8459500	he already made the better game really I have a friend that likes links to the
8459500	8464300	past the best too but I don't know just for me Ocarina of Time is still the best
8464300	8474340	I like he was also talking in terms of sales too mm-hmm you know I think it's
8474340	8479020	gonna be tricky to do I think you Twilight Princess was pretty darn good I
8479020	8483740	mean it would I think it really showed with the Wii games could it could be
8483740	8488180	pretty awesome although you know that game was kind of originally designed for
8488180	8491480	the GameCube so I think what it really might take to really knock people's
8491480	8495100	socks off is to kind of take that same approach but with a Zelda game that is
8495100	8499220	designed for the system it's gonna be out for and it'll probably be this we
8499220	8503580	HD thing that'll be out in 2010 or 2011 which will be a port of a Wii game
8503580	8509020	because you know they do a Wii version and a Wii HD version you know I wouldn't
8509020	8514780	be surprised if we see a play on Wii Wind Waker game I would like to see a
8514780	8522180	Wind Waker game that wasn't in you know world that was flooded with water it was
8522180	8526620	just you know spoiler but you know in Wind Waker you actually go under the
8526620	8530700	ocean you find out oh my god it's Hyrule but flooded and it looks pretty awesome
8530700	8536260	and I'm like why the fuck couldn't they have just done this you know and made it
8536260	8539900	really cool it's kind of like Wind Waker to me is kind of like Mega Man Legends
8539900	8544420	was there's another game that needs more you know I'm thinking if Zelda wants to
8544420	8549220	really really expand its audience and really cater to many people are crossing
8549220	8552260	different types the game that's just persist no no what you what you do you
8552260	8556540	just need to add a few things into the game you need to add kiddich matches you
8556540	8564260	need to add vampires that sparkle and you need to add Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus
8564260	8567700	somehow and then did that's that's how you would reach into Nintendo's other
8567700	8572980	markets I think Miley Cyrus as Princess Zelda I think there's huge market
8572980	8579700	ability in this so basically and stuff a wolf link turns into a sexy vampire guy
8579700	8584140	and then so I'll just start singing see you again I think I think we're on to
8584140	8587940	something here and then then he then he sparkles and we just talk about how
8587940	8598220	beautiful he is and that's okay waiting at midnight all right I I don't know you
8598220	8601940	know honestly the thing that's gonna make Zelda better is something we
8601940	8606460	haven't thought of yet that's my cryptic answer I mean it really is it's
8606460	8613700	something we have real controls that is like what with Loki said about when
8613700	8618780	waker I think it'd be cool like if they made a Wii version of it like you know
8618780	8622100	how like you conducted with the one waker you could actually probably do
8622100	8625660	that with the Wii remote and that'd be just something interesting you know and
8625660	8629540	I I know a lot of people hated the look of when waker I thought it looked really
8629540	8633540	cool and with the cell shading and everything if they just had applied that
8633540	8636860	much effort to the game and actually made it like a traditional Zelda game
8636860	8641220	hell you can almost do something that was not necessarily a remake of but like
8641220	8646780	a links with links awakening or whatever it's all the three you know I mean dude
8646780	8654020	whatever happened to links crossbow training I put it in a CD case to where
8654020	8658620	it would be forgotten forever remember what was what the hell was that thing
8658620	8663020	called it came with a zapper we zapper whatever happened to the we zapper
8663020	8668500	there's games that actually use it like Call of Duty that world war uses it I
8668500	8671980	say but we need we need like in the next Zelda game we need more links crossbow
8671980	8675580	training with sniper rifles and cannons and things that are more explosive than
8675580	8683820	a stupid crossbow Zelda Call of Zelda oh my god that's wrong but no seriously
8683820	8688780	they could just do you know they're the first thing they're probably gonna do is
8688780	8694220	just do that play on we think for Wind Waker and then you'll probably see a new
8694220	8698620	Zelda game yeah unfortunately I don't think it's gonna be on the Wii I agree
8698620	8702720	with why we are in check coming soon super links crossbow training turbo HD
8702720	8711900	remix they do come out like a we HD they're just gonna remake all the stupid
8711900	8715500	games that were on the Wii and they're gonna make them all HD now and you'll
8715500	8721580	buy them anyway that's right all right Oscar we're gonna let you go but thanks
8721580	8725180	so much for the call and you know I know you really didn't get an answer out of
8725180	8730520	us but I think it's because probably I sure there could be a game that one day
8730520	8734460	surpasses Zelda if they just want to put the effort into it and hopefully they
8734460	8738940	will and appease as hardcore gamers we'll see I think you were right though
8738940	8742740	when you said that it would have to be something that we haven't seen in a game
8742740	8747500	yet like the thing with Ocarina of Time for me was just how expansive it was
8747500	8751620	like that that feeling I got when I first stepped out in the Hyrule field I
8751620	8756540	was just like holy crap there's so much to do and maybe there's something to be
8756540	8762020	said for the potential of a Zelda MMO I don't know maybe a little weird but you
8762020	8768860	know when in doubt sparkles yeah have a good one buddy all right see you all
8768860	8771660	right that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight thanks so much for you
8771660	8775140	guys calls you didn't get through I'm sorry but you know I send us an email
8775140	8778700	mailbag at orange on traded calm and we'll take more calls next week last
8778700	8781580	minute stories to get out of the way before we take off tonight there was a
8781580	8786460	bunch of rumors coming out about stuff coming from Sony apparently this was
8786460	8790740	leaked from some sort of Sony staff meeting some of the stuff we've been
8790740	8796460	hearing about over and over now a little big planet on the PSP Motorstorm on the
8796460	8803040	PSP apparently are in the works maybe as early as next year you know I'm not
8803040	8807300	surprised they need something because there's nothing really coming out on the
8807300	8812400	PSP they said that Motorstorm was shown off on the PSP but it was target footage
8812400	8822500	and not the actual game also there was supposedly you know God of War 3 stuff
8822500	8827820	shown apparently it's you know really awesome looking and uncharted 2 also
8827820	8831180	shown you mean not big surprises they're gonna make it a second uncharted game
8831180	8837020	and kills unto stuff was shown off as well so yeah that's kind of interesting
8837020	8842220	another interesting thing would be the PSP 3000 system a new system that came
8842220	8850060	out one of the things about that was it was pretty impossible to hack the custom
8850060	8855780	firmwares on well now it's even easier to do that because a mod group has
8855780	8862620	actually released a new tool now called the PSP light blue tool and what it is
8862620	8868820	is it's a memory card that will act like the Pandora's battery and will allow you
8868820	8876500	to add the custom firmwares to your system and what's funny is it will sell
8876500	8882460	for 30 bucks and apparently it came out last weekend so that's kind of neat then
8882460	8888100	finally we know about gardening mama that's going to be coming to you know
8888100	8894760	the DS soon well there's a new trademark being made title is trademark pet shop
8894760	8901260	mama and it is actually a port of a DS game that's apparently available now I'm
8901260	8905620	really if I think mama might have to be euthanized I think mama's I got a lot of
8905620	8913060	mama's getting spread too thin yeah pet shop mana ghatari is the port of the
8913060	8917260	game is being ported and has everything from penguin washing to apparently a
8917260	8921860	bear that's jumping in the air that's interesting another game though that is
8921860	8926940	being ported and thankfully coming to the United States finally track mania
8926940	8933820	DS will be coming thanks to Atlas March 17th to the US so that's pretty cool
8933820	8939020	this track mania is all sorts of awesome I would like to see a mama game where
8939020	8951020	mama is trapped in Silent Hill fix this mama mama's brothel stripping mama you
8951020	8955500	know it's funny I don't think mama here's something I would just like to
8955500	8960340	bring up where the fuck's PlayStation home I thought it should have been a
8960340	8967620	release by now it's coming out December 31st 1159 technically there's the
8967620	8971180	version 1.0 and they said that everybody in the PlayStation Underground got an
8971180	8974220	invite I'm part of PlayStation Underground I still haven't gotten an
8974220	8979220	invite so that's apparently a lie and to be honest I really couldn't care less
8979220	8983780	but I'm just kind of curious you know that they promise it's supposed to be
8983780	8988180	here for 2008 are they so white you didn't get into home so what fuck that
8988180	8992300	shit I really don't care I like I said you know yeah fuck that shit but I just
8992300	8997740	think it's funny though that they still haven't come out with something you know
8997740	9001540	even though they've been teasing this for over two years and hell it's still
9001540	9005100	in the commercials you know they're teasing for the PlayStation 3 look at
9005100	9008420	all these cool games you can play on it including PlayStation home no you can't
9008420	9014740	you cannot play that I love what joshi16 in chat says Britney mama where you get
9014740	9019460	to neglect your kids for points you were teasing home back in January in December
9019460	9026020	of last year when you know with the new PlayStation 3 commercials with what was
9026020	9033140	it a ladies and gentlemen I don't know it's sad all right well that's it for
9033140	9036140	last minute stories and that's it for the show here tonight orange launch
9036140	9039140	radio I know it's a little bit shorter but that's what happens when you take a

9083660	9089900	Loki I'm gonna try to play some more games this week and it's gonna suck
9089900	9097540	because my co-workers leaving and my boss procrastinated on having me learn
9097540	9102660	his territory and you know the accounts I'm gonna take over until I don't know
9102660	9110980	tomorrow and he leaves on Tuesday so way to be proactive my final thought is
9110980	9115580	thank you Aaron for putting us in the credits of snake 360 I thought that was
9115580	9120100	pretty cool I forgot to tell you about that in the little in the credits screen

9132300	9136340	actually get the orange launch radio game released on Xbox 360 I don't know I
9136340	9139060	don't know who we have to blow to make that happen but we might we might have
9139060	9142740	to get working on that might be a new year's resolution for oh nine I don't
9142740	9148220	know what you think it's just you know it I've thought about it a few times now
9148220	9154060	and it's just when you actually get down to figuring it out game developments
9154060	9157660	really hard and it makes something game development is hard to make something
9157660	9161620	really good takes a lot of time and it's just like holy crap that's a lot is hard
9161620	9168700	right Loki yes all right well thankfully what you cannot make yourself you steal
9168700	9175740	so my gosh all right that's it we're gonna say goodnight and get on out of
