00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:22,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 16, 2008, Wii music sales are initially disappointing, an old video game movie is getting upgraded for Blu-ray, and as little

2
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Internets and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:41,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast and live program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,880
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me as always, say hello to Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.

6
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

7
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:47,384
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

8
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:48,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

9
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:48,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Rawr.

10
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:49,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr.

11
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:49,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Rawr.

12
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Rawr.

13
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight is the episode where we will be speaking to ourselves in animal speak all night long.

14
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:56,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Meow.

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:03,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and also say hello to Miep Miep Miep, uh-huh, uh-huh, Miep Miep, Loki.

16
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not participating in this.

17
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have to speak Simlish.

18
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:10,834
[SPEAKER_09]: We're speaking Simlish tonight?

19
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

20
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Since that is a little more video game related.

21
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Run through a translation filter back into English.

22
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:19,622
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, though.

24
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:21,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.

25
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:22,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, good, good.

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, you know how it works here at Orange Lounge Radio.

27
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:30,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We do a little program here for about three hours talking about the latest and greatest in gaming.

28
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:38,254
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the show kind of started as us sitting around the table at dinner after a long night of playing DDR and fighting games in the local arcade and some pinball and all that good stuff.

29
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:39,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, golf, maybe.

30
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:44,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And just talking trash about games and other things going on in our lives.

31
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And kind of carried over onto this little program.

32
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:48,757
[SPEAKER_09]: We invite you all to our dinner table through our chat room.

33
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

34
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:58,143
[SPEAKER_09]: and when we tape live on Sunday nights at allgames.com at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

35
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:03,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start off tonight's show as we always do with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week and we'll start with DarkSakura.

36
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:04,247
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

37
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:08,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I played something other than Ragnarok, although I did play a lot of Ragnarok.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, what?

39
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:18,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I played, and you saw me play it, the Doctor Who Top Chumps game that thanks to one of our lovely listeners sent to me.

40
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:19,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rob.

41
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this Rob, but that Rob.

42
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

43
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And something will be on its way to you as soon as I am no longer broke.

44
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:29,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it's, it's cool.

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never played any Top Trumps game before.

46
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:44,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, it's really simple, and it, the, I played one of the, um, I guess ones in Adventure Mode, and I went, I did just a single game, and I had to play against a Slothine, which was, you know, I was like, eh, I don't like them.

47
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:46,924
[SPEAKER_04]: But I lost my first game.

48
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:51,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't very great losing my first game.

49
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:59,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's sort of like playing war, but you choose your stats on your card to play against someone else's stats on their card.

50
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:03,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play for cards too, and it's bizarre.

51
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's weird.

52
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:11,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to try to practice a bit more at it and see if I can get any good at it.

53
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also have, even though I haven't played it yet,

54
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:40,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Castlevania Order of Ecclesia so I'm going to be hopefully giving that a try during the week if I actually have time because I've got two art projects due and my Animal Crossing is coming tomorrow so I'm glad for that and I've also been playing a little bit of Fable Fable 2 so that's it sweet have you been playing anything fun?

55
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:42,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

56
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I played this week more Saints Row 2 because I've already finished the game.

57
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:54,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going for 100% completions, so I've been playing through the mini-games, which are actually pretty easy so far.

58
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:03,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of them are difficult, like some of the insurance fraud can be difficult because it's kind of random of what cars come and how many times you get hit and that kind of thing.

59
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:04,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

60
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:34,743
[SPEAKER_07]: but like I finished the septic adventure part where you spray sewage onto people and property and that's funny because you fling poo at them and also played through some of the helicopter assault stuff which is also fun because you're just firing rockets at things then also went and played through some of the online of that trying to get some more ranks and badges and stuff and

61
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it wasn't so cumbersome, because getting to the ranked games, it takes forever.

62
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:45,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you're done with that, there's no going back to a lobby or going into another game.

63
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:49,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kicks you back out to the main menu and you have to go through the whole thing again and again.

64
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of lame.

65
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,803
[SPEAKER_07]: But eventually I'll get enough trophies, I guess, if I stick with it long enough.

66
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am 80% done with the game, so that's awesome.

67
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:11,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the other thing I've played this week, of course, we switched to Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer because people got tired of me beating them all the time in Saints Row 2, so now they want me to beat them all the time in Grand Theft Auto 4.

68
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what's been going on.

69
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

70
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:27,822
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

71
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, it looks fun.

72
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:49,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to checking that out.

73
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:55,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I went back and played some Rock Band 2 because I finally got my cymbals for my new drum set.

74
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I vowed that I wouldn't play the drum set until I got the cymbals.

75
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:02,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I've got the cymbals, it's pretty awesome.

76
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I got only a 2-pack because they weren't selling 3-packs yet.

77
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:07,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

78
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:15,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I went ahead, I didn't really get to play Animal Crossing this week, but we did get it a little early.

79
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been watching my wife hog the game.

80
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:29,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it at PAX, and just from what I've seen, it really is almost exactly the same as the other two games.

81
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Very minor changes.

82
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:35,631
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, there's a few things that are kind of neat in it, but they don't even mention them at all.

83
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:41,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, apparently, there's like an Easter egg if you take a certain path each time.

84
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, say you start the game and immediately run across this one bridge or something.

85
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:50,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, eventually it will carve out a path for you in the leaves or in the grass or something.

86
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of a neat little Easter egg.

87
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:53,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

88
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame the economy and the stock market and gas prices.

89
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:38,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting to the point now where I have too many things to play at once.

90
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:47,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Ubisoft sent me a copy of Snowboarding for the 360 and then I got a copy of Rain Man's Raving Rabbids TV Party that I got to try out.

91
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:54,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And DS games, I'm going to try to play Trackmania DS this week because I like the PC version.

92
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:21,572
[SPEAKER_07]: also Line Raider 2 at some point and I got a download code for Banjo-Kazooie so I'm probably able to try that because I never really actually played the original and god, Fallout 3 at some point because I still haven't finished that and I gotta finish Fable 2 so it's busy but Animal Crossing does mark the last game I'm buying this year so that's nice oh and Resistance too, I still gotta play that

93
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,336
[SPEAKER_09]: SingStar Abba

94
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,816
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

95
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:04,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

96
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:05,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what am I going to say?

97
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I'm already addicted to WoW.

98
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,383
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I going to add to this?

99
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say this.

100
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:15,749
[SPEAKER_09]: They've really kind of kicked up a notch this expansion compared to the last one, the Burning Crusade.

101
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,014
[SPEAKER_09]: The new dungeons are pretty awesome, the three I've played so far.

102
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

103
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:46,827
[SPEAKER_09]: is actually really awesome because it's nothing but epic boss fights for a five man, which is pretty cool.

104
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the quests are neat.

105
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:55,350
[SPEAKER_09]: They've added this whole new vehicle thing into the game, which is kind of fun, kind of controls a little bit differently.

106
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:03,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for lore fans, I'm not huge on the lore in WoW, but I know lore fans are really getting a kick out of this one with some of the twists that are on it.

107
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:07,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're into WoW, you probably already bought this game.

108
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:19,900
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're somebody who used to play WoW that's debating coming back, you might want to take advantage of that offer that Blizzard's doing where you can get the 10-day free pass to Burning Crusade and all that.

109
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm going to tell you what, for new people, there's really not a lot in Wrath of the Lich King for you.

110
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,283
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually probably the game's shortcoming.

111
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas in Burning Crusade, at least you have Blood Elves, Draenei,

112
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

113
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:53,927
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, there's not a lot for new people.

114
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,487
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot you're going to see at level 1.

115
00:10:56,408 --> 00:11:02,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, you have a new profession, a haircut thing, but that's not worth $40 for the expansion.

116
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:12,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you do have a level 70 character, if you've quit WoW during the Burning Crusade and you're kind of curious what's changed with this, I definitely think Lich King is worth checking out.

117
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:16,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely check out Wrath of the Lich King if you're a Warcraft fan.

118
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,180
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not, there's nothing here that's going to win you over.

119
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think.

120
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:24,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I do think the quest lines so far in the dungeons from 70 to 80 have been awesome.

121
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love the music too.

122
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The music has been very ambient and pretty awesome.

123
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a zone called the Fjord.

124
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:32,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And who doesn't love the word Fjord?

125
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:35,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, it has Vikings and all that stuff, which is pretty awesome.

126
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get to kill them in the face.

127
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's pretty much been my gaming week.

128
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:42,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have gotten to get my grubby little hands on Animal Crossing.

129
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really gotten to play it very much at all.

130
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:47,286
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would agree.

131
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,548
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot here we haven't seen.

132
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:54,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And kind of as I was saying on Bobby's show as we were doing the toss over to our program tonight.

133
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,373
[SPEAKER_09]: The GameCube, in a way, was almost a better deal.

134
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:07,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, you have the online stuff now, and there's a few new things here and there, but you don't get to unlock the old-school NES games anymore.

135
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:13,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki, when we were talking about it on Bobby's show, you had a great idea for how Animal Crossing kind of put that magic back, right?

136
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:18,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, like they've been doing with some of their other Nintendo games that come out, add some minigames in there.

137
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:19,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Make some minigames.

138
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You can even make them like retro NES games or something like that.

139
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:24,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

140
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:30,895
[SPEAKER_07]: or even like, was it with, you know, just have, and he has demos or something.

141
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, they did it with Smash Brothers.

142
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:36,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why that's such a big deal now or just something.

143
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Game and watch games for heaven's sakes.

144
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Just something, you know?

145
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:43,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know what it is about mini games, but hey, it is Nintendo after all, right?

146
00:12:43,920 --> 00:13:02,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it seems like that they're not trying, that they're just basically putting in the most basic content ever, and they're making it so that you don't have to play this, you know, multiple times a week or something like that, even though you probably should if this is, you know, a game that you're going to be playing, because that's how you play this, is you have to constantly go back and maintain stuff.

147
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, the city is literally all the, you know, special event stuff that would happen, you know, all the people coming and visiting your town, they're all in the city now, which...

148
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,033
[SPEAKER_07]: The city is kind of lame.

149
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it was like other villages.

150
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe expand your village.

151
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, I don't know, make it look different.

152
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Put some effort.

153
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,056
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, here's what it is.

154
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:25,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, whereas we loved Animal Crossing and the minigames thing I think is important because

155
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,160
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we had a lot of that going on.

157
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,479
[SPEAKER_09]: There was incentive to go back and forth.

158
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas at least you still have the items and things.

159
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, come visit my Shrine of Fire and all this stuff.

160
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:58,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I think Animal Crossing has become a game for 10-year-olds.

161
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusively for the tween area.

162
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:06,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds.

163
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:09,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's anything left for us old folks anymore.

164
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really...

165
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:15,427
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the fear of actually putting virtual console games in this game?

166
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:21,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it may cut down on the sales of your virtual console games that you have featured in this.

167
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:22,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

168
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:23,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They're digital.

169
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:25,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you have to manufacture discs.

170
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:26,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It costs you nothing.

171
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,383
[SPEAKER_07]: If anything, you sell more copies of Animal Crossing and you get more people to do it.

172
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:31,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, you could maybe even...

173
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Charge them as download content.

174
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Or here's an idea.

175
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: The virtual console games that you have on your system you can put in your house or something like that.

176
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Or select ones.

177
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Like say if I own Super Mario Bros.

178
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I can put Super Mario Bros.

179
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,340
[SPEAKER_07]: game in my game or something.

180
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I can purchase Super Mario Bros.

181
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,563
[SPEAKER_07]: and put it in my house or something.

182
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:49,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

183
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:52,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's lazy.

184
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:53,524
[SPEAKER_09]: All it is is lazy.

185
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,945
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, here's the thing about Nintendo.

186
00:14:55,205 --> 00:15:00,908
[SPEAKER_09]: The disappointing thing for me as a hardcore gamer is that Nintendo is still going to sell like hotcakes this Christmas.

187
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii's are still going to be a must-have.

188
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Fit is still going to sell like crazy.

189
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Soccer moms are going to buy this for their kids.

190
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:11,775
[SPEAKER_09]: and honestly, things like, you know, look, this has been like a recurring trend on this show.

191
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:16,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We bashed Wii Music previously and said, but it's probably really good for 10 year olds.

192
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:21,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we are bashing Animal Crossing, but your 10 year old will probably have a lot of fun with it.

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I get Wii Fit?

194
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't probably exercise much with it, but my 10 year old probably will.

195
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:30,846
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is not being taken seriously by a lot of us hardcore gamers anymore.

196
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,908
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the kid system.

197
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Will it still sell?

198
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:34,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

199
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,433
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're going to lose a lot of credibility with us if they don't start turning around some games fast in 2009.

200
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And to lose that brand loyalty is going to be painful.

201
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:43,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

202
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember before, the GameCube, it was looked at as a kid system.

203
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,281
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii hasn't changed that at all.

204
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:54,004
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, now they're really pushing it that it's more of a kid system or

205
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,025
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

206
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:16,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Change it.

207
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:19,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it different than the last two that you put out.

208
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine if Super Mario Bros.

209
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:22,267
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 came out?

210
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It was exactly the same as Super Mario Bros.

211
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,210
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 except it was at night or something.

212
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,852
[SPEAKER_07]: That's seriously what they're doing.

213
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:28,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the same.

214
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:29,253
[SPEAKER_09]: With Wii Speak.

215
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's seriously that bad.

216
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they're not trying at all.

217
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:38,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And the sad thing is it's because it's Animal Crossing and people will buy it.

218
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,073
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to learn!

219
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine if 10-year-olds are happy with Animal Crossing because maybe they didn't play the other versions of the game.

220
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:06,362
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

221
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:13,687
[SPEAKER_07]: But they'll be equally disappointed when Animal Crossing 2 or whenever the next one comes out for the next Nintendo system, they're like, holy crap, this is exactly the same as the last one I played.

222
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:17,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be going, holy crap, it's exactly the same as the last three I've played.

223
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:25,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Queltipo in chat says, yeah, but at least GameCube had the debut of Resident Evil 4 to combat the supposed kiddiness and eternal darkness, too.

224
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game.

225
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's really... I have the Nintendo 64 version, so that's all it is.

226
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even have to be the look.

227
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:42,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they didn't change... The towns are basically the same as the other ones.

228
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe they're just saying the formula works, why mess with it?

229
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't have a lot of incentive to buy this game, although I guess I already have it, but to recommend it to others.

230
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:57,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a very interesting counterpoint to your whole Mario at Night thing.

231
00:17:57,783 --> 00:18:01,824
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says someone hasn't played Lost Levels, which was Super Mario Bros.

232
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:02,565
[SPEAKER_09]: 2 in Japan.

233
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: In a way, Super Mario Bros.

234
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:08,886
[SPEAKER_09]: 2 in Japan was Mario at Night, but the levels were different.

235
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:14,168
[SPEAKER_09]: They did have poison mushrooms, a difference between Mario and Luigi, but the look was the same.

236
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

237
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet another great comment from Janai in chat.

238
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Chatroom's got great comments tonight.

239
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Janai in chat says, Nintendo is really pissing on its fans for not bringing Mother 3 out.

240
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great comment.

241
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:47,934
[SPEAKER_09]: So meanwhile, while they're cranking out these games, they've got a game that might appeal to us that they refuse to release here in the U.S.

242
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:50,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

243
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:55,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well anyhow, that's pretty much going to do it for my gaming week.

244
00:18:55,571 --> 00:19:04,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some housekeeping news tonight, of which we don't have an awful lot, but I do want to make sure I announce here, towards the top of the show, we have a special guest joining us tonight.

245
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.

246
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:13,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you guys have heard about the Xbox 360 New Xbox Experience is coming out pretty soon, this next coming week.

247
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:18,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one thing that's going to be rolling out on this is the community games on the Xbox 360.

248
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,135
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember when these things were first previewed a few months ago at the Game Developers Conference, I said, this is it.

249
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,696
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a huge thing.

250
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,738
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be like the YouTube...

251
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:28,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Snake!

252
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Snake360.com Snake360.com

253
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:28,991
[SPEAKER_09]: This Game, and Music Games that we've talked about in the past.

254
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll talk about that a little later.

255
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:31,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile...

256
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,159
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really it for housekeeping.

257
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, I'm just going to say, hey, join us on Facebook at OL Army.

258
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:41,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Join us on MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio, and join us on LiveJournal at Orange Lounge.

259
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:42,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And Twitter at OLR.

260
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:49,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And this week, I will not ignore the pre-OLR twit like I did last week, and I apologize for that.

261
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I will read your twits tonight when we get to that story on Samba de Amigo.

262
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:56,894
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not ready for that yet.

263
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get some other stories first, and Loki is going to start us off tonight.

264
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

265
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be called Show Us Your Twits.

266
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

267
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that should be the official name of the saying.

268
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:08,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You like that, DarkSakura?

269
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:08,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

270
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:09,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

271
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:11,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your twits.

272
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:13,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good, Loki.

273
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:13,653
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

274
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite clever tonight.

275
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:21,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so kind of going into what we were just talking about, disappointment in Nintendo.

276
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Music has definitely been disappointing for Nintendo.

277
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:30,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually only sold so far not even 100,000 units.

278
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Only 81,000 units according to the NPD or according to Nintendo, 65,000 to 66,000 units.

279
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

280
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:47,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see why, because the game itself, really there's no point to it.

281
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:49,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a toy.

282
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:55,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that could have been literally downloaded on their WiiWare service, which it probably should have been.

283
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, you were the lone holdout for Wii Music on this program.

284
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you get a chance to check it out yet?

285
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:03,143
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

286
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:03,904
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

287
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've had school.

288
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious.

289
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:08,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, better games to play.

290
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:11,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally you're admitting it.

291
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,028
[SPEAKER_09]: There are better things out there.

292
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:16,290
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I admitted it from the beginning that there were better things to play.

293
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that I liked it.

294
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:20,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was cute.

295
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: My inner musician sang out and went, cool, I did this crap in music theory.

296
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:42,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I say it's great too for 10 year olds but anyway I don't think a 10 year old would even want to play this I'm sorry this is like for like 5 year olds it's for kids that like shake around shit that don't know what they're doing you know in a game they're like oh my god it's like I'm making music

297
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:45,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what?

298
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:55,095
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool because sometimes the parents want to go talk and have adult conversations whereas the little kids are screaming and being annoying and put them in front of this and they'll shut up.

299
00:22:55,315 --> 00:23:00,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, is the numbers here skewed a little bit because this game came out late in the month?

300
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:00,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

301
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:06,041
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, 81,000 doesn't sound like a bad number to me.

302
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:12,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe it's under expectations, but you consider there's been other music games out there, like probably Beatmania didn't sell that much.

303
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:19,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this was released, this is basically one week worth of sales, because this was released in the second to last week of the month.

304
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,415
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be honest, from what I've seen, it's not selling very well at all.

305
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:26,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

306
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:31,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... I don't know.

307
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:40,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people... Once again, they're trying to find games that the people that buy the Wii system for Wii Sports would possibly buy.

308
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,824
[SPEAKER_07]: That is really their challenge right now.

309
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do to get people to buy games that really don't want to buy other games other than Wii Sports?

310
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Lacrosse!

311
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:50,009
[SPEAKER_07]: WeSports2

312
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the parents are like, well, Wii Sports is fun for the whole family and I'm not really bored of that yet.

313
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:19,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny point from YYR in chat, Wii Music has sold more copies than Rock Revolution, fact.

314
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,867
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't go there with Rock Revolution.

315
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,808
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a whole other can of worms.

316
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:28,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on, shall we?

317
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:31,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks are kicking Nintendo while they're down, apparently.

318
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:40,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Motiva is an Ohio-based company, and they've, of course, filed a lawsuit, yet another one against Nintendo, saying that the Wiimote is violating their patent.

319
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:46,295
[SPEAKER_09]: They filed it in 2004, technology used to create a human movement measurement system.

320
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:55,122
[SPEAKER_09]: that will use a handheld tracking device in communication with a base station that is then used to create an interactive gaming experience among other capabilities.

321
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:56,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's what I want to know.

322
00:24:56,603 --> 00:25:01,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo's getting sued by all these people that claim they have the patent for the Wii Remote and stuff.

323
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,769
[SPEAKER_07]: How can everybody have the patent for the Wii Remote?

324
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's all these people that are suing them saying that they have patents for this stuff.

325
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:14,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't they be suing each other because now they have patents that also kind of overlap?

326
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:14,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

327
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the part I don't really get either.

328
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

329
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,351
[SPEAKER_09]: All these people are claiming we invented the Wii years ago.

330
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:20,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we invented the Wii Remote.

331
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:24,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, we just paid a settlement to this other company and said they invented the Wii Remote.

332
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:28,995
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to dish it out with them then because they're the ones that actually claimed the... I am Spartacus.

333
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I am Spartacus.

334
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,857
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I am Spartacus.

335
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's really ridiculous.

336
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:37,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

337
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:44,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also, it's like, oh my god, we didn't realize they were so similar two years after it came out.

338
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:55,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be really curious to see what happens with one of these lawsuits, because we keep hearing about, oh, somebody's suing them, somebody's suing them, yet we haven't heard about really anybody winning or losing yet.

339
00:25:56,293 --> 00:26:01,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's basically, it's like, yeah, we created the Wii Remote, we want you to pay up.

340
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:08,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think we created the Wii Remote and all these hundreds of thousands of dollars say we did.

341
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:10,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yes, you created the Wii Remote.

342
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

343
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:23,799
[SPEAKER_09]: and more.

344
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to reset that joke now, excuse me.

345
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in Soviet Russia, joke tell you.

346
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:55,042
[SPEAKER_09]: So we called TiVo this week to get a comment on this story, and you know what they told us?

347
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:56,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I am Spartacus.

348
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, I don't feel bad now for interrupting that joke.

349
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:09,746
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was going to say, what's going to be an interesting turn of event is when TiVo sues Nintendo over the technology for a pointer and, you know, that kind of an airface.

350
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,380
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

351
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:13,481
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

352
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just lawsuit after lawsuit in the world.

353
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:16,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't we all just get along?

354
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:18,485
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's not allowed to.

355
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you know that war is the true way of things?

356
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:23,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's not, but still.

357
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:26,272
[SPEAKER_04]: War is population control.

358
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Nintendo is being sneaky.

359
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very sneaky.

360
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:42,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And their sneakiness will definitely fool a few people, but they haven't said anything about it efficiently, nor have they actually...

361
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:51,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, put any kind of thing on their site from what I understand.

362
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was actually seen at Target.

363
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's official.

364
00:27:56,233 --> 00:28:02,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a multiplayer control set is what it's called.

365
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Mario Kart wheel, a Wii remote and nunchuck, and it's $74.99, which is actually more expensive than getting them all individually.

366
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

367
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

368
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:18,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sweet.

369
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:20,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Two cents more, according to Kotaku.

370
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:25,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, it's like, okay, why?

371
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:27,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you even need the damn wheel?

372
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:28,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

373
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more than that.

374
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think the wheel itself is only $10.

375
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Although some people charge $15 for it.

376
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:34,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on where you go.

377
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going over official retail price.

378
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, officially it's supposed to be $10.

379
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:45,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually $5 more expensive than buying them separately.

380
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:46,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

381
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:50,496
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I will... Well, I don't know why I'm looking at GameStop's website.

382
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:52,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they have theirs for $15.

383
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we sell them for $10.

384
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:58,359
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just funny.

385
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, another kind of holiday gift thing.

386
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you really don't need the Wii wheel, but I guess people have trouble.

387
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:11,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, we have to have the Wii wheel or we don't have the proper grip on the thingy.

388
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:15,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Wii wheel sells for $14.99.

389
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was supposed to be $10.

390
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:22,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that I've seen two different SRPs from them and one was $14.99 and one was $10.

391
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they're supposed to be $10.

392
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But people still charge $15 because guess what?

393
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't know better and they will buy it for $15.

394
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because people are dumbasses.

395
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:34,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have to admit something.

396
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:43,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the magic of radio, you may not have even known I was gone, but I had to run in the house because I've had a migraine and I don't remember if I said that at the top of the show, so I was making myself some coffee so I could have some caffeine because that's good for headaches.

397
00:29:44,436 --> 00:29:45,997
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is so damn funny?

398
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:49,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard you literally laughing all the way in the house.

399
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:56,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That their combo, that their bundle here with one remote nunchuck and a Wii wheel is actually more expensive than buying them all separately.

400
00:29:58,686 --> 00:29:59,307
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty funny.

401
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:00,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a bagel.

402
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:24,214
[SPEAKER_07]: so uh yes i also ran in to get jamie a bagel and really i mean why should you buy this in a big old bundle like this when i'm sure right next to all of them are the individual components separate of each other and it's just stupid but whatever you know can't hurt them for trying i'm sure that's probably like one of those target exclusive sets or something like that

403
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:25,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say anything on the box.

404
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It's official Nintendo stuff.

405
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but sometimes I know with like Activision, they make special bundles for like Guitar Hero and stuff like that for different retailers.

406
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:41,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it won't say Atari exclusive or whatever, but it's made exclusively for those retailers.

407
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:46,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, the room smells like caffeine.

408
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:46,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

409
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's good.

410
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:48,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

411
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:52,244
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I gotta be up at work at 6 in the morning.

412
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, now I'm never going to be able to go to sleep tonight.

413
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:55,385
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, I can stay up and play WoW.

414
00:30:55,945 --> 00:31:01,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of innovation, Nintendo has revealed their 2009 lineup, or early 2009, basically for...

415
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:06,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario & Luigi RPG 3

416
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,100
[SPEAKER_07]: is scheduled to come out February 11th to the DS.

417
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now there's a good game.

418
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:29,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a cool game.

419
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:33,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Castlevania Judgment, they're getting it a little bit late.

420
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:37,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And Play for Wii Mario Tennis coming January 15th.

421
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:46,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Play for Wii Mario Tennis is the port of the GameCube game with Wii controls now.

422
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:54,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time will be coming to both DS and Wii on January 29th.

423
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:01,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Also not listed on there would be Sin and Punishment 2 and Punch-Out.

424
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:04,791
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe soon after that.

425
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Queltipo gives a nice, mature summary of the 2009 lineup for Nintendo.

426
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, Mario & Luigi.

427
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:09,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Fart to everything else.

428
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:32,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Punch-Out might be kind of cool even if they're just capitalizing on Wii Sports, the boxing game.

429
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:33,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Punch-Out!

430
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:36,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I didn't realize Punch-Out had been re-released so many times.

431
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:39,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they've had different versions for like the Super Nintendo and stuff like that.

432
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:41,358
[SPEAKER_09]: The Super Nintendo one was awesome!

433
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of underrated.

434
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be pretty neat, but, you know, I...

435
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:53,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have much faith in Nintendo just because of the example of their products that have come out recently.

436
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't seem like they're trying.

437
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Sin and Punishment might be pretty cool because the first one was fun.

438
00:32:57,524 --> 00:33:02,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Sin and Punishment looks awesome, but it just doesn't look like they're trying.

439
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:06,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The stuff that's developed in-house just doesn't seem to be that good.

440
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:09,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Shonen Jump is a manga compilation.

441
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:34,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

442
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:36,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So how much did I talk about video games in there?

443
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ads for stuff and little articles in there.

444
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for whatever reason, this game got the jump on Blood of Bahamut, which is the game that Squeenix is teasing.

445
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:51,454
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a DS game, and apparently what you do, you can play this game with four people locally, and you defend your city from attacks.

446
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:52,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like a city defense game.

447
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:57,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, you build them on a creature or something.

448
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:59,416
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's what the teaser image kind of makes it look like.

449
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:01,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'll be more information.

450
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:03,517
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where Bahamut comes into things.

451
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:04,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming.

452
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:08,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be hearing more on this game soon, but who knows if it's coming to the US or not.

453
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:19,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I would assume it is, because Squeenix has gotten a little better about their whole universal game, you know, worldwide game thing, especially if Last Remnant's any indication, which, god damn, there's another game I gotta play this holiday season.

454
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like SimCity of the Colossus.

455
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:26,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

456
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:29,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there's a lot of Squeenix fans who are going to be curious to check this one out.

457
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:33,861
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet again, another kind of interesting game for the DS.

458
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:36,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is the DS getting all the love?

459
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:42,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's because more people own DSs than anything else, but I don't know.

460
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,830
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's just like I was saying last week when I was talking about Order of Ecclesia.

461
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we have these games on consoles?

462
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play them on my television, not when I'm lying in my bed playing my DS.

463
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,216
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make a DS TV tuner.

464
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:55,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes and no.

465
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:13,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the idea is cool in theory, but at the same time, I want them to have a platformer, like the type of thing you'd see on the DS, but with that LittleBigPlanet-style graphics, really sharp, good-looking, use the high-end graphics.

466
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:16,551
[SPEAKER_09]: They already have a TV tuner for the DS in Japan.

467
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:22,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also have it if you review games and you're putting together professional stuff, but the rest of us...

468
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if we have a DS dev kit.

469
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:27,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

470
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we'd ever get one of those.

471
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

472
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:31,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It could happen.

473
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,279
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

474
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It would never happen.

475
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:40,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on and talk about some release dates and some of the games we will be getting our hands on a little bit sooner.

476
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,585
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start with our friends over in Europe, right, Jamie?

477
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:43,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

478
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:49,110
[SPEAKER_04]: For our UK releases, and this is stuff that we may or may not get our hands on, but yeah.

[SPEAKER_09]: Which is not a surprise, by the way.

482
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:21,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though they don't have Thanksgiving over in Europe, it's still the same busy period it is here.

[SPEAKER_07]: Busy, busy week.

489
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:19,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and it's very similar to that in the U.S.

490
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:19,953
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.

491
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:28,294

501
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:00,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a fun party game.

502

00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:23,258

507
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf says, Loki, you just misspoke.

508
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,323
[SPEAKER_09]: You stated that Animal Crossing was a new game that came out on the Wii this week.

509
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:29,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

510
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:30,744

526
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:54,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like with Rock Revolution, I don't know what it is that draws me to these games that really get shit on by the public, but I'm fucking curious about it.

527
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to buy it just to kind of check it out.

528
00:39:56,697 --> 00:40:01,460
[SPEAKER_07]: They want you to make your judgment on it and judge with your wallet and do not buy it.

529
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you are planning on buying it, wait a few weeks for it to really suck and then to drop the price on it.

530
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:08,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Find it used?

531
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:08,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

532
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:10,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I can find Rock Revolution used now.

533
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:12,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably getting cheaper.

534
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:14,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only imagine.

535
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:15,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Pet's Monkey House.

536
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have monkeys infesting your DS.

537
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that sounds kind of awesome.

538
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,858

546
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:17,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, to be honest, the game looks like... What are you doing, the game of Nipple?

[SPEAKER_07]: But really, why even bother?

563
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,282
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tony Hawk's Motion on DS.

564
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

565
00:42:03,802 --> 00:42:04,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Hawk.

566
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,364

[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine Movie Star on DS.

568
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even bother with that one.

569
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:14,572
[SPEAKER_07]: God, there's too much shit coming out.

570
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,453

[SPEAKER_07]: Pet's Crazy Monkeys on the Wii.

574
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, Loki played it at PAX on stage in front of everyone.

575
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:32,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Comedy.

576
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:41,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I wanted to play the actual part where you can slide around on the moose using the Wii balance board, and you sit on it and lean back and forth.

577
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:50,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, sure, you can play that after you play this dancing game with some chicks, the frag dolls.

578
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:52,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and we're going to videotape you.

579
00:42:52,515 --> 00:42:56,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then when you're done, we're going to say, fuck off, and you're not going to get to play the actual thing you wanted to play.

580
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:59,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what was great about that whole thing is that...

581
00:43:00,303 --> 00:43:04,508
[SPEAKER_09]: You were there to play something else that was being horribly ignored by everybody.

582
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:07,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And you were really excited to check out a different game at the booth, right?

583
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:08,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what it was.

584
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to play Rayman's Raven Rabbids.

585
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was something else in the booth that you went over there first to go play.

586
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:14,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Hawks?

587
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:15,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's what it was.

588
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the cute girl came up and was like,

589
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:20,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you want to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids?

590
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,245
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't even do that.

591
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:27,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you know, I wanted to play Rayman's Raving Rabbids because that's kind of one of the things I wanted to do when I got there.

592
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:28,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't want to play the dance game.

593
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I want to play that one.

594
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:33,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done the dance game in the other one and it was, guess what?

595
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much different than this one.

596
00:43:35,816 --> 00:43:37,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone's like, oh, getting real into it.

597
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yay.

598
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,220
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.

599
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to dance, I want to ride the moose.

600
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:44,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

[SPEAKER_07]: CSI New York.

607
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not want the kook Cats Clan on my DS.

00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:06,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

609
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,474

616
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:28,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, these are the games that demand your attention on the Wii.

617
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:29,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not fucking knock Foosball.

618
00:44:30,663 --> 00:44:31,864

626
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:46,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a little fancy deal that they've got going there.

627
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:47,959
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn.

628
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:49,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Still not done.

634
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:09,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is another guitar hero rip-off game or guitar freaks rip-off or whoever you want to rip off.

635
00:45:10,237 --> 00:45:12,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks with pop music, so don't buy it.

636
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout Anthology, coming out with the last three Burnout games.

637
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,460

[SPEAKER_07]: The Last Remnant on Xbox 360.

00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're done.

645
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:40,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

646
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank God.

647
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:41,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

648
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:46,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some of the Japanese releases and talk about what's coming out in Japan.

649
00:45:46,636 --> 00:45:53,142
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a game on the Xbox 360 called Otomedius Gorgeous which looks pretty hot and I'd like to know where the hell this game is in America.

650
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:54,803
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an arcade game from Konami.

651
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:56,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a Konami game.

652
00:45:56,164 --> 00:45:58,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Proteus but it's bigger.

653
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:02,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a shooter with hot chicks and the shooter actually looks kind of graphically pretty fun.

654
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:06,333
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of looks like UN Squadron to me a little bit.

655
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:07,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it on Wii, you said?

656
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,817
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's on Xbox 360, of all things.

657
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:11,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So this game looks pretty hot.

658
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:12,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That's coming out this week in Japan.

659
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming out, The Last Remnant is coming out in Japan this week.

660
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:19,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also coming out in a bundle-style thing.

661
00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:21,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So keep an eye out for that because they're hoping to sell some...

662
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dying to play...

663
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they just port, like, Guitar Freaks or something?

664
00:46:50,443 --> 00:46:51,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

665
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:11,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing, City Folk hits the Japanese shores as well, as well as the version that has We Speak.

666
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:16,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes gets a price reduction this week.

667
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:17,559
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a new game, but it gets a price reduction.

668
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:20,401
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want a new game, check out this new game from Compile.

669
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:21,842
[SPEAKER_09]: We love Compile, right?

670
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:23,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Sugoro Chronicle.

671
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:29,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Migite ni ken o hidarait ni saikoro o comes out this week.

672
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have no idea what the hell this game's about.

673
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:34,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's some type of board game translation that's coming out in Japan.

674
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:39,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like, I guess you could say, a Mario Party-ish game, but it looks like there's some RPG elements in that game.

675
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:41,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't look half bad, though.

676
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:48,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on the handheld systems, or actually, let's take a look quick at PlayStation 2, because some folks still have that.

677
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:56,763
[SPEAKER_09]: You also get another version of Mercenaries 2, World in Flames, as well as a game called Koi Haime Musou comes out as well, from Yeti.

678
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:58,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Hime.

679
00:47:59,124 --> 00:47:59,424
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

680
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:03,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, that's part of the reason why I do this, because I butcher all the Japanese names.

681
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:04,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It means princess.

682
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:04,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.

683
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:06,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, goody, another Princess game.

684
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:11,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is probably the game that most folks are waiting for, not just in Japan, but in the U.S.

685
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:17,594
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo DS this week, Chrono Trigger finally hits on November 20th, so keep an eye out for that.

686
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:21,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that comes a whole lot of accessories from Hori.

687
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:29,045
[SPEAKER_09]: New pouches in different colors, a new little cleaning cloth thing, as well as a couple other games.

688
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:40,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomica Hero Rescue Force, Touch and Direct from Sega, and a game called DS Recording Diet comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.

689
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:47,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, over on the PSP, checking out what releases we have there this week.

690
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:50,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not quite as busy of a week in Japan as it is in other parts of the world.

691
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:55,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Ratchet & Clank, or as they call it, Clank & Ratchet.

692
00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:58,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Maruhi Mission Ignition comes out on the PSP this week.

693
00:48:59,418 --> 00:49:04,179
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as, again, Hori is also putting out some cases and things for the Sony PSP.

694
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, you have All-Star Yaken 2 Portable.

695
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And, wait for it, Mobile Suit Gundam!

696
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:20,823
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, another Mobile Suit Gundam game Gundam vs. Gundam, and it even comes with its own PSP pack if you want to check that out Is that like a Gundam remake of Spy vs. Spy?

697
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,867
[SPEAKER_04]: No My friend calls it Gundam

698
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:25,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I think this is kind of neat.

699
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:31,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's like a Disgaea spinoff because a game has come out all about Prinnies this week on the PSP.

700
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:37,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Prinnie, Ore ga Shujinku de Inisuka comes out this week.

701
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:39,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can be a hero too or something like that.

702
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:42,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out in the US too in February.

703
00:49:42,885 --> 00:49:45,466
[SPEAKER_09]: You get 1,000 lives in this game.

704
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:50,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a side-scroller action game and your character has literally 1,000 lives.

705
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's really hard, because that'd be funny.

706
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:53,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be.

707
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:57,719
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, printies were kind of disposable in Disgaea, so that is kind of funny.

708
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually sounds like kind of a funny game, so you might have to check that one out.

709
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:02,952
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

710
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with some other gaming news.

711
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is particularly exciting stuff.

712
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of other release dates, Street Fighter 4 has a date for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

713
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you're saying that it's going to be February 20th, 2009.

714
00:50:56,813 --> 00:51:05,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also some reports saying that there's going to be 25 characters in the console release and maybe some other fun stuff.

715
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:06,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So who knows?

716
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:10,654
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

717
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:39,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunnyvale Golfland

718
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:57,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we're going to see it.

719
00:51:58,612 --> 00:51:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It is popping up around the U.S.

720
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:01,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks are importing it.

721
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:04,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some of our New York listeners called in several weeks ago to talk about it.

722
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:08,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of sad it's not getting an official quote-unquote release in the U.S.

723
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:09,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

724
00:52:09,155 --> 00:52:10,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't really stop a lot of people nowadays.

725
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:13,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe because it's coming out on the consoles.

726
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:16,357
[SPEAKER_09]: When games come out on consoles, it kind of kills the arcade release.

727
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:19,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless it's Derby Owner's Club or DDR.

728
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:21,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it, right?

729
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:35,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if developers are smart enough to incorporate things that you can tie into consoles, like, for example, DDR with edit data or, you know, F-Zero GX with, you know, data that you can port to the arcade and that kind of stuff.

730
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:39,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if they do it smart, both can benefit from it.

731
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,536
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, hey, Street Fighter fans.

732
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:48,159
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are a hardcore Street Fighter fan, you've got to be a really hardcore Street Fighter fan to appreciate this.

733
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:54,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you just like bad movies like me, you're going to be excited that Street Fighter the movie is coming out on Blu-ray.

734
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:55,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

735
00:52:55,564 --> 00:53:03,649
[SPEAKER_09]: The Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul Julia, and most importantly, Kylie Minow as Cammy Street Fighter movie is coming out on Blu-ray.

736
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:07,171
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an extreme edition of the Street Fighter movie.

737
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

738
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:11,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so sad but true that this is Raul Julia's last movie.

739
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:13,374
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can experience it one more time.

740
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:14,775
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually was the best thing about the movie.

741
00:53:15,155 --> 00:53:16,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I even remember this 20 years later.

742
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:19,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not quite that much, but like 15, 20 years later.

743
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:22,279
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was the best thing about that movie and the rest of it was complete cheeseball.

744
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:22,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Cammy was great.

745
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,000
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

746
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Kylie Minogue was pretty awesome.

747
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty great to see her in the movie.

748
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the reason that this movie's coming out now or soon, I guess Well, to tie in with all the other Street Fighter crap Well, yes, and also to make it seem like that the new movie isn't as bad as it really is, because you watch this movie and you see the new movie and you're like, holy crap, that's awesome you know, whereas the average person who's seen it can go yeah not great Very good point It's like, thank god it's not thank god it didn't kill any good actors in this one

749
00:53:56,511 --> 00:54:05,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say this though, and not to spoil anything about the movie, but the very last thing in the entire movie, the little pose they all do at the very end, is by far the best part.

750
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:10,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's so fucking cheesy.

751
00:54:10,235 --> 00:54:15,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Good question from Frisbee in chat, chat.orange.radio.com Can we expect Street Fighter, the movie, the game?

752
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:16,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

753
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:25,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering some of the people who were in development of that game have come out and now spoken about why the game was such crap, I don't think you're ever going to see that game again.

754
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:28,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the type of thing they've kind of swept under the rug and would like to leave there.

755
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for reminding them of such painful memories.

756
00:54:32,112 --> 00:54:36,695
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play Street Fighter, the movie, the game, you just need to go find MAME.

757
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:42,979
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, they are making that Street Fighter the later years into a TV show.

758
00:54:46,052 --> 00:54:46,312
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

759
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:17,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would do it if my email would pull up, so just give me a second.

760
00:55:17,784 --> 00:55:18,184
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

761
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:19,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo.

762
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a stunning total of one email.

763
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:26,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And it comes.

764
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:32,532
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, as a reminder, that email address is mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you want to give DarkSakura some work to do.

765
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:33,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

766
00:55:34,654 --> 00:55:36,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So this comes from Geekboy.

767
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:41,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, for episode 300 I sent an email and you asked how old I am.

768
00:55:41,578 --> 00:55:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: My 13th birthday is going to be on the 23rd.

769
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my parents know I listen.

770
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:46,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't freak out.

771
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:49,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So SakuraMax beat that fatality.

772
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:52,205
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Jamie.

773
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:56,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on Twitter, so please give me the JSRF soundtrack info on there.

774
00:55:56,628 --> 00:56:00,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I know I have typed this horribly, but I am too lazy to type slowly.

775
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

776
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Orange Lounge!

777
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:04,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Exclamation points a lot.

778
00:56:05,553 --> 00:56:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

779
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:08,055
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

780
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:14,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just be happier if you actually... Dude, you spelled just, like, everything right.

781
00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:18,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So why not try just using your shift key to capitalize stuff, okay?

782
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:19,522
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

783
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:23,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyramid Head is inferior Pyramid Head is inferior

784
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:52,839
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty controversial statement right there on this program.

785
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:53,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyramid Head is inferior.

786
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyramid Head may be near and dear to many of your hearts, but I mean no ill will.

787
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:02,023
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, I want to expose everyone to something more creepy and superior.

788
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:11,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Games with a horror theme may have their most memorable monsters and moments, but I believe that there is one out there to best them all, and it comes from Earthbound.

789
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:14,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the old Super Nintendo game with Ness in it.

790
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:19,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I continue, I'd like to put up the old spoiler warning here since what I'm referring to is the final boss of Earthbound.

791
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:30,617
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of Earthbound, Ness faces Giygas, an enemy that has been inhabited by the very manifestation of evil and has become a formless, swirling mass of red and black.

792
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:33,938
[SPEAKER_09]: As the fight progresses, Giygas becomes more erratic and unsettling.

793
00:57:34,238 --> 00:57:38,459
[SPEAKER_09]: The fight itself is disturbing even by today's standards, and it's a Super Nintendo game to boot.

794
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:47,361
[SPEAKER_09]: The parallax sprite of Giygas has a fetus in it, the audio in the fight is the actual boss itself, and Giygas' speech is just plain creepy.

795
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Truly an experience in itself.

796
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:53,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a little clip of actually what that might look like.

797
00:57:58,753 --> 00:58:01,216
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a little creepy sound that Giygas makes.

798
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:05,842
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a little bit creepy.

799
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:14,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that wasn't bad enough, consider the fact that there is complete leftover data for a potentially creepier rematch against Giygas in Mother 3.

800
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:20,267
[SPEAKER_09]: What was found was a sequence of imagery that gets progressively disturbing as the fight would have progressed if one were to play it.

801
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't you get freaked out?

802
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:29,531
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were fighting the hollow red outline image of a dead relative's face with pupil-less eyes and mouth gaping wide open, right.

803
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:32,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's audible speech for this iteration of Giygas.

804
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:36,793
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of creepy, all things considered.

805
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:43,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, even if you never play Earthbound, I implore the listeners to set aside a few minutes to watch these amazingly How's that spelled?

806
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:44,874
[SPEAKER_09]: frightening experiences.

807
00:58:44,974 --> 00:58:51,936
[SPEAKER_09]: G-I-Y-G-A-S Search for Earthbound's Giygas Final Battle and Lucas Nightmare on YouTube.

808
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:52,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Greeny.

809
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you have it.

810
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:09,016
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't know.

811
00:59:09,036 --> 00:59:11,558
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put Giygas in the next Smash Bros.

812
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:11,838
[SPEAKER_07]: game.

813
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:12,479
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

814
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:13,039
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

815
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:13,900
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm talking about.

816
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a horror all-stars game.

817
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:16,741
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

818
00:59:16,861 --> 00:59:18,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put him in Smash Bros.

819
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:23,306
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it'll piss fans off even more because you had another character from Earthbound and they're not bringing it over here.

820
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,748
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like what they did with Kid Icarus.

821
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:27,728
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

822
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's Mailbag.

823
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us more emails.

824
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:34,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, you won a Kid Icarus game, did you?

825
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:35,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one's coming.

826
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,673
[SPEAKER_07]: and someday, maybe, I don't know.

827
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:49,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So Activision, you know, since they are going to be planning on making a lot of Guitar Hero games, needs some more developers to help them with that.

828
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have acquired Budcat to do that.

829
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And Budcat Creations, the studio that has been responsible for all Guitar Hero titles on PlayStation 2 since Guitar Hero 3 is...

830
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:07,847
[SPEAKER_07]: is currently in development of a new game in the Guitar Hero franchise.

831
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:13,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And one guess would be that it's Guitar Hero Metallica.

832
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:15,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

833
01:00:16,272 --> 01:00:29,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says with Neversoft at the helm, Budkaz working on PS2, and Vicarious Visions will be responsible for the Wii and DS versions of whatever the next game will be.

834
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:38,814
[SPEAKER_08]: and Budcat also just worked on, I guess, a Wii game that just came out on the WiiWare service, Our House, which was published by Majesco.

835
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:39,974
[SPEAKER_09]: In the middle of the street?

836
01:00:40,874 --> 01:00:41,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Our House?

837
01:00:42,895 --> 01:00:43,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

838
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:43,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

839
01:00:44,115 --> 01:00:44,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

840
01:00:44,635 --> 01:00:52,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there really a lot of development that needs to go into Guitar Hero Metallica?

841
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:53,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

842
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:56,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than putting note charts together and

843
01:00:58,907 --> 01:00:59,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

844
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:00,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have to make it so uniquely different.

845
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:04,297
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just like how Guitar Hero Aerosmith was so different from Guitar Hero 3.

846
01:01:04,738 --> 01:01:09,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, we do need to create the exaggerated models of the Metallica band members.

847
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:18,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, it's interesting that Budcat is kind of being assimilated into the Acty Blizzard empire, but what can you do?

848
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:28,945
[SPEAKER_09]: More interesting stuff coming out for Guitar Hero, an official Gene Simmons brand Axe guitar coming out for not just Guitar Hero, but Rock Band as well.

849
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:29,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

850
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:30,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a wireless guitar.

851
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a freaking axe, not the deodorant.

852
01:01:33,871 --> 01:01:39,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about like I'm going to chop you in half type axe, which actually looks pretty fucking sweet.

853
01:01:39,598 --> 01:01:41,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out November 15th for $80.

854
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:43,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll waste my money on that.

855
01:01:44,064 --> 01:01:45,967
[SPEAKER_09]: That date just passed, so it's already out now.

856
01:01:46,027 --> 01:01:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out for $80.

857
01:01:47,426 --> 01:01:52,630
[SPEAKER_09]: It is compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 versions of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

858
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The little controller actually will work with both.

859
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:01,317
[SPEAKER_09]: It uses a little dongle to get the signal there.

860
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:07,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, the actual guitar is like a three-quarter size official replica of the official Gene Simmons Axe guitar.

861
01:02:07,462 --> 01:02:10,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, unfortunately, this guitar will only work for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2.

862
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:14,968
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are an Xbox 360 owner, you have to wait until April of 2009.

863
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:21,274
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a Wii owner, January 31st is when you get your version of the guitar.

864
01:02:21,294 --> 01:02:24,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know why Xbox 360 owners have to wait so much longer, but there you go.

865
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:26,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

866
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:31,196
[SPEAKER_08]: They got, like, what, the Mad Catz bass guitar.

867
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:34,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as if there wasn't a million different guitars out there already, right?

868
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:38,117
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to admit, this one does look pretty freaking sweet.

869
01:02:38,397 --> 01:02:42,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do need a new guitar, but I play the games on the Xbox 360, so... Well, I'll tell you what, Rob.

870
01:02:43,018 --> 01:02:45,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of guitars, this has nothing to do with it.

871
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:45,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

872
01:02:48,752 --> 01:02:50,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to throw that ferret in a fireplace.

873
01:02:50,753 --> 01:02:52,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you say that all the time.

874
01:02:52,175 --> 01:02:52,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you?

875
01:02:52,655 --> 01:02:52,975
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

876
01:02:53,175 --> 01:02:55,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret is undefeatable.

877
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:59,380
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny is that in Wii Music you have all these obscure things, right?

878
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,681
[SPEAKER_09]: You have cheerleaders, triangles, cowbell, right?

879
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:02,142
[SPEAKER_09]: All that stuff.

880
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:04,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we have ferret in Wii Music?

881
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:06,445
[SPEAKER_09]: That might have made the game sell more copies.

882
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:07,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it, Nintendo.

883
01:03:07,105 --> 01:03:08,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the OLR edition of Wii Music.

884
01:03:08,907 --> 01:03:09,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

885
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:10,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

886
01:03:12,346 --> 01:03:22,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Samba de Amigo is going to be on mobile phones.

887
01:03:22,514 --> 01:03:34,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It will actually be with T-Mobile and AT&T phones, which pretty much spells out iPhone for me since I think T-Mobile has the iPhone now too, right?

888
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:35,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it?

889
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:40,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think in other countries they do, but not here.

890
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, T-Mobile has their sidekick too.

891
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically those nice big screens.

892
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:50,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But Samba de Amigo is going to be coming out for T-Mobile and AT&T phones.

893
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be pretty cool.

894
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:57,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I mean, basically just Samba de Amigo.

895
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not going to really have it being all fun and Morocco-y.

896
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:06,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you just shake the phone.

897
01:04:07,796 --> 01:04:14,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I mean, how much can you really replicate the experience of Samba de Amigo on a friggin' cell phone?

898
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:16,564
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I don't get, you know?

899
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:17,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little silly to me.

900
01:04:18,306 --> 01:04:23,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I might have to try it, but that's just to see exactly how it works.

901
01:04:24,972 --> 01:04:25,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So, who knows?

902
01:04:26,754 --> 01:04:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any kind of a date on it or anything yet, but just keep looking if you care.

903
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:32,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I don't care.

904
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:35,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can show right over there.

905
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:36,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That was how little I cared.

906
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

907
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:49,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we asked our listeners tonight in a little segment we're now going to call Show Us Your Twits on Twitter what they thought about the Samba de Amigo game.

908
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I need music for the Show Us Your Twits segment.

909
01:04:51,723 --> 01:04:52,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any music.

910
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:53,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to get some music.

911
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Find something porny.

912
01:04:55,343 --> 01:04:56,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what I can find.

913
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:56,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

914
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Digging out some music.

915
01:04:58,184 --> 01:05:01,025
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think the listeners said while I tried to dig out some music here?

916
01:05:01,445 --> 01:05:02,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they said burrito.

917
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Bean Burrito, Chimichanga.

918
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:11,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if I can find live radio folks.

919
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:13,988
[SPEAKER_09]: How about now you're a man?

920
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:15,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

921
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not appropriate.

922
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Inappropriate.

923
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:20,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

924
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:21,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

925
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:23,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a line about big titties in it.

926
01:05:24,636 --> 01:05:25,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go, here we go.

927
01:05:26,097 --> 01:05:26,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try this again.

928
01:05:26,878 --> 01:05:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to a segment now we call Show Us Your Twits.

929
01:05:38,796 --> 01:05:43,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, 13xforever says, Nope, played just fine with my iPhone.

930
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:49,546
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Tyron says, could be fun for a few minutes on the iPhone.

931
01:05:49,566 --> 01:05:51,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see it being really worth it though.

932
01:05:51,186 --> 01:05:53,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Music games generally suck on mobile.

933
01:05:54,447 --> 01:05:58,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says, even if I were into mobile gaming, probably not.

934
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:01,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Half the gameplay is shaking the maracas and you don't get that on a mobile.

935
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:08,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Deekman says, after the Wii version's crappy controls and no support on the console release, I'm not expecting anything Sega does to be good anymore.

936
01:06:09,972 --> 01:06:14,134
[SPEAKER_09]: MistyOLR says, hell, I'll probably check it out if Verizon decides to make it work on my phone.

937
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:19,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, Samba de Amigo without maracas ain't Samba de Amigo.

938
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:21,842
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says, I don't play mobile games.

939
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:23,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a DS and a PSP.

940
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Marin Marvel says, probably not.

941
01:06:25,624 --> 01:06:30,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be hard to emulate a game like that and make it as fun as the original in a mobile phone version.

942
01:06:30,507 --> 01:06:31,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, unless it was on the iPhone, maybe.

943
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Still, probably not.

944
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Crows says, ew, mobile games?

945
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Dem fancy cell phones were made for phone calls, nothing else.

946
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:42,972
[SPEAKER_09]: For gaming, they're probably even weaker than Game Boy Advance.

947
01:06:43,552 --> 01:06:48,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Tipo says, sure, why not take a game beloved for its peripherals and put it out on mobile phones?

948
01:06:48,953 --> 01:06:50,494
[SPEAKER_09]: What's next, Steel Battalion?

949
01:06:52,114 --> 01:06:59,760
[SPEAKER_09]: and lastly, Geekboy says, I never had the chance to play the original because I was too young, but I wouldn't buy this in case I ever do get the chance to.

950
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to ruin the experience.

951
01:07:01,481 --> 01:07:02,842
[SPEAKER_09]: My cell phone is really crappy.

952
01:07:02,882 --> 01:07:03,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I want an iPhone.

953
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:05,404
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody wants to give me one, contact me.

954
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sell you mine for $400.

955
01:07:07,966 --> 01:07:08,886
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

956
01:07:08,926 --> 01:07:09,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your twits.

957
01:07:09,847 --> 01:07:10,888
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to follow us on Twitter,

958
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:13,643
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR is our username on Twitter.

959
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can answer questions and show us your twits every Sunday night here.

960
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sell mine autographed for $400.

961
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we autographed it, but it wore off.

962
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:23,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

963
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:24,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming news.

964
01:07:25,352 --> 01:07:25,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we gotta?

965
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:30,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because we're almost to the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

966
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:31,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have an interview tonight.

967
01:07:32,217 --> 01:07:33,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron from Snake360.

968
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:34,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a busy show tonight.

969
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:34,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta keep it moving.

970
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

971
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:45,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band are both getting brand new songs from the new Killers album, Day and Age.

972
01:07:46,716 --> 01:07:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's originally thought to only be debuting on Guitar Hero World Tour, but of course the MTV came out to say, hey, that's not true.

973
01:07:56,621 --> 01:08:01,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's going to be a three-song track pack available day and date with the new album.

974
01:08:02,483 --> 01:08:04,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be available for...

975
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:12,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero World Tour for 440 Microsoft Points or 549 on the PlayStation 3.

976
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:22,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, each song will be available individually for 160 Microsoft Points, $1.99 on PS3, and actually on the Nintendo Wii for 200 points a pop.

977
01:08:23,143 --> 01:08:25,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for Rock Band...

978
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be releasing, I guess, alongside with the thing as well.

979
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:38,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And no word on price or if they're going to just be doing like a three-song pack that says it looks like they're going to feature...

980
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:45,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like it also might be the same.

981
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, three different songs from there.

982
01:08:47,616 --> 01:08:58,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas Guitar Hero World Tour had Human and Losing Touch, Rock Band 2's got Mr. Right Side alongside with Smile Like You Mean It.

983
01:09:00,072 --> 01:09:01,593
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess both of them get day and age.

984
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:03,435
[SPEAKER_09]: The Killers are pretty cool.

985
01:09:03,535 --> 01:09:04,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve.

986
01:09:04,876 --> 01:09:07,217
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the songs I really like to sing in SingStar.

987
01:09:08,098 --> 01:09:11,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, SingStar is kind of an underrated karaoke game.

988
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:16,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It really does add to the party atmosphere to have the original videos playing in the background.

989
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:19,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, all things considered, the SingStore, I know I'm totally getting off track, but I don't care.

990
01:09:20,127 --> 01:09:21,428
[SPEAKER_09]: The SingStore works pretty well.

991
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:23,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually did play that game a little bit this week.

992
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:25,811
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually downloaded some of the stuff from SingStore.

993
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:33,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Paula Abdul Opposites Attract with the video and it's actually a duet and you can choose to sing Paula's part or MC Scat Cat.

994
01:09:34,465 --> 01:09:34,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

995
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:39,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to say that even though it has nothing to do with the killers but it made me think of that.

996
01:09:40,703 --> 01:09:43,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, back to Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

997
01:09:43,384 --> 01:09:45,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other download stuff coming out very soon.

998
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:49,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band is going to be getting the Dead Kennedys, a three-pack of Dead Kennedys songs.

999
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:53,428
[SPEAKER_09]: California Uber Al's, not Allies, but Al's.

1000
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:55,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Holiday in Cambodia, you know that song.

1001
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Police Truck coming out in a three-pack.

1002
01:09:58,331 --> 01:10:00,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Mission of Burma also getting a three-pack.

1003
01:10:00,932 --> 01:10:04,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Micah, That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate and That's When I Reached for My Revolver.

1004
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:05,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that song.

1005
01:10:06,774 --> 01:10:09,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Century Media Girls of Metal three-pack.

1006
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:12,676
[SPEAKER_09]: It's two songs from Lacuna Coil and one song from In This Moment.

1007
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:17,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one more individual song coming out this week from Crooked X, a song called Gone.

1008
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:22,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero, not to be outdone, is also releasing some songs this week.

1009
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:27,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Not quite as much, but they did land a pretty big-name artist, Jimi Hendrix.

1010
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:29,822
[SPEAKER_09]: A Hendrix track pack is out this week.

1011
01:10:29,962 --> 01:10:34,584
[SPEAKER_09]: If Six Was Nine, Little Wing, and Fire live from Woodstock.

1012
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:35,724
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty hot.

1013
01:10:37,355 --> 01:10:38,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So check those out.

1014
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,417
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either get something modern there in Rock Band or something.

1015
01:10:41,457 --> 01:10:49,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess it's not all modern, though, because some of those other songs were kind of like 80s punk, but pretty good diverse selection between the two games this week.

1016
01:10:50,886 --> 01:11:05,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Also to diversify your gaming week, DarkSakura is here to pick a game from the archives and dub it as her classic video game of the week because you kids need to respect your elder games and check out an old school game once in a while.

1017
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:16,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though DarkSakura has kind of had some newer choices as of late, like last week was Symphony of the Night and you can kind of play that on the newer consoles, tonight's pick, going back to the very, very old school, right DarkSakura?

1018
01:11:18,204 --> 01:11:19,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That it is.

1019
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:27,346
[SPEAKER_04]: The game of the week is Wizards and Warriors, which is the game that I played a shit ton of.

1020
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:28,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.

1021
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Wizards and Warriors.

1022
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:30,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take a listen.

1023
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:31,549
The map.

1024
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:32,029
The map.

1025
01:11:46,863 --> 01:11:50,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the music that it plays when you go inside one of the little rooms in the trees.

1026
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.

1027
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:58,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, tell us a little more about Wizards and Warriors.

1028
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:06,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Wizards and Warriors, you play as this dude named Kuros, who is wearing full plate armor, unlike the box.

1029
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,701
[SPEAKER_04]: where he's dressed up as Conan the Barbarian, go fig.

1030
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:15,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, 80's Nintendo artwork was awesome.

1031
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:16,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite my big toe.

1032
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:18,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn inaccurate bastards.

1033
01:12:20,325 --> 01:12:21,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Making men look like that.

1034
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:24,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so you start off in the forest.

1035
01:12:25,687 --> 01:12:29,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The forest is wonderful and beautiful and scary and deadly.

1036
01:12:29,688 --> 01:12:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Full of spiders and creatures and thingies.

1037
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can go inside trees.

1038
01:12:35,137 --> 01:12:58,059
[SPEAKER_04]: and the trees have doors and they make special noise every time you open the door and you get this cool music and suddenly the trees have like special things that you can jump on and spiders to kill so um um you basically are going through the game and you can get treasure chests that like if you find the ones with gems in it it says thou hast discovered gems

1039
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:00,136
[SPEAKER_09]: There it was right there.

1040
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:01,897
[SPEAKER_09]: That has discovered Dagger of Throwing.

1041
01:13:02,597 --> 01:13:05,578
[SPEAKER_09]: The Dagger of Throwing is so freaking useful.

1042
01:13:06,519 --> 01:13:07,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that game.

1043
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:08,900
[SPEAKER_09]: This game was awesome.

1044
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:15,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can also get potions and food as your healing items, weapons, and tools.

1045
01:13:16,223 --> 01:13:16,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1046
01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:24,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You have unlimited continues, and basically the only problem of dying is that your score gets reset to zero.

1047
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:30,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So the main guy has a sword or an axe and a shield.

1048
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in the sequel, you can actually choose to pick an element and then...

1049
01:13:42,572 --> 01:13:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Go through the game like that.

1050
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:49,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really going to talk too much about the other versions because they were inferior in comparison to the first one.

1051
01:13:52,215 --> 01:13:56,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, why couldn't they get him to look right on the cover?

1052
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:57,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for going back to that.

1053
01:13:57,877 --> 01:13:58,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still bothering me.

1054
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:04,459
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya wants to point out, don't forget the sequel, Iron Sword, that that box art actually had Fabio on it.

1055
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that.

1056
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But that also made the game slightly inferior.

1057
01:14:12,054 --> 01:14:15,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, but I mean really the game is very simple.

1058
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:26,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go through all the different stages and you have to, um, basically you have to keep unlocking, um, rescuing these women throughout the level until you rescue the princess.

1059
01:14:27,081 --> 01:14:28,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I always like to think of them as wenches.

1060
01:14:30,182 --> 01:14:31,763
[SPEAKER_04]: They were being held up by ropes.

1061
01:14:33,204 --> 01:14:38,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, now the thing, there is a trick with this game.

1062
01:14:39,864 --> 01:14:49,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And the big trick with this game is that if you go through the different levels and keep picking up however many, what was it?

1063
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:52,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the different keys you needed, wasn't it?

1064
01:14:54,514 --> 01:15:09,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually, if you go back into the second forest level, which is basically after you do the underground and come back up, there's actually a way to do a series of jumps to where you will jump over pretty much the screen divider back into the first level of forest.

1065
01:15:10,865 --> 01:15:12,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can play through the game again.

1066
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll actually beat the game halfway through the game.

1067
01:15:15,749 --> 01:15:17,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you'll just have all the number of items you need.

1068
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:21,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And the princess will just be left there going, uh, dude, where are you?

1069
01:15:22,614 --> 01:15:25,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So you actually don't have to fight the final boss to beat the game.

1070
01:15:25,496 --> 01:15:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just glitch the game out hardcore.

1071
01:15:29,818 --> 01:15:37,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad guy, Malkill, was also in an episode of Captain N, the Game Master.

1072
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:38,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking stupid show.

1073
01:15:39,385 --> 01:15:41,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the Nightmare on Mother Brain Street.

1074
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:42,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1075
01:15:44,691 --> 01:15:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: and the world, in the game it was called the Kingdom of Elrond, in the show it was called Excalibur for some reason.

1076
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just say something completely random?

1077
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:59,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm watching the video of this guy playing Wizards and Warriors, and the little beehives that the bees come out of look like poop.

1078
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they do.

1079
01:16:02,352 --> 01:16:03,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I call them shit bees.

1080
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:04,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1081
01:16:06,473 --> 01:16:14,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Kurose, the main guy, he was in a show called The Power Team, and they made him look like He-Man.

1082
01:16:16,175 --> 01:16:39,541
[SPEAKER_04]: But now this is one cool thing, and I wasn't quite aware of this, but the Wizards and Warriors story was turned into a book called Worlds of Power, a different series of novels for young children, and it was about a boy named Matthew who was trying to use his imagination creatively and instead brings his father's night figure to life and has to go help fight the battle.

1083
01:16:44,073 --> 01:16:45,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just the story.

1084
01:16:46,075 --> 01:16:46,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I love this game.

1085
01:16:47,176 --> 01:16:48,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate every other version after it.

1086
01:16:48,677 --> 01:16:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the end.

1087
01:16:51,299 --> 01:16:53,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Wizards and Warriors is your classic game of the week.

1088
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:56,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out if you happen to own a Nintendo.

1089
01:16:56,624 --> 01:16:57,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this music too.

1090
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.

1091
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Thou hast rescued... What was her name?

1092
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucinda, the distressed damsel.

1093
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:06,252
[SPEAKER_09]: 500 points.

1094
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:08,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And conveniently, she's wearing a bikini.

1095
01:17:08,934 --> 01:17:09,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew?

1096
01:17:09,595 --> 01:17:10,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she's a harem girl.

1097
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Wizards and Warriors is your classic game of the week.

1098
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:17,328
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to use this opportunity to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but we'll be right back.

1099
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:18,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go anywhere.

1100
01:17:18,949 --> 01:17:24,931
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have Aaron to bring on from the game Snake 360, which is coming out with the new Xbox experience this week.

1101
01:17:25,331 --> 01:17:34,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have your phone calls and the FUs of the week and some news about LittleBigPlanet and some other things coming up in Part B. So don't go anywhere, darn it.

1102
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:36,995
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1103
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:50,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, November the 16th of 2008.

1104
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:53,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry I'm laughing, which isn't going to make much sense to the podcast listeners.

1105
01:17:53,911 --> 01:18:05,235
[SPEAKER_09]: But during the breaks when we were taping this live on Sunday nights at allgames.com, we like to just play some music for about 10 minutes just to give ourselves a chance to rest, use the restroom, take a break, and our live listeners to do the same.

1106
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So we play some music from assorted video games.

1107
01:18:07,656 --> 01:18:13,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the music we was playing there during the break was Super Mario... Did I just say we was playing?

1108
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:14,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Bros.

1109
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:15,800
[SPEAKER_04]: We was out there playing.

1110
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,561
[SPEAKER_09]: We was playing something old school.

1111
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:19,983
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we were playing the theme music from Super Mario Bros.

1112
01:18:20,243 --> 01:18:19,983
2.

1113
01:18:20,603 --> 01:18:21,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can play a clip of it.

1114
01:18:21,644 --> 01:18:23,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Playing clips of songs is okay on podcasts.

1115
01:18:23,485 --> 01:18:24,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can't play the whole thing.

1116
01:18:24,586 --> 01:18:25,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the old school song?

1117
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkSakura comes in here and starts singing Dookie over all the lyrics.

1118
01:18:32,352 --> 01:18:34,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dookie.

1119
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:37,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So I started singing along too and then it went Dookie, Dookie, Dookie, Dook, Poop.

1120
01:18:39,116 --> 01:18:41,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we just started busting up because we're like five years old.

1121
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:42,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyway.

1122
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, let's get back to... And Frisbee says, dookie dookie panic.

1123
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:51,266
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a Mario Brothers 2 joke, isn't it?

1124
01:18:51,386 --> 01:18:52,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was a funny joke.

1125
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:54,467
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

1126
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:55,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1127
01:18:55,908 --> 01:19:02,071
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get back into some gaming news here during this Part B. You guys are going to call us a little later on with your phone calls and interview.

1128
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron Teplitsky is going to be joining us.

1129
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:05,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Snake360.

1130
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:07,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see the teasers at snake360.com.

1131
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:17,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the old school Snake from the cell phones, but like camera angles and color and multiplayer and goals and modes galore.

1132
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:18,956
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nuts.

1133
01:19:19,637 --> 01:19:21,437
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk all about it with Aaron here very soon.

1134
01:19:21,477 --> 01:19:23,157
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, some more gaming news.

1135
01:19:23,297 --> 01:19:23,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1136
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:29,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the recently released Banjo-Kazooie game, Nuts and Bolts, has...

1137
01:19:30,888 --> 01:19:36,013
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of a problem if you have an older TV, or an older TV that also happens to be very small.

1138
01:19:36,414 --> 01:19:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the in-game text is too small to see on some standard definition television sets.

1139
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:52,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And originally Rare had said that they weren't going to fix the problem, that it would be too expensive in terms of time, resources, and money to alter.

1140
01:19:54,226 --> 01:19:59,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The company has now gone back on that word and said that they will have a fix within the next 30 days.

1141
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:03,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Which just goes to show you if the internet bitches enough, it will get its way.

1142
01:20:03,653 --> 01:20:05,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it can't be that hard.

1143
01:20:05,254 --> 01:20:09,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, after all, Dead Rising had the same problem and the same fix.

1144
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So, come on guys.

1145
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:13,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, what, editing a font?

1146
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:14,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

1147
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:22,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine though, from the developer's perspective, getting these patches out there has got to be a pain in the ass.

1148
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:35,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But, to be fair though, all games that are published on the 360 are supposed to go through a process where they actually test them on a standard definition 14-inch TV.

1149
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:43,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And the text has to be readable on that, and it has to play well, look right, and all that sort of stuff.

1150
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:44,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So the...

1151
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:46,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

1152
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:16,548
[SPEAKER_09]: How this gets missed or approved, you know what I mean?

1153
01:21:17,548 --> 01:21:29,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, seeing that, in my memory, it's only been two games really so far that have had this issue, I think that the precautions and the steps are in place to make sure this doesn't happen.

1154
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:38,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that maybe they were trying to rush the game out to the market and didn't quite have time to go back and fix said problem with game.

1155
01:21:39,255 --> 01:21:40,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Until after the fact.

1156
01:21:40,476 --> 01:21:43,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And at first they said, oh, let's see if no one notices.

1157
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:45,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, sure enough, people noticed.

1158
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, ah, let's see if they're fine with us not fixing it.

1159
01:21:48,322 --> 01:21:49,402
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, people weren't.

1160
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:50,603
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they have to do it.

1161
01:21:51,884 --> 01:21:52,124
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1162
01:21:52,144 --> 01:21:56,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, speaking of Banjo-Kazooie, Loki has been able to hook us up with...

1163
01:21:57,694 --> 01:22:00,435
[SPEAKER_09]: This right here, I'm holding in my hot little hand on Justin TV.

1164
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:03,996
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys can see that there, if you're on the radio, you unfortunately cannot see it.

1165
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:13,300
[SPEAKER_09]: But what this is, this is a code for you to download the original Banjo-Kazooie game on Xbox Live absolutely free.

1166
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Free!

1167
01:22:14,621 --> 01:22:17,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to be giving that away next week on the show.

1168
01:22:18,045 --> 01:22:21,488
[SPEAKER_09]: A popular game is coming back that we haven't played here on the show in a long time.

1169
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:26,994
[SPEAKER_09]: One vs. the Chat Room is going to be played next week, and this code is going to be given away to a lucky winner.

1170
01:22:27,915 --> 01:22:33,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if you didn't pre-order the brand new Banjo-Kazooie game, you can still get your hot little hands on the old school one on Xbox Live.

1171
01:22:33,561 --> 01:22:34,382
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be giving that away.

1172
01:22:34,922 --> 01:22:35,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because we love ya!

1173
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:37,249
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1174
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,930
[SPEAKER_09]: So next week, be here for one versus the chat room.

1175
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:42,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, I'm sorry podcast listeners.

1176
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't work out that we can give one away to you guys this week.

1177
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:48,653
[SPEAKER_09]: But I promise the next contest we do will be open to all.

1178
01:22:49,053 --> 01:22:50,214
[SPEAKER_04]: That was satisfying, Rob.

1179
01:22:50,614 --> 01:22:50,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1180
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:51,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunting the chat room.

1181
01:22:51,554 --> 01:22:53,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting up and getting to wave that.

1182
01:22:53,395 --> 01:22:53,775
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1183
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so stay tuned for that.

1184
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Meantime, we're going to move on to the PlayStation 3 and talking about LittleBigPlanet.

1185
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:02,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, what a mess LittleBigPlanet has suddenly become.

1186
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:03,283
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1187
01:23:03,503 --> 01:23:04,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked about this game last week.

1188
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:05,723
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is awesome.

1189
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:11,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I still love this game, but it sounds like moderation is really starting to get a little crazy there.

1190
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:15,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony apparently has laid out some rules this week.

1191
01:23:16,046 --> 01:23:20,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Ensure the content you share with other users is suitable for all ages and everybody has access to your level if you publish it.

1192
01:23:21,388 --> 01:23:23,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Please respect other people's intellectual property rights.

1193
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:26,571
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, don't use images, brands, or logos that you're not entitled to use.

1194
01:23:26,952 --> 01:23:30,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you come across any content that you feel the need to report, then please do it responsibly.

1195
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:33,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Hoax reports will be considered inappropriate behavior.

1196
01:23:33,616 --> 01:23:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if this has made anything better for them to come out and clarify because apparently some really popular levels on LittleBigPlanet have been hit, including one called Azure Palace, which I haven't played myself, but apparently

1197
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:45,323
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

1198
01:23:45,343 --> 01:23:47,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it's a very, very popular level.

1199
01:23:47,465 --> 01:23:48,365
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the favorite.

1200
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It got hit for moderation this week, if you can believe it.

1201
01:23:51,468 --> 01:23:54,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And they can't figure out why this game got hit for moderation.

1202
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:58,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it the blood splatters they had in the level that apparently were?

1203
01:23:58,573 --> 01:23:59,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1204
01:24:00,294 --> 01:24:01,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets worse than that, actually.

1205
01:24:01,975 --> 01:24:03,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just that one.

1206
01:24:03,356 --> 01:24:08,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of the top levels have been hit with moderation, including the World of Color, which is another one.

1207
01:24:08,379 --> 01:24:11,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, there is nothing copyright in World of Color.

1208
01:24:11,021 --> 01:24:11,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get that.

1209
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:12,622
[SPEAKER_09]: That is weird.

1210
01:24:12,823 --> 01:24:15,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the level creator of Azure Palace is pissed.

1211
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:17,386
[SPEAKER_09]: He made a comment, So, needless to say, uh...

1212
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:59,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoever is pulling these levels, Sony, Medium Molecule, whoever, I imagine it's Sony, whoever is pulling these levels is starting to bite the hand that feeds them a little bit because if you piss off all the people that are creating the great content for your game, there's not going to be much left but those, you know, win nine trophies in 30 second levels which get old fast.

1213
01:25:00,852 --> 01:25:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really sad, though, because lots of levels are getting moderated.

1214
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:07,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Some, you know, maybe they're kind of borderline.

1215
01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:11,099
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like that Tetris level that was sort of like Tetris, but not quite.

1216
01:25:11,499 --> 01:25:12,480
[SPEAKER_07]: That got moderated.

1217
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,681
[SPEAKER_07]: That level was a lot of fun.

1218
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bunch of other ones, but there's seriously a ton of threads on LittleBigWorkshop, the official website for LittleBigPlanet and stuff.

1219
01:25:24,407 --> 01:25:24,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1220
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:27,128
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, tons of stuff.

1221
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:33,334
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a 22 page post on there that's just going.

1222
01:25:33,874 --> 01:25:35,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and some of the things, like some of the comments.

1223
01:25:37,168 --> 01:25:47,975
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a minigame actually in LittleBigPlanet in the Frozen Tundra world called Spline Rider where you get on a thin sled and slide around on a track.

1224
01:25:48,836 --> 01:25:52,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems kind of familiar to a popular online game called Line Rider.

1225
01:25:52,978 --> 01:25:59,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's okay for Media Monocle to go ahead and rip off other games but it's not okay for other people to do that.

1226
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:05,215
[SPEAKER_09]: and they actually have... And it's okay for them to have a strip club in the game, but heaven forbid you see a blood splatter.

1227
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: You know those blood splatters?

1228
01:26:06,555 --> 01:26:08,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are actually taken from the game.

1229
01:26:08,256 --> 01:26:14,398
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in one of the Asian levels in there where there's blood splatters underneath these blades that are there.

1230
01:26:14,798 --> 01:26:16,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's stuff that's in the game.

1231
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:18,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

1232
01:26:19,336 --> 01:26:20,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1233
01:26:36,894 --> 01:26:37,514
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to be left?

1234
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:08,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1235
01:27:26,095 --> 01:27:29,639
[SPEAKER_07]: then you can still make a copy of the original level again and re-upload it if you need to.

1236
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, if you want, one good thing if you think someone's going to kick your level offline, make it so that they can download a copy of your level as well.

1237
01:27:37,328 --> 01:27:43,555
[SPEAKER_07]: You have that option on there so someone can actually save it, even put it in your comments to make sure you save the level when you're done.

1238
01:27:43,835 --> 01:27:46,558
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually save it to your moon and then it doesn't matter if it gets moderated.

1239
01:27:47,158 --> 01:28:09,089
[SPEAKER_09]: and if anyone from Sony or Media Molecule happens to listen to this show because we do have some industry people that listen to this show but kind of keep quiet and they don't really let us know they're listening if anybody from either of those companies happens to listen to this show it is imperative you guys comment on the situation like this week I mean you can't let this keep going on much longer it is starting to snowball out of control it is imperative you get your legal department on the ball and say something quick

1240
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:13,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing too is because people aren't saying anything, people are thinking the worst.

1241
01:28:14,114 --> 01:28:19,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, are they going to steal my levels and use them in a download pack or something they're going to charge money for?

1242
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:20,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, why are they doing this?

1243
01:28:22,805 --> 01:28:23,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just ridiculous.

1244
01:28:24,345 --> 01:28:33,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing that's really ridiculous about it is, say you work 20 hours on a level and upload it and stuff like that, and they moderate it for some retarded reason, you can't re-upload it again.

1245
01:28:34,068 --> 01:28:38,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't really make a copy of it or do whatever with it.

1246
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:42,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I seem to remember this comparison being made in the past, but GS68 makes it again tonight.

1247
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:46,812
[SPEAKER_09]: See, Blastworks has levels with copyrighted imagery, yet their staff doesn't mind that shit.

1248
01:28:47,992 --> 01:28:49,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And nobody sued Blastworks yet.

1249
01:28:50,646 --> 01:28:51,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very interesting.

1250
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:55,869
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says, this could probably spark a global boycott of the game if they don't fix it.

1251
01:28:56,669 --> 01:29:02,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know so much about that because I think a lot of people that were going to... The games have already all been sold a lot of times.

1252
01:29:02,552 --> 01:29:03,212
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1253
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:05,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people that were really eager about the game have already bought it.

1254
01:29:05,753 --> 01:29:06,914
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR kind of follows up with that.

1255
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Global boycott will never happen.

1256
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:11,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as likely to happen as an internet petition meaning something.

1257
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:12,548
[SPEAKER_07]: The FUs of the Week

1258
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:50,270
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura wants to start us off tonight.

1259
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:56,956
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to apathetic voters, as in people who don't vote.

1260
01:29:58,617 --> 01:30:05,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, there's people, well, actually, specifically, the people who complain about an issue and don't vote on it.

1261
01:30:06,403 --> 01:30:15,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you, if it doesn't mean enough to you to go out and make your voice heard, you know, at least by giving your vote to the issue, then you have no right to complain.

1262
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:22,143
[SPEAKER_09]: But like if somebody just abstains from voting for a school board member because they don't know anything about them.

1263
01:30:22,203 --> 01:30:23,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about big issues.

1264
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:25,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm just saying though.

1265
01:30:26,847 --> 01:30:32,011
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's something that's really not going to affect everything from day to day, that's one thing.

1266
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:34,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's something like, oh, example, a civil rights issue.

1267
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, Alameda County.

1268
01:30:37,856 --> 01:30:41,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, only 22% of them voted.

1269
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1270
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy asses.

1271
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:52,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But just make sure if it means something to you that instead of just bitching about it, you do something about it.

1272
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:54,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

1273
01:30:55,777 --> 01:31:02,561
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my place of employment for still not giving me a raise and for potentially making my job even harder.

1274
01:31:02,902 --> 01:31:07,965
[SPEAKER_07]: My coworker is quitting here within the next couple weeks and

1275
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:34,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately they're going to probably hire someone else to fill his spot and I'm going to get probably some of his bigger accounts and they're planning on giving me yet another really big account and it's just more work for me to do with no sort of compensation for it and it kind of sucks but their mentality is you don't like it, leave and unfortunately I've been there for almost 10 years and I would rather

1276
01:31:35,726 --> 01:31:53,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I really just want to give an F you tonight to Noah's Bagels and their bagel dogs because they're so delicious and I can't stop eating them, especially now that, you know, after the gallbladders come out and my health is starting to get back to normal, thank God.

1277
01:31:54,898 --> 01:31:57,940
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to those things for being so damn yummy and I know they're not good for you.

1278
01:32:00,839 --> 01:32:06,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry that my FU is a little more silly compared to some of the others tonight, but sometimes it's the little things.

1279
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:10,969
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

1280
01:32:11,069 --> 01:32:11,889
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1281
01:32:14,092 --> 01:32:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic number is five.

1282
01:32:16,194 --> 01:32:16,934
[SPEAKER_09]: What magic number?

1283
01:32:17,134 --> 01:32:17,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1284
01:32:17,655 --> 01:32:18,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought three was a magic number.

1285
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:20,918
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they told me on Schoolhouse Rock.

1286
01:32:21,378 --> 01:32:20,918
42.

1287
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:22,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

1288
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:25,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, who's been looking forward to LocoRoco 2?

1289
01:32:28,363 --> 01:32:30,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I never really got into LocoRoco1, but I'd check it out.

1290
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I would check it out.

1291
01:32:31,489 --> 01:32:32,772
[SPEAKER_04]: LocoRoco is crack!

1292
01:32:34,295 --> 01:32:35,978
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate... Yes, ma'am.

1293
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:47,431
[SPEAKER_04]: On the online portal for the LocoRoco 2 site, there is actually a Flash minigame that you can play.

1294
01:32:47,491 --> 01:32:58,080
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over on Spill Games' website, and it will be there until the 21st of November, so try it while you can, and download it while you can.

1295
01:32:58,881 --> 01:33:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?

1296
01:33:00,782 --> 01:33:02,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will be linking the...

1297
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:30,869
[SPEAKER_04]: the site in the chat room however to go ahead and say this on the podcast it is at games.co.uk slash game slash loco roco 2.html so give it a try it's cute alrighty it's the cuteness there's some people are calling it in chat Loki Roco it's not Loki Roco

1298
01:33:31,971 --> 01:33:32,611
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cute name.

1299
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:33,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki Roko.

1300
01:33:34,112 --> 01:33:35,612
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we'll start calling him on this program.

1301
01:33:35,792 --> 01:33:36,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

1302
01:33:36,693 --> 01:33:37,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki Roko.

1303
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:44,076
[SPEAKER_07]: This rumor's been around before, but now it's coming into yet another venue, I guess.

1304
01:33:45,716 --> 01:33:52,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Electronic Gaming Monthly, their usual quarterman segment of different rumors and speculations.

1305
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:57,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he now has a rumor saying that LittleBigPlanet will be coming to the PSP in 2009.

1306
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:04,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it makes sense that they'll do that, and I think with actually the controls, it could work.

1307
01:34:04,842 --> 01:34:06,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You could easily do that on there.

1308
01:34:06,903 --> 01:34:13,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how it'd look, because the PSP obviously is not as powerful as, I don't know, the PlayStation 3.

1309
01:34:14,745 --> 01:34:16,706
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not being developed by Media Molecule, right?

1310
01:34:17,506 --> 01:34:17,666
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1311
01:34:19,026 --> 01:34:21,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems that they are actually at the...

1312
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:23,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right.

1313
01:34:23,683 --> 01:34:24,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't have them.

1314
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:28,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead it's Sony Studio Liverpool.

1315
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:34,036
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked Media Molecule for comment and what they said is that they were going to moderate this game for being too similar to their own.

1316
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:36,059
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a bummer.

1317
01:34:37,901 --> 01:34:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, I am Spartacus.

1318
01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:44,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1319
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:45,001
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1320
01:34:46,242 --> 01:34:51,486
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's no surprise, though, that they're going to hoard this franchise out into the ground, that there's a PSP version coming out.

1321
01:34:51,746 --> 01:35:04,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It might actually be pretty cool, especially if, wait for this, especially if the levels you get, assuming this whole moderation thing gets figured out, if you could get the levels on your PS3 and transfer them to your PSP, that might be pretty awesome, actually.

1322
01:35:04,915 --> 01:35:05,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you think?

1323
01:35:07,465 --> 01:35:07,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1324
01:35:08,385 --> 01:35:09,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it'd look right.

1325
01:35:10,587 --> 01:35:12,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the proportions and everything?

1326
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:16,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine that they'd be able to do the same kind of quality on the PSP.

1327
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:18,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be scaled down quite a bit.

1328
01:35:19,973 --> 01:35:20,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see.

1329
01:35:20,493 --> 01:35:21,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you guys.

1330
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:22,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds pretty interesting to me.

1331
01:35:22,674 --> 01:35:25,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, damn, the news will not just stop coming in about Burnout Paradise.

1332
01:35:25,896 --> 01:35:26,217
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

1333
01:35:26,397 --> 01:35:29,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Just last week we were talking about the awesome old school cars that were going to be in the game.

1334
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:35,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, apparently, toy cars are coming to Burnout Paradise.

1335
01:35:35,502 --> 01:35:35,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...

1336
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:39,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Criterion, they're really awesome about this.

1337
01:35:39,286 --> 01:35:41,648
[SPEAKER_09]: They're showing you how to keep the game alive.

1338
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:42,288
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

1339
01:35:42,668 --> 01:35:47,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now apparently they are going to be introducing tiny little collectible cars.

1340
01:35:47,852 --> 01:35:53,056
[SPEAKER_09]: No idea if the cars themselves will be tiny in the game, but they all look like little Hot Wheels and they're pretty awesome.

1341
01:35:53,376 --> 01:35:55,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there's nine cars in all.

1342
01:35:55,117 --> 01:36:02,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Carson GT Concept P12, Krieger Racing WTR, Hunter Takedown 4x4 and Hunter Manhattan, so on and so on.

1343
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:05,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they're all going to come out next year and...

1344
01:36:06,365 --> 01:36:06,945
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1345
01:36:07,366 --> 01:36:08,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Criterion just keeps supporting this game.

1346
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:10,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the monster truck.

1347
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:10,867
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be awesome.

1348
01:36:10,907 --> 01:36:12,428
[SPEAKER_09]: This little purple one with flames on it.

1349
01:36:12,888 --> 01:36:14,189
[SPEAKER_09]: They're putting hot wheels in the game.

1350
01:36:15,029 --> 01:36:15,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for them.

1351
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:20,312
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny if you could actually drive the little cars around and they act like big cars.

1352
01:36:20,812 --> 01:36:23,674
[SPEAKER_07]: You can smash through things and just pow, pow, pow.

1353
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:24,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Power wheels, pow, pow.

1354
01:36:24,915 --> 01:36:25,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, forget it.

1355
01:36:26,776 --> 01:36:30,497
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a preschooler driving a car around would be pretty awesome, don't you think?

1356
01:36:30,698 --> 01:36:30,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1357
01:36:31,894 --> 01:36:32,954
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1358
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:06,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 21 year old and leads a raiding guild and the character is called Nim.

1359
01:37:07,223 --> 01:37:08,063
[SPEAKER_04]: N-Y-M-H.

1360
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:15,926
[SPEAKER_04]: 27 hours worth of leveling and being kept alive by a healer.

1361
01:37:16,046 --> 01:37:20,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nim got all the experience and made it to 80.

1362
01:37:22,247 --> 01:37:23,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently...

1363
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:36,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The one right after was someone called Darius who was suspended by Blizzard at level 79 and bumped back to level 70 after using an exploit.

1364
01:37:37,546 --> 01:37:38,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, snap.

1365
01:37:39,463 --> 01:37:45,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know what the exploit was.

1366
01:37:45,205 --> 01:37:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Grinding.

1367
01:37:45,705 --> 01:37:46,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1368
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Grinding in a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area.

1369
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:50,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a second.

1370
01:37:50,827 --> 01:37:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Grinding is not an exploit.

1371
01:37:53,468 --> 01:37:54,929
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he didn't get banned either.

1372
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:58,210
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Darius got banned.

1373
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:00,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Or rolled back or whatever you want to call it.

1374
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what that exploit was.

1375
01:38:02,332 --> 01:38:03,212
[SPEAKER_04]: He got wall-marted.

1376
01:38:04,673 --> 01:38:05,394
[SPEAKER_09]: He got moderated.

1377
01:38:05,574 --> 01:38:06,375
[SPEAKER_09]: He got Walmarted.

1378
01:38:07,055 --> 01:38:07,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Moderate!

1379
01:38:07,856 --> 01:38:12,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what makes this so notable is that, you know, it's supposed to take you, like, a month to get to 80.

1380
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:15,523
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the game came out, what, Wednesday night?

1381
01:38:15,943 --> 01:38:19,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm level 73, and I've been playing pretty hardcore.

1382
01:38:19,346 --> 01:38:22,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people in my guild are only, like, 71, maybe 72.

1383
01:38:22,889 --> 01:38:30,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently this place that he was grinding at has a really high respawn rate, and monsters are neutral monsters.

1384
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

1385
01:38:33,731 --> 01:38:35,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crypt in the Grizzly Hills area.

1386
01:38:35,913 --> 01:38:38,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Go spam it, everybody, and crash the server!

1387
01:38:39,156 --> 01:38:42,598
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of level one boars there, and he just kept killing them.

1388
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Solid Goomba comments and says, Mom!

1389
01:38:46,602 --> 01:38:46,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Bathroom!

1390
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:50,850
[SPEAKER_09]: which must have been exactly what happened here with this guy.

1391
01:38:51,291 --> 01:39:02,318
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you know, despite all the fun being made of this guy, the thing that he did that the rest of the people aren't doing, they obviously found this area in the beta, figured it would be a good area to go to.

1392
01:39:02,378 --> 01:39:05,120
[SPEAKER_09]: When the game hit, they went straight to this area.

1393
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:14,086
[SPEAKER_09]: This was their sole intention, to gain XP as fast as possible, and with a Warlock of a certain spec, it's pretty easy to do if you have a dedicated healer, and did nothing but level.

1394
01:39:14,346 --> 01:39:15,247
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1395
01:39:35,933 --> 01:39:36,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1396
01:40:03,408 --> 01:40:14,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, you know I've been playing Wrath of the Lich King quite a lot this week, but something that might actually be able to divert my attention away from Warcraft this next week is the release of the new Xbox Experience.

1397
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,984
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing we've been talking about a lot on this show is the addition of community games to the Xbox dashboard.

1398
01:40:20,584 --> 01:40:22,106
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the games that is going to be coming...

1399
01:40:22,706 --> 01:40:33,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Out is called Snake360, and it has an interesting tie-in to music-based video games, which we've been talking about a lot on this show, you know, previously in our history and anything.

1400
01:40:34,051 --> 01:40:39,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, to join us on the show tonight to talk about Snake360 is its creator, Aaron Teplitsky.

1401
01:40:39,853 --> 01:40:46,055
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get on the phones and get a hold of Aaron and talk to him a little bit about his new game, Snake360.

1402
01:40:46,455 --> 01:40:47,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, Aaron, are you there?

1403
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:49,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm right here.

1404
01:40:50,018 --> 01:40:51,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well welcome to the show.

1405
01:40:51,539 --> 01:40:54,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for taking the time to be on Orange Lounge Radio this evening.

1406
01:40:54,141 --> 01:40:55,222
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing this Sunday night?

1407
01:40:56,463 --> 01:40:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing great.

1408
01:40:57,184 --> 01:40:58,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for having me on here.

1409
01:40:58,826 --> 01:40:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.

1410
01:41:00,027 --> 01:41:00,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome, not a problem.

1411
01:41:01,028 --> 01:41:04,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're all about, you know, the independent games as well as the big boys.

1412
01:41:04,671 --> 01:41:08,995
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell us, your game is Snake 360, coming to the new Xbox 360 experience.

1413
01:41:09,255 --> 01:41:10,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about Snake 360.

1414
01:41:11,117 --> 01:41:12,058
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this game all about?

1415
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, basically what it is, it's similar to, you know, Snake games that you've probably seen before on cell phones, old computers, and whatnot.

1416
01:41:20,255 --> 01:41:22,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it is is a complete reimagining.

1417
01:41:22,756 --> 01:41:30,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Graphically, you know, it's got 3D graphics, it runs nice and smooth, and, you know, it has a very clean look.

1418
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little boxy, but, you know, that's the way Snake is.

1419
01:41:34,683 --> 01:41:39,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, you know, it's not...

1420
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to get a huge graphical masterpiece.

1421
01:41:43,261 --> 01:41:44,742
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for that, then you'll play Gears 2.

1422
01:41:45,523 --> 01:41:49,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it lacks in graphics, it definitely makes up for in the gameplay department.

1423
01:41:49,765 --> 01:41:53,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got classic gameplay and a whole wide range of levels.

1424
01:41:53,967 --> 01:41:55,668
[SPEAKER_03]: They start ridiculously easy.

1425
01:41:55,688 --> 01:41:57,249
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your four walls, and that's it.

1426
01:41:57,788 --> 01:42:00,310
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it goes up to insanely difficult.

1427
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:10,456
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like retro games, arcade games, just challenging games in general, you're going to get a lot of mileage out of Snake360, especially seeing as how it's got internet-based leaderboards.

1428
01:42:10,976 --> 01:42:17,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think you're selling yourself a little bit short on the graphical ability of the game because, you know, sure, we all know the game Snake on cell phones.

1429
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:24,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, a blocky game where you kind of go, but I noticed in watching the trailer on your website, Snake360.com, you kind of do all these little

1430
01:42:24,884 --> 01:42:29,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Well you know, what I try and do is I throw in the instant replays and the

1431
01:42:43,652 --> 01:42:50,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Camera effects from the different angles and part of it is functionality related because sometimes you want to view the whole level.

1432
01:42:51,099 --> 01:42:56,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you want a view of just you so you can line up better, get a view of your surroundings.

1433
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:59,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want to zoom in, maybe you want to zoom out.

1434
01:42:59,286 --> 01:43:01,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of it is just functionality related.

1435
01:43:01,528 --> 01:43:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: But also we've come to expect a lot of these things in games.

1436
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:19,308
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're in battle mode and you just cut the other guy off and surprise the heck out of him and everybody in the room is screaming and yelling you're going to want to watch that over and over and over again to rub it in his face so you've got the instant replay for that reason

1437
01:43:20,788 --> 01:43:21,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds great.

1438
01:43:21,248 --> 01:43:24,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, I don't want to talk just about graphics.

1439
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:34,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about music for a minute, because even though this game has nothing to do with arrow stomping or beat matching, I hear there's a connection in here for fans of dance music games, which we have a lot of at Orange Lounge.

1440
01:43:34,897 --> 01:43:35,578
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the connection?

1441
01:43:35,598 --> 01:43:47,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, actually, it turns out I was looking for music, and I'm no musician, so I went to Kyle Ward and John Mendenhall and their record label, SCI Recordings.

1442
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:49,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Their website right now is SCIREcordings.com.

1443
01:43:50,763 --> 01:44:15,912
[SPEAKER_03]: and we struck a little bit of a deal and as it turns out players of the In The Groove series of games and also the more recent Pump Pro are going to find that they're familiar with a lot of the music in the game and we fleshed it out with some music that they won't be familiar with and in total there are nine of their songs in the game and I think that the players are going to really enjoy the soundtrack it's you know pumping you know get your blood moving and

1444
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe cause you not to crash into a wall, I don't know.

1445
01:44:33,557 --> 01:44:39,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I'm really fond of the soundtrack, and I've been listening to it for months straight, working on the game, and I'm not sick of it yet.

1446
01:44:39,263 --> 01:44:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that probably says that it might actually be working for the game.

1447
01:44:43,888 --> 01:44:45,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So you mentioned you've been working on the game for months.

1448
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:51,056
[SPEAKER_09]: How long did things take from idea to where we are, the game's launching November 19th?

1449
01:44:52,771 --> 01:44:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll be quite honest with you.

1450
01:44:54,352 --> 01:44:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout 2007, I was thinking about this game constantly.

1451
01:44:58,896 --> 01:45:04,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working this little IT job for a non-profit, which is completely not the field that I want to be working in.

1452
01:45:05,161 --> 01:45:07,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And just driving from place to place, I'd be thinking about it.

1453
01:45:07,923 --> 01:45:12,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be thinking, well, this is how I want this to work, and this is how I imagine this.

1454
01:45:12,927 --> 01:45:19,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And towards the end of the year, with X and A out, I just said, well, why don't I take a stab at this?

1455
01:45:19,634 --> 01:45:49,121
[SPEAKER_03]: and my original intent was to target Xbox Live Arcade and I actually submitted to them and it took them a long time to get back to me I don't know what happened with that but in the time between the time I submitted to them and the time they gave me the final answer they announced community games so I'm thinking yeah hey that's not a bad idea and then finally they came back and they said well we have limited space for casual action games on Xbox Live Arcade so we feel it's not a good fit at this time

1456
01:45:49,778 --> 01:45:51,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, well, you know, community games.

1457
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was back in March.

1458
01:45:54,402 --> 01:45:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting in March, I started working on it, you know, more frequently.

1459
01:45:58,846 --> 01:46:02,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually started, completely started last December.

1460
01:46:03,389 --> 01:46:08,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I just, you know, started from scratch with XNA and, you know, got a snake moving on the screen and whatnot.

1461
01:46:09,434 --> 01:46:11,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I really took it into high gear in August.

1462
01:46:12,076 --> 01:46:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really started about a year ago, but I'd say, you know, solid work is probably about seven months of work

1463
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: All my spare time went into this game.

1464
01:46:22,177 --> 01:46:24,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that was a long, convoluted answer, but yeah.

1465
01:46:24,738 --> 01:46:25,999
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's all right.

1466
01:46:26,339 --> 01:46:32,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very interesting to kind of hear that you actually had submitted it originally as an Xbox Live arcade game, but yet they turned it down.

1467
01:46:32,423 --> 01:46:37,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you look at some of the stuff that's on Xbox Live Marketplace that they let through... Well, you know what?

1468
01:46:37,106 --> 01:46:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting you say that, because I'm not the only one who's been turned down.

1469
01:46:40,829 --> 01:46:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard of the Japanese shoot-'em-up developer, Cave?

1470
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:45,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have, yes.

1471
01:46:47,546 --> 01:46:56,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I was absolutely floored when I found out that they submitted two of their games to Live Arcade and they were turned down because I absolutely adore their games.

1472
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:01,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Japanese PS2 that I basically play shoot-em-ups on.

1473
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:08,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm planning on getting a Japanese 360 so I can play the upcoming Cave Shooters if they're not localized here.

1474
01:47:10,334 --> 01:47:11,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I was absolutely floored.

1475
01:47:11,955 --> 01:47:13,635
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, I felt, well, you know what?

1476
01:47:13,675 --> 01:47:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're being rejected, then maybe I don't feel so bad.

1477
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:17,757
[SPEAKER_09]: At least you're in good company.

1478
01:47:17,837 --> 01:47:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, talking about the development cycle of the game, you know, a lot of folks kind of, you know, are critical of the Xbox 360 control scheme.

1479
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:33,442
[SPEAKER_09]: But you kind of found an interesting way around it for a game that requires kind of precision in turning like Snake does, right?

1480
01:47:33,882 --> 01:47:38,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, everybody knows that the 360's D-pad leaves a lot to be desired.

1481
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:48,059
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first things I did when I started playing XBLA games was I went and I bought an arcade stick because even for Pac-Man, you know, it just gums up the works.

1482
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:49,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't play Pac-Man with that D-pad.

1483
01:47:50,680 --> 01:48:05,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So at first, you know, I was thinking, well, you know, we can use the analog sticks and you've got those options, but really the best solution, and I say so in the trailer, not in the trailer, I say so in the other video I put up, I say so in the documentation, and I say so within the game itself.

1484
01:48:06,178 --> 01:48:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: The best solution is to use the A, B, X, and Y face buttons.

1485
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,561
[SPEAKER_03]: A is down, Y is up, and then you've got X and B for the sides.

1486
01:48:12,701 --> 01:48:15,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is absolutely the best way to control this game.

1487
01:48:16,383 --> 01:48:16,863
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1488
01:48:17,303 --> 01:48:18,904
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a very creative workaround.

1489
01:48:18,964 --> 01:48:20,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's probably what I'll use.

1490
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:22,265
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we weren't using those buttons for anything else.

1491
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:26,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I was thinking, well, you know, we could do turbo boosts, we could do this and that.

1492
01:48:27,088 --> 01:48:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, I decided for this version, because I might expand it later, especially considering that

1493
01:48:32,492 --> 01:48:36,733
[SPEAKER_03]: The version I'm releasing is not the version I originally anticipated.

1494
01:48:36,753 --> 01:48:38,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't quite get everything that I wanted in there.

1495
01:48:39,674 --> 01:48:43,435
[SPEAKER_03]: But for this version, I decided, let's keep the accessibility high.

1496
01:48:44,836 --> 01:48:50,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep the gameplay simple so that you look at it, you know exactly how it works, you can jump right in.

1497
01:48:51,278 --> 01:48:58,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The challenge of this game is not in new gameplay elements, but it's in the challenging level designs and all the other things you can do with it.

1498
01:48:59,042 --> 01:49:00,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it works extremely similarly to the way that, uh,

1499
01:49:28,886 --> 01:49:33,987
[SPEAKER_03]: any internet ranking board work before we had online leaderboards that were integrated into the game itself.

1500
01:49:34,667 --> 01:49:44,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who played Ikaruga on GameCube and participated in the rankings there, there are also rankings in a lot of arcade games where they basically just put codes on the screen.

1501
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:49,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go to their website, you put in the code, yeah, you put in the code and boom, there you are on the internet rankings.

1502
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:54,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have it keep track of your email address so that if you submit the same score twice,

1503
01:49:55,039 --> 01:50:01,485
[SPEAKER_03]: or if you submit two scores for one course, it'll automatically overwrite your lower score with your higher one.

1504
01:50:02,006 --> 01:50:11,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason there are over 50 leaderboards is because there's going to be a leaderboard for every course, every difficulty, every round you can play in survival mode.

1505
01:50:11,734 --> 01:50:14,357
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go crazy competing for high scores in this game.

1506
01:50:15,598 --> 01:50:17,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still finishing up the internet ranking.

1507
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:20,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It should hopefully be ready by the end of next week.

1508
01:50:20,549 --> 01:50:20,809
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1509
01:50:21,149 --> 01:50:24,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you mentioned there's all these different types of internet ranking boards.

1510
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:28,613
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because you have all these different types of modes and handicaps in the game.

1511
01:50:28,653 --> 01:50:35,676
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like you've made this very accessible for children as well as, you know, hardcore people that really get into these types of arcade games.

1512
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:38,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about some of your favorite modes that you have in the game.

1513
01:50:38,578 --> 01:50:43,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, the main game mode basically throws you into a course consisting of eight levels.

1514
01:50:44,335 --> 01:51:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually it may or may not consist of eight levels depending on whether you lose any lives along the way and I'll leave it at that but if you can complete all the levels on the course you'll get a code for internet ranking and the courses are played on several different difficulty levels what you'll get is you know basically this kind of the same concept

1515
01:51:04,673 --> 01:51:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, on easy, maybe you'll get something that kind of looks like a tree.

1516
01:51:08,135 --> 01:51:09,416
[SPEAKER_03]: On normal, you'll get a tree.

1517
01:51:09,716 --> 01:51:12,698
[SPEAKER_03]: On difficult, you'll get a tree with more branches, that kind of thing.

1518
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:18,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll take the same concept, and we'll just keep making it more and more difficult as you go up in level.

1519
01:51:19,183 --> 01:51:25,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, a lot of the level themes are very interesting, and part of the fun of the game is to see, oh, well, now I'm playing on a new level.

1520
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:27,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what this level's going to look like.

1521
01:51:27,908 --> 01:51:31,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And the survival mode, well, that's just, you know, classic.

1522
01:51:31,631 --> 01:51:33,472
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the old Snake games just played like that.

1523
01:51:34,212 --> 01:52:03,838
[SPEAKER_03]: you get one life and you just last as long as you can and you grow to ridiculous lengths and this version throws in a time limit that you can't just go in a circle and survive forever and you get a time bonus when you pick up a target but you're just going to have to be really careful not to block yourself off from more targets or trap yourself it's very interesting and one of the fake achievements I'm going to call them goals in the game is to last in there for four minutes and it's harder than it sounds

1524
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:06,196
[SPEAKER_09]: What about some of the things you've put?

1525
01:52:06,236 --> 01:52:12,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is something for a player who's really, really good at the game, but what about somebody who's not so great at Snake 360?

1526
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:16,424
[SPEAKER_09]: There's kind of modes you've put in for them, too, right?

1527
01:52:17,444 --> 01:52:18,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, you know what?

1528
01:52:18,665 --> 01:52:23,749
[SPEAKER_03]: My mother's even played this game using a couple of handicaps that I've put in.

1529
01:52:23,949 --> 01:52:25,210
[SPEAKER_03]: There's slower speeds.

1530
01:52:25,410 --> 01:52:30,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn the Snake speed down to slow or even slowest, which is half the normal speed.

1531
01:52:31,586 --> 01:52:33,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It plays pretty slowly.

1532
01:52:33,468 --> 01:52:48,041
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got good reflexes, you'll want to stick with the normal or the faster speeds, but there's a slow speed for them, and there's also visual guides that you can turn on in the form of lines that extend from the targets in all four directions, so you can line up more easily with those.

1533
01:52:49,042 --> 01:52:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you play with those on, then you won't be eligible for the Internet ranking, but it's something that'll get a lot more people into the game, making it easier to

1534
01:52:57,574 --> 01:52:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing.

1535
01:52:58,414 --> 01:53:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also something exciting I threw in called Kid Mode.

1536
01:53:01,975 --> 01:53:03,716
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this, you know, anybody can play.

1537
01:53:03,796 --> 01:53:05,496
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like bumper bowling for Snake.

1538
01:53:06,096 --> 01:53:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you know, you're rushing into a wall.

1539
01:53:08,197 --> 01:53:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.

1540
01:53:09,137 --> 01:53:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing happens.

1541
01:53:10,558 --> 01:53:12,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're stuck on the wall.

1542
01:53:12,698 --> 01:53:15,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, now you have three seconds to turn and go somewhere else.

1543
01:53:16,537 --> 01:53:24,627
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically the effect of this is you won't die unless you trap yourself somehow, spiral, you know, that sort of deal.

1544
01:53:25,148 --> 01:53:28,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could just, you know, go there all day and then the easy difficulty has no time limit.

1545
01:53:29,313 --> 01:53:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could spend three hours, you know, on one level and take as much time as you need so long as you don't trap yourself.

1546
01:53:36,497 --> 01:53:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sounds like there's something for the young and the old alike in this game, so awesome.

1547
01:53:42,762 --> 01:53:50,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and if you're not sure whether you're young or old, if you start playing and then the game sees you're having trouble, it'll offer to turn one of these handicaps on for you.

1548
01:53:50,683 --> 01:53:51,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

1549
01:53:51,464 --> 01:53:51,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1550
01:53:51,884 --> 01:53:52,204
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1551
01:53:52,284 --> 01:53:52,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

1552
01:53:53,485 --> 01:53:56,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about kind of the bigger picture for a minute, just community games in general.

1553
01:53:57,608 --> 01:54:02,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of not just your game, but all the other games kind of going in when the new Xbox Experience launches.

1554
01:54:02,231 --> 01:54:07,694
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we've heard kind of leading up to this launch, we've heard a lot about Netflix, we've heard a lot about avatars.

1555
01:54:08,094 --> 01:54:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me...

1556
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:14,799
[SPEAKER_09]: for as big of a deal as at least I perceive this community games thing to be where we have a lot of great indie developers showing up.

1557
01:54:15,299 --> 01:54:21,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not hearing as much about it as you would think, you know, with all these, what, 20 games on the service right now.

1558
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kind of surprised that there's been a little less focus on community games leading up towards the launch?

1559
01:54:26,807 --> 01:54:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on one hand I am, but on the other hand I'm really not because, you know, let's say I'm EA or Activision or some other big name publisher and I've got $60 games on the shelf from launching a new IP like Mirror's Edge and, um,

1560
01:54:39,454 --> 01:54:46,095
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of a sudden, Microsoft is promoting the heck out of all these little five and ten and two and a half dollar games.

1561
01:54:46,736 --> 01:54:49,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to be a little bit, you know, pissed off.

1562
01:54:49,096 --> 01:54:58,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be like, hey, hi, we want to keep selling our $60 games, so you guys better lay off and delay this to next year or we're going to stop publishing on your console.

1563
01:54:59,818 --> 01:55:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my point of view if I was a big name publisher.

1564
01:55:02,819 --> 01:55:06,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be, if I were them, I'd be happy that they're not plugging the heck out of this stuff.

1565
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1566
01:55:09,139 --> 01:55:11,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, these relationships are very important to Microsoft.

1567
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm kind of not surprised that we're a little under the radar.

1568
01:55:17,006 --> 01:55:22,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think once people get a hold of the new NXE, they're definitely going to notice community games.

1569
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:25,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right there with Live Arcade and the Game Store.

1570
01:55:25,653 --> 01:55:28,136
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the Game Marketplace, it's right there as a category.

1571
01:55:29,737 --> 01:55:36,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've been accepted into the NXE preview and you already have it, you can see plain as day there are already 20 games on the service.

1572
01:55:36,423 --> 01:55:36,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

1573
01:55:37,853 --> 01:55:39,494
[SPEAKER_03]: The visibility is not going to be an issue.

1574
01:55:40,415 --> 01:55:43,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to kind of sneak up on people and really surprise them.

1575
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:45,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, very cool.

1576
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:54,947
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one thing, before we let you go, Aaron, one thing we always like to ask our guests here on Orange Lounge Radio, it's a segment we always do every week, we want to ask you, how was your gaming week?

1577
01:55:54,987 --> 01:55:57,629
[SPEAKER_09]: What other kinds of video games have you been playing besides Snake360?

1578
01:55:59,448 --> 01:56:01,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what, this last week has been kind of crazy.

1579
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:15,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the whole week off from work, you know, presumably to focus on Snake, but then I basically came down with a really bad cold, and my fiancée had a really bad cold as well, you know, starting last week and going into this week.

1580
01:56:16,418 --> 01:56:26,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very distracted all week, partially with, you know, with Snake, partially with having a cold, and then, of course, for a lot of times I couldn't stay focused, so...

1581
01:56:27,148 --> 01:56:32,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I diverted my attention with a little bit of Half-Life 2, which I hadn't really gotten to play very much of yet.

1582
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:34,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying it a lot.

1583
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:37,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I completed a few more of the advanced portal maps.

1584
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have one left that I'm completely stuck on.

1585
01:56:41,173 --> 01:56:48,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up the new Namco compilation, Namco Museum Virtual Arcade, which is a complete cash-in because it's so shoddily thrown together.

1586
01:56:49,015 --> 01:56:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But it features every XBLA release Namco has had up to this point, and it was only $30, so I'm a sucker for those.

1587
01:56:57,336 --> 01:56:58,877
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I played that a little bit.

1588
01:57:00,619 --> 01:57:06,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to get out to an arcade but I usually try to play a step game at least once a week.

1589
01:57:07,044 --> 01:57:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only kind of exercise I can do.

1590
01:57:10,086 --> 01:57:11,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Well Aaron, rest up and feel better.

1591
01:57:11,647 --> 01:57:19,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've been hearing you coughing a little bit tonight but I hope by the time this game launches you're well enough to celebrate when NXT comes out on November 19th.

1592
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:26,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited you were able to have me on here talking about it and I hope for all the arcade game fans, retro game fans or

1593
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:29,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, fans of fun games.

1594
01:57:29,431 --> 01:57:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys could take a few minutes of your day to check out Snake360.

1595
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:42,815
[SPEAKER_03]: The trial game will run for four minutes, and you'll be able to try out one of the courses on three different levels and battle mode with two players.

1596
01:57:43,755 --> 01:57:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And just give it a shot, and I appreciate, you know, giving it a try.

1597
01:57:49,011 --> 01:57:54,376
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, the game is Snake 360, and it's launching with the new Xbox 360 experience on November 19th.

1598
01:57:54,857 --> 01:58:00,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It has got a free time trial for you to check out the game, and if you want the full game, it's only going to set you back 400 points.

1599
01:58:00,302 --> 01:58:04,726
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want more information in the meantime, check out the website at snake360.com.

1600
01:58:05,147 --> 01:58:07,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron, thanks so much for joining us tonight, and best of luck with the game.

1601
01:58:07,929 --> 01:58:09,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it does really well for you.

1602
01:58:11,072 --> 01:58:14,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to quit my IT job, but thank you very much, Rob, for having me on the program.

1603
01:58:29,227 --> 01:58:33,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys will check out the demo.

1604
01:58:33,349 --> 01:58:35,110
[SPEAKER_09]: At least look at the YouTube on the website.

1605
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:36,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks pretty rad.

1606
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:39,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.

1607
01:58:39,592 --> 01:58:40,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1608
01:58:40,533 --> 01:58:48,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of retro games, you may remember the Atari 2600 flashback systems that were released a while back.

1609
01:58:49,157 --> 01:58:50,578
[SPEAKER_07]: They even had one that was in the

1610
01:58:51,678 --> 01:58:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: True2Life, Woodgrain.

1611
01:58:53,859 --> 01:59:01,263
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, the same company that brought those out are actually now bringing out USB Atari 2600 controllers.

1612
01:59:01,983 --> 01:59:17,671
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually use those to play whatever the heck you'd like, but mostly they're ideal for main usage, and they are compatible, of course, with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and will run you $14.99.

1613
01:59:20,984 --> 01:59:24,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, they just love to whore out the old school Atari 2600 stuff, don't they?

1614
01:59:24,545 --> 01:59:24,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1615
01:59:25,065 --> 01:59:25,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1616
01:59:25,845 --> 01:59:32,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, going from old school controller that's $14.99 to something rather new school, who doesn't love to play pinball?

1617
01:59:33,107 --> 01:59:33,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, DarkSakura?

1618
01:59:33,767 --> 01:59:34,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You love pinball.

1619
01:59:34,908 --> 01:59:36,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinball is fantastic.

1620
01:59:36,408 --> 01:59:40,849
[SPEAKER_09]: You spend a lot of money on pinball, but you buy the authentic pinball machines.

1621
01:59:40,909 --> 01:59:45,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how big of a fan you are of video pinball games, you know, the types of things.

1622
01:59:45,051 --> 01:59:45,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Some.

1623
01:59:45,591 --> 01:59:45,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1624
01:59:46,491 --> 01:59:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you be willing to spend $300 on your obsession?

1625
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:51,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends.

1626
01:59:51,421 --> 01:59:52,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like an ultracade?

1627
01:59:52,483 --> 01:59:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here it is.

1628
01:59:53,384 --> 01:59:56,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Nanotech Entertainment is putting out what's called a Pinball Wizard Controller.

1629
01:59:57,409 --> 02:00:05,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Real flipper buttons, an actual plunger, motion sensing thing for the tilting on it, $300 for the controller.

1630
02:00:06,602 --> 02:00:07,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

1631
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:07,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd do it.

1632
02:00:08,864 --> 02:00:15,228
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have to be pretty sick into this in order to justify this, but Nanotech is putting this out.

1633
02:00:15,328 --> 02:00:17,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the Pinball Wizard Controller.

1634
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:23,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got what's called a Mosh Ion or whatever, Mode Ion, Motion, IO Adapter.

1635
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:26,115
[SPEAKER_09]: No special drivers required for this.

1636
02:00:26,235 --> 02:00:28,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It's apparently fully configurable.

1637
02:00:28,697 --> 02:00:35,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It will work with a lot of existing pinball games that are out there right now, something they call a fancy-smancy future pinball engine.

1638
02:00:36,862 --> 02:00:37,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1639
02:00:37,763 --> 02:00:42,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it ships with a combination of a variety of different 3D pinball games already out there.

1640
02:00:43,165 --> 02:00:47,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Some recreations of famous pinball tables from Gottlieb.

1641
02:00:48,448 --> 02:00:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what tables those are yet, though.

1642
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:50,389
[SPEAKER_09]: That hasn't been said.

1643
02:00:50,469 --> 02:00:52,950
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can keep an eye out for more information on this.

1644
02:00:53,391 --> 02:00:54,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Nanotech Entertainment.

1645
02:00:55,232 --> 02:00:56,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nanotechent.com.

1646
02:00:57,053 --> 02:00:58,553
[SPEAKER_07]: All I got to say is the who will sue.

1647
02:00:59,774 --> 02:01:00,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that?

1648
02:01:00,734 --> 02:01:01,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Pinball Wizard.

1649
02:01:02,355 --> 02:01:03,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, because of the name, right?

1650
02:01:03,636 --> 02:01:03,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1651
02:01:04,649 --> 02:01:09,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that by now, you know, it should be fair use.

1652
02:01:10,413 --> 02:01:10,874
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1653
02:01:11,374 --> 02:01:11,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1654
02:01:11,694 --> 02:01:12,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little much for me.

1655
02:01:13,115 --> 02:01:15,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather just take the plunge and get a real machine.

1656
02:01:16,197 --> 02:01:18,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I need one already, but they're so expensive.

1657
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the money.

1658
02:01:21,601 --> 02:01:23,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I got that collection on the Wii.

1659
02:01:23,382 --> 02:01:24,483
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome.

1660
02:01:24,703 --> 02:01:25,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I can just keep that for now.

1661
02:01:27,376 --> 02:01:41,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is something that actually is a little interesting, I should say, as far as some stuff for Rock Revolution, if anyone is actually interested in it.

1662
02:01:42,848 --> 02:01:43,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's interested in that game?

1663
02:01:46,078 --> 02:01:46,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Revolution.

1664
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,083
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as I said, I'm still curious to check it out.

1665
02:01:50,123 --> 02:01:52,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just waiting for the price to drop, which should happen soon.

1666
02:01:52,926 --> 02:01:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also love the movie Showgirls.

1667
02:01:55,609 --> 02:01:57,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So take my opinion with a grain of salt.

1668
02:01:57,932 --> 02:02:01,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, there's some downloadable content for Xbox Live Marketplace.

1669
02:02:02,436 --> 02:02:04,638
[SPEAKER_04]: There is Desro, Death Reel.

1670
02:02:04,838 --> 02:02:05,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cool song.

1671
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Naoki, remixed by Kuro, which is my only shining star.

1672
02:02:12,345 --> 02:02:13,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, got tongue-tied.

1673
02:02:13,806 --> 02:02:16,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Mutsuhiko Izumi with Model DD8.

1674
02:02:17,249 --> 02:02:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Daisuke Kurosawa with Progressive Baby and Chimera.

1675
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:21,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1676
02:02:22,386 --> 02:02:35,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so despite all the crap we've given Rock Revolution in saying why don't they just bring out Guitar Freaks over here, interesting yet non-surprising that some of these tracks are crossover, at least the artists are certainly from those series, coming over to Rock Revolution.

1677
02:02:36,973 --> 02:02:37,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1678
02:02:38,314 --> 02:02:47,799
[SPEAKER_04]: There actually is a press release also out by Konami stating that it actually is shipping, will be $129.99 and is available for Xbox 360 and PS3.

1679
02:02:52,894 --> 02:02:54,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, check it out if you really want.

1680
02:02:58,170 --> 02:03:02,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Now what's kind of interesting is we talk about game piracy a lot.

1681
02:03:03,271 --> 02:03:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Well there was one game actually that was out there, World of Goo, that was actually pretty good.

1682
02:03:07,992 --> 02:03:12,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It was more of a puzzle game that came out on PC and WiiWare.

1683
02:03:14,374 --> 02:03:23,536
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting though is the developer actually has come out, designer Ron Carmel, who mentioned that his game has received a 90% piracy rate.

1684
02:03:27,188 --> 02:03:54,104
[SPEAKER_07]: and um yeah apparently he's been doing some research in the different torrent sites with you know some torrents with 500 seeders and 300 leechers and received emails from people who initially stole the game but ended up buying the full product and um it's kind of interesting to see that like you know smaller developers like this are really affected by piracy you know quite a bit um

1685
02:03:55,114 --> 02:03:55,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of neat though.

1686
02:03:55,635 --> 02:03:58,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember they had a t-shirt for this at one time.

1687
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:01,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember they were doing that Target thing with independent games tied in?

1688
02:04:02,126 --> 02:04:02,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1689
02:04:02,947 --> 02:04:03,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad that never happened.

1690
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:06,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened for like a week.

1691
02:04:06,554 --> 02:04:07,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

1692
02:04:08,076 --> 02:04:08,878
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of sad.

1693
02:04:10,205 --> 02:04:10,745
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1694
02:04:41,139 --> 02:04:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I get to go see it for free the night before it comes out.

1695
02:04:45,002 --> 02:04:45,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you?

1696
02:04:45,382 --> 02:04:46,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to review it for us here on the show?

1697
02:04:47,984 --> 02:04:48,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1698
02:04:48,664 --> 02:05:01,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to get out of it because I, as it is, I was managed to get a couple extra tickets for, um, Irene and, um, Nelly's mom, but my sister might want to go see it.

1699
02:05:01,953 --> 02:05:05,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to see if she can go my place, but I don't think that's going to happen.

1700
02:05:05,076 --> 02:05:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1701
02:05:06,593 --> 02:05:07,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably will have to see it.

1702
02:05:08,073 --> 02:05:10,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Kuroishi in chat says, oh yeah, and those Candy Mountain shirts.

1703
02:05:10,974 --> 02:05:11,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I own one of those.

1704
02:05:11,834 --> 02:05:12,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1705
02:05:12,514 --> 02:05:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought the Candy Mountain shirt at Hot Topic.

1706
02:05:15,615 --> 02:05:17,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Candy Mountain, Charlie.

1707
02:05:17,315 --> 02:05:18,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

1708
02:05:18,616 --> 02:05:21,256
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, are you going to be buying tickets to see Twilight?

1709
02:05:21,596 --> 02:05:24,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dying to know what you feel about Twilight.

1710
02:05:24,557 --> 02:05:26,057
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody buys them for me.

1711
02:05:27,518 --> 02:05:30,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just curious if you were a fan or not a fan.

1712
02:05:31,179 --> 02:05:32,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to read the books first.

1713
02:05:33,191 --> 02:05:33,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Understandable.

1714
02:05:34,672 --> 02:05:40,516
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, there's a new trailer apparently for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that's showing before Twilight that looks pretty hot.

1715
02:05:40,756 --> 02:05:41,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised.

1716
02:05:41,637 --> 02:05:42,577
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a Harry Potter fan.

1717
02:05:42,978 --> 02:05:44,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe that'll be worth going to see it.

1718
02:05:44,699 --> 02:05:45,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Harry Potter!

1719
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:52,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And a new trailer for Star Trek is apparently in front of the new James Bond movie, which I need to go see.

1720
02:05:53,164 --> 02:05:53,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I love James Bond.

1721
02:05:54,645 --> 02:05:54,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1722
02:05:56,087 --> 02:05:57,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen the new trailer?

1723
02:05:57,128 --> 02:06:00,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of trailers, and since we're totally off topic right now, the new trailer for Watchmen?

1724
02:06:01,891 --> 02:06:03,032
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't seen the new trailer.

1725
02:06:03,072 --> 02:06:05,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the last one with the Smashing Pumpkins song.

1726
02:06:05,333 --> 02:06:11,437
[SPEAKER_07]: See, because I'm actually reading the actual graphic novel there.

1727
02:06:11,497 --> 02:06:15,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of the stuff that I've seen in the graphic novel, obviously I can see in the trailer.

1728
02:06:15,319 --> 02:06:15,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of cool.

1729
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:22,904
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting, though, is it uses one of the songs that's in the trailer is a song that's on one of the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto 4.

1730
02:06:24,204 --> 02:06:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually the trailer, the song that they used when they first teased Grand Theft Auto 4.

1731
02:06:29,188 --> 02:06:30,409
[SPEAKER_07]: They had their teaser trailer.

1732
02:06:30,789 --> 02:06:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It was that same song.

1733
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:32,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1734
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:34,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1735
02:06:34,131 --> 02:06:36,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of good movies on the lineup for next year.

1736
02:06:36,573 --> 02:06:38,094
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of anticipated movies.

1737
02:06:38,114 --> 02:06:40,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we had a few of them this year between The Dark Knight and everything else.

1738
02:06:40,296 --> 02:06:42,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, doesn't Dark Knight come out on Blu-ray pretty soon?

1739
02:06:43,399 --> 02:06:44,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And just in time for your SingStar ABBA

1740
02:07:00,663 --> 02:07:01,684
[SPEAKER_09]: here at the home of Roberts.

1741
02:07:02,284 --> 02:07:04,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Left 4 Dead.

1742
02:07:04,225 --> 02:07:09,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's another game I've got to check out, and I've just got no freaking time left between all the Wrath of the Lich King I've been playing.

1743
02:07:09,948 --> 02:07:15,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Left 4 Dead apparently brings some clues to other Valve games, Team Fortress 2.

1744
02:07:16,691 --> 02:07:23,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, according to Kotaku, one of their readers actually was looking through the Left 4 Dead demo and found something very interesting.

1745
02:07:23,575 --> 02:07:25,716
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little cereal called Choco Bites.

1746
02:07:26,536 --> 02:07:26,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Team Fortress 2

1747
02:07:37,955 --> 02:07:49,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, there's only nine Team Fortress 2 classes out there right now, so a tenth one is coming soon, apparently, if this little Easter egg is to be believed.

1748
02:07:50,304 --> 02:07:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good catch, though.

1749
02:07:52,025 --> 02:07:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, that's pretty impressive somebody caught that.

1750
02:07:55,108 --> 02:07:56,189
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh, Valve?

1751
02:07:57,222 --> 02:08:01,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Valve has some pretty rabid fans, and I understand why.

1752
02:08:01,228 --> 02:08:04,873
[SPEAKER_09]: They are definitely masters of the first-person genre, I would say.

1753
02:08:05,253 --> 02:08:09,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Between Half-Life and Portal and now Left 4 Dead is generating tons of buzz.

1754
02:08:09,579 --> 02:08:10,701
[SPEAKER_09]: People love their Valve, don't they?

1755
02:08:11,274 --> 02:08:13,096
[SPEAKER_04]: They sure do, but guess what else people like?

1756
02:08:13,196 --> 02:08:13,576
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

1757
02:08:13,856 --> 02:08:15,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Rare.

1758
02:08:16,038 --> 02:08:26,467
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually an Easter egg in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts that says they're all in the pipeline, you know.

1759
02:08:26,607 --> 02:08:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: New Killer Instinct, Battletoads, and Force Gemini games, even Ghoulies 2.

1760
02:08:32,572 --> 02:08:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you'll never believe that.

1761
02:08:33,913 --> 02:08:35,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I ruined my own humorous tape.

1762
02:08:37,696 --> 02:08:38,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1763
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:38,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1764
02:08:40,475 --> 02:08:40,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Xenogias

1765
02:09:08,035 --> 02:09:10,637
[SPEAKER_04]: as in Z-E-N-O-G-I-A-S.

1766
02:09:11,277 --> 02:09:11,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1767
02:09:12,038 --> 02:09:12,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be funny.

1768
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be funny if the people translating it weren't told about Xenogears.

1769
02:09:16,121 --> 02:09:18,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of going back to the whole Left 4 Dead thing.

1770
02:09:19,323 --> 02:09:29,350
[SPEAKER_07]: They should make some other games in the whole Half-Life Valve universe including I think that they should make one based off the parody Half-Life Full Life Consequences.

1771
02:09:31,412 --> 02:09:32,713
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've ever seen that video it's hilarious.

1772
02:09:32,773 --> 02:09:33,253
[SPEAKER_07]: No I have not.

1773
02:09:33,873 --> 02:09:34,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to say.

1774
02:09:34,594 --> 02:09:35,675
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious retarded.

1775
02:09:37,957 --> 02:09:41,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Good comment from chat, kind of going back a story, talking about the whole Team Fortress 2 thing.

1776
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:45,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Seg has an interesting thought on what that could be all about.

1777
02:09:45,502 --> 02:09:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, I think that the 10th is actually the announcer for an action figure.

1778
02:09:49,385 --> 02:09:53,068
[SPEAKER_09]: The announcer is the 10th character, and the announcer could be an action figure.

1779
02:09:53,148 --> 02:09:56,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So no new class, just the acknowledgement that the announcer is the 10th character.

1780
02:09:57,671 --> 02:09:58,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting theory.

1781
02:09:58,912 --> 02:09:59,673
[SPEAKER_09]: An action figure?

1782
02:10:01,284 --> 02:10:02,345
[SPEAKER_09]: were you listening to the story?

1783
02:10:02,425 --> 02:10:11,694
[SPEAKER_09]: the back of the box teases collect all 10 action figures there you go I thought they were actually making action figures no but that would be kind of rad too don't you think?

1784
02:10:12,915 --> 02:10:13,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

1785
02:10:14,175 --> 02:10:20,317
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for the stories tonight until we get to some last minute stories, but now's the part of the show where we like to open up the Skype line.

1786
02:10:20,337 --> 02:10:23,617
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1787
02:10:23,717 --> 02:10:31,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Our 800 number is toll free in the US and Canada, but if you're in Europe or somewhere far away, you might want to consider using Skype because it's going to cost you money otherwise.

1788
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:35,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, while we wait for a call to come in, oh, never mind, we got calls coming in right now.

1789
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,801
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just, we'll hold off on last minute stories for just a little bit.

1790
02:10:38,101 --> 02:10:39,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1791
02:10:39,221 --> 02:10:39,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1792
02:10:41,325 --> 02:10:43,927
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Ake Ripper in Sweden.

1793
02:10:45,128 --> 02:10:46,289
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing Ake Ripper?

1794
02:10:46,309 --> 02:10:47,130
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight?

1795
02:10:52,755 --> 02:10:57,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Just ranting about Left 4 Dead.

1796
02:10:57,559 --> 02:11:00,121
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just completely awesome.

1797
02:11:01,113 --> 02:11:06,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us something about Left 4 Dead, because I don't think any of us in studio have actually gotten a chance to really play it yet.

1798
02:11:06,534 --> 02:11:14,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's kind of on the list of things we want to do, but I know for me, I still have the Mirror's Edge demo to play too, but there's been another game taking up a lot of my time.

1799
02:11:15,636 --> 02:11:16,096
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't heard.

1800
02:11:17,076 --> 02:11:20,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, plus you are, as we all know, a WoW addict.

1801
02:11:21,697 --> 02:11:22,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we know.

1802
02:11:22,257 --> 02:11:25,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like a... What can I say?

1803
02:11:25,777 --> 02:11:25,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1804
02:11:31,045 --> 02:11:33,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Old WoW addict, sort of.

1805
02:11:34,646 --> 02:11:35,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Recovering.

1806
02:11:35,107 --> 02:11:36,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, tell us about Left 4 Dead.

1807
02:11:36,967 --> 02:11:38,728
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes this game so flippin' awesome?

1808
02:11:40,108 --> 02:11:48,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is... Well, you have... You are playing like four... You have a maximum of four people.

1809
02:11:50,352 --> 02:11:59,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are to survive... Survive... Like this stomping zombie assault...

1810
02:12:00,836 --> 02:12:03,237
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just blow you away, really.

1811
02:12:04,537 --> 02:12:08,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so utterly good.

1812
02:12:10,158 --> 02:12:18,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, even if you're playing this game by yourself, you actually have like three other people with you that are all run by artificial intelligence, right?

1813
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,381
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that work?

1814
02:12:20,561 --> 02:12:21,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it good?

1815
02:12:21,461 --> 02:12:23,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I would imagine that they would be stupid.

1816
02:12:25,982 --> 02:12:29,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't got much experience playing with bots, really, since

1817
02:12:30,697 --> 02:12:42,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's all about the multiplayer multiplayer experience and playing to online play.

1818
02:12:43,265 --> 02:12:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only thing that's interesting in my way, in my view.

1819
02:12:48,809 --> 02:12:52,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Toshin in our chatroom seems to think the bot AI is probably better than humans.

1820
02:12:52,711 --> 02:12:55,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft agrees, though, that Left 4 Dead is really all about the multiplayer.

1821
02:12:57,234 --> 02:12:57,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but...

1822
02:12:59,476 --> 02:13:01,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I would disagree.

1823
02:13:01,776 --> 02:13:10,298
[SPEAKER_05]: The bots are, from my point of view, quite stupid.

1824
02:13:13,038 --> 02:13:23,060
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I'm not in one way super at shooters in a way.

1825
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of weird in one way, since my take on most shooters

1826
02:13:29,099 --> 02:13:35,363
[SPEAKER_05]: on single-play shooters, that is, is that give me god mode, and that's it, really.

1827
02:13:37,184 --> 02:13:41,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But multiplayer shooters, you can't do that.

1828
02:13:44,061 --> 02:13:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for me in one way, so I get to learn to play in one way.

1829
02:13:47,503 --> 02:13:48,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't cheat in this game.

1830
02:13:48,804 --> 02:13:53,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know a lot of people are looking forward to this game, and Elise can check out the demo right now.

1831
02:13:54,688 --> 02:13:55,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out there.

1832
02:13:55,288 --> 02:13:59,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have actually been playing the demo for a week now.

1833
02:13:59,651 --> 02:14:00,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1834
02:14:01,091 --> 02:14:06,595
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo was released actually last Friday to us that pre-

1835
02:14:13,038 --> 02:14:13,378
[SPEAKER_05]: bought it.

1836
02:14:14,018 --> 02:14:14,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1837
02:14:14,539 --> 02:14:15,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, pre-ordered?

1838
02:14:16,099 --> 02:14:16,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1839
02:14:16,819 --> 02:14:22,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that this game, if I remember right, this had some of the longest lines it packs, too, the previews of this game.

1840
02:14:22,361 --> 02:14:24,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of people are definitely anticipating this one.

1841
02:14:24,382 --> 02:14:24,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's Valve.

1842
02:14:25,002 --> 02:14:25,842
[SPEAKER_09]: People love their Valve.

1843
02:14:26,423 --> 02:14:26,923
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1844
02:14:27,063 --> 02:14:31,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if you think of it, it has a, well, what is it?

1845
02:14:31,284 --> 02:14:37,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originally shown at E3 in 2007, actually.

1846
02:14:39,587 --> 02:14:41,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at some point it got

1847
02:14:42,805 --> 02:14:43,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1848
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and we'll take a couple more calls tonight and then we've got to get to some last minute stories and get on out of here for the night if you can believe it.

1849
02:15:21,640 --> 02:15:23,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go ahead and go to the phones.

1850
02:15:23,741 --> 02:15:25,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1851
02:15:25,102 --> 02:15:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1852
02:15:26,533 --> 02:15:27,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, this is Seg.

1853
02:15:27,834 --> 02:15:29,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Seg, what's on your mind, buddy?

1854
02:15:30,416 --> 02:15:42,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, earlier this week, Gamasutra put up an article about IP property in academia, specifically with game schools.

1855
02:15:43,426 --> 02:15:51,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that really got me were the comments that the president of Digipend

1856
02:15:53,771 --> 02:16:01,356
[SPEAKER_06]: really caught me off guard, especially coming from a president of an educational institution.

1857
02:16:02,237 --> 02:16:14,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, apparently the policy at DigiPen is that any intellectual property presented in the classroom is solely owned by DigiPen.

1858
02:16:17,008 --> 02:16:18,850
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's the policy as I understand it.

1859
02:16:20,391 --> 02:16:44,624
[SPEAKER_06]: and as a graduate of a game design program but at a different institution, Emerson College, I found that really offensive to the student because it says that, I know I'm skipping over some of the details on it, but

1860
02:16:45,771 --> 02:16:52,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the reason that they chose to own, you know, just to decide that, oh, the school owns all the property and has all the control.

1861
02:16:52,837 --> 02:16:57,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, so just to clarify, you're saying if a student creates something for a class project, the school owns it?

1862
02:16:58,421 --> 02:16:59,342
[SPEAKER_09]: At DigiPen, yes.

1863
02:16:59,542 --> 02:16:59,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

1864
02:17:01,583 --> 02:17:03,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that he cites...

1865
02:17:05,331 --> 02:17:13,176
[SPEAKER_06]: is that, oh, the IP laws are so complicated, and it just makes things easier, and all this.

1866
02:17:13,296 --> 02:17:21,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And I felt that that's missing a very large, significant teaching moment, an opportunity.

1867
02:17:23,584 --> 02:17:26,866
[SPEAKER_06]: to the students by just pushing off to the side.

1868
02:17:27,747 --> 02:17:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, at least with Emerson College, which is my personal experience, the policy is basically a quasi-shared where Emerson... I made a thesis video game called Antidote for my BFA thesis.

1869
02:17:45,462 --> 02:17:46,843
[SPEAKER_06]: and I own it.

1870
02:17:47,443 --> 02:18:00,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mine with, I mean I can put an asterisk on the software that I used and all that but as far as Emerson College's role, I use their equipment and they have a distribution license pretty much.

1871
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:06,092
[SPEAKER_06]: They can showcase it as here's what one of our students did but they don't own it.

1872
02:18:06,512 --> 02:18:11,575
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't own everything which allowed me the capability to do whatever I want with it.

1873
02:18:12,216 --> 02:18:19,042
[SPEAKER_06]: whereas students of DigiPen apparently don't have that ownership in their own thing.

1874
02:18:19,282 --> 02:18:22,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for example, you may know a game called Portal.

1875
02:18:23,065 --> 02:18:23,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've heard of it.

1876
02:18:24,426 --> 02:18:25,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have heard of it.

1877
02:18:25,827 --> 02:18:32,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a few students from DigiPen who created a game called Nebacular Drop, which... I remember that.

1878
02:18:35,715 --> 02:18:38,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Oh.

1879
02:18:39,018 --> 02:18:39,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, weird.

1880
02:18:39,558 --> 02:18:39,918
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead.

1881
02:18:39,938 --> 02:18:40,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, there was a feedback loop.

1882
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:41,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1883
02:18:43,471 --> 02:18:47,755
[SPEAKER_06]: They made Nebacular Drop, and that was the game that got them the job at Valve.

1884
02:18:48,916 --> 02:18:59,326
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was sort of just like this gentleman's agreement that DigiPen wouldn't care that it's slightly similar because they got the jobs at DigiPen.

1885
02:19:00,307 --> 02:19:07,994
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's no guarantee that any student at DigiPen would get that affordedness.

1886
02:19:09,584 --> 02:19:16,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it possible that DigiPen does this, I mean, just theorizing here, maybe in a way to protect the students so that students aren't ripping off from each other?

1887
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:23,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you see something really cool that another student presents and you're like, wow, maybe I want to kind of make that game someday.

1888
02:19:24,374 --> 02:19:25,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be a protection thing?

1889
02:19:25,855 --> 02:19:27,516
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sort of afforded already.

1890
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:30,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, somebody else outside of the classroom can also do that.

1891
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:32,899
[SPEAKER_06]: regardless.

1892
02:19:33,879 --> 02:19:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my sort of test and for anyone, not just for video games but for anyone wanting to do a higher education in creative arts and even not just creative arts is just ask the question can I put my work in a creative commons license?

1893
02:19:54,609 --> 02:19:59,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I choose specifically choose to do a creative license or not?

1894
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:29,595
[SPEAKER_06]: because then you have the choice of where you want to put your work and incorporating whether it be commercial or free or Creative Commons work into your work because the sort of weird thing that hasn't been addressed is because DigiPen owns this work you can't do copy left apparently I mean that's a murky area and I'm not Mr. Lawyer here but

1895
02:20:31,975 --> 02:20:40,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of means that you can't do the Coffee Left attributions that you're supposed to do if you use a Creative Commons license thing.

1896
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:51,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a restrictive copyright onto one particular entity that doesn't allow you to do Copy Left.

1897
02:20:52,298 --> 02:20:59,341
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I didn't see the story on Gamma Studio, but now I'm very curious about it, especially if there's any kind of follow-up to it, because you would think at some point this is going to be challenged.

1898
02:20:59,721 --> 02:21:04,564
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what if the students create something they want to make?

1899
02:21:04,984 --> 02:21:09,866
[SPEAKER_06]: The comments on there have been rather debated extensively.

1900
02:21:10,246 --> 02:21:15,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are other schools... I mean, the thing that gets me is that this isn't unique to the video game industry.

1901
02:21:16,689 --> 02:21:20,130
[SPEAKER_06]: People like to make that oppression, but it's not.

1902
02:21:20,351 --> 02:21:20,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

1903
02:21:21,661 --> 02:21:23,683
[SPEAKER_06]: General creative endeavors.

1904
02:21:23,863 --> 02:21:28,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I studied television and radio when I was in college.

1905
02:21:29,528 --> 02:21:32,691
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the classes I was in, we had to write a script for a TV show, basically.

1906
02:21:33,031 --> 02:21:34,092
[SPEAKER_09]: But we essentially owned it.

1907
02:21:34,372 --> 02:21:34,852
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1908
02:21:36,033 --> 02:21:38,736
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't something that we would write a script and the college would own it.

1909
02:21:38,956 --> 02:21:43,440
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, we were encouraged, if we wanted to, to write a script based on a show that was already out there.

1910
02:21:44,614 --> 02:21:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, yeah, and let's say you wrote that, I mean, if you wrote that script that was heavily lifted off of something, it would be all null and void, but then you got the plagiarism, which is already policies in any college, and that counts as a plagiarism and all that.

1911
02:21:58,577 --> 02:22:10,300
[SPEAKER_09]: But for some reason, you know, at our school, it kind of didn't matter, because, you know, we weren't, obviously, you weren't going to say, it was just for a school project, you know, whatever, but, you know, there were some people that were writing scripts that they planned to use someday in the real world.

1912
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:10,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1913
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:11,480
[SPEAKER_06]: That was interesting.

1914
02:22:12,717 --> 02:22:41,211
[SPEAKER_06]: and I just find it very troubling that this certain academic institution wants to not only not teach IP policy I mean those were classes that I was required I basically went to a film school and created my own little curriculum for interactive media within the new media program but

1915
02:22:41,994 --> 02:22:53,239
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of kids who made their foundation and were able to travel off from that independently of the college because they had the capability of doing so.

1916
02:22:54,179 --> 02:23:00,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And it strikes me that DigiPen doesn't do that or want people to do that.

1917
02:23:01,022 --> 02:23:11,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems that they're more centered on making people that will fit into a role in a larger company and denying the choice of having students

1918
02:23:13,479 --> 02:23:32,425
[SPEAKER_06]: not only form a grander knowledge of the industry and being an actual participant and professional that is aware of the industry, but just making people that fit into smaller slots.

1919
02:23:33,665 --> 02:23:38,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a missed opportunity.

1920
02:23:39,653 --> 02:23:41,653
[SPEAKER_06]: for students, to box them in that way.

1921
02:23:41,854 --> 02:23:50,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to read, I can't talk about this for too much longer, but I've got to read some comments from chat, because Charam has some very interesting things to say.

1922
02:23:51,135 --> 02:24:06,078
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR, who happens to be Aaron, who we talked to earlier in the show about Snake360, says, just to clarify, Microsoft doesn't touch your IP if you publish a game on X and A. But the flip side of the coin, they're not responsible if you get sued over IP infringement and so on.

1923
02:24:06,558 --> 02:24:07,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1924
02:24:07,839 --> 02:24:11,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby from the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf, says something else interesting here.

1925
02:24:11,582 --> 02:24:12,763
[SPEAKER_09]: He's done some stuff with game design.

1926
02:24:12,803 --> 02:24:17,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he's played around with X and A. You know, I really thought this was standard with game design colleges.

1927
02:24:17,848 --> 02:24:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first time I've heard of a game design curriculum that didn't own your homework.

1928
02:24:21,891 --> 02:24:29,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, the last company I worked for owned anything I created as a program even on my off hours because I was dumb and didn't contest that portion of the employment contract.

1929
02:24:29,759 --> 02:24:30,359
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.

1930
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:31,861
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, that's very different.

1931
02:24:32,742 --> 02:24:35,726
[SPEAKER_06]: in an employment context that is extremely different.

1932
02:24:36,427 --> 02:24:42,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason is that in an employment context, you are being paid

1933
02:24:43,908 --> 02:24:45,008
[SPEAKER_06]: to do this work.

1934
02:24:45,728 --> 02:25:02,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is completely different from being in an educational facility where you are paying or funding on your own, you know, scholarships or whatever, to get an education to formulate a base for you to get to an employment situation or make your own company.

1935
02:25:02,532 --> 02:25:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's vastly different than employment.

1936
02:25:07,053 --> 02:25:12,434
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, in the employment context, yes, you were doing work for hire.

1937
02:25:13,644 --> 02:25:19,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the educational aspect, you're not doing this work for hire.

1938
02:25:20,506 --> 02:25:22,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwell just wants to clarify real quick.

1939
02:25:22,407 --> 02:25:28,209
[SPEAKER_09]: The company that he did, it was actually a defense contractor company, but they would still own the games he created on the weekend.

1940
02:25:29,298 --> 02:25:57,545
[SPEAKER_06]: but I guess the difference here is in a school you pay them, in a company they pay you so that's why you kind of have the different now like in California there's laws that prevent a company from having that overreach where as long as you do not use company equipment, you are not on company time and you don't use company specific knowledge the company you're employed to cannot

1941
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:03,311
[SPEAKER_06]: take claim of anything you do as long as there's that separation.

1942
02:26:03,711 --> 02:26:06,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, not every state's California.

1943
02:26:07,211 --> 02:26:11,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's also in the legal framework of you're being paid to do creative work.

1944
02:26:12,532 --> 02:26:16,233
[SPEAKER_06]: But in an educational environment, you're not being paid to do work.

1945
02:26:16,993 --> 02:26:20,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You're paying them, if anything, for a rental fee.

1946
02:26:21,514 --> 02:26:28,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to reduce it so simply, but you're paying the institution...

1947
02:26:30,185 --> 02:26:43,529
[SPEAKER_06]: for that, and there's no precedence for that besides certain very few colleges making that ownership policy, which a lot of colleges don't really go that far.

1948
02:26:43,929 --> 02:26:54,052
[SPEAKER_06]: They may have some influence, some collusion there, but to have complete and utter ownership like that is not very common.

1949
02:26:56,834 --> 02:27:05,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta wrap up, but thank you for bringing up a topic, especially on a night when we've been talking about moderation and kind of talking about these usage rights.

1950
02:27:06,164 --> 02:27:09,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I think sometimes these are things that a lot of people don't think about that goes on behind the scenes.

1951
02:27:10,229 --> 02:27:11,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just close with one thought?

1952
02:27:12,751 --> 02:27:13,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1953
02:27:13,352 --> 02:27:15,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Regardless, for anyone out there who is

1954
02:27:16,255 --> 02:27:16,835
[SPEAKER_06]: and others.

1955
02:27:16,875 --> 02:27:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Be aware.

1956
02:27:40,123 --> 02:27:46,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Be aware, this is something you should ask the admission counselor regardless of whatever field, even if it's creative or not.

1957
02:27:47,214 --> 02:27:51,617
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something you should be aware about before you make your decision for your higher education.

1958
02:27:52,117 --> 02:27:55,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good advice, especially considering we have a lot of people around that age that listen to this program.

1959
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Seg, thanks so much for the insight.

1960
02:27:57,361 --> 02:27:58,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Always appreciate it.

1961
02:27:58,281 --> 02:27:59,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me.

1962
02:27:59,122 --> 02:28:00,242
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always great to be on the show.

1963
02:28:00,302 --> 02:28:01,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you are most welcome.

1964
02:28:01,323 --> 02:28:01,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

1965
02:28:01,723 --> 02:28:05,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And hey, I hear there's another episode of Homestar Runner coming out very soon?

1966
02:28:06,446 --> 02:28:06,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, now.

1967
02:28:07,267 --> 02:28:12,010
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I'm only representing myself and being only myself.

1968
02:28:13,343 --> 02:28:14,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

1969
02:28:14,264 --> 02:28:15,725
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also that coming around the bed.

1970
02:28:16,205 --> 02:28:16,546
Alright.

1971
02:28:17,186 --> 02:28:17,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

1972
02:28:18,327 --> 02:28:18,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1973
02:28:18,707 --> 02:28:19,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, everybody.

1974
02:28:19,488 --> 02:28:19,908
[SPEAKER_09]: You too, buddy.

1975
02:28:20,489 --> 02:28:20,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1976
02:28:20,889 --> 02:28:21,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1977
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:25,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1978
02:28:25,333 --> 02:28:28,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably going to do one more quick, quick call, and then we're going to call it a night.

1979
02:28:28,415 --> 02:28:29,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1980
02:28:29,396 --> 02:28:29,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1981
02:28:30,817 --> 02:28:31,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.

1982
02:28:31,678 --> 02:28:32,859
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me, Legend of Zaku.

1983
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:33,499
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?

1984
02:28:34,260 --> 02:28:34,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

1985
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:34,880
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

1986
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:39,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, just hanging in there, just trying to, like, you know,

1987
02:28:40,336 --> 02:28:48,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm currently unemployed right now, because that job market is busting my balls right now, I'm just holding myself back from gaming in general.

1988
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:50,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the stuff that I managed to get for free.

1989
02:28:51,786 --> 02:29:10,481
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, let me see, I just found out over the weekend that Capcom, in their most infinite wisdom, quote-unquote, you know, I'm being sarcastic here, has decided to hold back, you know, the arcade releases, Street Fighter IV, effectively, you know, just saying, fuck you, we're not gonna do it, go fuck off, the arcade industry's dead.

1990
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:13,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty, I mean, I don't blame them, though.

1991
02:29:14,144 --> 02:29:20,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't blame them because, you know, fighting games, especially in the arcade level, are kind of, have been relegated to a niche recently.

1992
02:29:21,789 --> 02:29:30,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like DDR where it has that casual appeal where people can just easily jump into it without any risk.

1993
02:29:33,175 --> 02:29:36,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you've got fighting games that are much more difficult.

1994
02:29:36,096 --> 02:29:39,618
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a much higher learning curve in terms of moves and all that.

1995
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:48,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Zaku, I hate to kind of throw you a curveball here, but you made a very interesting comment on the last call, the kind of ties in, because you're talking about job market, economy, blah, blah, blah.

1996
02:29:49,403 --> 02:29:59,907
[SPEAKER_09]: You were mentioning on kind of to say phone call here, when I worked full time as a mobile software engineer, I had to sign a typical confidentiality agreement basically stating that anything I wrote or ran on their machines became essentially theirs.

1997
02:30:02,528 --> 02:30:06,430
[SPEAKER_09]: In light of what's happened, what do you think about kind of everything we've been talking about?

1998
02:30:07,242 --> 02:30:17,465
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I actually read that story earlier this week, you know, about DigiPen basically, you know, and their policy on owning everything you pretty much submit to them, which is kind of typical.

1999
02:30:18,485 --> 02:30:31,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of typical for how a company operates, you know, where if you're working in software engineering, for example, or any work-for-hire stuff that you do at freelance levels, you pretty much don't own the content, the content.

2000
02:30:31,752 --> 02:30:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: The creator, you know, the actual, the person who commissioned it actually does.

2001
02:30:36,476 --> 02:30:40,859
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you know, the person commissioning in a software engineering company is the company itself.

2002
02:30:41,519 --> 02:30:48,785
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it needs employees to actually, you know, like me as a software engineer to actually type in the code on the screen and make it work.

2003
02:30:50,166 --> 02:30:53,969
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it does, you know, it does worry me somewhat.

2004
02:30:54,489 --> 02:31:01,074
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, I don't, you know, I don't really, I can really understand why they do it just to cover their own asses.

2005
02:31:01,775 --> 02:31:13,661
[SPEAKER_00]: in case they want to avoid as much litigation as possible in terms of who owns the IP, the school, or the student.

2006
02:31:13,741 --> 02:31:19,443
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically solves a lot of problems before they even creep up.

2007
02:31:20,124 --> 02:31:28,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a sad reality that many people actually submit work and then realize that, oh, oh,

2008
02:31:29,181 --> 02:31:39,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh crap, I might have used a good idea and then now they're screwed because it's going to take a while to create something much better than what you already submitted because you can't use it anymore because it's someone else who owns it.

2009
02:31:40,806 --> 02:31:47,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Zach, I've got another kind of interesting question for you because you talking about having gotten laid off from the mobile company kind of makes me think about this.

2010
02:31:48,990 --> 02:31:53,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I mentioned this earlier in the program, but earlier this week I was actually interviewed by the local news.

2011
02:31:53,952 --> 02:31:55,753
[SPEAKER_09]: They were doing a story about the Warcraft launch

2012
02:31:56,473 --> 02:32:14,161
[SPEAKER_09]: and they wanted to talk about how video games are like economy they're kind of economy in spite of our falling economy people were still lining up to buy this game you know and I'm using Warcraft as an example but they were kind of talking about how video games were economy they were rescission proof

2013
02:32:14,861 --> 02:32:19,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Recession Proof Of course, you have basically game devs that are failing left and right, shutting down, laying off people

2014
02:32:41,159 --> 02:32:44,581
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's probably because they're not taking in enough money for the games that they're selling.

2015
02:32:45,202 --> 02:32:56,969
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, on the consumer level, you realize that people, you know, games right now are much cheaper than any big-ticket luxury items like iPods or flat-screen TVs.

2016
02:32:57,049 --> 02:33:03,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the used game market is still thriving right now because of the recession, because people want to play for cheap.

2017
02:33:04,474 --> 02:33:10,398
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, you know, GameStop's making a killing right now with the used games that they have on the, you know,

2018
02:33:11,363 --> 02:33:12,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there in the bins.

2019
02:33:13,744 --> 02:33:17,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people want, you know, they want instant satisfaction in that sense.

2020
02:33:18,527 --> 02:33:26,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are willing to save up for something, you know, something like $50 or $60 for like one game, must-have game of this year.

2021
02:33:26,872 --> 02:33:31,014
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, personally, I would pick Fallout 3 over Left 4 Dead, but that's just me.

2022
02:33:31,634 --> 02:33:32,835
[SPEAKER_00]: But people have their, you know...

2023
02:33:33,646 --> 02:34:02,510
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be saving up for something for that one thing they want to get this year since the economy is really going under and they're not in a position to actually spend as much as they did last year alright well Zaku we got to wrap up and let you go but any other quick last thoughts for our listeners let me see the arcade scene is not dead it's just going through it just basically got hit in the stomach it's just trying to get up right now let's hope DDR saves it again

2024
02:34:02,932 --> 02:34:04,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Zaku, take care, buddy.

2025
02:34:04,215 --> 02:34:04,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the call.

2026
02:34:05,998 --> 02:34:06,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And good luck on the job hunt.

2027
02:34:08,102 --> 02:34:08,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

2028
02:34:08,623 --> 02:34:09,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2029
02:34:09,164 --> 02:34:09,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2030
02:34:10,353 --> 02:34:10,913
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, anybody?

2031
02:34:10,933 --> 02:34:11,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Last minute stories for us tonight.

2032
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:37,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I like pie.

2033
02:34:38,711 --> 02:34:39,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I do too.

2034
02:34:39,271 --> 02:34:40,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I want some pumpkin pie.

2035
02:34:40,372 --> 02:34:40,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Real bad.

2036
02:34:41,192 --> 02:34:43,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any pie-licious stories for us?

2037
02:34:43,753 --> 02:34:47,355
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't have pie-licious stories, but this is kind of cheesy.

2038
02:34:48,175 --> 02:34:49,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm, cheesecake?

2039
02:34:50,016 --> 02:34:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put cheese on apple pie.

2040
02:34:53,338 --> 02:34:58,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Uwe Boll has been... No, hold on, hold on.

2041
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,041
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not making another movie.

2042
02:35:00,181 --> 02:35:02,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least this is not an announcement of another movie.

2043
02:35:02,502 --> 02:35:03,903
[SPEAKER_07]: He's being charged with libel.

2044
02:35:05,277 --> 02:35:10,680
[SPEAKER_07]: and is being forced to pay a $2.1 million fine.

2045
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:23,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, he had badmouthed the Fantastic Films International Company, the very film distributor handling his movies, and now he lost his court case, and so he has to pay money.

2046
02:35:23,987 --> 02:35:24,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

2047
02:35:26,529 --> 02:35:27,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of funny.

2048
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:28,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Hilarious.

2049
02:35:29,771 --> 02:35:30,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Hilarious.

2050
02:35:30,651 --> 02:35:32,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he gets for being a dick!

2051
02:35:34,545 --> 02:35:37,826
[SPEAKER_07]: and then what else was I looking up here?

2052
02:35:40,027 --> 02:35:40,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too much.

2053
02:35:40,567 --> 02:35:41,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably pornography.

2054
02:35:42,068 --> 02:35:43,068
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not pornography.

2055
02:35:43,128 --> 02:35:47,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking up some old videos of the Half-Life 2 stuff.

2056
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:51,752
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Half-Life Full Life something or other.

2057
02:35:52,212 --> 02:35:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, the same guy did some other videos called the Idiots of Gary's Mod and they're hilarious.

2058
02:36:00,435 --> 02:36:01,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also found a cam

2059
02:36:03,917 --> 02:36:06,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched it with no sound.

2060
02:36:23,001 --> 02:36:26,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, sounds like that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2061
02:36:26,482 --> 02:36:27,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to wrap up.

2062
02:36:27,343 --> 02:36:28,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Get on out of here.

2063
02:36:28,223 --> 02:36:29,124
[SPEAKER_04]: In ribbons and bows?

2064
02:36:29,244 --> 02:36:30,444
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, in ribbons and bows.

2065
02:36:31,445 --> 02:36:34,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week is the week before Thanksgiving, if you can believe it.

2066
02:36:35,267 --> 02:36:36,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Time is flying.

2067
02:36:36,668 --> 02:36:37,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not allowed.

2068
02:36:38,789 --> 02:36:40,810
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob, you have to be politically correct.

2069
02:36:41,110 --> 02:36:42,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the holiday.

2070
02:36:42,531 --> 02:36:44,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, the Harvest Festival, whatever.

2071
02:36:44,853 --> 02:36:47,174
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2072
02:36:47,854 --> 02:36:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a discussion about this in my team meeting at work.

2073
02:36:52,377 --> 02:36:55,219
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, okay, who is offended if we say Christmas?

2074
02:36:55,619 --> 02:36:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: No one raised their hand.

2075
02:36:56,599 --> 02:36:57,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay!

2076
02:36:58,757 --> 02:37:03,552
[SPEAKER_04]: We're calling it whatever we want to in this room, and then we'll call it the holiday.

2077
02:37:04,655 --> 02:37:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: The appreciation.

2078
02:37:06,824 --> 02:37:13,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Most Jewish people I've talked to, Jewish being the biggest religion and most obvious one that doesn't do Christmas, they do Hanukkah instead, right?

2079
02:37:14,331 --> 02:37:21,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Most Jewish people I know are kind of used to it and don't take personal offense to it and kind of get into the whole celebration thing.

2080
02:37:21,358 --> 02:37:22,999
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't celebrate the secular holiday.

2081
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:23,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2082
02:37:23,500 --> 02:37:24,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to be perfectly honest.

2083
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:28,765
[SPEAKER_09]: They get into the Hallmark side of it, but not the meaning behind it necessarily.

2084
02:37:28,885 --> 02:37:33,368
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest, my own celebration is Yule.

2085
02:37:33,408 --> 02:37:36,130
[SPEAKER_04]: If our fireplace wasn't shit, I'd be burning a log every year.

2086
02:37:37,251 --> 02:37:38,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just whatever.

2087
02:37:40,273 --> 02:37:55,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas itself, as most people know it in the Western world, is a secular holiday given a name by the Catholic Church to convert pagans because Jesus was not born in December.

2088
02:37:56,104 --> 02:37:56,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It was October.

2089
02:37:58,484 --> 02:38:00,425
[SPEAKER_09]: So Halloween is closer to Jesus' birthday?

2090
02:38:00,766 --> 02:38:00,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2091
02:38:01,126 --> 02:38:01,966
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, just curious.

2092
02:38:02,087 --> 02:38:03,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be whenever they do the census.

2093
02:38:04,388 --> 02:38:08,891
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, look, I don't want to get into religio chat too deep on a video game show.

2094
02:38:08,911 --> 02:38:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it's funny, but that's okay.

2095
02:38:11,353 --> 02:38:11,693
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2096
02:38:13,214 --> 02:38:18,158
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll do our politically incorrect Christmas and deal with it special or something like that.

2097
02:38:18,378 --> 02:38:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Actdeft refers to zombie Jesus.

2098
02:38:24,325 --> 02:38:27,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll do a Christmas gaming marathon or politically incorrect.

2099
02:38:27,648 --> 02:38:29,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming marathons are the big thing right now.

2100
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:34,473
[SPEAKER_09]: People playing games for hours and hours on end to raise money for charity.

2101
02:38:34,793 --> 02:38:36,794
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do something like that here at Orange Lingerie.

2102
02:38:36,814 --> 02:38:37,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how or when.

2103
02:38:37,715 --> 02:38:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: A play-a-thon?

2104
02:38:38,675 --> 02:38:39,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a play-a-thon.

2105
02:38:39,456 --> 02:38:41,437
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's not TDR.

2106
02:38:41,457 --> 02:38:43,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to play obscure games.

2107
02:38:43,239 --> 02:38:44,860
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let the users vote on what we're going to play.

2108
02:38:45,160 --> 02:38:47,441
[SPEAKER_04]: How about, you know what, I should catalog my collection.

2109
02:38:48,441 --> 02:38:50,382
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as they don't pick some of the shit that's in my collection.

2110
02:38:50,402 --> 02:38:52,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do have some shit in the collection.

2111
02:38:52,202 --> 02:38:54,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We should pool like 40 games.

2112
02:38:54,763 --> 02:38:56,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says Guardian Legend.

2113
02:38:56,803 --> 02:38:57,544
[SPEAKER_09]: That can be one of the games.

2114
02:38:57,584 --> 02:39:01,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Like every hour, play a new game and let the chatroom vote on what game we play each hour.

2115
02:39:02,133 --> 02:39:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally, totally down for that.

2116
02:39:03,794 --> 02:39:05,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We should do something like that.

2117
02:39:05,074 --> 02:39:05,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

2118
02:39:05,534 --> 02:39:07,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll call it our Christmas marathon.

2119
02:39:11,337 --> 02:39:11,677
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2120
02:39:12,017 --> 02:39:13,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Who called it Jesus Ween?

2121
02:39:14,758 --> 02:39:15,299
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

2122
02:39:16,039 --> 02:39:16,299
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2123
02:39:16,339 --> 02:39:21,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we'll try to figure out that idea and bring you more on that a little later.

2124
02:39:21,721 --> 02:39:23,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can open up the studio.

2125
02:39:23,202 --> 02:39:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to my roommate about it.

2126
02:39:24,242 --> 02:39:27,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We can open up the studio and have people in and out of here throughout the hour and something like that.

2127
02:39:27,944 --> 02:39:29,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we gotta wrap up.

2128
02:39:29,845 --> 02:39:30,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of here for the night.

2129
02:39:30,665 --> 02:39:31,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody's final thought.

2130
02:39:32,506 --> 02:39:33,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought for us tonight.

2131
02:39:34,668 --> 02:39:35,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a headache now, too.

2132
02:39:38,329 --> 02:39:41,311
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought tonight is Child's Play.

2133
02:39:41,771 --> 02:39:45,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Seg is screaming in chat room, mention Child's Play.

2134
02:39:45,393 --> 02:39:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Child's Play is on now.

2135
02:39:46,394 --> 02:39:46,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Mention.

2136
02:39:46,854 --> 02:39:47,214
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2137
02:39:47,334 --> 02:39:47,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Child's Play.

2138
02:39:48,355 --> 02:39:49,415
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2139
02:39:54,403 --> 02:39:56,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I think DarkSakura is zombie Jesus.

2140
02:39:57,065 --> 02:39:57,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2141
02:39:57,665 --> 02:40:01,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I just found out one of my zip drives has escaped my keychain somehow.

2142
02:40:01,867 --> 02:40:02,388
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.

2143
02:40:02,948 --> 02:40:04,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope there's not pornography in there.

2144
02:40:04,669 --> 02:40:06,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight.

2145
02:40:07,191 --> 02:40:09,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

2146
02:40:10,192 --> 02:40:13,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

2147
02:40:13,174 --> 02:40:13,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Spread the word.

2148
02:40:14,275 --> 02:40:15,495
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

2149
02:40:15,735 --> 02:40:16,036
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...

2150
02:40:16,676 --> 02:40:45,027
[SPEAKER_09]: that's how Aaron from Snake360 got on this show in the first place because a friend of his told him about the show and worked out the whole interview thing with us so it just goes to show no matter where you are in the game playing spectrum whether you just play them or you write them spread the word about Orange Launch Radio because we are a community based program and if you have no friends or you're just feeling up to it because you want to really help leave us a nice review on iTunes a nice five star review on there or any of those other podcasting sites throughout the internet because it also helps us spread the word because that's all we got

2151
02:40:45,367 --> 02:40:48,450
[SPEAKER_09]: No fancy magazines or TV stations backing us up.

2152
02:40:48,830 --> 02:40:49,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Just us.

2153
02:40:49,331 --> 02:40:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've got to take on those big boys all ourselves.

2154
02:40:51,472 --> 02:40:53,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2155
02:40:53,955 --> 02:40:58,298
