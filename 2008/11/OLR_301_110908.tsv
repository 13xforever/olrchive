0	3000	You're listening to All Games Radio.
3000	31000	Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio Live.
31000	33000	Tonight, November 9th, 2008.
33000	36000	EA gets hit with more lawsuits over their controversial DRM.
36000	39000	Copyright concerns hit Guitar Hero and LittleBigPlanet.
39000	44000	And has Yaris become the first casualty of Xbox listing?
44000	49000	Orange Lounge Radio.
49000	52000	We are back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
52000	58000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
58000	64000	And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura.
64000	67000	Jamie Summers, not here yet.
67000	69000	She's running a little late tonight.
69000	71000	And we'll talk a little bit about why.
71000	74000	It's very interesting, but she will be joining us for Part B tonight.
74000	77000	She'll get here about 7 o'clock Pacific for those listening live.
77000	82000	For those on the podcast, she'll be here for Part B to kind of talk about where she's been.
82000	87000	And it is a little bit related to some things we've talked about previously on the show, but not gaming.
87000	89000	Very interesting. I'll leave you with that.
89000	92000	In the meantime, we'll talk to Techmaster Loki.
92000	93000	Yes.
93000	94000	How you doing, Loki?
94000	95000	I'm doing okay.
95000	96000	Awesome.
96000	100000	Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?
100000	106000	Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.
106000	108000	But how did you enjoy the time off?
108000	112000	I remember I did last Sunday, to be honest.
112000	114000	I think I played games.
114000	120000	I know I didn't play Fable 2 because I had left it at work and Nellie was disappointed because she was playing that.
120000	127000	And I offered to go get it for her because I actually have a key to the building, but she said no.
127000	134000	So, probably was either playing LittleBigPlanet or Saints Row 2.
134000	142000	I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it.
142000	144000	So, it was very late at night.
144000	146000	But, you know, I can't live without my cell phone.
146000	150000	Alright, well you started talking about games like Fable 2, so we'll ask you, how was your gaming week, Loki?
150000	152000	We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that.
152000	153000	My gaming week was alright.
153000	157000	I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.
157000	161000	I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.
161000	172000	I did play Fable 2 a bit mainly to cheat and how I cheated.
172000	174000	Let me count the ways.
174000	176000	First, I cheated to get lots of money.
176000	185000	And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property and then time travel and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again.
185000	186000	So, I have lots of money now.
186000	189000	And then I decided to get lots of experience.
189000	196000	And the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own.
196000	204000	And you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything.
204000	205000	So, that's what I did.
205000	206000	I did all that.
206000	211000	And then I played a few missions and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.
211000	214000	So, I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.
214000	217000	And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.
217000	220000	In fact, now I am almost done with the game.
220000	222000	I have two missions left, I think.
222000	224000	And that game is awesome.
224000	226000	It's just a lot of fun.
226000	228000	Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.
228000	231000	In fact, they're kind of hating me.
231000	234000	They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.
234000	237000	And I've been winning with over 20 points.
237000	244000	And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.
244000	246000	And it's not really fun.
246000	254000	The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.
254000	255000	But it's alright.
255000	261000	And then I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.
261000	262000	Just a lot of activities.
262000	265000	I really appreciate Saints Row 2.
265000	270000	I think this is the game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.
270000	276000	And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2 and I don't plan on it.
276000	281000	Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.
281000	285000	But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.
285000	286000	Which is too bad.
286000	288000	And then Little Big Planet, I've been playing a lot of that.
288000	293000	Just trying to go back and collect 100% of everything in each level.
293000	297000	And now I've kind of gotten a little bit bored with doing that.
297000	304000	I've been continuing through the game and now I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.
304000	306000	But it's really cool.
306000	308000	Slightly offensive still.
308000	310000	And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.
310000	316000	Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.
316000	320000	His character's interesting, to say the least.
320000	322000	We'll just leave it at that. Interesting.
322000	325000	But it's a fun game.
325000	329000	And it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.
329000	331000	But that's the thing.
331000	336000	Now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.
336000	341000	It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess. I don't know.
341000	345000	Then, let's see, what else did I play?
345000	350000	Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo. Holy crap, is that awesome.
350000	355000	Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.
355000	356000	It's pretty awesome.
356000	363000	Now this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.
363000	366000	Still got to go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.
366000	369000	Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.
369000	376000	They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there.
376000	384000	Which is cool because that game is really cheesy anyways and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim I guess would be really fun.
384000	386000	But they're going to have downloadable characters.
386000	388000	They're going to have Obama and Sarah Palin.
388000	389000	Oh lord.
389000	391000	So that would be funny.
391000	395000	But yeah, basically Mirror's Edge, very intense.
395000	401000	The game reminds me kind of like playing out a scene in Bourne Identity, which is pretty cool.
401000	403000	And the music kind of fits with it as well.
403000	406000	But that's about it.
406000	415000	It's a lot of trial and error because when I was trying to jump from building to building, I'd miss the other building a lot.
415000	422000	Let's get some comments from the ever-present fourth panelist on our show, the Chat Room at chat.orangelandradio.com, live on this Sunday night.
422000	424000	Tigerclaw starts off, he's also played the Mirror's Edge demo.
424000	428000	He says the Mirror's Edge demo has some pretty cool music, a combination of ambient and trance music.
428000	430000	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
430000	436000	So that's basically been what I've been playing this week.
436000	438000	I have Fallout 3.
438000	441000	I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
441000	445000	I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.
445000	446000	It's just too much.
446000	450000	And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.
450000	454000	I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.
454000	457000	Just a lot of stuff.
457000	458000	Oh, and I got Resistance 2.
458000	459000	That was the other game I played.
459000	461000	Resistance 2.
461000	468000	You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.
468000	471000	I'm not liking it as much as the first one.
471000	474000	I think what it is is there's not a lot of setup.
474000	477000	It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.
477000	480000	Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...
480000	484000	Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything,
484000	490000	I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.
490000	492000	But this is just, it's too much.
492000	493000	Just too quick.
493000	498000	So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.
498000	500000	But it's been good.
500000	504000	It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.
504000	507000	You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.
507000	511000	Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?
511000	514000	It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.
514000	520000	I think it's going to be about as big as like, say, maybe Assassin's Creed.
520000	522000	But I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.
522000	523000	Interesting.
523000	524000	But it'll be fun.
524000	533000	I mean, it's one of those games that they could add like, you know, kind of the Melgir Solid challenge levels and stuff later on and stuff to it.
533000	538000	Because it's a lot of, a lot of it feels just kind of like the VR missions or something like that.
538000	543000	It's a lot of just linear running and, you know, having to figure out how to do tricks and stuff.
543000	546000	And there's very few buttons that you use in the game.
546000	550000	But the way you do stuff is pretty cool.
550000	551000	I'll have to check it out.
551000	556000	I'm not usually a big fan on the first person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.
556000	558000	Just because it's not really a shooter.
558000	560000	Like, you can't really call it a first person shooter, right?
560000	563000	It's more of a first person free running sim.
563000	570000	Yeah, and I do love, see, and then like Portal, I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first person, you shoot portals, so who knows.
570000	575000	Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.
575000	578000	And CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.
578000	581000	They're okay, it just takes a lot of getting used to.
581000	584000	Because, like I said, I kept falling off the building. A lot.
584000	588000	Alright, if you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com
588000	590000	Anything else for your gaming week?
590000	591000	That's it.
591000	596000	Alright, let me answer the questions in the chat room, because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.
596000	599000	Obviously I'm here, so I'm doing fine.
599000	607000	And to answer what Marin in chat said, no the doctor did not have my gallbladder with some fava beans and an ice canteen.
607000	615000	So, yeah, I had the operation on Wednesday, and I was pretty much out for the next few days recuperating.
615000	622000	And I did try to get some gaming in. I took my DS over to my parents' house where I was recuperating.
622000	628000	And, by the way, speaking of the gallbladder, they did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube.
628000	631000	And, you know, I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.
631000	633000	And they didn't put it in a jar for me.
633000	639000	And I didn't really get to, I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.
639000	646000	But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.
646000	649000	But see, Loki? That was my gallbladder there on the left.
649000	652000	So, yay. Yeah, exactly.
652000	656000	So I'll be showing those to Jamie when she arrives, too, because I know she was really excited to see.
656000	659000	But there you go. So I do at least have pictures.
659000	662000	And to answer Redertainment's question in chat, Skye, did you vote?
662000	665000	Yes, I went and voted. That's a very important thing.
665000	669000	So hope you all did, too, no matter what you did. I hope you did go vote.
669000	673000	I voted on the monorail. I mean, bullet train.
673000	675000	As pro-monorail.
675000	679000	Yeah, I did vote. I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.
679000	684000	If I was a little worried that, you know, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time,
684000	688000	I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the cargo vote.
688000	691000	If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.
691000	693000	So there you go.
693000	697000	So I'm doing great. I feel a lot better. I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.
697000	703000	I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including ORR.
703000	708000	Be sure to download it, in case you haven't done it yet, the free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.
708000	709000	Oh yeah, I already did.
709000	710000	Yeah, those are funny.
710000	714000	And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.
714000	715000	Really?
715000	716000	Yep.
716000	717000	I wanted a card.
717000	718000	Well, not that I really care.
718000	719000	Sorry.
719000	723000	Anyhow, let me talk about some other stuff as far as games go.
723000	725000	So I was playing DS while I was recuperating.
725000	730000	I went back and revisited an old classic DS game, Clubhouse Games.
730000	735000	I was playing for a little while, which is, you know, it's a good way to pass the time when you're doped up.
735000	739000	And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out,
739000	744000	and I asked him to pick me up a game, and he did it, and that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
744000	747000	I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.
747000	751000	As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it.
751000	756000	Because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it, so I don't really remember it at all.
756000	757000	Like, I do.
757000	763000	I remember thinking it was very much, like, here's my thing with Castlevania games.
763000	766000	To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.
766000	770000	There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.
770000	772000	They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.
772000	776000	Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait till Castlevania Judgment comes out.
776000	779000	That'll innovate you up the ass.
779000	783000	Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony of the Night is one hella good game,
783000	787000	but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?
787000	789000	It makes me miss them on the console.
789000	791000	And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.
791000	795000	I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.
795000	799000	I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.
799000	803000	It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.
803000	806000	But keep in mind, Vicodin.
806000	808000	So I'm not really at my peak.
808000	813000	So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.
813000	815000	Did you try to hit it for massive damage?
815000	819000	Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.
819000	822000	That's because it only applies to...
822000	825000	I didn't have 6-axis on the DS, that's why.
825000	826000	It didn't work.
826000	833000	But I do have 6-axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.
833000	834000	Wait, I gotta read this.
834000	836000	I gotta read this comment in chat.
836000	838000	Marin in chat says,
838000	841000	Castlevania Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.
841000	845000	Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.
845000	847000	Anyhow.
847000	855000	The other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called Little Big Planet.
855000	859000	And as far as my thoughts on Little Big Planet, I love it.
859000	864000	It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.
864000	867000	I love the sense of humor in the game.
867000	869000	I think the graphics look great.
869000	875000	I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.
875000	882000	I think, even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.
882000	890000	Just even as a standalone game, I would have paid 20 bucks as an arcade title for just the story, which was a lot of fun.
890000	894000	But then you add this whole online component to it, and wow.
894000	901000	I think my thoughts on this were kind of best summed up by a Twitter post I made earlier this week where I was like,
901000	905000	You know what? I think this game is the new ZZT for me.
905000	908000	Little Big Planet is kind of the new ZZT.
908000	911000	No, no, no. Nothing will ever replace ZZT.
911000	912000	It won't. It won't.
912000	914000	ZZT always has a fond place in my heart, but I think that's because...
914000	917000	Sony's not trying to rip ZZT levels off the internet for you.
917000	921000	ZZT also had a more comprehensive programming language that Little Big Planet doesn't have.
921000	926000	Even though you can do some pretty fancy things in Little Big Planet, you could do a little more in ZZT.
926000	933000	But anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that the whole creation and the potential for really doing anything
933000	935000	is really out there in Little Big Planet.
935000	938000	And you really see that out there on some of these community levels.
938000	941000	Now granted, there's a lot of shit out there.
941000	946000	There's a lot of these levels that are like, Get 9 Trophies in 30 Seconds, which I'm sure we all played once.
946000	948000	I never played that one.
948000	951000	You better believe it was the first level I played.
951000	956000	But because we're all playing it as the first level, it's never going to go away.
956000	960000	And all the clones are never going to go away from the top page.
960000	962000	But there's some really interesting stuff too.
962000	965000	And we're going to talk a little later in the show about the copyright infringement and all that stuff.
965000	969000	But I've seen some pretty interesting stuff that's really blurred the lines of copyright infringement.
969000	973000	Like I played a Batman level that was kind of funny. It was a little stupid.
973000	980000	I mean, the level itself was very short, but it was really neat how the guy really worked in all these little Batman logos
980000	985000	and little Joker faces and things into the game, even though it's a huge copyright problem.
985000	988000	But whatever, he hasn't been shut down yet.
988000	993000	And then it was interesting. Some levels I played, you actually could unlock little stickers.
993000	998000	Like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera.
998000	999000	Awesome.
999000	1002000	And that was a sticker I unlocked because people are holding things up to the camera.
1002000	1008000	Like in Bobby's level, you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf on AllGames.com,
1008000	1011000	he has a level he did during the beta.
1011000	1018000	And as a part of that, you can unlock the AllGames logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox.
1018000	1021000	But that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself.
1021000	1027000	But that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels.
1027000	1035000	And to be honest, even if you go in the non-copyright stuff, there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels.
1035000	1041000	I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with.
1041000	1043000	It's a lot of fun.
1043000	1046000	And then he had multiplayer into it.
1046000	1050000	And that's also a lot of fun. It's hard as hell to do without a headset.
1050000	1055000	But because LittleBigPlanet is international, you might be playing with somebody from Japan or playing with Europe,
1055000	1061000	you could all have headsets and you might still not be able to communicate very well.
1061000	1064000	But people have come up with really efficient ways of communicating.
1064000	1068000	Like people use the arrow stickers to point at things.
1068000	1074000	Like one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing
1074000	1077000	because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.
1077000	1079000	He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.
1079000	1088000	Also if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the poppet and just hover on it in a minute to show heart.
1088000	1090000	Good thing. Heart.
1090000	1094000	Plus you can also hit people with your character.
1094000	1098000	Exactly. My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan and he's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.
1098000	1100000	I wouldn't need you with a frying pan.
1100000	1103000	I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.
1103000	1105000	A little tip from me to you.
1105000	1110000	Ace the first area, the little England area. If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.
1110000	1114000	And it's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge.
1114000	1118000	But if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.
1118000	1121000	If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.
1121000	1123000	So it's pretty awesome.
1123000	1127000	As you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.
1127000	1133000	It's a lot of fun and just exploring it and there's so much more potential this game has.
1133000	1135000	Does the game have minor flaws?
1135000	1140000	Yeah. Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.
1140000	1143000	There are some frame rate issues sometimes.
1143000	1146000	When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.
1146000	1156000	But I don't know. I look past all that because I still see laid out in front of me an amazing game that I think is going to still be a big deal a year from now.
1156000	1166000	I just hope Sony keeps it under control with how much they hoard this because there's really the potential to microtransaction the shit out of this game and just make it old real fast.
1166000	1171000	But so far, they released a Halloween costume, albeit a week late.
1171000	1174000	But there's been a lot of neat things in LittleBigPlanet.
1174000	1178000	So if you have a PlayStation 3, get it. You're going to love it.
1178000	1183000	If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?
1183000	1191000	That's a big investment. Especially, I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.
1191000	1195000	Maybe not. You really have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons.
1195000	1201000	But hey, Christmas is coming around. You're going to be getting gift certificates. It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that fancy stuff.
1201000	1212000	Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 80-gig system and you get a $100 gift card.
1212000	1214000	Which is not a bad deal.
1214000	1215000	It is not a bad deal.
1215000	1219000	Solid Goomba in chat says, too late Rob, I already did.
1219000	1225000	You know what? To be honest, remember the golden rule of gaming we always talk about on Orange Laundry.
1225000	1228000	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1228000	1237000	I had my foot down. I was not going to buy a PlayStation 3 until the games were out that I wanted to finally start playing.
1237000	1240000	And LittleBigPlanet was the first must-have for me.
1240000	1245000	And then I was finally like, you know, I really want to have a Blu-ray player. They're not making the HD DVDs anymore.
1245000	1248000	I want to have a better player hooked up to my HDTV.
1248000	1254000	And between that and knowing that home is on the horizon and so on and so on, I finally decided to take the plunge.
1254000	1256000	Honestly, I've been liking the system.
1256000	1259000	We did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out.
1259000	1264000	But through the magic of patches and all this stuff, they've been making the system quite a bit better.
1264000	1266000	And now the games are really starting to come out.
1266000	1269000	I use it a lot for streaming video files.
1269000	1273000	Like, for example, we had the Halloween party we went to.
1273000	1279000	We downloaded a copy of a synced version of the Rift Tracks for Harry Potter and the Goblet of...
1279000	1282000	Or not Goblet of Fire, the...
1282000	1285000	Sorcerer's Stone? The second one.
1285000	1287000	Chamber of Secrets.
1287000	1288000	Wow.
1288000	1289000	We're bad muggles.
1289000	1291000	It was hilarious.
1291000	1292000	Nice.
1292000	1294000	What did you do to my cat?
1294000	1296000	You will now become a new cat.
1296000	1302000	I always thought it was interesting. Honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.
1302000	1307000	But it's so odd to me that the freaking, like, Microsoft Vista...
1307000	1310000	What do they call that? The whole media sharing media center?
1310000	1314000	That whole thing on the 360? What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.
1314000	1316000	It's slow and it doesn't work.
1316000	1319000	If you use that. Never use that though.
1319000	1322000	I actually set it up. I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.
1322000	1325000	It is slow as hell. It doesn't work right at all.
1325000	1328000	PlayStation 3? I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.
1328000	1329000	Yes.
1329000	1330000	In one minute.
1330000	1332000	What you need to do, what I normally use...
1332000	1336000	I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.
1336000	1338000	I'm hoping the NXC makes that all go away.
1338000	1340000	Media center is really old though.
1340000	1344000	What you need to use, I use Teversity, which is awesome.
1344000	1348000	And, you know, I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.
1348000	1351000	I prefer my PS3. I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.
1351000	1355000	And I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.
1355000	1358000	And don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product
1358000	1360000	would interface better with Windows than Sony.
1360000	1361000	Five minutes.
1361000	1366000	You see, I don't really use the Zune stuff for their new media center.
1366000	1369000	Or, not media center, Windows Media.
1369000	1373000	Because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up and up.
1373000	1379000	So, Teversity works really well with those not so legitimate copies of Windows.
1379000	1383000	Well, mine's the real deal because it came with my computer and everything.
1383000	1387000	And it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.
1387000	1391000	But, don't get me wrong, the Sony is not perfect because I've had problems.
1391000	1394000	You can't run that and your internet thing at the same time,
1394000	1396000	or you'll keep getting booted off the internet.
1396000	1398000	So, you do kind of, it has its own faults.
1398000	1402000	But, as far as streaming video for a party or whatever, it works far better.
1402000	1405000	By the way, one other game I want to quickly mention, I played the demo for.
1405000	1407000	I don't think the full game is out yet.
1407000	1408000	I think it comes out next week.
1408000	1410000	It is out? I might have to pick it up.
1410000	1414000	Valkyria Chronicles from Sega.
1414000	1418000	Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.
1418000	1423000	It's kind of like an RTS type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.
1423000	1428000	Like, it's first person, like you go from the top,
1428000	1432000	like the way it zooms in from this top down view into a first person view,
1432000	1436000	and then you move your pieces around like live and attack things.
1436000	1438000	It's actually kind of neat.
1438000	1440000	And, from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.
1440000	1443000	I might pick that one up. I actually had quite a good time with that.
1443000	1446000	So, check out the demo if you haven't, Valkyria Chronicles.
1446000	1451000	Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.
1451000	1454000	Dark Soccer, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week,
1454000	1457000	but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.
1457000	1460000	I want to say something about the podcast delays,
1460000	1463000	because I've been getting some emails about it,
1463000	1465000	and I've seen posts on the forums about it,
1465000	1468000	and that the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.
1468000	1470000	It took a couple weeks to get on the feed,
1470000	1472000	and I'm really sorry about that, you guys.
1472000	1474000	It's never our intent to, like,
1474000	1477000	and I know it's kind of been like a recurring thing that's been going on lately,
1477000	1479000	is that the shows have been extremely delayed,
1479000	1480000	and I apologize.
1480000	1482000	This whole two computer setup I have going on in the garage
1482000	1486000	has not been very helpful with that.
1486000	1489000	However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine,
1489000	1491000	so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show
1491000	1494000	a hell of a lot faster in the future.
1494000	1495000	So I'm really sorry about that.
1495000	1497000	And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode,
1497000	1500000	and if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny,
1500000	1502000	because we had so many people here in house,
1502000	1504000	so check out episode 300.
1504000	1506000	And, you know, again, I'm really sorry, but please understand,
1506000	1509000	you know, I usually am the one that puts all those shows together
1509000	1512000	just because I just have traditionally,
1512000	1515000	and I got so busy before the surgery trying to take care of everything else
1515000	1517000	I was trying to take care of,
1517000	1520000	and then, like, after the surgery, like, literally for a week and a half,
1520000	1524000	I could not bend over to switch the computers to change the cords.
1524000	1527000	Like, I would not, it was too much pain to do that.
1527000	1529000	So, you know, I'm okay now.
1529000	1530000	That's why I was able to get it done now.
1530000	1533000	But, you know, and just with everything else going on in the world,
1533000	1536000	there was just a lot more on my mind than just, you know,
1536000	1539000	Orange Lawn's radio, and honestly, for me,
1539000	1541000	I can't speak for Loki or Dark Soccer,
1541000	1544000	but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything
1544000	1548000	and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.
1548000	1553000	So, I hope you all understand, you know, in the real TV shows,
1553000	1555000	they do, what, like 26 episodes a year?
1555000	1557000	If that, 23, what's a season order?
1557000	1559000	Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?
1559000	1562000	Shit, last season we only had 11 episodes all year?
1562000	1564000	It's usually 26, I think.
1564000	1566000	So, please bear with us.
1566000	1567000	We do our best.
1567000	1568000	It's not an anti-podcast thing.
1568000	1572000	Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example,
1572000	1575000	Little Britain, that's six a season.
1575000	1577000	Yeah, so, there you go.
1577000	1579000	Yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad,
1579000	1581000	like, oh, look at me, cry for me.
1581000	1582000	We're on season 50.
1582000	1586000	I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand,
1586000	1589000	sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.
1589000	1590000	But we're here.
1590000	1594000	We're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule
1594000	1597000	of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.
1597000	1599000	Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday,
1599000	1602000	to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody,
1602000	1605000	because, again, it's a great show.
1605000	1606000	I had a lot of fun.
1606000	1608000	Loki came in costume, if you haven't heard it yet.
1608000	1611000	He did finally wear a costume for all you people.
1611000	1613000	It's not the one you'd expect.
1613000	1616000	He dressed up as Sackboy from Little Big Planet,
1616000	1618000	but I want to ask a quick follow-up before we get into
1618000	1619000	tonight's gaming news.
1619000	1623000	How did the Sackboy costume go over at the Halloween party?
1623000	1624000	It went over well.
1624000	1627000	Well, at the Halloween party, I won second place.
1627000	1628000	What did you lose to?
1628000	1629000	My sister.
1629000	1631000	She won with grr.
1631000	1635000	Oh, like, was she, like, a full-blown grr?
1635000	1636000	Yeah.
1636000	1637000	Well, that's pretty awesome.
1637000	1639000	If you're going to lose to anything, lose to her.
1639000	1640000	Well, it's all good, you know.
1640000	1642000	And it was just for fun.
1642000	1645000	You have, like, this family to be reckoned with
1645000	1647000	in Halloween costume contests.
1647000	1649000	Well, I normally don't make costumes.
1649000	1653000	I mean, this is, like, the first costume I've made, period.
1653000	1656000	So she makes stuff all the time.
1656000	1658000	Like, she did, like, a fawn one year,
1658000	1662000	where she actually made, like, the fawn legs and everything,
1662000	1665000	because she was really, she's real into, like, the fantasy,
1665000	1667000	Kralka-Linardia crap, you know,
1667000	1669000	just, like, the whole fantasy world
1669000	1672000	and the mythological creatures and that kind of crap.
1672000	1675000	So, yeah, so that's, I won second there.
1675000	1676000	I mean, it was just for fun.
1676000	1677000	It was just whatever.
1677000	1680000	And then at my work, I won most original costume,
1680000	1681000	which is cool.
1681000	1682000	That's awesome.
1682000	1684000	And you haven't mentioned this yet,
1684000	1685000	but I don't even know if you know,
1685000	1687000	but there's some blog out there.
1687000	1689000	I think the dude who actually made the costume.
1689000	1690000	Yeah, I sent him the email.
1690000	1691000	He put your picture on it.
1691000	1692000	Yeah, because I sent him an email.
1692000	1693000	Nice.
1693000	1694000	So you're actually, if you want to,
1694000	1696000	if you haven't seen Loki in the costume yet,
1696000	1697000	what's the blog?
1697000	1698000	MakeAsackBoy.com.

1699000	1700000	Loki's right there in the OLR shirt.
1700000	1702000	What a great plug for the show.
1702000	1703000	Good job, Loki.
1703000	1704000	Mm-hmm.
1704000	1705000	Good job.
1705000	1707000	All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1707000	1708000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1708000	1710000	All right, let's start things off.
1710000	1713000	We'll talk about a program called Boku.
1713000	1717000	And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer
1717000	1718000	to the little big planet.
1718000	1721000	It's a programming language meant, well,
1721000	1723000	it looks like it's meant for little kids.
1723000	1727000	And basically, you can use this to create your own games.
1727000	1733000	And, you know, it's sort of like XNA to a certain extent.
1733000	1737000	And we've talked about this before.
1737000	1741000	Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282,
1741000	1744000	back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a...
1744000	1747000	Damn, episode number and everything.
1747000	1748000	Nice, Loki.
1748000	1749000	Very nice.
1749000	1754000	Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.
1754000	1757000	They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters
1757000	1758000	and whether I liked them or not.
1758000	1760000	So I hated them all.
1760000	1762000	No, they were all right.
1762000	1767000	But the programming language itself, it looks very basic.
1767000	1769000	But, you know, much like little big planet,
1769000	1771000	you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it.
1771000	1774000	And they showed some examples of different games.
1774000	1778000	And there's basic AI that you can assign to objects
1778000	1781000	and tell them how they behave and that kind of thing.
1781000	1784000	And the games itself look like they're...
1784000	1786000	The levels almost look like they're made out of Legos,
1786000	1787000	which is kind of cool.
1787000	1792000	So, no word on when exactly this is going to be available.
1792000	1795000	I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.
1795000	1801000	They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.
1801000	1804000	And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week,
1804000	1806000	although it's been at a few different conventions.
1806000	1807000	It's just been so much...
1807000	1810000	Didn't they have a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo,
1810000	1811000	if I remember right?
1811000	1812000	There was something about it.
1812000	1814000	It was almost like an informational thing only,
1814000	1815000	if I remember right.
1815000	1816000	No, no, the thing at...
1816000	1817000	I thought I saw it somewhere.
1817000	1820000	No, the thing at Penny Arcade was something different.
1820000	1821000	That was not Boku.
1821000	1824000	That was...
1824000	1826000	Well, it was similar to Boku.
1826000	1828000	It wasn't quite the same thing.
1828000	1831000	It was...
1831000	1834000	I don't remember what they called it at the time,
1834000	1836000	but this is totally different than that.
1836000	1837000	No, that's alright.
1837000	1839000	The program that they were showing off was...
1839000	1841000	That was really basic.
1841000	1843000	It was for Flash games, I think.
1843000	1846000	And, I mean, you're talking like stuff...
1846000	1849000	I don't know if anyone remembers Maxis's...
1849000	1850000	Click and Play.
1850000	1851000	God, I love that game.
1851000	1853000	But it's that basic.
1853000	1855000	Actually, it was even more basic than that.
1855000	1857000	The one that they were showing off at Penny Arcade Expo,
1857000	1859000	and I can't remember for the life of me what it was called,
1859000	1861000	but it wasn't Boku, because I would have remembered that.
1861000	1863000	No worries.
1863000	1866000	But this, though, is supposed to be available,
1866000	1867000	I guess it looks like now.
1867000	1869000	They're saying early next year.
1869000	1870000	So, it's pretty cool.
1870000	1871000	And they have a video.
1871000	1873000	If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra,
1873000	1875000	and they have it mirrored on joystick.
1875000	1877000	So, you know, definitely check it out.
1877000	1879000	It's pretty cool looking.
1879000	1882000	It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.
1882000	1884000	And you know what's funny is the entire time
1884000	1887000	that I was playing LittleBigPlanet,
1887000	1888000	I was thinking,
1888000	1891000	how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?
1891000	1892000	Honestly.
1892000	1896000	Because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by.
1896000	1897000	You know what I mean?
1897000	1899000	They're always trying to one-up, especially Sony.
1899000	1902000	So, it's just funny that this is coming to light.
1902000	1903000	Hey, don't forget about us.
1903000	1904000	We got a game coming.
1904000	1905000	Well, yeah.
1905000	1908000	I mean, this has been around for a while now.
1908000	1911000	It's been in development for at least a few years.
1911000	1914000	So, I don't know.
1914000	1921000	They definitely won't be the last people to do something similar to LittleBigPlanet.
1921000	1923000	I mean, this is, I think, going to be a trend going forward.
1923000	1926000	You're going to have a lot more games where it's all about creating stuff
1926000	1928000	and sharing it with the community and that kind of stuff.
1928000	1930000	Because that's what people like.
1930000	1933000	They like being creative and having the tools to be creative.
1933000	1934000	All right.
1934000	1938000	Well, I'm very curious to see what Xbox's kind of response is to this.
1938000	1939000	So, we'll see.
1939000	1941000	You know, it's something I would definitely give it a try.
1941000	1944000	I mean, I like making games and I think it'd be fun.
1944000	1946000	SonicM88 in chat, chat.ornisontraday.com says,
1946000	1949000	I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.
1949000	1951000	I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.
1951000	1953000	That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.
1953000	1955000	There's so many games out there to catch up on.
1955000	1956000	It's insanity.
1956000	1957000	Well, the thing is-
1957000	1959000	But, of course, this is the holidays every year.
1959000	1960000	Yeah.
1960000	1963000	And also, you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.
1963000	1968000	I mean, especially during the holiday, it feels like you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.
1968000	1973000	You know, like, Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I gotta get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.
1973000	1975000	But, I'm like, I got too much shit I gotta play.
1975000	1976000	I'm not gonna go buy another game.
1976000	1977000	That's how I feel.
1977000	1982000	Because I've heard, like, Fallout 3 is Oblivion with guns and nothing could, like, sell a game better for me.
1982000	1986000	But, I just, I don't have fucking time between all the other games I'm trying to play.
1986000	1988000	And then, add on top of that Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.
1988000	1990000	And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.
1990000	1991000	Addict.
1991000	1994000	Oh, it sounds like Dark Sakura's here with us.
1994000	1995000	How are you doing, Jamie?
1995000	1997000	I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.
1997000	1998000	There you go.
1998000	1999000	Oh, you sound a little raspy.
1999000	2000000	Have you been yelling a lot today?
2000000	2002000	I've been yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.
2002000	2003000	Alright.
2003000	2007000	Did you notice at the top of Part B, a little bit where Dark Sakura's been screaming her head off at?
2007000	2009000	Did you notice I have a giant sandwich?
2009000	2010000	It was a lot more giant earlier.
2010000	2012000	Holy fucking shit.
2012000	2014000	That's a 24-inch family-sized sandwich.
2014000	2015000	You didn't talk about this on the show.
2015000	2017000	You just talked about it on JustinTV before we went live.
2017000	2020000	I have only one word to ask in regards to that sandwich.
2020000	2021000	Yes.
2021000	2022000	Why?
2022000	2024000	Because I'm hungry.
2024000	2029000	Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.
2029000	2033000	I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.
2033000	2036000	It's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.
2036000	2037000	Yes.
2037000	2038000	And Dunkin' Donuts, even, I think.
2038000	2040000	I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.
2040000	2046000	Togo's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.
2046000	2051000	Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.
2051000	2056000	But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.
2056000	2061000	And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.
2061000	2063000	I'm like, family-sized sandwich?
2063000	2065000	They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.
2065000	2067000	I'm like, really, you say?
2067000	2070000	That is a size that I was unaware of.
2070000	2073000	And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.
2073000	2075000	24 inches for you, not them?
2075000	2083000	And so, basically, what I'm going to do with this is, it's not I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it, like, throughout the week.
2083000	2086000	So, it's lunch for all week.
2086000	2088000	How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?
2088000	2089000	20 bucks.
2089000	2095000	You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?
2095000	2096000	That's not bad.
2096000	2097000	That isn't bad.
2097000	2098000	That's not bad at all.
2098000	2100000	I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.
2100000	2106000	It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about 2 bucks, and then, so it's, like, 90 bucks.
2106000	2107000	Doesn't Subway do something?
2107000	2112000	These drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs without profit?
2112000	2113000	Yeah, yeah.
2113000	2114000	Like, 5 cents.
2114000	2116000	Doesn't Subway have a similar thing?
2116000	2119000	I mean, most sub-shops do. I'm pretty sure Quiznos does the huge subs, too, if you ask.
2119000	2120000	Quiznos, yeah.
2120000	2124000	Yeah, but this is something that they actually have available, like, anytime.
2124000	2129000	Normally, if you order a sandwich that's larger than, like, Subway, they don't make anything larger than a foot.
2129000	2130000	Oh, yeah.
2130000	2132000	Because that's their thing, their foot long.
2132000	2138000	But, you know, you can go in there, in fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than 2 feet.
2138000	2141000	I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.
2141000	2144000	But, no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger,
2144000	2148000	because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a 3-foot-long sandwich to come in to work with that,
2148000	2151000	because it'd be funny, because people are like, what the hell are you doing?
2151000	2153000	They've done that for work events where I worked before.
2153000	2158000	I usually save these things till the end of the show, but it just, it works too much now.
2158000	2163000	You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews,
2163000	2168000	because, you know, it makes us feel really good about what we're doing, it helps us spread the word out about our show,
2168000	2169000	and increases our rankings in iTunes.
2169000	2170000	And we need our E-peen stroked.
2170000	2172000	We do, we need our E-peen stroked once in a while.
2172000	2177000	And a couple of you have stroked in the past couple weeks, including this review from Biohaze20,
2177000	2179000	who says, one of the best podcasts out there.
2179000	2181000	And, yes, this is related.
2181000	2186000	Orange Lawns Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.
2186000	2195000	And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.
2195000	2199000	Dear Orange Lawns Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.
2199000	2200000	All right.
2200000	2201000	Signed, Jamie.
2201000	2205000	I was just hoping they'd have some really cool, like, long box that you could put it in or something,
2205000	2210000	because they didn't, they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to, like, take it home and, I don't know.
2210000	2212000	And I didn't have them cut it either, because I figured that would-
2212000	2215000	All right, enough sandwich! Jesus.
2215000	2219000	Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.
2219000	2223000	All right. How was your gaming week, of all things?
2223000	2225000	I played Fable 2 a little bit.
2225000	2226000	And what'd you think?
2226000	2231000	I smashed beetles, and I tried to be a good little girl.
2231000	2233000	Dan had an interesting experience.
2233000	2237000	He is a big beefy man, got turned into a big beefy woman.
2237000	2239000	He drank the gender potion.
2239000	2242000	And so he decided just to be evil.
2242000	2247000	And went around killing everybody, and his dog turned black, and he lost his halo and grew horns.
2247000	2248000	Awesome.
2248000	2249000	The end.
2249000	2252000	I still haven't played Fable 2, I'm having to live another one of those games on the back burner.
2252000	2261000	Also, one of our listeners, who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat,
2261000	2263000	so I'm just gonna say Rob.
2263000	2265000	And it's a good name.
2265000	2266000	Yes, it's a very good name.
2266000	2269000	I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.
2269000	2270000	Nice.
2270000	2275000	So, I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming.
2275000	2281000	Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?
2281000	2284000	I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.
2284000	2287000	Alright, fair enough.
2287000	2296000	I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality, and instead move to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever.
2296000	2297000	Fair enough.
2297000	2299000	And in your DS game, he will be.
2299000	2300000	Yes.
2300000	2301000	So there you, you just have to never watch the show again.
2301000	2304000	It's just it's got Martha in it, and Martha's not fun.
2304000	2306000	I like Donna.
2306000	2307000	Dr. Donna.
2307000	2308000	What else was I gonna ask you?
2308000	2309000	Oh, you!
2309000	2310000	You!
2310000	2311000	What?
2311000	2312000	You need to play LittleBigPlanet.
2312000	2313000	I'm gonna!
2313000	2314000	It is, when it arrives.
2314000	2315000	Rocking amazing.
2315000	2316000	We're supposed to get a free copy.
2316000	2325000	And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in the traditional English style, making those little puns,
2325000	2326000	I think of you.
2326000	2328000	Because I know you live for that stuff.
2328000	2329000	I want to move there.
2329000	2331000	The narrator is some famous guy too.
2331000	2332000	He's the guy that narrates.
2332000	2334000	He's the witch hanker's guy from the galaxy.
2334000	2335000	Yeah, he's.
2335000	2336000	Oh, sweet.
2336000	2337000	Yeah, he's pretty famous.
2337000	2338000	I want to move there, okay?
2338000	2340000	You want to move to LittleBigPlanet?
2340000	2341000	No.
2341000	2342000	It's pretty rad.
2342000	2344000	You can decorate your pod and fire.
2344000	2346000	I want to, sweet.
2346000	2347000	You know.
2347000	2350000	There's levels on there that are just, fire!
2350000	2353000	You know I'm gonna have HellPod.
2353000	2354000	You should.
2354000	2355000	Anyhow.
2355000	2357000	But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but I am proud to say.
2357000	2358000	Yes.
2358000	2363000	I finished the entirety of season two of Supernatural, and I'm moving on to season three.
2363000	2365000	Quel Tipo, Stephen Fry is the gentleman's name.
2365000	2366000	Thank you.
2366000	2367000	It was on the tip of my tongue.
2367000	2368000	I didn't want to have to go look it up because I'm lazy.
2368000	2370000	I am going to be watching more Supernatural.
2370000	2374000	I vow by the end of the semester, I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.
2374000	2377000	Because that is now my favorite TV show.
2377000	2379000	Is that on the CW?
2379000	2380000	Yes.
2380000	2381000	Yes.
2381000	2382000	You know what else they show on the CW?
2382000	2383000	What?
2383000	2384000	90210.
2384000	2385000	Just saying.
2385000	2387000	It's alternate reality, Rob.
2387000	2389000	You shut your mouth.
2389000	2393000	Apparently post episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.
2393000	2394000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
2394000	2395000	You know what?
2395000	2396000	Excuse me.
2396000	2397000	Masters of the Wiki.
2397000	2402000	Can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?
2402000	2406000	Also, I ate at a very good restaurant speaking of food.
2406000	2407000	Not today.
2407000	2409000	Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?
2409000	2410000	I have to talk about it, Rob.
2410000	2411000	Alright.
2411000	2414000	It's called Something Bohem.
2414000	2415000	Lost Something Bohem.
2415000	2416000	Lovey Bohem?
2416000	2417000	Like the Rent song?
2417000	2418000	No, but it's kind of.
2418000	2420000	Okay, it's an Italian song.
2420000	2422000	It's an Italian Czech restaurant.
2422000	2423000	Nice.
2423000	2428000	They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an
2428000	2431000	Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.
2431000	2438000	I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi, and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy.
2438000	2439000	What?
2439000	2440000	Shut your mouth.
2440000	2442000	Just talk about Shaft.
2442000	2444000	Shut your mouth and chew.
2444000	2447000	So, I had to share that antidote.
2447000	2451000	So, in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme
2451000	2452000	from Shaft?
2452000	2454000	At least once per meal.
2454000	2455000	Alright.
2455000	2459000	Well, back to gaming news.
2459000	2462000	I don't know what to say, but hey, if you like to blow things up.
2462000	2463000	That would be us.
2463000	2465000	Who doesn't like to blow things up?
2465000	2470000	You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8, and Dark
2470000	2473000	Sakura's a bit of a vigilante herself.
2473000	2478000	It's actually, speaking of Shaft, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel
2478000	2483000	to it, so maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.
2483000	2484000	It's kind of the sequel.
2484000	2485000	You know what?
2485000	2486000	It was really good food, okay?
2486000	2488000	It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.
2488000	2490000	It had really, really good beer on tap.
2490000	2491000	Nice.
2491000	2494000	And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.
2494000	2495000	Does it have good beer?
2495000	2496000	Actually, this is an old game.
2496000	2497000	It's being remade.
2497000	2499000	Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.
2499000	2501000	Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?
2501000	2502000	No, original PlayStation.
2502000	2503000	Alright, well there you go.
2503000	2505000	But now you can play it online with eight people.
2505000	2506000	That's why it's Vigilante 8.
2506000	2508000	I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.
2508000	2510000	800 Microsoft points for the game.
2510000	2511000	Does it have good beer?
2511000	2512000	I don't know.
2512000	2514000	You can drive a bus.
2514000	2516000	A school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.
2516000	2517000	School bus.
2517000	2519000	Was that last week's release?
2519000	2520000	Yeah, this week.
2520000	2523000	You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.
2523000	2524000	Well, we were off for a week.
2524000	2527000	What's coming out this week on this Wednesday?
2527000	2528000	I know it's coming out next week.
2528000	2531000	I don't know about this week.
2531000	2532000	It's next week's...
2532000	2536000	Well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.
2536000	2537000	This week...
2537000	2540000	I don't know what's coming out this week.
2540000	2543000	I'm sure we'll learn soon enough.
2543000	2546000	Alright, well let's move on.
2546000	2548000	Yes, so one thing that...
2548000	2553000	Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War.
2553000	2558000	They have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.
2558000	2564000	Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon since the game comes out in a couple days anyways.
2564000	2567000	So, yeah.
2567000	2568000	But at least it's kind of cool.
2568000	2573000	What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody.
2573000	2580000	And apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs.
2580000	2583000	And it's all sorts of fun.
2583000	2587000	But for the full game, you'll have to play it.
2587000	2588000	I think it comes out on the 12th.
2588000	2592000	How much does 890 megs actually weigh?
2592000	2593000	Not much.
2593000	2595000	Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.
2595000	2598000	They're not light if one falls on your head.
2598000	2600000	My first hard drive in my first computer...
2600000	2601000	They hurt.
2601000	2603000	My first hard drive in my first computer, PC...
2603000	2607000	Back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.
2607000	2608000	Okay, my first hard drive...
2608000	2609000	486!
2609000	2611000	It was a 3... no, I remember.
2611000	2612000	286.
2612000	2613000	I remember clearly.
2613000	2615000	A 386 SX16.
2615000	2617000	Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.
2617000	2618000	SX for sexy.
2618000	2619000	Yes, exactly.
2619000	2620000	SX for sex.
2620000	2621000	That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.
2621000	2622000	Was it Scuzzy?
2622000	2623000	But here's the thing.
2623000	2626000	It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.
2626000	2628000	Oh my god, Rob!
2628000	2632000	And that's how I got on Prodigy to post my intentions.
2632000	2633000	You know what we used to call Prodigy?
2633000	2634000	Huh?
2634000	2635000	Buttigy.
2635000	2636000	I always heard Prodigy.
2636000	2639000	I remember we had a 386 FX 20.
2639000	2642000	And the 20, that was when it was running in turbo mode.
2642000	2643000	That's right!
2643000	2644000	Computers with turbo buttons.
2644000	2646000	Because who didn't use the fucking turbo button?
2646000	2647000	I mean, really.
2647000	2650000	Unless you were trying to play an old ass game.
2650000	2656000	Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?
2656000	2657000	I know, and seriously now.
2657000	2659000	So I remember, and that thing was a brick.
2659000	2664000	Because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later.
2664000	2668000	And now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too.
2668000	2671000	Now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.
2671000	2673000	Amazing memory is so damn cheap.
2673000	2674000	Technology.
2674000	2678000	I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.
2678000	2680000	You're quite feisty today.
2680000	2681000	I think I rather like it.
2681000	2683000	Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.
2683000	2686000	You need to have wine, you need to get loaded more often before coming to the show.
2686000	2687000	I'm not loaded!
2687000	2688000	I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.
2688000	2689000	Exactly.
2689000	2690000	But you need to loosen up a little bit.
2690000	2694000	I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.
2694000	2695000	That's cool, that's cool.
2695000	2699000	All right, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again since we're talking a little bit retro.
2699000	2704000	I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.
2704000	2706000	It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.
2706000	2709000	They are saying the game will come out in November.
2709000	2714000	And hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere.
2714000	2715000	Don't you think?
2715000	2716000	Yes.
2716000	2718000	Even though, isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?
2718000	2719000	Yes it is.
2719000	2721000	So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.
2721000	2728000	But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.
2728000	2729000	So there you go.
2729000	2735000	So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.
2735000	2740000	You never know, if the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.
2740000	2741000	But they have submitted it.
2741000	2743000	It is very soon to go.
2743000	2750000	Yes, and if you can't wait that long, well this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.
2750000	2757000	It's a Street Fighter themed level and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft Points.
2757000	2760000	And hmm, looks pretty cool.
2760000	2763000	That's not bad though. 200 Microsoft Points is what? 250?
2763000	2765000	Now Jamie, you would probably know this.
2765000	2769000	Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables?
2769000	2774000	There was one. There was, oh god, and I've played one before. It wasn't very good.
2774000	2776000	That's too bad.
2776000	2779000	I seem to recall that too. I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.
2779000	2785000	If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body. I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.
2785000	2790000	You know, I'm going to find out actually. I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.
2790000	2792000	But this is not a remake of that table.
2792000	2796000	This is to celebrate the HD remix coming out, so it's not that.
2796000	2799000	But not all tables based on video games are bad.
2799000	2802000	One of my favorite, favorite tables they ever did was the Mario Brothers table.
2802000	2805000	Not the little one, because there were two versions of it.
2805000	2808000	There was a tiny one that was for kids and there was a big one.
2808000	2810000	It was a Gottlob.
2810000	2813000	And so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlob game.
2813000	2815000	And that was a lot of fun speaking of pinball.
2815000	2818000	The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.
2818000	2820000	I think that's the one I'm thinking of. I think that's it.
2820000	2822000	I wonder if that was in Mario World.
2822000	2827000	No, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlob collection for Wii?
2827000	2832000	It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but I doubt it.
2832000	2835000	The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlob.
2835000	2836000	Gottlob was in the UK.
2836000	2842000	It was a Street Fighter II pinball that was developed by Gottlob in 1993.
2842000	2848000	And I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it, so I am personally not...
2848000	2853000	Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice, I mean, pinball is pinball.
2853000	2861000	And there are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.
2861000	2864000	Actually, we picked up a new pinball table. Did I tell you?
2864000	2865000	No, what'd you get?
2865000	2868000	We have a Revenge from Mars.
2868000	2869000	No, take that back.
2869000	2870000	Oh, wow.
2870000	2871000	I take that back. We have an Episode 1.
2871000	2873000	Wow, that's cool.
2873000	2874000	Yeah, we picked up...
2874000	2876000	That's a hologram one. Those are rad.
2876000	2877000	What do they call it? The pin 2000 or whatever?
2877000	2881000	Pinball 2000, exactly. We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.
2881000	2882000	Nice.
2882000	2884000	I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.
2884000	2887000	Are there some good... Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?
2887000	2889000	We should do a pincast.
2889000	2893000	There ought to be a couple others that are already up and running out there. I'm kind of curious.
2893000	2896000	There's only so much pinball news, to be honest.
2896000	2897000	I guess not.
2897000	2898000	Pinball's still got a massive following.
2898000	2901000	Yeah, I mean, they do these conventions and stuff. I mean, I'm sure there's plenty to talk about.
2901000	2907000	I know, but I can't imagine that there's that much. I mean, maybe our podcast is still talking about...
2907000	2913000	Thank you, Frisbee. He says ballcast. I don't know if he's making that up. That could be just a joke, but I don't know.
2913000	2914000	I don't know.
2914000	2919000	All right, well, moving on to other news. You know, the new ExitBox experience is coming out pretty soon,
2919000	2923000	and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test,
2923000	2926000	which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.
2926000	2930000	I didn't even sign up because it was like the... I think it was like the day before my surgery or something.
2930000	2932000	Yeah, it was such a small window.
2932000	2939000	Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part right about now,
2939000	2942000	but that's all right. I had to make do with regular Netflix.
2942000	2949000	But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new XBox experience were cut,
2949000	2958000	and I'm not talking about like things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.
2958000	2962000	I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about they have this big list of things they wanted to accomplish,
2962000	2968000	and according to the head of XBox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said,
2968000	2974000	of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new XBox experience,
2974000	2977000	but, assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.
2977000	2981000	And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.
2981000	2986000	He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do. Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.
2986000	2990000	One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.
2990000	2994000	The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard,
2994000	2999000	and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.
2999000	3001000	These are the type of things we're going to start doing.
3001000	3003000	So a photo party, that sounds kind of neat.
3003000	3006000	Well, that's fine. I mean, I can't say that there's...
3006000	3007000	It's not like there's...
3007000	3015000	Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?
3015000	3019000	What other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?
3019000	3025000	I don't know. I don't know. Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.
3025000	3026000	That's lame. That's what email's for.
3026000	3028000	What the hell is up with your live journal icon?
3028000	3030000	What is up with my live journal icon?
3030000	3031000	It looks like pasta.
3031000	3032000	I don't... Oh.
3032000	3033000	It's shrimp chow.
3033000	3037000	Ask me later. We're trying to do a show here.
3037000	3040000	All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some release dates.
3040000	3047000	Yes. This week there's a ton of stuff coming out. Absolute myriad of things.
3047000	3053000	To start things off, of course, we have Call of Duty World at War coming out on pretty much everything out there.

3062000	3065000	A game we were talking about earlier. Pretty awesome.

3082000	3087000	Pony Friends Mini Breeds Edition on the DS.
3087000	3091000	Populous on the DS. That's kind of neat.
3091000	3094000	They were putting out a... Dude, I remember Populous. That game was awesome.
3094000	3098000	They're putting out a Three Stooges game on PC. I'm sure that'll be awesome.
3098000	3102000	Supposedly they're doing a new Three Stooges movie that's fast tracking for next year.
3102000	3106000	And I think I want to say the Farley Brothers were attached or something?
3106000	3109000	I thought I heard something like that at one time.

3200000	3205000	Except unfortunately for those two systems, you can both cheat on those, so that kind of sucks.

3244000	3246000	Let's see here.

3318000	3324000	And they have a bunch of other crappy games that are coming out like Fantasy Aquarium.
3324000	3329000	But that's pretty much it for the US.
3329000	3334000	Lots of good stuff.
3334000	3336000	And then Rob has disappeared.
3336000	3339000	But it's my turn. He said I could take a turn.
3339000	3341000	There's a whole ton of crap coming out in the UK.

3475000	3483000	Star Wars The Clone Wars Jedi Alliance, Star Wars The Clone Wars Lightsaber Duels, Wii Music,
3483000	3487000	WSC Reel 08, my Wii Music arrived by the way,
3487000	3490000	World Championship Snooker is what it says,
3490000	3494000	EverQuest 2 The Shadow Odyssey Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack.
3494000	3496000	Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. Those are actually the 18th.
3496000	3497000	Yeah, I'm done.
3497000	3498000	That's alright, alright.
3498000	3504000	You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chat room listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.
3504000	3506000	GS68 says Sing Star Loki.
3506000	3510000	Redertainment says My Horse in Me 2 Adventures in Tijuana.
3510000	3512000	Now that would be a game worth playing.
3512000	3516000	That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.
3516000	3521000	SSG100 Matt says No Sing Star Matters Unless it's Abba Sing Star, you damn right.
3521000	3528000	Redertainment says My Secret Diary, finally a place to go on and on about the things that people could honestly give a rat's ass about.
3528000	3531000	Don't we have that? Isn't it called Live Journal?
3531000	3534000	No, it's called Zonga.
3534000	3535000	I don't use Zonga.
3535000	3539000	Hey Rob, you missed it. They have Hello Kitty Daily, which is a diary.
3539000	3540000	My God.
3540000	3543000	Act Def says Is Top Model Smarter than a 5th Grader?
3543000	3549000	Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader.
3549000	3552000	You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.
3552000	3555000	For what it is, it's not bad.
3555000	3557000	The game itself.
3557000	3562000	But I think the thrill of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader could only really last so long.
3562000	3564000	It's kind of one of those haha for about 15 minutes.
3564000	3569000	I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a 5th grade.
3569000	3570000	Ah, there you go.
3570000	3572000	I think, yeah.
3572000	3575000	But they released the US version here on Xbox Live.
3575000	3580000	Or they could just forego release it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?
3580000	3593000	For what I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck, but the fact is it is a game based off a TV show that can kind of just go away.
3593000	3599000	They should have just called it Are You Smarter than an American and it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone was like,
3599000	3603000	Oh my God, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.
3603000	3605000	Alright.
3605000	3606000	As a collective?
3606000	3607000	As a collective.
3607000	3610000	I'm not, even, forget it.
3610000	3612000	Alright, moving on.
3612000	3614000	Let's talk about Japanese release dates.
3614000	3616000	Speaking of people smarter than Americans.
3616000	3620000	FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on November 13th on the Xbox 360.
3620000	3623000	A brand new Xbox 360 pack.
3623000	3625000	It's the 60 gigabyte live pack.
3625000	3627000	Also comes out in Japan on the 13th.
3627000	3629000	Could that be because The Last Remnant is coming out next week?
3629000	3631000	I don't know.
3631000	3633000	But I'm thinking yes.
3633000	3638000	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.
3638000	3641000	A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.
3641000	3642000	Major League Beast...
3642000	3643000	Beastball?
3643000	3644000	Baseball!
3644000	3645000	Beastball!
3645000	3647000	I'd like to see that.
3647000	3649000	Major League Beastball!
3649000	3652000	No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.
3652000	3655000	Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.
3655000	3661000	Also Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey race then there you go.
3661000	3664000	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week.
3664000	3666000	Quite a bit of stuff.
3666000	3668000	New Ono Kids Wii.
3668000	3669000	Jinsei Game Wii.
3669000	3671000	FIFA Soccer 09 Allplay.
3671000	3674000	Because you know EA likes to do the Allplay thing.
3674000	3675000	Family Ski.
3675000	3677000	World Ski and Snowboard if I'm not mistaken.
3677000	3682000	That's the Wii mat game.
3682000	3685000	Wii Fit that uses that, right?
3685000	3688000	No, Family Athletics would be the one.
3688000	3690000	Family Ski was Wii Ski.
3690000	3691000	Oh, okay.
3691000	3694000	Is that a price reduction?
3694000	3698000	No, it's coming out from Namco and it's not a price reduction.
3698000	3700000	That already came out over there unless it's a sequel.
3700000	3701000	Maybe it's a sequel.
3701000	3703000	It could be because this has snowboarding in it too.
3703000	3704000	Oh, I see. There you go.
3704000	3711000	Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Na Kibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of.
3711000	3712000	The Blob.
3712000	3724000	Coming out on the PlayStation 2 if you're still rocking it old school on the PlayStation 2, you are going to have the release of Major League Baseball 2008.
3724000	3731000	As well as Nobunaga gets a price reduction that's specifically Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.
3731000	3736000	And if you've never played a Nobunaga game, go back to the NES and play the very first one.
3736000	3738000	And then take a nap.
3738000	3744000	And grow your rice and make your citizens happy.
3744000	3752000	Also coming out on the portable systems if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out...
3752000	3754000	Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.
3754000	3756000	Ah, Nintendo DS.
3756000	3757000	Some new casings and so on.
3757000	3759000	A game called Juggler.
3759000	3762000	A Nobunaga game gets a price reduction there too.
3762000	3764000	Rhythm to Cooking.
3764000	3765000	That's what they're calling it.
3765000	3769000	Ryusen no Rockman 3, Black Ace, and Red Joker.
3769000	3772000	I'm assuming that's their tactical Mega Man series over there.
3772000	3774000	ZX, er, not the ZX.
3774000	3776000	Mega Man Star Force games.
3776000	3779000	Taisen ka 2chan no Koronope.
3779000	3781000	Zero kara Hajimiru.
3781000	3784000	Otona no 5 Kokugo Numion.
3784000	3786000	But, you know what?
3786000	3790000	All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.
3790000	3795000	I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week. The shells of Almia on DS.
3795000	3796000	Oh really?
3796000	3797000	Yes, I think that's...
3797000	3798000	What makes this Pokemon game special?
3798000	3799000	Nothing.
3799000	3800000	Alright then.
3800000	3803000	On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction.
3803000	3807000	And FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.
3807000	3810000	Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot.
3810000	3824000	But you do have a game called Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hoto Gisuran and Zero Pilot Daisanji Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.
3824000	3826000	Oh, also this one. I'm sorry, I missed this one.
3826000	3828000	This is a pretty big one, I think, over in Japan.
3828000	3831000	It's bolded on my list, which usually means it's a pretty big deal.
3831000	3836000	It's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai.
3836000	3841000	And I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of.
3841000	3846000	I don't know, it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something.
3846000	3852000	But it looks like it is an action game coming out over there.
3852000	3855000	There you go. That's it for Japanese release dates.
3855000	3856000	Alright, cool.
3856000	3858000	What about Zimbabwe?
3858000	3859000	What about it?
3859000	3861000	What about their release dates?
3861000	3864000	Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.
3864000	3866000	I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.
3866000	3870000	I know Australia, cry cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us.
3870000	3873000	But we only have so many hours.
3873000	3881000	Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet,
3881000	3884000	well, there's something that might be able to help you out.
3884000	3888000	Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.
3888000	3894000	They have tools that will allow you to design your levels, basically,
3894000	3898000	and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff.
3898000	3903000	So go to www.LittleBigWorkshop.com and check it out,
3903000	3906000	and you might be able to create the next big level,
3906000	3911000	hopefully not based off of licensed materials, otherwise they'll get yanked offline.
3911000	3913000	I just want to say I did visit that website,
3913000	3917000	and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.
3917000	3920000	You have to use your email address, though, instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.
3920000	3926000	But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually have your own little page on there.
3926000	3929000	It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.
3929000	3933000	You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.
3933000	3940000	It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebook-y update your current status thing.
3940000	3943000	But I don't think it's really something I would practically use.
3943000	3948000	But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.
3948000	3951000	So, pretty cool.
3951000	3954000	And the copyright levels, right?
3954000	3956000	Yes, but that's the thing.
3956000	3964000	There's been a lot of copyrighted levels, or levels with copyrighted materials in them, that are being yanked offline.
3964000	3969000	Included in that, of course, levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.
3969000	3973000	There was even a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.
3973000	3979000	One weird one, though, was there was a level called Failure to Launch that someone took offline.
3979000	3982000	Because, I guess, there's that movie Failure to Launch.
3982000	3983000	That's a little much.
3983000	3988000	Which, to be honest, if you heard Failure to Launch, I don't think you would think of the romantic comedy.
3988000	3989000	No, I wouldn't.
3989000	3993000	Did anyone actually see that movie that plays Little Big Planet? Probably not.
3993000	3997000	Unfortunately, I did. And I can't take that away.
3997000	4000000	But, good comment from GS68 in chat.
4000000	4004000	Blastworks. Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?
4004000	4007000	I mean, not here on OLR. Loki's been hyping this game up forever.
4007000	4009000	Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much, either.
4009000	4014000	Well, here's the interesting thing. GS68 says Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff, and nobody gives a shit.
4014000	4017000	Yeah, it's so far under the radar.
4017000	4021000	Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.
4021000	4025000	But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.
4025000	4029000	Like, that grottiest level is still there. It was there just before we went live tonight.
4029000	4036000	Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works,
4036000	4040000	and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?
4040000	4046000	Yeah, but it's very interesting. I mean, I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show,
4046000	4049000	or at the tail end of Bobby's show when we're usually on.
4049000	4053000	But there's a Batman level out there, too, that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.
4053000	4059000	Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it,
4059000	4062000	and that you even unlock that as a reward.
4062000	4065000	So, there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.
4065000	4068000	Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off, too.
4068000	4072000	Unpublished levels are actually being moderated.
4072000	4074000	Weird. How's that possible?
4074000	4083000	I don't know, but it says, for example, one user posted a strategy, I guess, for keeping a copy of the level offline,
4083000	4086000	and republish it in case it gets deleted.
4086000	4092000	It says, but Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated, too.
4092000	4095000	I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.
4095000	4102000	Weird. Maybe when you break, maybe it's kind of one of those things where, you know, once a crook always a crook,
4102000	4108000	so if you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow, and see if you're infringing in the other places.
4108000	4110000	I don't know. That's weird.
4110000	4112000	That is weird.
4112000	4115000	This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M, or whatever, he said,
4115000	4122000	so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, light-hearted violence have been taken down,
4122000	4125000	like the popular Gears of War demon skull level.
4125000	4127000	Yeah, but it's Gears of War.
4127000	4129000	It didn't get taken down because of the violence.
4129000	4134000	So what's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it,
4134000	4136000	and act to try to please everybody?
4136000	4142000	The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.
4142000	4146000	Like, there's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.
4146000	4150000	I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I've played it in the real game,
4150000	4157000	and, you know, you've got little things dancing on poles, it's no mistaking what it is.
4157000	4158000	It's interesting.
4158000	4163000	Redertainment in Chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.
4163000	4170000	I think yes, you can, because I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues,
4170000	4171000	I think is what it is.
4171000	4174000	I don't think they can moderate your level if you have a public- that's stupid.
4174000	4175000	I don't think so.
4175000	4179000	But, you know, and as far as these people bitching and stuff, though, here's the complication.
4179000	4183000	This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end-user license agreement.
4183000	4188000	And if you want to be, you know, extra safe, just make backups of your saves.
4188000	4193000	I mean, that's really the only thing you can do, and thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.
4193000	4198000	In fact, the other thing is you can, you know, download saves online with the PS3,
4198000	4201000	because none of those are linked to your user account.
4201000	4206000	You can just go, like, on Game Facts, for example, and download stuff, so maybe you could swap levels that way.
4206000	4207000	I don't know.
4207000	4212000	I wish you could, because that would be nice, you know, to be able to download levels that are awesome to play.
4212000	4220000	Really interesting comment from Chat, from Shahram, saying, but that's not as offensive as Two Men Kissing,
4220000	4224000	going back to that whole- what was that?
4224000	4227000	WhatTheyPlay.com poll we talked about months ago.
4227000	4230000	Remember that whole thing where, like, Two Men Kissing was one of the most offensive things?
4230000	4237000	But that had me thinking, boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels,
4237000	4246000	see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.
4246000	4249000	Interesting, to say the least.
4249000	4253000	And make the level called What They Play.
4253000	4257000	I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation,
4257000	4261000	or, you know, because this has been a topic of controversy lately,
4261000	4264000	and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show,
4264000	4268000	but there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.
4268000	4271000	You go through three levels that all center around a wedding,
4271000	4275000	and a crazy bride going after her drunken groom, which, by the way,
4275000	4280000	is my favorite level in the game so far, is the Skulldozer level, if you've played that.
4280000	4285000	It would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms.
4285000	4288000	I'd be very curious to see what happens.
4288000	4291000	Anyhow, now I'm getting ideas for my first level.
4291000	4293000	There you go.
4293000	4296000	Rob Robert's Big Gay Adventure.
4301000	4305000	Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.
4305000	4306000	We'll see what happens.
4306000	4309000	Nothing more inspiring than offending people.
4309000	4311000	It's not offensive!
4311000	4314000	What's offensive about gayety? Nothing!
4314000	4316000	Am I pushing the envelope?
4316000	4318000	No, to other people maybe.
4318000	4319000	Maybe.
4319000	4321000	Is it offensive? It shouldn't be.
4321000	4328000	Anyhow, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.
4328000	4331000	Yep, that's South America for you.
4331000	4333000	It's like, God, man, seriously.
4333000	4337000	I've got some ideas, Bruin. We'll see what happens.
4337000	4340000	Let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.
4340000	4346000	You have to be careful with it, because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff,
4346000	4349000	there are people out there that would play it and think it's real,
4349000	4353000	so there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.
4353000	4356000	And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea,
4356000	4357000	one, I'll cut you.
4357000	4363000	Two, be very careful, because you can push the envelope,
4363000	4367000	but just be careful, because there are some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.
4367000	4370000	Now, Rob, how far have you gotten into LittleBigPlanet?
4370000	4375000	Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the,
4375000	4380000	I just beat the boss, well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.
4380000	4384000	Just past Mexico? Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat?
4384000	4385000	No.
4385000	4387000	Oh, I want a flamethrowing cat.
4387000	4388000	Alright, anyhow.
4388000	4393000	Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff,
4393000	4398000	Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool,
4398000	4404000	so pretty soon you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.
4404000	4406000	Making it even easier to...
4406000	4411000	Even easier to infringe on copyrights galore, but you could also put in pictures of yourself,
4411000	4417000	or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK, which I saw on the 3Speech blog,
4417000	4419000	you can actually put pictures of your family in the game.
4419000	4421000	You can actually see this in one of the commercials.
4421000	4425000	But, who do you believe, because the developer also has come out this week and said,
4425000	4430000	even though it's on their blog, a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums,
4430000	4437000	image importing is technically viable, but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons.
4437000	4439000	But here's the thing.
4439000	4443000	If people want to get their images in the game, they're already doing it.
4443000	4446000	How? By printing it out and holding it in front of the camera.
4446000	4450000	That's what Bobby did in his level, and also in some other levels I've seen out there.
4450000	4452000	There's one level I played.
4452000	4458000	I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s
4458000	4462000	that somebody obviously just held the video box in front of the camera and took a picture of it,
4462000	4467000	which is copyright infringement, but it's how people are getting their pictures in anyway.
4467000	4471000	So, why not make it easier?
4471000	4476000	And as Retertainment says, of course, somebody in chat had to say it, importing porn.
4476000	4480000	Little big porn, says Zach Deft.
4480000	4483000	I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here,
4483000	4486000	but very interesting to see what happens.
4486000	4492000	You know, I think though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.
4492000	4501000	And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.
4501000	4504000	Like, it goes to the bottom of the list, so that people just don't find it.
4504000	4510000	But I don't know about this whole crazy going onto your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the list.
4510000	4515000	I have a problem with them moderating stuff that's on your system, because that's your stuff.
4515000	4520000	If I want to make a Batman level, I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends.
4520000	4527000	Now, I do have a problem with them taking it offline, because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever,
4527000	4532000	they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else. That's fine. They should be able to do that.
4532000	4541000	But, at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.
4541000	4546000	I don't see any harm in that, but I'm sure they'll find reasons not to.
4546000	4549000	Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.
4549000	4555000	So, you guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it type of thing.
4555000	4558000	I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.
4558000	4561000	This game has the potential to get so big, if it isn't already.
4561000	4566000	And it's not like building these levels is that easy.
4566000	4569000	I mean, the creator can get pretty involved.
4569000	4576000	I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build the level.
4576000	4580000	I mean, it's as easy as it can get, considering how intricate your levels can get.
4580000	4586000	But, you know, if they just delete your level, that's a lot of time.
4586000	4590000	I think Bobby said on his show tonight when I was listening, it took him like eight hours to build that level.
4590000	4593000	Which, with all due respect to the level and the fun I had playing it,
4593000	4598000	was not nearly as complex as some of the things I've seen on LittleBigPlanet so far.
4598000	4599000	Yeah.
4599000	4601000	Because he used the basic artwork.
4601000	4607000	I mean, he built his own little unique car thing, and used the iToy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.
4607000	4609000	Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.
4609000	4613000	I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.
4613000	4616000	Like there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.
4616000	4617000	It's like nuts.
4617000	4618000	Interesting.
4618000	4620000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
4620000	4621000	We've got so much more news to get to.
4621000	4627000	Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.
4627000	4635000	It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.
4635000	4639000	What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be like Wii remotes.
4639000	4642000	And the way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye.
4642000	4646000	Because the PlayStation Eye has four microphones built into it.
4646000	4649000	Actually, I don't know why it has four microphones built into it.
4649000	4651000	Maybe for such a thing.
4651000	4656000	But the way they're going to do it is the camera will track the X and Y movements.
4656000	4663000	Whereas the ultrasonic part of it will detect how far away the controller is from the camera.
4663000	4665000	So that will control the Z axis.
4665000	4670000	So with that, you could have a 3D controller much like the Wii remote is.
4670000	4672000	Which is kind of neat.
4672000	4676000	And that would be the way to integrate it, I guess, now with the current technology that they have on the system.
4676000	4678000	Hmm.
4678000	4684000	So maybe sometime soon, maybe we'll see a new controller or something.
4684000	4687000	Do you think this is something for Sony's next system?
4687000	4690000	Or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one?
4690000	4694000	I think it's their current one because on the actual patent, it says PS3 on it.
4694000	4699000	And it's showing the Wi-Fi and the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that.
4699000	4701000	Hmm.
4701000	4704000	I mean, it makes sense if they want to expand out.
4704000	4707000	Because right now, I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games.
4707000	4714000	I mean, they do have LittleBigPlanet, but there's nothing that's really like get in and just play.
4714000	4716000	Even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff.
4716000	4718000	They have a little bit more than Sony.
4718000	4725000	But I mean, the Wii's got to be big time with casual, more family friendly just play type of stuff.
4725000	4727000	You know, like tennis or something.
4727000	4730000	Is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now?
4730000	4731000	No.
4731000	4732000	Okay.
4732000	4734000	Alright, I look like a sex toy.
4734000	4740000	No, it's something that was posted in chat there saying it was a hoax, this other one.
4740000	4743000	I just want to make sure it wasn't the same thing you were talking about, but it's something completely different.
4743000	4744000	No.
4744000	4750000	Alright, something else completely different from Sony games and LittleBigPlanet.
4750000	4751000	Sega!
4751000	4753000	Who doesn't love Sega, right DarkSakura?
4753000	4754000	Sony.
4754000	4756000	But here's...
4756000	4759000	Well, Sega makes games for Sony now, so I would hope they like them now.
4759000	4766000	But, you know, the thing about Sega is, boy, do they know how to whore their 16-bit nostalgia.
4766000	4767000	And guess what?
4767000	4769000	They're going to whore it all over again.
4769000	4774000	Sega has announced this week the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.
4774000	4782000	It's 40 titles that were on the Genesis for next gen systems.
4782000	4787000	This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4787000	4793000	It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vectorman 2 and everything in between,
4793000	4801000	including Golden Axe, all three of them, Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kidd Chameleon, Echo One, Echo Two,
4801000	4808000	Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3, Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, pretty much all your...
4808000	4810000	I think Spinball is in there, too.
4810000	4811000	Was Sonic Spinball in there?
4811000	4812000	Yes, it was.
4812000	4818000	All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection, pretty much, that were first party.
4818000	4820000	They're going to be releasing in Spring 2009.
4820000	4822000	But here's the interesting thing.
4822000	4826000	You might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?
4826000	4828000	Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.
4828000	4830000	They've released it as a download.
4830000	4831000	Here's the thing.
4831000	4833000	It's going to output in 720p.
4833000	4839000	And that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go, really?
4839000	4841000	720p for my Genesis game.
4841000	4844000	Yeah, that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics.
4844000	4847000	But just kind of an interesting little addition.
4847000	4850000	It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.
4850000	4851000	Does that make sense?
4851000	4856000	Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are,
4856000	4862000	where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out, I guess, a little bit, and it's kind of blurry.
4862000	4869000	Or you can just do it where it just scales everything up, and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.
4869000	4872000	It's just larger pixels, I guess.
4872000	4875000	Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix,
4875000	4878000	and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.
4878000	4882000	Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?
4882000	4883000	Yes.
4883000	4884000	It's part of the mandate.
4884000	4886000	Now, PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies,
4886000	4889000	but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there,
4889000	4891000	they might as well do the trophies.
4891000	4898000	So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.
4898000	4901000	It's going to be interesting for the achievement horse.
4901000	4905000	And, you know, what's funny is there's no Wii version, which makes sense because...
4905000	4907000	Well, they can't do 720p.
4907000	4908000	Also, virtual console.
4908000	4909000	Yes, exactly.
4909000	4919000	So, hmm, I could pay $8 a pop for the old games, or I could pay $30 for 40.
4919000	4921000	That means, like, 75 cents a game.
4921000	4924000	$8, 75 cents.
4924000	4927000	Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.
4927000	4930000	I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.
4930000	4933000	Hmm, interesting.
4933000	4937000	Frisbee in chat says, who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?
4937000	4939000	He'd be surprised.
4939000	4941000	He would be surprised.
4941000	4943000	Alright, let's move on.
4943000	4947000	Remember, they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.
4947000	4948000	True statement.
4948000	4950000	And that's supposed to be pretty nice, too.
4950000	4952000	They have, like, 30-some games in there as well.
4952000	4954000	So, nice.
4954000	4960000	Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,
4960000	4964000	it's about this time that they need to announce some more WarioWare games.
4964000	4970000	And not to be su- no, not too surprising that they're going to actually have some WarioWare games.
4970000	4972000	Now, I'm not sure if these are actually going to be downloadable games,
4972000	4975000	because it sort of sounds like they might be.
4975000	4979000	One of the games they have is called WarioWare Myself.
4979000	4987000	And I guess it's supposedly some sort of game where you can actually use user-created content as well.
4987000	4993000	Players will be able to reportedly create their own frantic minigames and share them with others.
4993000	4995000	So that kind of sounds cool.
4995000	5000000	There's also talks of, like, a WiiWare application that allows these creations to be played,
5000000	5003000	though not designed on the Wii.
5003000	5005000	So now that'd be pretty awesome.
5005000	5013000	The DSi is getting a WarioWare photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game,
5013000	5020000	as well as several WarioWare minigames that'll be available to download on the system's online store.
5020000	5027000	So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.
5027000	5029000	I don't know.
5029000	5031000	Interesting.
5031000	5036000	Well, but I do love me some WarioWare, so they're always pretty innovative with what they do,
5036000	5038000	with whatever new piece of thing.
5038000	5041000	I think WarioWare Myself sounds pretty awesome.
5041000	5043000	That'd be very interesting.
5043000	5045000	Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?
5045000	5049000	A remake of Press Your Luck.
5049000	5053000	And I'm not talking about that shatacious show on Game Show Network, Whammy.
5053000	5056000	I'm talking old-school 80s Press Your Luck.
5056000	5058000	You remember this game show? It was one of the best.
5058000	5059000	Oh, hell yeah!
5059000	5061000	No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!
5061000	5062000	You remember that whole thing?
5062000	5065000	I remember the guy who memorized the screens with all that money.
5065000	5068000	Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him,
5068000	5070000	and sadly I missed it, which kind of sucks.
5070000	5072000	But, you know, they had this whole thing,
5072000	5079000	and apparently they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.
5079000	5082000	And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.
5082000	5084000	And it's not just for PC.
5084000	5088000	It's going to be coming for iPods, iPhones, and apparently, consoles.
5088000	5090000	So the people that got the Price is Right,
5090000	5092000	now unfortunately I haven't played the Price is Right game,
5092000	5094000	so I don't know if it's any good or not,
5094000	5100000	but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know,
5100000	5104000	if it's a new game, it's going to have new Whammy animations and all that fun stuff.
5104000	5106000	This is going to be an awesome party game.
5106000	5109000	It has to have the music, the sound, wah wah.
5109000	5112000	I used to have the actual theme song somewhere around here.
5112000	5114000	I'm trying to dig for it right now.
5114000	5116000	But man, Press Your Luck was awesome.
5116000	5118000	I should have more games that are like game show based,
5118000	5119000	because I think that'd be fun.
5119000	5121000	Everyone likes watching game shows.
5121000	5126000	I actually have them like, so that they're literally a half an hour long or something like that.
5126000	5130000	Well isn't that what they're kind of trying to do with the whole Xbox,
5130000	5133000	the new thing they're doing on Xbox?
5133000	5136000	I forget what they officially call it, but as part of the NXC, you know what I'm talking about, right?
5136000	5140000	Yeah, I know what you mean.
5140000	5142000	So yeah, I know exactly. Who doesn't love game shows?
5142000	5143000	Game shows are awesome.
5143000	5144000	Exactly.
5144000	5145000	There you go.
5145000	5148000	Something not so awesome though is two class action lawsuits.
5148000	5154000	Both of these of course have to do with the whole digital rights management
5154000	5158000	that EA sort of secretly slipped in there on a few games.
5158000	5164000	Although you'd be surprised though, Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.
5164000	5169000	The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.
5169000	5175000	Apparently they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.
5175000	5180000	And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.
5180000	5187000	And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the digital rights management for Spore.
5187000	5192000	And, you know, interesting.
5192000	5198000	The first suit, I guess, says it was lodged by a Pennsylvania man who installed the Spore trial.
5198000	5212000	It says that the installation of DRM on a freely distributed program constitute a major violation of the computer's owners' absolute right to control what does and what does not get loaded onto their computers and how their computers shall be used.
5212000	5214000	I mean, that kind of is like spyware.
5214000	5224000	And it says apparently the trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or secure arm whatsoever.
5224000	5235000	And then the second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri saying that after installing the DRM protected The Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.
5235000	5240000	Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.
5240000	5245000	Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.
5245000	5259000	She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, and oppressive, and unscrupulous behavior.
5259000	5264000	So, in other words, EA got sued over secure arm. Nobody's surprised.
5264000	5267000	But is it going to hold up? What do you think?
5267000	5286000	If they came out and disclosed that secure arm was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, that it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.
5286000	5293000	Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this, if you install this, this is what's going to happen.
5293000	5299000	If they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.
5299000	5304000	Especially on these demos. That's the real tricky part. I mean, if you buy the game...
5304000	5311000	Well, who cares? It's a demo. I don't understand, you know. I don't get it.
5311000	5313000	Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens.
5313000	5321000	Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until part B.
5321000	5324000	I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.
5340000	5341000	There you go.
5341000	5345000	Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off there.
5345000	5347000	What? There's a spore level now?
5347000	5350000	That'd be funny. They should do that.
5350000	5354000	Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.
5375000	5377000	Alright, I could go on and on. Apparently tonight's...
5377000	5380000	I love that sound.
5380000	5382000	Yeah, that's the best sound ever.
5382000	5385000	I'll have to get that for the show. We can use that a little later on.
5385000	5392000	Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.
5392000	5396000	But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to do it.
5396000	5402000	We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from RobWithTwoBees.
5402000	5405000	I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.
5405000	5408000	This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.
5408000	5410000	I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.
5410000	5412000	To answer your question, yes it is.
5412000	5416000	In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.
5416000	5423000	And it's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.
5423000	5426000	Now obviously we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show,
5426000	5430000	but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email that's pretty awesome.
5430000	5431000	The quote here at the end.
5431000	5439000	This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.
5439000	5442000	Interesting.
5442000	5446000	An email from, well it's not signed.
5446000	5451000	It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.
5451000	5452000	We'll leave it at that.
5452000	5455000	Sent us something this, but I thought this was an interesting story.
5455000	5459000	Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.
5459000	5464000	And this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October.
5464000	5466000	So it looks like the same day as our last show.
5466000	5471000	But apparently it was like this giant, like, cosplay record type thing.
5471000	5474000	342 people posed.
5474000	5476000	Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on.
5476000	5478000	Part of the London Games Festival.
5478000	5485000	And the funny thing is, they were out there to top the record of.337 set the week before in Germany.
5485000	5488000	Who knew that World War III would be fought with cosplay?
5488000	5490000	Who knew?
5490000	5492000	But there you go.
5492000	5495000	A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.
5495000	5498000	Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?
5498000	5501000	Yeah, well not the one that he sent, I just happened to find one on YouTube.
5501000	5503000	And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.
5503000	5506000	That's fantastic.
5506000	5508000	I don't know if we learned this.
5508000	5512000	Can you actually save levels from online to like your planet and stuff?
5512000	5517000	I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of the show, he was telling us that there's an option you can.
5517000	5519000	God, I hope so.
5519000	5520000	I need to go save that one.
5520000	5522000	Alright, anyhow, we got another email here, one last email.
5522000	5525000	It's a little bit lengthy, but that's alright since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.
5525000	5527000	And it's from Spaznator.
5527000	5532000	Hi folks, I'm sending you this within a few minutes of finishing watching episode 300 live on Justin TV.
5532000	5536000	This is the first time I saw OLR on Justin TV live rather than listening on my PSP.
5536000	5539000	I would have called in, but unfortunately I could not get through tonight.
5539000	5541000	Oh well, as they say, shit happens.
5541000	5544000	Firstly, I'd like to relay to you a now belated happy 300th episode.
5544000	5546000	It was a pretty good show.
5546000	5548000	I particularly liked the Justin TV feed.
5548000	5554000	Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the all games radio feed on shoutcast on my PSP.
5554000	5556000	Well, now our all games friends wouldn't like that very much.
5556000	5558000	You should do both. Ideally you do both.
5558000	5562000	You turn on the Justin TV and mute it and then listen on the all games feed.
5562000	5565000	Because the Justin TV unfortunately has shitty audio.
5565000	5569000	One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.
5569000	5572000	Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a Playstation 3.
5572000	5573000	Welcome to the dark side.
5573000	5577000	Just out of sheer, stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?
5577000	5584000	I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.
5584000	5585000	And you're right.
5585000	5588000	It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.
5588000	5590000	I just bought the 80GB, the new one.
5590000	5596000	And it doesn't play Playstation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a Playstation 2.
5596000	5598000	And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.
5598000	5603000	Whoa. Hello. Hey. No, we're not ready for one gun music yet.
5603000	5604000	That's our break music tonight.
5604000	5610000	Anyway, speaking of Playstation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.
5610000	5614000	Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this.
5614000	5618000	And it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.
5618000	5624000	I'm speculating that Playstation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.
5624000	5625000	The reasoning behind this is simple.
5625000	5630000	On November 19th, Microsoft, as we all know, is releasing the NXT, the new Xbox experience,
5630000	5635000	which includes, among other things, avatars, a revamped menu interface, Netflix support, and so on.
5635000	5640000	If Sony is smart and wants to stay competitive as well as not lose any more ground to the 360,
5640000	5642000	they'll have home out by then.
5642000	5646000	Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.
5646000	5650000	I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.
5650000	5651000	I may be proven wrong on this.
5651000	5655000	I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.
5655000	5658000	Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like,
5658000	5660000	you can send me your friend request on Playstation Network.
5660000	5665000	As my Xbox Live gamertag suggests, my Playstation Network handle is Spazinator.
5665000	5667000	You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.
5667000	5670000	Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.
5670000	5673000	Well, that won't get pulled or anything.
5673000	5675000	There you go, an email from Spazinator.
5675000	5678000	The Gradius level is well done.
5678000	5681000	It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?
5681000	5687000	I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.
5687000	5690000	Who knows? It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.
5690000	5692000	But then again, it is Sunday.
5692000	5694000	But not in Europe. Shit.
5694000	5695000	It's going to be Monday morning.
5695000	5697000	I just found LittleBigMacross.
5697000	5701000	Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.
5701000	5703000	I think it might actually be Sony.
5703000	5704000	Interesting.
5704000	5706000	You're right, I am assuming that.
5706000	5708000	I don't know.
5708000	5709000	All right.
5709000	5712000	Well, we have a little more news to get to.
5712000	5717000	If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send those emails.
5717000	5722000	As far as that previous email and the whole release date, you know,
5722000	5729000	I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.
5729000	5731000	So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.
5731000	5733000	That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.
5733000	5739000	So, you know, if they could one-up Microsoft by making their thing better, they'll wait.
5739000	5741000	But they'll have it out by Christmas.
5741000	5747000	Which doesn't leave a lot of time, because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before, you know, the Thanksgiving rush.
5747000	5749000	But I don't work for Sony.
5749000	5751000	I don't know what they think sometimes.
5751000	5753000	We'll see.
5753000	5755000	That's awesome. I was watching a video.
5755000	5757000	They have SAC to the future.
5757000	5759000	I'm sure that level got pulled off.
5759000	5761000	Oh, this is sweet.
5761000	5764000	I'm telling you, Jimmy, best game I've played in years.
5764000	5766000	I'm looking at the Macross level.
5766000	5768000	It's an amazing game. Amazing.
5768000	5777000	So anyways, something that's come actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.
5777000	5779000	You know, installs.
5779000	5781000	Well, now they have an...
5781000	5786000	No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.
5786000	5801000	Final Fantasy Dissida, or whatever, on the PSP now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.
5801000	5804000	That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.
5804000	5807000	Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.
5807000	5809000	Well, that too.
5809000	5810000	I don't know.
5810000	5822000	And it says they have different install options. You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.
5822000	5823000	Alright.
5823000	5826000	So, very interesting.
5826000	5828000	Indeed, very interesting.
5828000	5831000	Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.
5831000	5833000	That's my option.
5833000	5838000	Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.
5838000	5843000	Retertainment asks a good question in chat. Does this further facilitate piracy? I don't think so.
5843000	5845000	It's so rampant anyways.
5845000	5848000	And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.
5848000	5852000	And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.
5852000	5853000	True.
5853000	5855000	Very true.
5855000	5862000	Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though. There's plenty more to come in Part B.
5862000	5869000	We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.
5869000	5871000	Not episode, the start of the next segment.
5871000	5872000	We.
5872000	5873000	So, alright.
5873000	5876000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5883000	5887000	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.
5887000	5890000	We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.
5890000	5893000	And Dark Sakura joined us in the middle of Part A.
5893000	5896000	And we want to talk about something.
5896000	5902000	I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was-
5902000	5904000	Oh shit, we always talk about leather stuff.
5904000	5908000	If we can talk about sandwiches and check food, we can talk about this too.
5908000	5911000	Because it's a topic that's come up on our show before.
5911000	5916000	And, you know, Orange Lounge Radio started with this whole concept of, it was kind of inspired by two different things.
5916000	5924000	It was inspired by the previous show I was on before, Understation Live, which is obviously, as you know, still kicking on the All Games Network in its new form.
5924000	5933000	And also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically.
5933000	5936000	You know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.
5936000	5945000	So, obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8.
5945000	5950000	Which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.
5950000	5964000	No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, you know, just the fact that we have elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding.
5964000	5967000	And, you know, I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech.
5967000	5972000	And it's really great things are going to happen here in America, I think, on that front.
5972000	5982000	But it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on.
5982000	5988000	And then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.
5988000	5999000	And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, you know, Proposition 8 took away the right here in America, not America, sorry, in California of same-sex couples to marry.
5999000	6011000	And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida, and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California you took something away by passing Proposition 8.
6011000	6015000	Gay couples were allowed to marry in this state from period of June till now.
6015000	6019000	And you took that away by passing Proposition 8.
6019000	6028000	And it's been difficult for me, you know, as an openly gay gamer here on this show, which, you know, obviously that topic comes up once in a while.
6028000	6032000	And I'm pretty sure I gave a pretty angry rant about it in previous episodes.
6032000	6035000	So I've just been kind of trying to think about it.
6035000	6040000	That's one other thing that's kind of been weighing on my mind this time that we've had off here.
6040000	6047000	And what really surprised me in a very positive way was a lot of the emails that I got from listeners.
6047000	6057000	And it was not just one, I'm talking several emails from listeners that were kind of like apologizing even though it's not their fault.
6057000	6066000	And I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook from a friend who was apologizing because it was their fault.
6066000	6072000	And, I don't know, I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.
6072000	6082000	And it's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is, what are you so afraid of?
6082000	6085000	What is the big deal?
6085000	6091000	If people you don't even know, aren't required to associate with, get married.
6091000	6097000	And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage, that is not true.
6097000	6100000	I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.
6100000	6114000	In a civil union, if I pass away, my partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.
6114000	6120000	If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from,
6120000	6126000	and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families,
6126000	6130000	that could be a real issue in a lot of families.
6130000	6133000	So there's one, one's enough, there's a difference.
6133000	6136000	There's more than just the one, but one's enough.
6136000	6139000	So it's not the same thing as civil unions.
6139000	6141000	You're not protected, all this BS.
6141000	6145000	And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?
6145000	6148000	By using children and this whole schools thing.
6148000	6153000	If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.
6153000	6158000	Logic tells you they were lying.
6158000	6159000	Here's the logic.
6159000	6162000	Gay marriage was already legal.
6162000	6166000	So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.
6166000	6168000	And here's my other question.
6168000	6170000	So what?
6170000	6173000	If they teach it in schools, so what?
6173000	6177000	I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird,
6177000	6180000	but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship,
6180000	6182000	do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?
6182000	6185000	Trust me, folks, these kids are going to hear it.
6185000	6189000	I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.
6189000	6192000	That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet,
6192000	6196000	was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time
6196000	6200000	in very difficult parts of my life were right.
6200000	6203000	And do you think it's something I chose?
6203000	6206000	I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything,
6206000	6208000	is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.
6208000	6212000	I assure you, I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.
6212000	6214000	It was not a choice.
6214000	6216000	This is the way I was born.
6216000	6223000	This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.
6223000	6230000	So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?
6230000	6232000	DarkSakura, where were you today?
6232000	6238000	I was at the Repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps,
6238000	6240000	and it was amazing.
6240000	6242000	What kind of things were going on?
6242000	6244000	There were just a lot of speakers.
6244000	6247000	I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody
6247000	6249000	until I got closer.
6249000	6256000	One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.
6256000	6257000	They were all very good.
6257000	6259000	There were a couple speakers there.
6259000	6262000	One of them was a school commissioner.
6262000	6266000	She was there with her family, and they managed to get in
6266000	6271000	right before they weren't doing any more weddings.
6271000	6274000	So she was there with her family.
6274000	6280000	A big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching
6280000	6285000	of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.
6285000	6290000	If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it
6290000	6293000	in schools, I don't know. I believe them.
6293000	6295000	Well, another one.
6295000	6303000	I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.
6303000	6310000	She was just saying that she gave this really great speech
6310000	6316000	just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives,
6316000	6320000	and that was pretty crazy to hear about.
6320000	6324000	There was just a lot of really good energy there today.
6324000	6328000	Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.
6328000	6333000	I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting is how many people were.
6333000	6339000	This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.
6339000	6345000	We're saying that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority.
6345000	6349000	This has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California,
6349000	6352000	and I don't see anyone really offering anything about it,
6352000	6357000	that any amendment to our Constitution basically only takes a simple majority
6357000	6361000	when our budget takes a two-thirds majority.
6361000	6366000	You know Prop 2 passed, right?
6366000	6367000	Yeah, the chicken thing.
6367000	6371000	If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?
6371000	6375000	I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.
6375000	6377000	Prop 2 is a waste of money.
6377000	6380000	It's a funny contradiction, you know what I mean?
6380000	6383000	Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.
6383000	6387000	I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it, I've put in six and a half years on this show.
6387000	6394000	I can take ten minutes to get political.
6394000	6402000	I'm so angry mostly at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country on one hand,
6402000	6408000	and then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.
6408000	6411000	You think some people would know better.
6411000	6413000	It's just disgusting.
6413000	6417000	And you can say this whole, well, can't the majority talk?
6417000	6419000	Is this the way it's going to be?
6419000	6422000	No, because you know what?
6422000	6427000	The majority isn't always right, and that's what's happened in the past.
6427000	6429000	What we've seen happen in the past is that...
6429000	6431000	The majority is uninformed and lied to.
6431000	6435000	That's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California
6435000	6440000	to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong.
6440000	6444000	But what this has really done for this community,
6444000	6446000	and I'm not talking just the gay community,
6446000	6451000	I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community,
6451000	6454000	is it's really mobilized it.
6454000	6459000	And I think in a way, especially on the tail end of what you see happening with the whole Obama,
6459000	6464000	yes we can, rah rah rah, I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.
6464000	6468000	But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say,
6468000	6471000	I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.
6471000	6475000	I just hope they're on the right side.
6475000	6480000	History says they will be, but I don't know, maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.
6480000	6483000	But what can we do? What do I bring it up?
6483000	6487000	Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?
6487000	6491000	Well folks, you've been on Xbox Live, you've been on these things,
6491000	6494000	you've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.
6494000	6499000	This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up, on World of Warcraft,
6499000	6504000	I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar,
6504000	6509000	why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.
6509000	6514000	I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar, he signed onto his Horde character,
6514000	6518000	and said, what's your problem, fag?
6518000	6521000	So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games, because you know what?
6521000	6529000	When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian,
6529000	6533000	I don't give a shit who you are, stop it.
6533000	6537000	There is nothing to be afraid of, and when you say that stuff,
6537000	6543000	you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it, it's different.
6543000	6547000	Because this is where this all stems from.
6547000	6552000	You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.
6552000	6558000	So just knock it off.
6558000	6560000	And I guess that's all I have to say.
6560000	6563000	Well, it's ridiculous anyway.
6563000	6568000	Alright, but when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape,
6568000	6572000	and go to a happier place where I rule things, like in populace, yeah.
6572000	6574000	One more politically?
6574000	6575000	Sure, sure, sure.
6575000	6578000	Fuck you, majority voters of Arkansas.
6578000	6585000	That's a whole other issue that, oh my god, I could spend another episode on that.
6585000	6587000	That earned its own F.U. too.
6587000	6589000	Say what?
6589000	6591000	You know what happened in Arkansas?
6591000	6594000	Only married couples can adopt.
6594000	6597000	And because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.
6597000	6599000	But what about, I don't know, what about-
6599000	6601000	How many more children does that put into the system?
6601000	6603000	They can't even foster children.
6603000	6604000	It's not just adoption.
6604000	6607000	Grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died,
6607000	6610000	and grandma's husband died.
6610000	6613000	It makes no sense. It's so flawed.
6613000	6616000	This all spurns from people's-
6616000	6622000	It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.
6622000	6628000	And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.
6628000	6629000	One would hope.
6629000	6632000	But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.
6632000	6635000	So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.
6635000	6644000	But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.
6644000	6646000	Because that's what you did this week.
6646000	6648000	Back to video games.
6648000	6650000	Alright.
6650000	6658000	Activision has taken away some songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour's servers.
6658000	6666000	The GH-Toon service that they have available basically, of course, is not a big surprise.
6666000	6674000	It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.
6674000	6685000	So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like mainstream songs and that kind of thing.
6685000	6688000	So they only want your original stuff on there.
6688000	6695000	And they're going to promise to delete any copyright unfriendly material.
6695000	6701000	I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use, too.
6701000	6714000	So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess.
6714000	6716000	To emulate it or what have you.
6716000	6718000	Only to end up having it deleted.
6718000	6720000	So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?
6720000	6722000	Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.
6722000	6729000	And one of the things though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.
6729000	6734000	So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again.
6734000	6735000	Unless someone else throws it up there.
6735000	6742000	But maybe, I don't know, you should throw it up there and not name it Zelda theme or something like that.
6742000	6744000	That would not have been a good idea.
6744000	6747000	So, I don't know.
6747000	6754000	Pretty soon, if it expands to stay there, it's going to be really hard to monitor it.
6754000	6763000	Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last ten minutes of the show in chat room right now.
6763000	6765000	So sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.
6765000	6771000	But has there been any really good original works to come out of this, too?
6771000	6776000	All I hear about, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels, too.
6776000	6779000	But I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.
6779000	6781000	I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.
6781000	6784000	I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...
6784000	6789000	Here's what I'd be curious about. A little indie band, the type that's trying to publicize through MySpace,
6789000	6793000	putting their own song in Guitar Hero, if it's even possible.
6793000	6795000	I don't know to what extent you can even do it.
6795000	6798000	But would that be okay?
6798000	6803000	I'm sure it'd be okay if it's like that, because it's their own stuff.
6803000	6806000	And probably if they're in a little indie band like that anyways.
6806000	6814000	I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.
6814000	6816000	And Bobby's in chat right now and says,
6816000	6821000	Most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid Music Creator mode like me.
6821000	6827000	Yeah, and we're going to get into some other stuff about the Music Creator mode and the Guitar Hero tunes thing and stuff.
6827000	6832000	It just sounds less and less appealing as time goes on.
6832000	6840000	Alright, let's talk about Rock Band, the other music game that's still out there, still kicking and still releasing new expansions.
6840000	6844000	And there is a download pack coming out very soon.
6844000	6846000	It's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album.
6846000	6849000	And you know the song Everlong is from that album. It's already in the game.
6849000	6852000	And it's a lot of fun to play, even if it's a bitch.
6852000	6855000	But there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this.
6855000	6857000	Monkey Wrench, I believe, was one of the singles there.
6857000	6859000	My Hero, of course, is another big song from that album.
6859000	6865000	So the Color and the Shape, definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters, is the next release.
6865000	6871000	Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free Rock Band songs have started to hit as well.
6871000	6875000	Yes, I downloaded those. I haven't played any of them by downloading them.
6875000	6878000	I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.
6878000	6879000	That's awesome.
6879000	6885000	My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2. Our band now is in the top 500.
6885000	6887000	Interesting. Wow.
6887000	6889000	That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.
6889000	6890000	Dang, he must be really good.
6890000	6891000	He is really good.
6891000	6893000	That's cool. Good for him.
6893000	6897000	I distracted him, though. I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.
6897000	6900000	I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason.
6900000	6902000	And it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.
6902000	6904000	I still haven't gotten my Susie and the Banshee songs.
6904000	6905000	Here's the thing.
6905000	6906000	I really need to do that.
6906000	6912000	I have a new drum set I bought. I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.
6912000	6919000	And I'm not playing it until I get my Rock Band symbols for it, which supposedly are coming in tomorrow.
6919000	6921000	Cross our fingers.
6921000	6925000	So hopefully, once I get the symbols, I'll start playing my new drum set.
6925000	6927000	But until then, I'm not touching it.
6927000	6930000	Alright, we'll see what happens.
6930000	6932000	But there's other Rock Band news, yes?
6932000	6939000	There is. Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.
6939000	6946000	First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points.
6946000	6953000	But, you know, I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.
6953000	6955000	But here's what's going up.
6955000	6963000	It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.
6963000	6964000	That's a cool song.
6964000	6974000	Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts Angels and Airwaves, Just When I Needed the Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes Finally.
6974000	6978000	Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.
6978000	6979000	You know what?
6979000	6980000	See?
6980000	6981000	These are all...
6981000	6986000	No, I know, I know, I know, they're already download songs that are on the CD, but I'm just saying, that song does rock.
6986000	6987000	I've played it.
6987000	6989000	It needs to be in... anyway.
6989000	6991000	This one, it's like my favorite Police song.
6991000	6994000	Monkey Gone to Heaven by The Pixies, yay.
6994000	7007000	Rio Duran Duran, Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue, Simple Man, Leonard Skynyrd, Snow Hayo by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails, This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy, which I like that song too.
7007000	7013000	Time Is Running Out by Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Zero Smashing Pumpkins.
7013000	7014000	Not a bad track list.
7014000	7015000	Not at all.
7015000	7023000	What's kind of neat about that though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.
7023000	7029000	Like the Pixies track was from the album release, the Hayo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.
7029000	7039000	It's kind of interesting, it's not just single track releases they picked from, it's really a smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band, which I think is interesting.
7039000	7049000	Yeah, and what's also cool about that too is once again, with this, you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1.
7049000	7052000	Or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want.
7052000	7054000	Oh, that's kind of neat.
7054000	7055000	Yeah.
7055000	7057000	How would that work on the Wii though?
7057000	7061000	On the Wii? I'm not sure how they're going to, I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.
7061000	7069000	It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.
7069000	7072000	So, I don't know, soon I guess.
7072000	7078000	This is just like printing money though for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game though.
7078000	7087000	I mean, you're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing, this thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.
7087000	7090000	But, it's just, you know.
7090000	7103000	And if you think about it, if you're looking for a really cheap guitar game, like you just want something to play, I mean, you literally can go out there and buy a used, I saw a used Rock Band guitars for like 12 bucks.
7103000	7112000	And then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks, here you go, for less than 50 bucks you can have like a Guitar Hero type of thing.
7112000	7115000	That's a nice way of getting around it, I like the way you think.
7115000	7124000	Actually it's funny, through the Microsoft training site that I'm a part of, they had Guitar Hero Aerosmith guitars for 99 cents.
7124000	7126000	Really? I need one of those.
7126000	7133000	Well, they're not available now apparently. They put them up on the old site because they're revamping it and they're doing a new site or something.
7133000	7135000	But they're like, these won't be available until the new site comes out.
7135000	7139000	I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller. Still.
7139000	7145000	Hey, that's, you know, that top 500 bands? Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7145000	7156000	You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar in game bundle, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.
7156000	7159000	I might just go back and pick that up instead. I don't know.
7159000	7163000	Those guitars are dirt cheap, especially like game solving stuff. Interesting, really cheap.
7163000	7171000	Anyways, so Guitar Freaks Drummania, you know, that spawned the whole guitar music game thing anyways.
7171000	7176000	Well, there's a new arcade release in Japan, Guitar Freaks V6.
7176000	7182000	And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing! With four exclamation points. That's so awesome.
7182000	7187000	And, you know, it seems to be like fire themed, so that's kind of cool.
7187000	7197000	And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you could believe it or not,
7197000	7210000	570 plus, I guess, in all. That's freaking crazy. Over 570 songs?
7210000	7212000	It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.
7212000	7214000	It must be. My god, that's huge.
7214000	7217000	How would you scroll through that damn list?
7217000	7230000	I don't know. Location testing soon, I guess. And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drummania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.
7230000	7233000	That's nuts.
7233000	7234000	That is a lot.
7234000	7242000	And you know what? I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.
7242000	7250000	Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which, by the way, I just wanted to say, quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it,
7250000	7256000	but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.
7256000	7268000	I just, to go back to what I said, I blame society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.
7268000	7278000	But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.
7278000	7285000	So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat, that's just kind of what I wanted to say.
7285000	7291000	But, I want to say, regarding games, SSG100Matt says, the Microsoft employee store has Gears of War 2 for $25.
7291000	7298000	Which would mean that employee stores always have games that are cheap. In fact, I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.
7298000	7302000	I stole a copy of Boom Blocks I barely touched.
7302000	7309000	Well, this is a little different than the employee store. This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.
7309000	7315000	Like, you can get games for the 360 or the first party set for 9 bucks. It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.
7315000	7322000	But, you know, they're revamping it. They're redoing it because, I don't know, I guess it needs it.
7322000	7326000	And SonicM88 says, the Explorer is still the best, Rob.
7326000	7330000	And Act F says, Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.
7330000	7336000	So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking. Which sucks.
7336000	7338000	8 bucks will buy you-
7338000	7339000	Controller surgery!
7339000	7342000	No seriously, 8 bucks will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7342000	7346000	Really? Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7346000	7350000	Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.
7350000	7352000	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
7352000	7354000	Oh, I forgot to mention that-
7354000	7358000	We're all over the place today.
7358000	7361000	Yeah, that's cool. In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.
7361000	7362000	Really?
7362000	7366000	I played Supernova at that one game store.
7366000	7372000	Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out. I can't exercise still for another week and a half. It's another reason I didn't go out today.
7372000	7374000	Just because of the timing of what was going on today.
7374000	7380000	And just, I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.
7380000	7384000	And so I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.
7384000	7389000	It was fun. It was fun, but I mean, I'm totally out of shape for DDR anymore.
7389000	7395000	But I still play doubles, so I don't know if, you know, I could probably go back to singles and do that a little bit more.
7395000	7399000	But still fun. I don't know. Supernova was fun.
7399000	7405000	Anyhow, let's talk crazy. Let's talk real crazy.
7405000	7409000	Crazier than anything I've brought up so far on this show. Very fucking crazy, okay?
7409000	7413000	It's this guy, in fact, so crazy that I have to bring in the background music.
7417000	7421000	This guy is Jonathan Lee Riches, and apparently he's spending his time in South California.
7421000	7425000	Or, sorry, South California, which pretty soon might happen, who knows.
7425000	7432000	South Carolina, he's spending his time in a South Carolina prison suing people.
7432000	7434000	He sues a lot of people.
7434000	7440000	But one kind of particular interest of note that he's been suing, he sued Blizzard.
7440000	7445000	That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.
7445000	7447000	And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?
7447000	7454000	Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft
7454000	7459000	and fought cyber monster gangs.
7459000	7464000	And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.
7464000	7467000	So in other words, here's somebody saying,
7467000	7473000	it's Blizzard's fault that I can't separate game from reality.
7473000	7479000	No. That's called, um, he's stupid.
7479000	7484000	There's no such thing as video game addiction.
7484000	7489000	There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.
7489000	7494000	There are OCD people out there. This guy is just stupid.
7494000	7498000	Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know,
7498000	7503000	dumbs down the whole thing. But it's crazy to think that there are people out there
7503000	7506000	that rationalize this like his lawyer.
7506000	7510000	Or better yet, why are we letting inmates sue?
7510000	7512000	The lawyer's getting paid if he wins or not.
7512000	7517000	Why are we letting these inmates sue everybody? That's just retarded.
7517000	7519000	What else are you going to do when you're in prison?
7519000	7523000	I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.
7523000	7527000	So that, you know, we don't have this shit.
7527000	7529000	You only get three.
7529000	7532000	GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.
7532000	7535000	Oh, sure. Tyra will solve everything.
7535000	7537000	She can give him a stern talking to.
7537000	7538000	There's no Oprah to deal with him.
7538000	7540000	And I want to point out, it's a hand written.
7540000	7542000	Oh my god.
7542000	7550000	I'm actually looking at the text and this is a hand written testimony there.
7550000	7553000	And it all fits on one page. My god.
7553000	7557000	Pertainment asks, can I sue Fanta for being awesome?
7557000	7561000	Seriously, that's retarded.
7561000	7564000	And the fact that it's hand written, that's also retarded.
7564000	7566000	I mean, dude, get a typewriter. At least.
7566000	7568000	I don't let you have typewriters in prison.
7568000	7572000	This caused Riches to commit fraud to buy defendants' video games.
7572000	7575000	Riches chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.
7575000	7578000	Riches' mind became a living video game.
7578000	7581000	I hold defendants liable and support plaintiffs.
7581000	7584000	Why is he referring to himself in the third person?
7584000	7587000	I think it's like a lawyer or something. I don't know, but anyway.
7587000	7589000	Why did the lawyer then hand write all that?
7589000	7594000	You know what? Obviously they gave Jack Thompson a license, so you know.
7594000	7601000	Yeah, but eventually people got their brains straight and took away his license.
7601000	7607000	Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300-some-odd episodes,
7607000	7623000	you know what segment's coming next.
7623000	7626000	I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.
7626000	7628000	It's a comment from Marissa in chat.
7628000	7632000	The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here forever, who needs to come back, by the way.
7632000	7634000	You learn something new every day on Orange Lounge Radio.
7634000	7638000	Marissa says, I work in law. I've seen hand-written pleadings. They're so funny.
7638000	7640000	Apparently this is not uncommon.
7640000	7643000	Anyhow, sorry. F.U.'s of the week time.
7643000	7647000	F.U. to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.
7647000	7649000	And Prop 2.
7649000	7653000	And for... because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.
7653000	7661000	Okay, I understand we love the animals, but for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop...
7661000	7671000	and sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8 is just stupid.
7671000	7680000	Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass.
7680000	7684000	You know, that's why you've got your nose turned up because all you can smell is your own shit.
7684000	7687000	And it don't smell good.
7687000	7692000	I voted yes on Prop 2 because I thought chickens that got to stand up would taste better.
7692000	7698000	Which actually is partially true, in a way. It really is.
7698000	7701000	Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.
7701000	7705000	This is what people are ignoring with this. First of all, chickens are stupid.
7705000	7706000	Well, yeah.
7706000	7708000	But let me finish what I'm saying.
7708000	7717000	Second of all, for however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into making up these, you know, getting up to these new standards,
7717000	7721000	it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.
7721000	7726000	And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is,
7726000	7732000	for people losing their homes left and right, who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?
7732000	7739000	There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple, you know,
7739000	7746000	financial impact this is going to have on everybody, you know, just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.
7746000	7751000	Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.
7751000	7752000	It's just stupid.
7752000	7753000	Get those Nevada chickens.
7753000	7757000	It's a frivolous waste of money because people...
7757000	7762000	I blame liberals.
7762000	7765000	All right, let's move on.
7765000	7770000	I also want to say, F.U., the people that voted yes on eight, but not necessarily...
7770000	7775000	They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything, and they were showing...
7775000	7780000	They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on eight party or whatever,
7780000	7784000	and it just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.
7784000	7786000	I'd like to actually add another F.U. then.
7786000	7791000	To the Mormon Church, F.U. on boycotting all your businesses.
7791000	7795000	I don't know. It just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's all right, you know.
7795000	7797000	So, F.U. that, I guess.
7797000	7805000	And F.U. the fact that there was another proposition that has passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing,
7805000	7811000	when, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people...
7811000	7818000	It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like, you know, time of war or something like that.
7818000	7822000	They just have to be enlisted in the military to get these extra benefits,
7822000	7827000	and trust me, they get plenty of benefits as it is already, so F.U. that.
7827000	7829000	And the chickens, well, I just vote on that because it tastes.
7829000	7836000	I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.
7836000	7842000	Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same F.U. I'm just going to say F.U. to intolerance.
7842000	7850000	And I was really surprised to learn this week, in all walks of life, in all places in my life,
7850000	7855000	wherein there is still intolerance, and we have a lot of work to do.
7855000	7857000	That's it.
7857000	7858000	All right.
7858000	7863000	Moving on, gaming news, gaming deals, games that are steel.
7863000	7868000	Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?
7868000	7869000	What do you mean?
7869000	7870000	Tabula Rasa.
7870000	7872000	But I'm bummed.
7872000	7876000	Yeah, Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.
7876000	7877000	Really?
7877000	7878000	Yes.
7878000	7880000	Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents?
7880000	7881000	Yes, I checked.
7881000	7884000	Or if you want to translate that into a...
7884000	7886000	Is that with free shipping?
7886000	7887000	No.
7887000	7888000	Damn.
7888000	7891000	It's also, it would translate to 61 pence, by the way.
7891000	7895000	So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.
7895000	7897000	Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people.
7897000	7903000	But they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of
7903000	7910000	hammer space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped
7910000	7916000	first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!
7916000	7920000	You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.
7920000	7925000	But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.
7925000	7928000	If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.
7928000	7931000	You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.
7931000	7933000	I'm actually half-tempted.
7933000	7935000	Tabula Rasa was not terrible.
7935000	7937000	I'm thinking about it too.
7937000	7942000	It's a month of play for five bucks.
7942000	7943000	Why not?
7943000	7945000	It might be worth a look.
7945000	7946000	I'm kind of curious.
7946000	7948000	I honestly do think this is the tactic.
7948000	7949000	I mean...
7949000	7952000	It is a very interesting way to get people on board, because that's what they'll make
7952000	7953000	their...
7953000	7955000	They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game, because the retailer
7955000	7956000	gets screwed there.
7956000	7960000	They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something,
7960000	7961000	which I won't do.
7961000	7962000	If the game sucks, it sucks.
7962000	7965000	I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.
7965000	7966000	I'm just thinking about buying it.
7966000	7967000	Just to have.
7967000	7969000	Yeah, to go in the collection.
7969000	7970000	It is a Lord British game.
7970000	7972000	Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?
7972000	7975000	Commander British or whatever his name is.
7975000	7977000	I do have a soft spot in my heart for Ultima.
7977000	7981000	It's a very tiny, soft, squishy spot, but it's there.
7981000	7986000	But you say that and I still think of Salamander.
7986000	7989000	You know my friend was trying to get me to come back to Final Fantasy XI?
7989000	7990000	Who?
7990000	7992000	Oh, one of my online friends.
7992000	7993000	But...
7993000	7994000	You know what?
7994000	7995000	There's two words to say.
7995000	7996000	What?
7996000	7997000	Hell no!
7997000	7999000	That's kind of sadly what I had to say.
7999000	8002000	I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.
8002000	8003000	Rob, buy life.
8003000	8004000	Rob?
8004000	8005000	What?
8005000	8006000	What?
8006000	8009000	Are you going out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?
8009000	8010000	When?
8010000	8011000	Thursday?
8011000	8012000	No, I probably won't go by at midnight.
8012000	8018000	Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?
8018000	8020000	Everybody's E-peen is going to make them go on there first.
8020000	8022000	I like Ragnarok.
8022000	8023000	It's free.
8023000	8024000	You go girl.
8024000	8025000	Alright, let's move on.
8025000	8026000	You go!
8026000	8030000	You keep going!
8030000	8045000	So, the DSI just was released, and it's apparently allowed the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew
8045000	8049000	slash hacking carts, it's prevented them from working.
8049000	8055000	Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSI has already been hacked.
8055000	8061000	We've already got, yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess,
8061000	8070000	developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World program, and apparently
8070000	8075000	it was done also with something that has been exploited on, I'd like to, for once, on this
8075000	8079000	Hello World program, I'd like to, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is
8079000	8082000	to simply print Hello World on the screen.
8082000	8087000	In Commodore BASIC, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.
8087000	8089000	20, go to 10.
8089000	8093000	If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.
8093000	8095000	Hello Piracy!
8095000	8101000	But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing,
8101000	8108000	which, for people that know, the PSP was done the same way, and it seems to be something
8108000	8111000	that's pretty typical, so, surprise!
8111000	8119000	You know, where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.
8119000	8123000	And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.
8123000	8127000	Especially now with SD card support, man, that's gonna make things even easier, because
8127000	8128000	you know what that means?
8128000	8131000	I know, we kinda knew this was gonna happen when they announced that SD card slot was
8131000	8132000	gonna be on there, right?
8132000	8133000	Yeah, can you imagine that, though?
8133000	8136000	With SD card support, all you're really gonna need to do is load a program, and then you're
8136000	8138000	gonna be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.
8138000	8139000	You won't even need a cart!
8139000	8142000	It'll be even easier to hack open!
8142000	8143000	Woohoo!
8143000	8148000	Alrighty, well, guess what?
8148000	8153000	Speaking of hacked, apparently, something has been hacked out of the Xbox Live Marketplace.
8153000	8158000	You remember how a while ago, Xbox, they were threatening to delist games based on a Metacritic
8158000	8162000	score and or sales, basically, was the thing?
8162000	8170000	It apparently appears the first casualty may have disappeared, the game is gone, Yaris
8170000	8173000	is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.
8173000	8179000	But, here's the question, and by the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.
8179000	8185000	What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it
8185000	8191000	something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?
8191000	8198000	Or, you know, this game did come out about one year ago exactly, is it some type of contractual
8198000	8204000	thing going on where, you know, it was a Toyota promotion, it was basically a game advertisement,
8204000	8206000	did the ad run out?
8206000	8208000	It probably did.
8208000	8215000	And Bobby Blackwell swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.
8215000	8218000	And I wouldn't be surprised at all.
8218000	8223000	But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's
8223000	8224000	coming for you?
8224000	8229000	No, it was just, it was a big advertisement game, that's why it probably sucked in the
8229000	8230000	first place.
8230000	8232000	Who puts that much effort into an ad game?
8232000	8234000	I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.
8234000	8236000	Citar Hero was cool.
8236000	8237000	Yeah, Citar Hero was kind of cool.
8237000	8239000	But I hope I don't lose those achievements, that'll piss me off.
8239000	8240000	Probably not.
8240000	8241000	That's good.
8241000	8243000	It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.
8243000	8245000	Well, how about something cool?
8245000	8246000	Alright, how about it?
8246000	8252000	Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.
8252000	8253000	Dead Rising 2.
8253000	8255000	Oh, hey, cool.
8255000	8256000	Yep.
8256000	8262000	They're supposed to be, well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated
8262000	8266000	by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.
8266000	8267000	Insider info.
8267000	8268000	Yep.
8268000	8273000	No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything, but hey, maybe
8273000	8274000	it'll be.
8274000	8279000	To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?
8279000	8280000	I mean, no.
8280000	8281000	Zombies!
8281000	8282000	Exactly.
8282000	8283000	And malls.
8283000	8286000	What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?
8286000	8288000	I guess that's true, it might not be a mall.
8288000	8290000	Oh, how about an airport?
8290000	8293000	Where do you think the zombie outbreak's gonna happen next?
8293000	8295000	An office building.
8295000	8296000	Hmm.
8296000	8298000	During the lunch hour.
8298000	8300000	Mmm, brains.
8300000	8302000	It's what's for lunch.
8302000	8305000	Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.
8305000	8307000	Rob, you need to play the song.
8307000	8308000	What?
8308000	8309000	This is a Jonathan Coulton song.
8309000	8310000	Ah, later.
8310000	8312000	I don't have it right now.
8312000	8316000	But Dead Rising 2's, Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.
8316000	8318000	What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?
8318000	8320000	Fix the saving.
8320000	8322000	Fix the saving.
8322000	8324000	Fix the saving.
8324000	8326000	There you go.
8326000	8328000	And rocket launchers.
8328000	8330000	Or rocket launchers.
8330000	8333000	Or rocket launcher save guns.
8333000	8335000	Rocket launcher save guns.
8335000	8337000	Could be awesome.
8337000	8342000	Another thing that could be awesome is some more stuff that could be coming out.
8342000	8347000	And Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games.
8347000	8351000	Some sound ordinary, one sounds really weird.
8351000	8358000	Of course, they just put out Alien Crush Returns, which is really awesome.
8358000	8363000	But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii shop.
8363000	8366000	And probably coming over here at some point as well.
8366000	8374000	First they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.
8374000	8376000	That's not QQ Sports when you lose.
8376000	8377000	Not QQ.
8377000	8381000	It features online play for one of the four players.
8381000	8385000	And allows you to either do motion control or button based play.
8385000	8391000	The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat.
8391000	8393000	Sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.
8393000	8395000	That sounds kind of cool.
8395000	8398000	The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.
8398000	8402000	And it's weird.
8402000	8408000	It's sort of like a racing game, but you play a pit crew that fixes different things.
8408000	8414000	From fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.
8414000	8420000	Well, how exciting.
8420000	8421000	What did you do on your Wii today?
8421000	8423000	I fixed a toilet.
8423000	8424000	Awesome.
8424000	8426000	You did what Wii with your toilet?
8426000	8430000	Besides a toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game.
8430000	8434000	And boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.
8434000	8436000	Beer Pong?
8436000	8438000	No, it's not Beer Pong.
8438000	8440000	They changed the name, remember?
8440000	8444000	Pong Toss or something like that. Wasn't that what they called it?
8444000	8447000	Something like that, yeah.
8447000	8450000	Anyhow, Burnout Paradise.
8450000	8453000	Man, they just keep trying to make this game better.
8453000	8455000	And to some extent, they're succeeding.
8455000	8458000	Because this is very, very cool.
8458000	8461000	It's something coming out from, of course, Criterion Games.
8461000	8463000	The folks behind Burnout Paradise.
8463000	8466000	It is actually...
8466000	8470000	Now, they don't say it's a DeLorean, but it looks a lot like one.
8470000	8472000	Yeah, there's no licensed cars in this game.
8472000	8475000	But it's the Legendary Cars Pack.
8475000	8480000	And they call this the Jansen 88 Special.
8480000	8482000	Well, who was the creator of the DeLorean?
8482000	8485000	Exactly. So that's what it is there.
8485000	8486000	Seriously.
8486000	8488000	That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.
8488000	8490000	Dude, is there a McLaren clone in there?
8490000	8497000	They also have cars called the Cavalry Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.
8497000	8501000	Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not so DeLorean,
8501000	8505000	is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it.
8505000	8511000	And if you push the L3 button, it will hover.
8511000	8513000	I'm looking at that in the screenshot.
8513000	8515000	I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.
8515000	8516000	It's hovering.
8516000	8518000	It will go in the hover mode.
8518000	8520000	You know what those other ones are? The Bootlegger.
8520000	8522000	That, of course, is the General Lee.
8522000	8527000	The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1.
8527000	8530000	And the other one, Kit.
8530000	8531000	Sweet!
8531000	8534000	What do they call it, a car?
8534000	8536000	Oh, that's what these other ones are.
8536000	8537000	That's what the other ones are.
8537000	8538000	GT Nighthawk.
8538000	8539000	GT Nighthawk, yeah.
8539000	8540000	I get it.
8540000	8542000	Well, that's pretty awesome.
8542000	8545000	And bless those folks at Criterion Games,
8545000	8547000	because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Bird Out Paradise.
8547000	8550000	They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.
8550000	8552000	They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game,
8552000	8555000	so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.
8555000	8557000	Plus, they didn't make the show roll.
8557000	8559000	They have a new party thing.
8559000	8561000	It's like Burnout Party or something like that,
8561000	8564000	that's coming out in February, I think.
8564000	8569000	And it's basically the game with all the updates that they've added so far,
8569000	8571000	and I think some of the download content.
8571000	8574000	But they are having a new party mode that will be downloadable as well,
8574000	8578000	that they're going to add some different Pass the Controller games and stuff.
8578000	8580000	So that's kind of cool.
8580000	8583000	They're adding, I think instead of putting it on another Burnout game,
8583000	8585000	they'll just keep adding to this one.
8585000	8586000	SSG100Matt in chat says,
8586000	8588000	I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.
8588000	8591000	I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.
8591000	8592000	Yeah.
8592000	8593000	I'm glad I kept it now.
8593000	8594000	I think I still kept mine.
8594000	8599000	I'm not sure, but either way, I can rebuy it if I have it,
8599000	8604000	and also if you own the PlayStation 3, you can just download it.
8604000	8605000	That's true.
8605000	8606000	You can't always just download it on the PlayStation 3.
8606000	8607000	It's in their little store.
8607000	8608000	That's pretty cool.
8608000	8609000	Yeah.
8609000	8610000	Good for them.
8610000	8612000	Good for them, giving us our money's worth.
8612000	8615000	Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money,
8615000	8617000	actually referring to economy,
8617000	8624000	is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players
8624000	8630000	where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.
8630000	8635000	You basically will be able to take empty space station areas
8635000	8640000	and put in stores, put in shops, customize them however you want to,
8640000	8645000	make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue.
8645000	8649000	You can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency,
8649000	8650000	you know, that type of thing.
8650000	8651000	So it sounds pretty cool.
8651000	8653000	What is this, Quark the Game?
8653000	8660000	But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on
8660000	8663000	where you can take command of a ship.
8663000	8665000	So that's kind of cool.
8665000	8666000	Hmm.
8666000	8667000	I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried
8667000	8669000	about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.
8669000	8670000	Maybe.
8670000	8671000	Maybe.
8671000	8672000	A bit.
8672000	8674000	Eve definitely has its following, though.
8674000	8675000	Oh, come on.
8675000	8679000	They're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.
8679000	8683000	I'd prefer the chess game.
8683000	8685000	But it's kind of neat.
8685000	8689000	You know, Eve's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO,
8689000	8692000	but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.
8692000	8693000	I've never played it myself.
8693000	8698000	I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.
8698000	8700000	Mm-hmm.
8700000	8705000	So speaking of community, there's, of course,
8705000	8709000	the whole Guitar Hero songs that are available online,
8709000	8710000	lots of community-made stuff.
8710000	8713000	Well, Activision wants to expand that.
8713000	8717000	They figure, you know, hey, this service is so awesome
8717000	8721000	because we're so awesome for coming up with such an original idea.
8721000	8723000	They said that so far, just in ten days,
8723000	8728000	that Guitar Hero Tunes has attracted over 25,000 user-generated songs,
8728000	8732000	probably many less now that they've taken them all down,
8732000	8735000	and will likely have up to 100,000 songs by year's end.
8735000	8738000	These songs are easily downloaded by consumers,
8738000	8742000	and the ability to offer these songs on a subscription basis
8742000	8750000	may very well result in the newest subscription opportunities in our portfolio.
8750000	8751000	That's an awesome idea.
8751000	8754000	Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game
8754000	8755000	and decide, oh, guess what?
8755000	8757000	You're going to have to pay for it now.
8757000	8758000	Nice.
8758000	8761000	And it's not going to have any songs that are actually based on other things.
8761000	8764000	It's just all original stuff.
8764000	8767000	Yeah, that'll fly.
8767000	8769000	The other thing that you should know, too,
8769000	8773000	is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.
8773000	8778000	In fact, they said that Activision's 09 lineup is 40% larger,
8778000	8781000	and of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty
8781000	8784000	and multiple Guitar Hero releases
8784000	8790000	because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.
8790000	8792000	Interesting.
8792000	8794000	You want to hear something else that's also interesting?
8794000	8797000	Remember when they purchased them
8797000	8801000	and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?
8801000	8803000	You know why they got rid of them?
8803000	8806000	Because they can't keep making sequels for them.
8806000	8807000	That's why.
8807000	8810000	Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.
8810000	8812000	They even came out and said that.
8812000	8814000	That's why they didn't pick up those original games,
8814000	8817000	because they only want games that they can make sequels for.
8817000	8819000	Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?
8819000	8821000	There's been many Ghostbusters games.
8821000	8822000	Well, you can only make so many.
8822000	8824000	That's not true.
8824000	8828000	They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.
8828000	8831000	Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters II.
8831000	8833000	I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.
8833000	8835000	That was one of those 386 SX games.
8835000	8838000	Would that be something that would be easily...
8838000	8841000	Would they be able to convince the writers and the actors and stuff
8841000	8843000	to be able to continue doing it?
8843000	8845000	They don't need them if they have the IP.
8845000	8846000	Just saying.
8846000	8847000	I don't know.
8847000	8849000	I don't think that would work.
8849000	8850000	That's why.
8850000	8854000	We're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.
8854000	8859000	Remember, there's maybe a World War II and a Modern and Future War.
8859000	8864000	I think this guitar whoring thing is going to really blow up in their faces
8864000	8866000	if they don't start playing it smarter.
8866000	8869000	They've got to innovate these franchises or they're going to disappear.
8869000	8872000	But then again, DDR games are still selling, aren't they?
8872000	8874000	Yeah, but DDR, though, they only do...
8874000	8878000	It's only one game a year, but it's one game on each platform.
8878000	8881000	I mean, if they just decided, hey, let's just release one...
8881000	8883000	I think they should just do that with one title
8883000	8885000	and release it on all the platforms.
8885000	8888000	Just make it, you know, downscale the videos or something like that
8888000	8890000	for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something.
8890000	8891000	I think they should do that.
8891000	8893000	I'm going to get Universe 3. That's out there in the wild now, isn't it?
8893000	8896000	Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360.
8896000	8897000	So many games.
8897000	8900000	It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think.
8900000	8903000	They basically give away the full song list.
8903000	8907000	They don't leave anything secret, so there's no joy in unlocking stuff.
8907000	8912000	And it's just, you know, each title is kind of hokey in its own way.
8912000	8913000	All right.
8913000	8915000	But Guitar Hero is going to get the same way.
8915000	8918000	They're going to have, you know, each one is going to be for a different band.
8918000	8919000	And they're going to make it...
8919000	8923000	I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into, say,
8923000	8924000	Guitar Hero World Tour.
8924000	8925000	I don't think they're going to do that.
8925000	8928000	I think Rock Band will, because they've been doing that so far.
8928000	8931000	But I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero.
8931000	8934000	I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time.
8934000	8937000	Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new,
8937000	8941000	I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards
8941000	8944000	DJ Maxx on the PSP.
8944000	8946000	I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this,
8946000	8948000	because until now you've had to import this game.
8948000	8951000	But there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.
8951000	8953000	It's DJ Maxx Fever.
8953000	8956000	DJ Maxx Fever, now, it was going to come out in November,
8956000	8958000	but sadly the game got delayed.
8958000	8960000	It is delayed a couple months.
8960000	8963000	It's now going to come out probably January-ish, is what they're looking at.
8963000	8966000	But the good news is they're supposed to be going back to make it actually
8966000	8968000	compatible with the PSP 3000.
8968000	8971000	Remember, it kind of had its own issues going on there with the PSP 3000,
8971000	8974000	with the whole scan lines and all that stuff.
8974000	8977000	So they're going to go back and fix that to make sure everything works with all
8977000	8980000	the PSPs, and they're going to put in new gear, new items,
8980000	8983000	and apparently some extra hidden content.
8983000	8986000	So apparently the wait won't be all bad for fans of DJ Maxx.
8986000	8990000	And also, the PSP sounds like it's not going to be the only place
8990000	8992000	to catch DJ Maxx Fever.
8992000	8995000	Apparently DJ Maxx Technica is coming to arcades,
8995000	8999000	and that's not DJ Maxx coming to special Korean arcades
8999000	9002000	that you can only find in very limited places in America.
9002000	9007000	Nope, this is actually being licensed to come out in America this December.
9007000	9009000	Here's the interesting thing about the game, though,
9009000	9011000	and how it's different from Beatmania.
9011000	9013000	It uses a touch screen.
9013000	9016000	You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line,
9016000	9019000	which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.
9019000	9023000	But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Maxx.
9023000	9025000	After all, half of the charm in these games is the music.
9025000	9028000	You know, this game almost reminds me that they're...
9028000	9030000	It's almost like they're trying to compete with Jubeet on this.
9030000	9032000	Yeah, that's kind of interesting.
9032000	9033000	It is very interesting.
9033000	9036000	Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the US,
9036000	9041000	and very interesting because between this, Street Fighter IV, Tekken 6,
9041000	9044000	arcades are slowly getting a little love again.
9044000	9047000	Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.
9047000	9050000	I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.
9050000	9054000	Technica is going to plug into the internet for global leaderboards,
9054000	9057000	internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool
9057000	9059000	because that means you can get new songs right on the internet,
9059000	9062000	and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.
9062000	9065000	And I believe there's some type of DJ Maxx soundtrack
9065000	9067000	that you can get that comes with one of these cards,
9067000	9069000	so you can get started.
9069000	9072000	There you have it. And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you,
9072000	9074000	it's U-Beat.
9074000	9076000	That's why I said I should be U-Beat. I corrected myself.
9076000	9078000	Oh, there you go.
9078000	9080000	Sorry.
9080000	9084000	There you go, and apparently some test locations for DJ Maxx Technica
9084000	9088000	are going to be released soon, so some folks that have been playing this game
9088000	9094000	on a more cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year,
9094000	9097000	in 2009, or it might not. We'll see.
9097000	9101000	But I don't know. I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.
9101000	9104000	I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use
9104000	9106000	and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golf Land
9106000	9108000	that that touchscreen is going to turn to shit,
9108000	9112000	but it sounds cool.
9112000	9115000	Sounds like it might work.
9115000	9118000	All right. Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight
9118000	9120000	were probably thinking towards the end of Part A,
9120000	9123000	hey, where's Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week?
9123000	9126000	We tune in every week to hear Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week.
9126000	9128000	And we didn't hear it tonight during Part A.
9128000	9131000	Well, that's because Dark Soccer got here a little earlier than anticipated.
9131000	9134000	We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.
9134000	9136000	Yep.
9136000	9141000	So get ready to experience a game from gaming's history
9141000	9143000	as Dark Soccer goes through her archives and picks a game
9143000	9146000	that you all should be playing right now.
9146000	9155000	Absolutely. The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
9155000	9156000	which-
9156000	9158000	And what a choice.
9158000	9162000	Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.
9162000	9165000	And I love the intro to it, okay?
9165000	9173000	But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.
9173000	9179000	Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X,
9179000	9181000	which is my favorite Castlevania game,
9181000	9185000	where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X.
9185000	9188000	You're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard,
9188000	9194000	trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.
9194000	9200000	The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it,
9200000	9203000	where you have different areas that you're exploring,
9203000	9205000	and you have to move through the different areas.
9205000	9209000	You hear different weapons on the way.
9209000	9214000	Really, it's just a lot of-
9214000	9216000	This game is just completely unique,
9216000	9221000	as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.
9221000	9224000	We've also had various other releases.
9224000	9230000	I've got the Saturn version, which is actually graphically not my favorite,
9230000	9232000	because the Saturn did the other 3D as well.
9232000	9235000	You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.
9235000	9239000	You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game,
9239000	9241000	you can play as Richter, which is really cool.
9241000	9248000	He's got his own attacks and everything.
9248000	9255000	But basically, through the game, you have an RPG element to the game,
9255000	9262000	where you've got your familiars with you.
9262000	9265000	I love the sword familiar. The sword familiar was my favorite.
9265000	9270000	But you've also got interactions between characters that go in.
9270000	9273000	You can even choose your path through the game,
9273000	9276000	and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive,
9276000	9278000	because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.
9278000	9281000	Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.
9281000	9283000	It was done by-
9283000	9284000	Wait, wait, here comes the best part.
9284000	9285000	Okay.
9285000	9289000	Dime monster, you don't belong in this world.
9289000	9294000	It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.
9294000	9300000	I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.
9300000	9306000	Tribute? You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.
9306000	9311000	Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.
9311000	9314000	Your words are as empty as your soul.
9314000	9318000	Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.
9318000	9320000	What is a man?
9320000	9323000	A miserable little pile of secrets.
9323000	9325000	Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.
9325000	9328000	Have at you!
9328000	9331000	It is just this cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.
9331000	9334000	One of the best gaming moments ever.
9334000	9336000	This person though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing,
9336000	9337000	because they wait.
9337000	9341000	When you're fighting Dracula the first time around as Richter,
9341000	9345000	if you let yourself die, then Maria comes out and says,
9345000	9349000	all my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!
9349000	9351000	Or something like that.
9351000	9355000	But I never needed her help.
9355000	9361000	Anyway, with the development of this game,
9361000	9365000	actually there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.
9365000	9371000	Actually, there's a thing that was called Castlevania the Bloodletting,
9371000	9377000	which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in development.
9377000	9384000	But the art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima,
9384000	9387000	doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.
9387000	9391000	Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.
9391000	9398000	Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.
9398000	9405000	I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.
9405000	9408000	But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D,
9408000	9414000	like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.
9414000	9420000	There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.
9420000	9422000	It's actually pretty cool.
9422000	9427000	However, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version,
9427000	9431000	which, you know, we've covered this and it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade.
9431000	9436000	If you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.
9436000	9441000	Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.
9441000	9444000	It's a greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.
9444000	9450000	But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions to come out,
9450000	9459000	and also there was the PSP version, this also has the Dart Priest's shaft.
9459000	9461000	Which is right up on the screen right now.
9461000	9465000	Which I just think is the greatest bad guy ever.
9465000	9471000	Yeah, it's the same shaft who was in Gameplay.
9471000	9480000	This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.
9480000	9487000	I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.
9487000	9489000	You know what I mean?
9489000	9494000	This was also the first one I think that Igarashi was in development on,
9494000	9499000	so I think that it's his input that specifically brought this style about.
9499000	9502000	I got to meet him, that was so cool.
9506000	9509000	Anyway, there are some particular differences.
9509000	9513000	The original name for this...
9513000	9517000	Actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him,
9517000	9523000	he imported this game when it first came out, because he was that anxious to play it.
9523000	9529000	The original name of it was Akumajo-Jakula X Geka no Yasukyoku,
9529000	9534000	which is not Turn in the Moonlight, pretty much.
9534000	9539000	Which is why you've seen it referred to as both names.
9539000	9541000	There are several differences.
9541000	9545000	First of all, in the Japanese version it has two extra familiars.
9545000	9548000	There's the Sprite Familiar and the Nose Devil Familiar.
9548000	9550000	Basically the Sprite is a palette swap,
9550000	9554000	the Nose Devil basically is the demon one with a Tengu mask.
9554000	9557000	I will not.
9557000	9562000	Sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.
9562000	9568000	The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga
9568000	9571000	that came with the Japanese version.
9571000	9576000	I can tell you it's pretty sweet, it's actually really, really cool.
9576000	9580000	It's sort of like just a little behind the scenes thing of Alucard waking up
9580000	9584000	and going off and kicking ass.
9584000	9592000	There's also different versions of the last stage.
9592000	9598000	Basically, in the US version you saw it was called Bloodlines
9598000	9600000	when Richter's chapter started up,
9600000	9607000	and in the Japanese one it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.
9607000	9610000	I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows up
9610000	9613000	towards the end of the game boss fight.
9613000	9617000	Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.
9617000	9619000	I love playing as Maria.
9619000	9623000	Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.
9623000	9627000	She just has some of her attacks are really hard to do.
9627000	9634000	But there's different remixes that play of old Castlevania music,
9634000	9636000	depending on if you play as Richter or Maria,
9636000	9638000	and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.
9638000	9641000	There are actually really good mixes of them, too.
9641000	9646000	The load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.
9646000	9649000	Oh, that's not the game, sorry. This is somebody's spear run.
9649000	9651000	I'm looking at it.
9651000	9654000	Sorry.
9654000	9658000	It actually has distorted sprites.
9658000	9662000	Really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better,
9662000	9664000	and they just didn't take advantage of it.
9664000	9667000	It was very rushed.
9667000	9670000	But it did have two extra levels in the game.
9670000	9674000	This is me being a nerd.
9674000	9677000	For anyone who has ever done this,
9677000	9681000	when you're in the first level, you'll find a trapdoor that closes
9681000	9685000	when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?
9685000	9690000	There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trapdoor,
9690000	9693000	and it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave,
9693000	9696000	and then you go into another room down there,
9696000	9700000	and in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room, that's all it is.
9700000	9705000	In the Saturn 1, you go down that same series of cave, you know, there,
9705000	9711000	and it takes you into the underground garden, or whatever they called it,
9711000	9714000	and that was really cool. It was also kind of a difficult place to get through.
9714000	9718000	But I don't know if this is true or not,
9718000	9723000	but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put
9723000	9726000	in the original release and didn't,
9726000	9732000	because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.
9732000	9735000	I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there
9735000	9738000	if there was that little, you know, area.
9738000	9739000	There's also another trick, though.
9739000	9741000	I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.
9741000	9743000	I know it works in the PlayStation version,
9743000	9747000	where you can do like some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat,
9747000	9751000	and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area,
9751000	9753000	which is really useful if you have the walk armor,
9753000	9755000	because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle,
9755000	9757000	the better defense you have.
9757000	9760000	I know a lot about this game. I also know that it's a pain in the ass
9760000	9763000	trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game,
9763000	9766000	in my opinion.
9766000	9769000	But it's a freaking awesome game, and everyone should be playing it.
9769000	9772000	It was voted in 1998.
9772000	9774000	It was the Game of the Year by EGM
9774000	9777000	and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.
9777000	9778000	Which was a bit controversial that year,
9778000	9781000	because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.
9781000	9783000	I think this was better than Final Fantasy VII.
9783000	9789000	This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy VII did.
9789000	9792000	I played this game for hours at a time.
9792000	9795000	Me too, I love this game. I love it.
9795000	9797000	Did you bother getting your walk armor?
9797000	9803000	No, this came out during that period where I wasn't like hardcore into games,
9803000	9805000	because I was like in school.
9805000	9807000	But I still played a lot of this game.
9807000	9809000	We need to just sit down and play through it.
9809000	9810000	It would be fun.
9810000	9814000	It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.
9814000	9816000	I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.
9816000	9824000	Speed runs for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.
9824000	9827000	They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy,
9827000	9829000	because if you really want to beat the game quickly,
9829000	9832000	you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.
9832000	9837000	However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft,
9837000	9842000	call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.
9842000	9843000	Nice.
9843000	9845000	So that earns the whatever reward.
9845000	9847000	By the way, I just want to say also the great thing about this game,
9847000	9850000	speaking of the alternate ways you can do things,
9850000	9857000	what a surprise when you might think you're done with the game,
9857000	9860000	but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.
9860000	9862000	Oh, no, it really was such a surprise.
9862000	9863000	It was crazy.
9863000	9864000	It was awesome.
9864000	9867000	I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it,
9867000	9869000	which I would hope is not that many people at this point,
9869000	9871000	but if you've never seen it, it's one of those moments where you're like,
9871000	9872000	ah, goddamn.
9872000	9878000	Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.
9878000	9883000	I mean, it really is fantastic.
9883000	9891000	There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.
9891000	9894000	I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.
9894000	9897000	There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library
9897000	9899000	and you do your double jump in one particular place,
9899000	9902000	you can actually pop up under the librarian
9902000	9904000	and knock him into the ceiling.
9904000	9905000	Nice.
9905000	9908000	And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, whee!
9908000	9909000	It's true.
9909000	9910000	You can.
9910000	9911000	That's awesome.
9911000	9912000	I'd like to see that.
9912000	9915000	And then there's the little chats with Maria,
9915000	9918000	and Maria's kind of ickter.
9918000	9920000	I think she says ickter.
9920000	9923000	Like she's going to spit out acid in your eye.
9923000	9924000	All right.
9924000	9925000	Anyway.
9925000	9927000	Well, what a wonderful game for the week.
9927000	9929000	Castlevania Symphony of the Night, if you haven't checked it out,
9929000	9932000	it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
9932000	9935000	Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games
9935000	9938000	that Dark Soccer brings up once in a while,
9938000	9940000	like games that were never released here or never will be,
9940000	9942000	Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.
9942000	9944000	So you've got to go play it.
9944000	9945000	All right.
9945000	9946000	Let's do a couple more stories,
9946000	9949000	then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.
9949000	9950000	We've been running a little long
9950000	9951000	because of everything else we've been talking about,
9951000	9952000	but we will get to Skypline.
9952000	9954000	We do want to take at least two calls
9954000	9958000	and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.
9958000	9960000	We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.
9960000	9963000	Loki, more news.
9963000	9965000	Yes.
9965000	9968000	Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.
9968000	9972000	Of course, you know, I just made my costume and, yeah, that's cool.
9972000	9975000	But if you want to make some other costumes,
9975000	9978000	Indie Mogul, they have a...
9978000	9980000	I guess it's like a podcast or video cast that they do.
9980000	9982000	It's Backyard FX.
9982000	9985000	And one of the segments that they just did
9985000	9988000	was how to build your own Halo 3 armor,
9988000	9990000	or your own Halo armor, I guess,
9990000	9992000	for under $100.
9992000	9995000	And they actually have instructions on how to do it.
9995000	9997000	It's done with paper.
9997000	9999000	You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft
9999000	10004000	and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff
10004000	10007000	and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.
10007000	10009000	But it can come out looking really cool
10009000	10011000	if you put the time and effort into it
10011000	10014000	and the videos are available online.
10014000	10016000	And it's pretty awesome.
10016000	10018000	If you want to check it out,
10018000	10020000	visit indymogul.com.
10020000	10023000	I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L.
10023000	10026000	All right.
10026000	10029000	It's interesting because, you know, Halloween,
10029000	10031000	we had all the official Master Chief costumes,
10031000	10033000	which, granted, were a lot cheaper
10033000	10035000	because they were, you know...
10035000	10036000	They looked like crap.
10036000	10038000	They were like a hefty bag and a helmet.
10038000	10041000	But, you know, it's kind of interesting that you can do this
10041000	10043000	whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.
10043000	10046000	Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.
10046000	10049000	I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor
10049000	10053000	or whatever cosplay stuff you want to, you know, use it for.
10053000	10054000	Very cool.
10054000	10056000	Well, one more story before we get to the Skype line tonight,
10056000	10058000	and it has to do with China
10058000	10062000	and something very interesting that they are thinking about doing on...
10062000	10065000	Actually, or they are going to be doing on real money trades.
10065000	10066000	You know what that is?
10066000	10069000	That whole MMO thing, you know, where you basically trade money
10069000	10070000	for gold in the game.
10070000	10071000	Guess what?
10071000	10073000	China, the government in China,
10073000	10077000	they have now instituted a tax on real money transactions,
10077000	10080000	which, you know, if you think it's a big industry here in China...
10080000	10083000	I mean, you know, if you play any MMO at length,
10083000	10087000	then you will hear the mandatory Chinese gold farmer joke in the game.
10087000	10090000	You know, it's a huge industry in China,
10090000	10093000	and they've decided to tax it over there,
10093000	10097000	which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern
10097000	10099000	for, you know, kind of money under the table,
10099000	10101000	laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.
10101000	10103000	They have just taxed it.
10103000	10106000	Twenty percent is the tax,
10106000	10108000	and this announcement just came out.
10108000	10110000	It was distributed to local tax bureaus,
10110000	10114000	and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency
10114000	10118000	from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.
10118000	10120000	Taxation officials are granted the right
10120000	10123000	to determine the original price of the online virtual currency
10123000	10128000	if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.
10128000	10131000	Interesting.
10131000	10135000	Do you think we might be next here in America
10135000	10137000	to tax this kind of stuff?
10137000	10139000	We'll try, but I don't know if there's much, you know,
10139000	10141000	that they'll want to admit real money transfer.
10141000	10143000	And it goes through these Chinese companies
10143000	10145000	and, like, foreign companies anyways.
10145000	10148000	I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax,
10148000	10150000	but, you know, I don't know.
10150000	10153000	It would be very hard to police everything.
10153000	10156000	That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law,
10156000	10158000	if you ask me.
10158000	10160000	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line,
10160000	10162000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10162000	10164000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10164000	10168000	We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.
10168000	10169000	Loki, while we wait for some calls,
10169000	10171000	do you have any last-minute stories for us?
10171000	10174000	Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.
10174000	10175000	One I was going to mention,
10175000	10178000	I don't know if this is out here anywhere,
10178000	10179000	there was a game that they showed off,
10179000	10182000	I want to say it was a Tokyo game show,
10182000	10185000	and it was teased in Famitsu magazine,
10185000	10190000	a Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross Edge.
10190000	10194000	You may remember such similar games as Namco X Capcom
10194000	10196000	or Namco Cross Capcom.
10196000	10197000	Yep.
10197000	10202000	Well, this game right here, which is out on the PS3,
10202000	10203000	combines a bunch of things.
10203000	10205000	So far, the ones that they've announced,
10205000	10208000	all sorts of different companies are involved.
10208000	10213000	Idea Factory, Gus, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Compile Heart.
10213000	10215000	It's a gaming orgy.
10215000	10216000	It's seriously a gaming orgy.
10216000	10221000	It features characters from Darkstalkers.
10221000	10224000	They have Morgan, Felicia and Dimitri,
10224000	10229000	R. Tonolico, Orica, Misha, and Shirelia.
10229000	10230000	Wow.
10230000	10233000	They've got Atona and Prina, Spectral Souls.
10233000	10234000	Pretty dude.
10234000	10235000	Monokimia 2.
10235000	10240000	They've got Lilia, Rose, and Marie.
10240000	10241000	They have Kitchen Sink.
10241000	10243000	They have everything.
10243000	10245000	And you want to know what the best part about this is?
10245000	10249000	It's coming out to the U.S. spring of next year.
10249000	10250000	Very nice.
10250000	10251000	Hey, I got a caller on hold.
10251000	10252000	Let's go to the phones.
10252000	10253000	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10253000	10254000	Who's this?
10254000	10255000	Solid Goomba.
10255000	10256000	Solid Goomba.
10256000	10257000	What's on your mind, my friend?
10257000	10263000	I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright ban hammer on LittleBigPlanet.
10263000	10264000	Yes, please.
10264000	10265000	Speak away.
10265000	10269000	I haven't played the game yet.
10269000	10272000	I just bought PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.
10272000	10276000	But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.
10276000	10281000	I see it as a homage to the original IP,
10281000	10284000	like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.
10284000	10286000	I think that's perfectly acceptable.
10286000	10290000	And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such,
10290000	10296000	then they should also be going after DV and art users for making fan images.
10296000	10297000	Interesting.
10297000	10300000	I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of...
10300000	10302000	You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.
10302000	10311000	I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the...
10311000	10312000	Oh, crap.
10312000	10314000	The confines of the game, yeah?
10314000	10315000	Yeah.
10315000	10318000	I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off.
10318000	10323000	But, I mean, just to be devil's advocate a little bit, I think some of these levels are pushing it.
10323000	10328000	Like Gears of War-inspired levels is kind of pushing it.
10328000	10331000	I mean, maybe it isn't even an IP thing at that point.
10331000	10333000	Sony just doesn't want that crap out there.
10333000	10336000	They don't want free advertising for Gears of War.
10336000	10339000	Yeah, but at the same time, no one's making money off of it.
10339000	10340000	I guess that's true.
10340000	10344000	But it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels.
10344000	10349000	But then again, as I understand it, Sony has been pulling levels about the PlayStation 3.
10349000	10350000	Right.
10350000	10363000	But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that kind of, some would say, overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.
10363000	10366000	And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this, a Galaga level.
10366000	10367000	Yes.
10367000	10368000	You know who made this one?
10368000	10369000	Same guy did the Gradius level.
10369000	10370000	Did it just come out or something?
10370000	10371000	No, he's got a bunch of videos.
10371000	10372000	He also did a Tetris level.
10372000	10373000	That's even better than the other one.
10373000	10375000	Oh my god.
10375000	10377000	That's crazy.
10377000	10379000	But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.
10379000	10381000	Because they're in Japanese.
10381000	10383000	And the company is a European company.
10383000	10385000	They probably can't read what his level says.
10385000	10389000	Now, a comment from Chatroom, and I apologize if I mispronounced this name.
10389000	10390000	It's a new name I haven't seen before.
10390000	10393000	Sunchez? Sunchez? Sunchez?
10393000	10394000	I like cheese.
10394000	10396000	So Sunchez says, uh, that's Two Zs.
10396000	10398000	It says Two Zs, not Two Es.
10398000	10400000	So Sunchez, maybe.
10400000	10405000	I'm tired of playing Super Mario Brothers 1-1 again and again.
10405000	10410000	It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Brothers level 1-1.
10410000	10416000	But even though, yeah, I'm sick of playing it too, there is that moment of, hey, cool.
10416000	10418000	When you first see it, right?
10418000	10420000	I don't know.
10420000	10425000	So if you had this game, or you're going to be getting this game soon enough, Solid Goomba,
10425000	10426000	what kind of level are you going to make?
10426000	10428000	Are you going to go and just make something original?
10428000	10433000	Or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?
10433000	10434000	Oh, I'm going to infringe.
10434000	10437000	I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.
10437000	10439000	There you go.
10439000	10440000	Awesome.
10440000	10443000	Hey, anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3 besides, you know,
10443000	10444000	because you're just now picking one up?
10444000	10447000	Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?
10447000	10450000	I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.
10450000	10453000	One more thought on the whole user-created content.
10453000	10454000	Please.
10454000	10458000	I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the, like, you know, the PC.
10458000	10463000	Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.
10463000	10466000	Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?
10466000	10470000	And if we'll see it any time soon?
10470000	10474000	Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.
10474000	10477000	So who knows?
10477000	10480000	In a way, yes, I think so.
10480000	10485000	It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember ten years ago,
10485000	10489000	the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point,
10489000	10493000	and the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems,
10493000	10494000	you didn't have to have a monitor.
10494000	10496000	You could hook it up to your TV.
10496000	10499000	So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now
10499000	10505000	and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.
10505000	10508000	Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.
10508000	10511000	Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.
10511000	10513000	All right, thanks, man. Have a good one.
10513000	10516000	You too, buddy. Take care.
10516000	10518000	It's very interesting, you know.
10518000	10522000	So much joking and funny things at Sony's expense,
10522000	10528000	but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.
10528000	10531000	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10531000	10532000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
10532000	10536000	Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind?
10536000	10541000	Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.
10541000	10545000	I heard, you lucky bastard. How is it? Are you enjoying it?
10545000	10547000	It's pretty cool.
10547000	10558000	It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.
10558000	10563000	Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.
10563000	10570000	Basically, the parties, the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome.
10570000	10575000	I haven't tried it yet, but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good.
10575000	10583000	The interface, it's totally revamped. It's easier to use than the old one.
10583000	10593000	I have still to get accustomed to it, but like I said, it's pretty easy to use the whole interface.
10593000	10600000	Huh. Very cool. Have you been able to try the Netflix? I don't know if you do Netflix.
10600000	10604000	No, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh? Do they have the Netflix thing?
10604000	10611000	Yeah, we don't have Netflix. Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.
10611000	10614000	But I heard it's pretty cool.
10614000	10619000	I imagine you spend a little time building an avatar. How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?
10619000	10624000	It's pretty easy to use. It's pretty easy to create an avatar, though.
10624000	10631000	What I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.
10631000	10639000	You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.
10639000	10655000	You have predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.
10655000	10661000	So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Miis, and you could really customize that.
10661000	10670000	But because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited is kind of the impression I'm getting.
10670000	10684000	Yeah, it's kind of limited. You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff.
10684000	10694000	But not like on the Wii that you have more choices to make.
10694000	10701000	Hey, quick question from SSJ100Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friendless limit in it?
10701000	10703000	I don't think they did.
10703000	10710000	I really don't know. I'm gonna search that, but I think they haven't.
10710000	10717000	I don't think they have either based on what I heard, but I was just curious. Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut. I don't know.
10717000	10723000	Well, Akdeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?
10723000	10735000	Well, it's pretty good. Like I said, I hope we Mexicans could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.
10735000	10747000	From what I have seen and what I have played with, it's pretty good. It's a whole new experience for the Xbox.
10747000	10756000	Alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico, even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent, I don't know, so be nice.
10756000	10757000	I hope so.
10757000	10769000	Alright, well, Akdeft, have a good one, buddy. And have fun playing that experience I can't have right now, because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off, because I'd have surgery.
10769000	10778000	Boohoo, QQ, cry cry. One more call. Well, I said two, but I'm feeling nice. Do one more call.
10778000	10783000	1877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10783000	10786000	Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?
10786000	10800000	Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me. Apparently the Melger Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.
10800000	10805000	Interesting. Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10805000	10807000	Oh, it's Spazinator.
10807000	10810000	Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10810000	10828000	Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment. In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell like video game soundtracks?
10828000	10840000	The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely, if ever, have soundtracks and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd.
10840000	10846000	Video game soundtracks. CD Japan still in business? It's been years since I bought one.
10846000	10847000	I'm sure they are.
10847000	10857000	Yeah, that would be one. There's other Japanese based sites too. I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.
10857000	10860000	Amazon Japan, I've ordered CD's from them before.
10860000	10867000	Playasia, that's right. Playasia soundtracks. Definitely Playasia, check them out. Because they sell games too if you want to get import games and all that stuff.
10867000	10869000	So they specialize in that stuff.
10869000	10871000	And toys.
10871000	10878000	There you go. So there's some sites to check out. And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.
10878000	10904000	Also, as far as Guitar Hero will tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not. Have you noticed any issues with the main menu at all where the graphics and the menu would essentially glitch out?
10904000	10912000	No, I don't even own the game at all yet. And when I do get it, I'll probably get it on 360 because that's where I have all my rock band games and I want the guitar to be compatible with everything.
10912000	10919000	But I haven't heard anything of that specifically. I've been hearing of bugs left and right in Guitar Hero.
10919000	10928000	But not anything with the menu. Although, something about I'm hearing band mode. Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?
10928000	10942000	Well, so far just myself. One thing I noticed is that the initial logos and loading screen and whatnot will appear normal.
10942000	10959000	But as soon as you get into the actual menu where there's solo play, options, so on and so forth, that's when the background gets all wonky. You can't even see what you're selecting. Stuff like that.
10959000	10980000	You know, I haven't heard of anything. I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you. I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched. Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.
10980000	10984000	And you said you had a comment or another question?
10984000	11002000	Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar. Do you know what that's for?
11002000	11016000	I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal. Didn't we talk about this on the show a long time ago? You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller? They never used it. Wasn't it going to be for an Effector pedal at one point?
11016000	11021000	Yeah, and they even set it in the Guitar Hero 2 manual.
11021000	11029000	But it just never happened. Never materialized. They opted for the fog machines instead. Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?
11029000	11036000	It came out, I think. Did it really? I think it did. Why are we not in possession of one? Because they're a hundred bucks. So? And I haven't thought about buying it yet.
11036000	11046000	I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog. It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want. Maybe not.
11046000	11075000	Yeah, actually, I see it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Informer or official Xbox magazine, I forget which. And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago. And I think they may list a website where you can buy it. I can look it up and email you a link or something.
11075000	11093000	It got really good reviews, too, because they actually made it. It's not just something that randomly does it with sound or whatever. They programmed in triggers in Rock Band 1 and 2 that will trigger different lighting and smoke effects based on what's going on in the game.
11093000	11105000	That's so rad. It will actually sync up with it, and it's pretty awesome. I think they are available now. In fact, I should probably get one when I get my bonus. That'd be funny.
11105000	11111000	First thing that comes up, Rock Band Stage Kid, available right now on GameStop.com. It will cost you twenty bucks to ship it, though.
11111000	11125000	Why do we need this? Because, spoken lights! If you want me to gag, then get one. I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.
11125000	11147000	I just want one in my house. No, I'm just kidding. We're not gonna waste the money on this. Loki, do not waste money on this. Ooh, alright. He's gonna do it. Hey, Spaznator, we gotta go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Take care, buddy.
11147000	11160000	Alright, sorry to those that didn't get through. I know there were a lot of people still trying to get through. It happens. Alright, yeah, you're right. You don't need it. Alright, any more last minute stories? I'm sorry, Loki. Or Dark Soccer. I don't know if you have any that you found.
11160000	11168000	Five. Is your last minute story? Yes. Awesome. There's also a glitch in Little Big Planet that will ruin your game.
11168000	11187000	Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed, and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying. Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod, and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.
11187000	11204000	Oh man, that sucks. So, remember, once again, because- Oh god, and people are gonna put that shit on the internet. There'll be those custom levels. Hold on, hold on. Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that. Just back up your save. That's all you gotta do.
11204000	11219000	Yes, people could- Well, here's the thing. If you spawn in the level, and you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it. Just quit the game and say, fuck this. So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing. A giant death wheel. Don't make a towering death a wheel.
11219000	11234000	There were some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet. There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest. It was as hard as those crazy games online that I want to be the guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.
11234000	11255000	I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here. I'm just kinda going through some of them. One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're gonna do it. There's a 9-11 level where the guy flings a thing through buildings and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.
11255000	11267000	The guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome. He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.
11267000	11284000	And a BeatMania level. No, no BeatMania level. No, Bobby said on his show he did a BeatMania level as well. Really? Yeah. It's kinda crap, but it's supposedly BeatMania inspired. There's a good way to put it. But he says you won't find it on YouTube, it's in the game.
11284000	11296000	I was gonna show you this one real quick here, Rob. It's got poops in it and a butt that poops out those little Japanese cute little doody things.
11296000	11311000	Oh please, please, I really want to see this. Hold on, I gotta find the part where it's at here. Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.
11311000	11321000	Okay, as you can see the butt right there. Can I just start it? Yeah, just start it. Okay. Did I hit it? Start. Oh. Little turds fall out.
11321000	11333000	Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster! That's amazing. Oh yeah. What will they think of next? I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...
11333000	11345000	And then they have this other one that some guy made. It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome. It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race. It's like Excite Truck, but not.
11345000	11355000	Alright, we're gonna get out of here. We gotta wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here. DarkSoccer, your final thought is poop. Loki, your final thought?
11355000	11359000	My final thought is I actually gotta start messing with this editor now. Looks awesome.
11359000	11372000	My final thought is pie. And for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.
11372000	11384000	You know, all we ask is just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth. And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, BocoFett wrote a really nice one this week.
11384000	11398000	The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world. The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.
11398000	11408000	Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met but you know well. Aww. Almost makes you want to barf. It's so nice. No, but thank you very much for that nice review. Hope to see you soon.
11408000	11411000	I feel squishy, Rob. I need to go to the bathroom now.
11411000	11424000	All right. You need to open up your poppet and hit the explode button. Little big planet joke. Anyhow, until next week, God, we've told you about 50 games you need to go out and play right now. Everything from Symphony of the Night to Little Big Planet.
