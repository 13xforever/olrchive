229	2813	You're listening to All Games Radio.
3414	8000	Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio, live.
13988	16952	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
31223	31563	We are back.
50333	52294	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
52354	58617	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
59017	65560	And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
65881	67041	Not here yet.
67301	68602	She's running a little late tonight.
69042	69523	TechMasterLoki.com
92065	92305	Yes.
92605	93146	How you doing, Loki?
93446	94327	I'm doing okay.
94987	95367	Awesome.
95848	99870	Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?
99890	105995	Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.
106055	107616	But how did you enjoy the time off?
108296	112039	I don't remember what I did last Sunday, to be honest.
112139	113160	I think I played games.
114417	115217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
135317	151933	I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it so it was very late at night but you know I can't live without my cell phone alright well you started talking about games like Fable 2 so we'll ask you how was your gaming week Loki and we always like to start off the show with a little bit of that
152373	153293	My gaming week was alright.
153353	157155	I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.
157215	160736	I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.
162196	163937	I did play Fable 2 a bit.
166297	167338	Mainly to cheat.
169198	170739	And how I cheated.
171939	172839	Let me count the ways.
173880	175560	First, I cheated to get lots of money.
176241	178501	And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property.
178981	180502	And then time travel.
181850	203544	and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again so I have lots of money now and then I decided to get lots of experience and the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own and you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything
204344	205184	So that's what I did.
205565	206165	I did all that.
206325	210967	And then I played a few missions, and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.
211447	213408	So I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.
214429	217270	And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.
217430	219852	In fact, now I am almost done with the game.
220412	222253	I have like two missions left, I think.
222773	224294	And that game is awesome.
224594	225935	It's just a lot of fun.
226415	228116	Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.
228176	228936	In fact, they're
229356	230577	Kind of hating me.
231317	233498	They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.
234418	236559	And I've been winning with like over 20 points.
237880	243282	And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.
244343	245783	And it's not really fun.
246003	252846	The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.
254227	254687	But it's alright.
255643	260566	And then, you know, I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.
260646	262387	And just a lot of activities.
262527	264988	Really appreciate, you know, Saints Row 2.
265028	269210	I think this is a game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.
269911	274653	And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2.
274853	275774	And I don't plan on it.
276074	280016	Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.
280816	283578	But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.
284690	286352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
300307	303451	I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.
304112	306275	But it's really cool.
306755	308117	Slightly offensive still.
308297	309899	And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.
309939	316648	Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.
316908	317769	His character's...
319030	320430	Interesting, to say the least.
320830	322571	We'll just leave it at that, interesting.
323311	328692	But it's a fun game, and it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.
329092	335573	But that's the thing, now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.
335653	337994	It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess.
338514	338834	I don't know.
341174	343455	Then, let's see, what else did I play...
345546	348127	Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo.
348527	350108	Holy crap, is that awesome.
350268	355450	Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.
355550	356350	It's pretty awesome.
356430	362653	Now, this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.
363553	366135	So I gotta go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.
366175	368918	Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.
369898	384010	They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there, which is cool, because that game is really cheesy anyways, and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim, I guess, would be really fun.
385011	386392	But they're gonna have downloadable characters.
386412	388654	They're gonna have Obama and Sarah Palin.
389015	389455	Oh lord.
390135	390776	So that'll be funny.
391697	391777	Um...
393186	393867	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
411334	411814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
433223	435584	That's basically what I've been playing this week.
436045	437385	I have Fallout 3.
438106	441347	I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
441387	444829	I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.
444869	445550	It's just too much.
446310	450012	And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.
450712	454034	I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.
455355	456976	Just a lot of stuff.
457156	458296	Oh, and I got Resistance 2.
458476	459517	That was the other game I played.
459857	460357	Resistance 2.
461038	461178	And...
462335	468663	You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.
469504	471487	I'm not liking it as much as the first one.
471567	474230	I think what it is, is there's not a lot of setup.
474310	477174	It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.
477214	479877	Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...
480778	489720	Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything, I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.
489940	491461	But this is just, it's too much.
492241	492981	Just too quick.
493141	498402	So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.
498502	500223	But it's been good.
500383	503843	It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.
504044	507104	You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.
507704	509885	Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?
511297	513980	I don't... It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.
514000	521969	I think it's going to be about as big as, like, say... Maybe Assassin's Creed, but I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.
522429	522870	Interesting.
523370	524291	But it'll be fun.
524491	527635	I mean, it's one of those games that they could add, like, you know...
528936	530117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
550197	550958	I'll have to check it out.
550978	555481	I'm not usually a big fan on the first-person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.
556122	558664	It's because it's not really a shooter.
558684	560445	You can't really call it a first-person shooter, right?
560866	563508	It's more of a first-person, free-running sim.
563568	565329	Yeah, and I do love Portal.
565389	567871	I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first-person.
567911	569493	You shoot portals, so who knows?
571174	574937	Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.
575497	578260	CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.
579180	579661	They're okay.
579761	584383	It just takes a lot of getting used to because, like I said, I kept falling off the building a lot.
585124	589887	If you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Anything else for your gaming week?
590547	590867	That's it.
591267	595770	Let me answer the questions in the chat room because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.
596631	598692	Obviously, I'm here, so I'm doing fine.
599372	601694	To answer what Marin in the chat said...
602694	603974	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
625239	630420	They did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube and I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.
630820	632501	And they didn't put it in a jar for me.
633481	638502	And I didn't really get to... I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.
639123	646264	But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin.TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.
646544	647165	But see, Loki?
647465	648885	That was my gallbladder there on the left.
649952	651814	Sky, did you vote?
651834	653056	Yes, I went and voted.
653096	654157	That's a very important thing.
654177	655319	I hope y'all did too, no matter what you did.
668256	669017	I hope you did go vote.
670078	671239	I voted on the monorail.
671319	672900	I mean, bullet train.
673800	675181	I was pro-monorail.
675882	676502	Yeah, I did vote.
676562	678944	I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.
679044	688091	If I was a little worried, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time, I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the car and go vote.
688431	691013	If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.
691533	691954	So there you go.
693314	694074	So I'm doing great.
694575	695395	I feel a lot better.
695435	697295	I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.
697395	703017	I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including OLR.
703357	705598	Be sure to download it in case you haven't done it yet.
705618	708559	The free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.
708579	709099	I already did.
709319	710319	Yeah, those are funny.
710799	714440	And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.
714981	715221	Really?
715501	715641	Yep.
715861	716521	I wanted a card.
717376	718637	Oh, not that I really care.
735350	741333	And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out and I asked him to pick me up a game and he did it.
741713	744074	And that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
744474	746615	I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.
746915	754238	As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it.
754898	756459	So I don't really remember it at all.
756499	760401	Like I do, I remember thinking it was very much like...
761454	762936	Here's my thing with Castlevania games.
763056	766060	To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.
766140	770265	There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.
770305	772408	They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.
772648	777294	Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait until Castlevania Judgment comes out.
777394	778956	That'll innovate you up the ass.
779176	787044	Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony Night is one hella good game, but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?
787544	789005	It makes me miss them on the console.
789646	791648	And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.
791728	795291	I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.
795351	799595	I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.
799916	803139	It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.
803539	803559	I...
804580	806561	But keep in mind, Vicodin.
806741	808522	So I'm not really at my peak.
808622	813505	So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.
813805	815186	Did you try to hit it for massive damage?
816365	819086	Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.
820546	825407	That's because it only applies to... I didn't have six axis on the DS, that's why.
825827	826227	Didn't work.
826948	832989	But I do have six axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.
833069	833749	Wait, I gotta read this.
834730	836290	I gotta read this comment in chat.
836790	840631	Marin in chat says, Castlevania, Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.
841011	844052	Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.
846354	854601	Anyhow, the other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called LittleBigPlanet.
855321	856963	And as far as my thoughts on LittleBigPlanet...
857934	859175	I love it.
859555	864299	It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.
865280	866821	I love the sense of humor in the game.
867662	869123	I think the graphics look great.
869523	875247	I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.
875748	882213	I think even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.
883374	884194	and DarkSakura.com
905973	906453	Thanks for watching!
927262	928543	Thanks for watching!
948451	950516	All the clones are never going to go away from the top page.
960370	960890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
989165	1018201	and then it was interesting some levels I played you actually could unlock little stickers like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera and that was a sticker I unlocked because people were holding things up to the camera like in Bobby's level you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us Bobby Blackwolf on allgames.com he has a level he did during the beta and as a part of that you can unlock the all games logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox so
1018601	1041282	so but that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself but that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels so and to be honest even if you go in the non-copyright stuff there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with
1041923	1042363	www.DarkSakura.com
1064335	1067936	Like, people use the arrow stickers to point at things.
1068016	1076679	Like, one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.
1077000	1079660	He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.
1080561	1089384	Also, like, if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the pop-it and just hover on it in a minute to show, you know, heart, good thing, heart.
1090404	1091845	Plus, you can also hit people.
1092725	1093365	with your character.
1094605	1095066	Exactly.
1095626	1097286	My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan.
1097426	1099606	He's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.
1099787	1103367	I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.
1103387	1104848	A little tip from me to you.
1105308	1108408	Ace the first area, the little England area.
1108448	1110509	If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.
1110929	1117950	It's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge, but if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.
1118270	1120911	If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.
1121911	1122651	So it's pretty awesome.
1124372	1127652	So yeah, as you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.
1127712	1129913	It's a lot of fun and just exploring it.
1130073	1132773	And there's so much more potential this game has.
1133153	1134853	Does the game have minor flaws?
1136334	1136574	Yeah.
1136654	1140655	Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.
1140695	1142795	There are some frame rate issues sometimes.
1143135	1146096	When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.
1146576	1147496	But I don't know.
1147596	1147936	I look...
1148536	1149477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1175919	1176219	Get it.
1176960	1177620	You're going to love it.
1178440	1183023	If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?
1185707	1186548	That's a big investment.
1187468	1191269	I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.
1192490	1192990	Maybe not.
1193090	1195451	You really have to weigh the pros and the cons.
1195491	1196592	But hey, Christmas is coming around.
1196612	1197732	You're going to be getting gift certificates.
1198112	1201734	It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that other fancy stuff.
1201934	1211838	Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 40 gig system, or I'm sorry, the 80 gig system, and you get a $100 gift card.
1213752	1214955	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1222472	1223452	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1248624	1268737	and between that and then knowing that Home is on the horizon and so on and so on I finally decided to take the plunge and honestly I've been liking the system we did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out but through the magic of patches and all this stuff they've been making the system quite a bit better and now the games are really starting to come out I use it a lot for streaming video files
1269457	1270718	What did you do to my cat?
1270738	1272379	You will now become a new cat.
1296104	1296925	I always thought it was interesting.
1296965	1301508	The place, honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.
1301868	1308232	But it's so odd to me that the freaking Microsoft Vista, what do they call that?
1308272	1309853	The whole media sharing media center?
1310173	1310714	That whole thing on the 360?
1311694	1314156	What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.
1314296	1316057	And it's slow, and it doesn't work.
1316217	1317338	If you use that.
1317598	1318539	Never use that, though.
1319039	1320020	I actually set it up.
1320060	1321761	I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.
1322041	1323302	It is slow as hell.
1323602	1324703	It doesn't work right at all.
1325043	1325604	PlayStation 3?
1326805	1328406	I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.
1328686	1328906	Yes.
1329006	1329506	In one minute.
1329807	1336712	What you need to do, what I normally use... I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.
1336772	1338633	I'm hoping the NXE makes that all go away.
1338653	1340795	Media Center is really old, though.
1340915	1344657	What you need to use... I use Tversity, which is awesome, and...
1345818	1348280	I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.
1348300	1349481	I prefer my PS3.
1349921	1352303	I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.
1352343	1354845	I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.
1355205	1360388	Don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product would interface better with Windows than Sony.
1360649	1361029	Five minutes.
1361169	1378738	You see, I don't really use the Zoom stuff for their new Windows Media because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up-and-up, so Diversity works really well with those not-so-legitimate copies of Windows.
1379539	1381039	But it works great.
1381059	1387182	Well, mine's the real deal because it came on my computer and everything, and it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.
1387202	1387983	Okay.
1388877	1389638	Valkyria Chronicles
1413081	1413741	from Sega.
1414442	1418044	Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.
1418664	1422747	It's kind of like an RTS-type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.
1422847	1435455	Like, it's first-person... Like, you go from the top... It zooms in from this top-down view into a first-person view, and then you move your pieces around live and attack things...
1436195	1437779	It's actually kind of neat.
1437919	1440104	And from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.
1440164	1441467	I might pick that one up.
1441547	1443190	I actually had quite a good time with that.
1443611	1444974	So check out the demo if you haven't.
1445175	1446057	Valkyria Chronicles.
1448662	1450804	Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.
1451144	1456650	DarkSakura, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week, but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.
1457971	1467621	I want to say something about the podcast delays, because I've been getting some emails about it, and I've seen posts on the forums about it, and yes, the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.
1468402	1468902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1485251	1485951	Helpful with that.
1486271	1493234	However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine, so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show a hell of a lot faster in the future.
1494055	1495175	So I'm really sorry about that.
1495275	1497676	And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode.
1497696	1502278	And if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny because we had so many people here in-house.
1502418	1503198	So check out episode 300.
1503238	1511762	And again, I'm really sorry, but please understand I usually am the one that puts all those shows together just because I just have traditionally.
1512282	1512402	And
1512962	1514344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1531801	1537247	And just with everything else going on in the world, there was just a lot more on my mind than just Orange Lounge Radio.
1537527	1547758	And honestly, for me, I can't speak for Loki or DarkSakura, but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.
1547998	1549599	So I hope you all understand.
1549620	1550681	In the real world,
1552455	1553316	TV shows.
1553396	1555978	They do, what, like 26 episodes a year, if that?
1555998	1555978	23?
1556099	1557480	What's a season order?
1557500	1559322	Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?
1559742	1562645	Shit, last season we only had, what, 11 episodes all year?
1562665	1563626	It's usually 26, I think.
1563646	1565668	So, please bear with us.
1566048	1566849	We do our best.
1567249	1568210	It's not an anti-podcast thing.
1568290	1574517	Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example, Little Britain, that's six a season.
1575077	1575578	Yeah, so...
1576078	1576498	There you go.
1576739	1581102	So, yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, like, oh, look at me, cry for me.
1581122	1581862	We're on season 50.
1582823	1589088	I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand, sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.
1589428	1596513	But we're here, we're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.
1596894	1604019	Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday, to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody, because, again, it's crazy.
1604039	1605080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1623029	1623710	It went over well.
1624350	1626572	At the Halloween party, I won second place.
1627273	1628394	What did you lose to?
1628574	1629074	My sister.
1629595	1630856	She won with Gurr.
1631896	1634839	Oh, was she like a full-blown Gurr?
1635059	1635299	Yeah.
1636200	1637201	Well, that's pretty awesome.
1637261	1639142	If you're going to lose to anything, lose to Gurr.
1639482	1640924	It's all good, you know.
1641684	1642805	It was just for fun.
1642905	1647829	You have like this family to be reckoned with in Halloween costume contests.
1648269	1649650	I normally don't make costumes.
1649690	1651152	I mean, this is like the first costume I've...
1652205	1654266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1672768	1675550	MakeASackBoy.com What a great plug for the show.
1702509	1703169	Good job, Loki.
1704010	1704410	Good job.
1704811	1707132	All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1707192	1708213	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1708553	1710234	All right, let's start things off.
1710274	1712675	We'll talk about a program called Boku.
1713076	1718179	And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer to LittleBigPlanet.
1718599	1722622	It's a programming language meant... Well, it looks like it's meant for little kids.
1723502	1728085	And basically, you can use this to create your own games and...
1729567	1732993	It's sort of like X and A to a certain extent.
1733774	1736479	And we've talked about this before.
1737788	1745250	Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282, back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a... Damn!
1745490	1747270	Episode number and everything.
1747351	1748011	Nice, Loki.
1748111	1748531	Very nice.
1749771	1753772	Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.
1754272	1760234	They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters and whether I liked them or not, so I hated them all.
1761034	1761694	No, they're alright.
1762094	1781038	But, um, the programming language itself, it's very, um, looks very basic, but, you know, much like LittleBigPlanet, you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it, and they showed some examples of different games, and, um, you know, there's basic AI that you can assign to, you know, objects and tell them how to behave and that kind of thing.
1781718	1786619	And the games itself, um, look like they're, the levels almost look like they're made out of Legos, which is kind of cool.
1787499	1788259	So, um,
1789801	1792302	No word on when exactly this is going to be available.
1792662	1794742	I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.
1794782	1800183	They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.
1801383	1806524	And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week, although it's been at a few different conventions.
1806584	1811065	It's just been so much... Didn't they have, like, a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo, if I remember right?
1811085	1812326	There was something about it.
1812366	1814966	Like, it was almost like an informational thing only, if I remember right.
1815066	1817007	No, no, the thing at... I thought I saw it somewhere.
1817207	1817847	No, the thing at...
1819247	1819847	PENI Arcade
1844753	1845854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1863763	1867668	This is supposed to be available, I guess it looks like now.
1867708	1869210	They're saying early next year.
1870232	1870672	It's pretty cool.
1870753	1871514	They have a video.
1871594	1873116	If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra.
1873136	1874918	They have it mirrored on Joystick.
1876040	1877001	Definitely check it out.
1877161	1878022	It's pretty cool looking.
1879765	1881387	It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.
1882611	1891117	And you know what's funny is the entire time that I was playing LittleBigPlanet, I was thinking, how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?
1891618	1896822	Honestly, because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by, you know what I mean?
1897382	1899524	They always are trying to one-up, especially Sony.
1899884	1902206	So it's just funny that this is coming to light.
1902246	1904087	Hey, don't forget about us, we got a game coming.
1904627	1908350	Well, yeah, I mean, and this has been around for a while now.
1908410	1911793	It's been in development for at least a few years, so...
1913424	1918800	I don't know, they definitely won't be the last people to do that, you know
1919699	1920640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1943917	1949165	SonicM88 in chat, chat.artistonsradio.com says, I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.
1949446	1951409	I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.
1951429	1952791	That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.
1952811	1954534	There's so many games out there to catch up on.
1954854	1956136	It's insanity.
1956156	1958500	But of course, this is the holidays every year.
1958540	1958760	It's like,
1958820	1962583	Yeah, and also you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.
1962643	1968568	I mean, it's like, especially during the holiday, it feels like that you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.
1969028	1973552	You know, like Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I got to get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.
1973612	1975453	But I'm like, I got too much shit I got to play.
1975473	1976815	I'm not going to go buy another game.
1976835	1982479	That's how I feel, because I've heard like Fallout 3 is oblivion with guns and nothing could like sell a game better for me.
1982559	1984261	But I just, I don't have fucking time.
1984921	1986063	between all the other games I'm trying to play.
1986103	1988706	And then add on top of that, Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.
1988726	1990368	And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.
1990769	1991049	Addict.
1991790	1994093	Oh, it sounds like DarkSakura is here with us.
1994674	1995595	How are you doing, Jamie?
1995755	1997177	I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.
1997277	1997818	There you go.
1998159	1999360	You sound a little raspy.
1999380	2000462	Have you been yelling a lot today?
2000742	2002384	I'm yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.
2022796	2024097	because I'm hungry.
2024377	2029199	Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.
2029219	2031940	I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.
2032640	2035862	And it's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.
2036042	2036222	Yes.
2036282	2037663	And Dunkin' Donuts even, I think.
2037743	2039783	I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.
2040104	2040324	It is.
2041284	2046006	Toko's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.
2046686	2050848	Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.
2051828	2056090	But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.
2056850	2061192	And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.
2061252	2063472	I'm like, family-sized sandwich?
2063873	2065733	They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.
2065773	2067794	I'm like, really, you say?
2067874	2070055	That is a size that I was unaware of.
2070675	2073637	And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.
2073657	2075098	24 inches for you, not them.
2076319	2083604	And so basically what I'm going to do with this is, it's not, I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it like throughout the week.
2083724	2086206	So it's lunch for all week.
2086306	2088047	How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?
2088067	2088188	20 bucks.
2090228	2095391	You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?
2095551	2096051	That's not bad.
2096191	2096932	That isn't bad.
2097072	2097732	That's not bad at all.
2097772	2099973	I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.
2100714	2105776	It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about $2, and then, so it's like $19.
2105836	2110319	Doesn't Subway just, drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs?
2110899	2111319	DarkSakura.com
2133451	2134552	You know, you can go in there.
2134652	2137693	In fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than two feet.
2137753	2140715	I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.
2140755	2143856	But no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger.
2143896	2147918	Because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a three foot long sandwich to come in the work with that.
2147938	2148699	Because it would be funny.
2148859	2150700	Because people are like, what the hell are you doing?
2150720	2152501	They've done that for work events where I worked before.
2153181	2158143	I usually save these things until the end of the show, but it works too much now.
2158723	2165806	You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews because it makes us feel really good about what we're doing.
2165946	2169407	It helps us spread the word out about our show and increases our rankings in iTunes.
2169927	2170247	We do.
2170307	2171848	We need our EP stroked once in a while.
2172128	2179291	And a couple of you have stroked it in the past couple weeks, including this review from BioHaze20, who says, one of the best podcasts out there.
2179691	2180732	And yes, this is related.
2181012	2186054	Orange Lounge Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.
2188630	2189731	That's fantastic.
2189771	2194896	And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.
2194916	2199001	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.
2199661	2200462	Signed, Jamie.
2201123	2208810	I was just hoping they'd have some really cool long box that you could put it in or something because they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to take it home and...
2209531	2209871	I don't know.
2210192	2212914	And I didn't have them cut it either because I figured that was... All right!
2212974	2214035	Enough sandwich!
2214636	2215256	Jesus!
2215316	2219500	Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.
2219700	2220120	All right.
2220421	2222583	How was your gaming week, of all things?
2223360	2224480	I played Fable too.
2224840	2226241	And what'd you think?
2226501	2229782	I smashed beetles and I tried to be a good little girl.
2231603	2233203	Dan had an interesting experience.
2233263	2236724	His big beefy man got turned into a big beefy woman.
2237564	2246327	He drank the gender potion and so he decided just to be evil and went around killing everybody and his dog turned black and he lost his halo and grew horns.
2247606	2247766	Awesome.
2247786	2248126	The end.
2248146	2249327	I still haven't played Fable 2.
2249567	2250087	I'm having to live.
2250107	2252368	It's another one of those games on the back burner.
2252649	2262433	Also, one of our listeners who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat, so I'm just going to say Rob.
2264114	2264855	And it's a good name.
2265055	2266035	Yes, it's a very good name.
2266516	2269237	I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.
2269697	2269977	Nice.
2271198	2271638	Very nice.
2271978	2275260	I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming, but...
2275782	2278583	Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?
2281064	2283906	I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.
2284226	2284886	Alright, alright.
2285106	2285466	Fair enough.
2287747	2295411	I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality and have instead moved to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever!
2296251	2296751	Fair enough.
2296971	2298512	Hey, and in your DS game, he will be.
2298992	2299232	Yes.
2299252	2299652	So there you go.
2299692	2300733	You just have to never watch the show again.
2300753	2301893	Except it's got Martha in it.
2301993	2303054	Martha's not fun.
2304314	2305055	I like Donna.
2306716	2307216	Dr. Donna.
2307376	2308217	What else was I going to ask you?
2308317	2308837	Oh, you.
2309337	2309637	You.
2310177	2310517	What?
2310577	2312578	You need to play LittleBigPlanet.
2312858	2313418	I'm gonna.
2313458	2315379	It is fucking amazing.
2315399	2316499	We're supposed to get a free copy.
2316699	2326002	And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in, you know, the traditional English style, making those little puns, I think of you.
2326702	2328283	Because I know you live for that stuff.
2328543	2329323	I want to move there.
2329443	2331404	The narrator is some famous guy, too.
2331464	2334285	He's the guy that narrates... He did Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
2334525	2335625	Yeah, he's... Oh, sweet.
2335905	2337386	Season 2 of Supernatural Season 3 of Supernatural
2363988	2364728	Thank you.
2364828	2366689	It was on the tip of my tongue.
2366729	2368070	I didn't want to have to look it up because I'm lazy.
2368090	2369831	I am going to be watching more Supernatural.
2370111	2374074	I vow by the end of the semester I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.
2375074	2376735	Because that is now my favorite TV show.
2376995	2378016	Is that on the CW?
2379337	2379657	Yes.
2379777	2381518	You know what else they show on the CW?
2381998	2382699	What?
2382999	2382699	90210.
2383279	2383719	Just saying.
2384040	2386061	It doesn't exist in my alternate reality, Rob.
2387720	2388882	You shut your mouth.
2388982	2392807	Apparently, post-episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.
2393609	2394330	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
2394570	2394870	You know what?
2395411	2395792	Excuse me.
2396272	2401760	Masters of the Wiki, can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?
2403064	2405764	Also, I ate at a very good restaurant, speaking of food.
2406405	2406945	Not today.
2407425	2408785	Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?
2408805	2409445	I have to talk about it, Rob.
2409465	2410265	I have to talk about it, Rob.
2410345	2410645	All right.
2410965	2413426	It's called something Bohem.
2414246	2415066	Lost something Bohem.
2415126	2415746	Lovey Bohem?
2415826	2416606	Like the Rent song?
2416926	2419507	No, but it's kind of... Okay, it's an Italian song.
2419607	2420367	It's an Italian song.
2420847	2422227	It's an Italian Czech restaurant.
2423248	2423488	Nice.
2424068	2430909	They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.
2433604	2437905	I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy gnocchi.
2438185	2438485	What?
2439545	2440266	Shut your mouth.
2440286	2442246	Just talk about Shaft.
2442266	2443326	Shut your mouth and chew.
2444727	2446767	So I had to share that antidote.
2447788	2451849	So in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme from Shaft?
2451969	2452789	At least once per meal.
2456272	2458933	Well, back to gaming news.
2459354	2460214	I don't know what to say.
2460314	2462175	But hey, if you like to blow things up.
2462695	2463516	That would be us!
2463576	2465016	Who doesn't like to blow things up?
2465076	2468678	You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8.
2469578	2471739	And DarkSakura is a bit of a vigilante herself.
2472980	2478803	It's actually, speaking of Chef, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel to it.
2478863	2483285	So maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.
2483545	2484365	It's kind of the sequel.
2484385	2484805	You know what?
2484885	2486266	It was really good food, okay?
2486606	2487766	It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.
2487826	2490007	They had really, really good beer on tap.
2490567	2490787	Nice.
2490967	2493948	And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.
2494048	2495429	Does it have good beer?
2495549	2497369	Actually, this is an old game that's being remade.
2497689	2499370	Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.
2499410	2500810	Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?
2500950	2502231	No, original PlayStation.
2502251	2503291	All right, well, there you go.
2503431	2504912	But now you can play it online with eight people.
2505072	2505712	That's why it's Vigilante 8.
2505752	2508353	I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.
2508373	2509733	800 Microsoft points for the game.
2510193	2510853	Does it have good beer?
2511894	2512234	I don't know.
2512745	2516546	You can drive a bus, a school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.
2516926	2517266	School bus.
2517366	2518486	Was that last week's release?
2519346	2520127	Yeah, this week.
2520147	2522447	You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.
2523107	2524027	Well, we were off for a week.
2524067	2527088	What's coming out this week, on this Wednesday?
2527148	2528448	I know it's coming out next week.
2528729	2529589	I don't know about this week.
2530809	2534950	It's next week's, well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.
2535030	2539831	But this week, I don't know what's coming out this week.
2540963	2544759	but I'm sure we'll learn stuff alright well let's move on
2546513	2557138	Yes, so one thing that... Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War, they have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.
2558819	2564202	Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon, since the game comes out, what, in a couple days anyways?
2564802	2568123	So, yeah, but at least it's kind of cool.
2568204	2573626	What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody, and...
2575507	2582775	Apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs and is all sorts of fun.
2583516	2588080	But for the full game, you'll have to play it and I think it comes out on the 12th.
2588321	2589362	How much does 890 megs actually weigh?
2589382	2589422	Ha!
2592805	2593145	Not much.
2593185	2594906	Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.
2595586	2597666	But they're not light if one falls on your head.
2597966	2606548	My first hard drive, my first computer, my first hard drive, my first computer, PC, you know, back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.
2606968	2608109	Okay, my first hard drive.
2608129	2608109	486.
2608169	2610169	It was a three.
2610229	2610809	No, I remember.
2610829	2610809	286.
2611489	2612449	I remember clearly a 386SX16.
2615589	2617813	Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.
2617853	2618554	Yes, exactly.
2618815	2619596	SX for sex.
2619636	2621139	That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.
2621179	2621740	Was it scuzzy?
2622681	2623162	But here's the thing.
2623382	2625746	It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.
2626840	2627761	Oh my god, Rob!
2650993	2656336	Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?
2656797	2670325	Seriously now, and that thing was a brick, because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later, and now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too, now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.
2671946	2672326	Amazing.
2672387	2673727	Memory is so damn cheap.
2674348	2677630	I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.
2679087	2680127	You're quite feisty today.
2680187	2681168	I think I'd rather like it.
2681468	2683649	Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.
2683749	2686130	You need to get loaded more often.
2686150	2686810	I'm not loaded!
2687131	2688471	I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.
2688731	2689131	Exactly.
2689151	2690852	But you need to loosen up a little bit.
2690932	2693773	I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.
2693933	2694754	That's cool, that's cool.
2695234	2704718	Alright, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again, since we're talking a little bit retro, I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.
2704778	2706559	It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.
2706959	2714823	They are saying the game will come out in November, and hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere, don't you think?
2715655	2716435	Yes.
2716535	2718476	Isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?
2718656	2719036	Yes, it is.
2719376	2721817	So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.
2721837	2728160	But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.
2728860	2729340	So there you go.
2729830	2735393	So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, though, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.
2735674	2736234	You never know.
2736274	2740617	If the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.
2740677	2741557	But they have submitted it.
2742037	2743378	It is very soon to go.
2743939	2744159	Yes.
2744519	2750823	And if you can't wait that long, well, this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.
2751443	2757527	It's a Street Fighter-themed level, and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft points.
2758407	2758547	And...
2759790	2760350	Looks pretty cool.
2760390	2761071	That's not bad, though.
2761091	2762912	200 Microsoft points is what?
2762932	2762912	250?
2763312	2765273	Now, Jamie, you would probably know this.
2765853	2768995	Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables.
2769704	2770324	There was one.
2770684	2773025	There was, oh God, and I've played one before.
2773045	2774045	It wasn't very good.
2774065	2775646	That's too bad.
2775926	2776946	I seem to recall that too.
2777466	2780067	I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.
2780227	2782208	If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body.
2782288	2785309	I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.
2785369	2786329	I'm going to find out actually.
2786369	2790090	I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.
2790290	2790470	Gatleib
2810542	2812723	and so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlieb game.
2813224	2814645	And that was a lot of fun, speaking of pinball.
2814665	2817666	The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.
2817686	2818827	I think that's the one I'm thinking of.
2818967	2820348	I think that's it.
2820388	2821268	I don't think it was like a Mario Bros.
2821288	2826571	I wonder if that was in, no, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlieb collection for Wii?
2827112	2831274	It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but...
2832282	2834823	The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlieb.
2835223	2836383	Gottlieb was in the UK.
2836483	2840744	It was a Street Fighter 2 pinball that was developed by Gottlieb in 1993.
2842824	2845405	I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it.
2847505	2853166	Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice... Pinball is pinball.
2853506	2860928	There are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.
2861760	2863841	I actually, we picked up a new pinball table, did I tell you?
2864221	2864721	No, what'd you get?
2864901	2867741	We have a Revenge from Mars.
2868542	2869142	No, take that back.
2869242	2869802	Oh, wow.
2869842	2870282	I take that back.
2870302	2870862	We have an Episode 1.
2871522	2873083	Wow, that's cool.
2873543	2874143	Yeah, we picked it up.
2874163	2875203	That's a hologram one.
2875243	2876063	Those are rad.
2876103	2877744	What do they call it, the Pin 2000 or whatever?
2877784	2878504	Pinball 2000, exactly.
2878744	2881385	We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.
2881765	2882085	Nice.
2882185	2883885	I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.
2884165	2887006	Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?
2888348	2888668	I don't know.
2888708	2889208	I don't know.
2914443	2916104	All right, well, moving on to other news.
2916564	2925646	You know, the new Exit Box Experience is coming out pretty soon, and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test, which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.
2925946	2929707	I didn't even sign up because it was like the day before my surgery or something.
2929948	2932148	Yeah, it was such a small window.
2932308	2937810	Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part.
2938870	2940051	Right about now, but that's alright.
2940451	2941952	I had to make do with regular Netflix.
2943113	2949436	But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new Xbox experience were cut.
2949756	2958081	And I'm not talking about things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.
2958101	2958721	I'm not talking about that.
2958741	2961883	I'm talking about they had this big list of things they wanted to accomplish...
2963058	2973804	and according to the head of Xbox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new Xbox experience.
2974065	2976726	But assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.
2977046	2980708	And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.
2980728	2983150	He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do.
2983550	2985932	Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.
2986372	2989674	One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.
2990434	2998916	The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard, and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.
2999176	3000836	These are the type of things we're going to start doing.
3001176	3002196	So a photo party.
3002896	3003616	Well, that's fine.
3003676	3014778	I mean, I can't say that there's... It's not like there's... Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?
3014818	3017859	Well, what other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?
3018999	3019379	I don't know.
3019919	3020259	I don't know.
3020299	3024720	Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.
3024740	3025040	That's lame.
3025060	3025820	That's what email's for.
3025840	3027441	What the hell is up with your LiveJournal icon?
3028421	3029521	What is up with my LiveJournal icon?
3029541	3030421	It looks like pasta.
3030941	3031801	I don't... Oh.
3032162	3033042	It's shrimp chow mein.

3323986	3329488	But that's pretty much it for the US.
3329748	3330548	Lots of good stuff.

3464827	3465167	What?

3475653	3477314	Star Wars, The Clone Wars, Jedi Alliance.
3478035	3479215	I said I was going to say alignment.

3490462	3495604	EverQuest 2, The Shadow Odyssey, Spore, Creepy and Cute Parts Pack Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself.
3495644	3496505	Those are actually the 18th.
3496825	3497185	I'm done!
3497345	3497685	That's alright.
3497705	3498046	Alright.
3498706	3504028	You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chatroom listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.
3504549	3512032	GS68 says SingStarLoki Redertainment says My Horse and Me 2 Adventures in Tiawata Now that would be a game worth playing.
3512752	3515874	That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.
3517168	3529650	SSJ100 Matt says no SingStar matters unless it's Abba SingStar you damn right Redertainment says my secret diary finally a place to go on and on about the things that people could honestly give a rat's ass about don't we have that?
3529690	3530511	isn't it called LiveJournal?
3532662	3543525	Actdeft says, is Top Model smarter than a 5th grader?
3543785	3548806	Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?
3549826	3552227	You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.
3552307	3553287	For what it is...
3554321	3561825	It's not bad, the game itself, but I think the thrill of are you smarter than a fifth grader could only really last so long.
3561925	3564387	It's kind of one of those ha-ha for about 15 minutes.
3564427	3568489	I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a fifth grade.
3569090	3570591	Ah, there you go.
3570671	3571311	I think, yeah.
3572650	3574611	They released the US version here on Xbox Live.
3575772	3580995	Or they could just forego releasing it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?
3581055	3585098	What I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck.
3586119	3590582	But the fact is, it is a game based off a TV show that
3591994	3595377	They should have just called it, Are You Smarter Than An American?
3595557	3603404	And it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone's like, Oh my god, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.
3604025	3604345	Alright.
3605146	3606126	What, as a collective?
3606307	3607568	As a collective.
3608448	3609690	Even, forget it.
3610110	3610750	Alright, um...
3611531	3612572	I don't know, but I'm thinking yes
3633466	3637749	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.
3637789	3640750	A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.
3641170	3642871	Major League Beast... Beastball?
3642931	3643432	Baseball!
3643692	3644853	Beastball!
3644873	3646413	Beastball!
3646553	3647274	I'd like to see that.
3647874	3649275	Major League Beastball!
3649375	3651796	No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.
3652077	3654158	Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.
3655824	3660748	Also, Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey racing, there you go.
3661589	3665272	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week, quite a bit of stuff.
3666493	3673839	New Ono Kids Wii, Jinsei Game Wii, FIFA Soccer 09 All Play, because you know EA likes to do the All Play thing.
3674239	3679504	Family Ski, World Ski and Snowboard, if I'm not mistaken, that's the Wii Mat game.
3679524	3679784	Wii Fit!
3683669	3684570	that uses that, right?
3685290	3688252	No, Family Athletics would be that one.
3688292	3690633	Family Ski was Wii Ski.
3690873	3691334	Oh, okay.
3692054	3694075	But it sounds like that's... Is that price reduction?
3695716	3698057	No, it's coming out from Namco, and it's not a price reduction.
3698618	3700339	That already came out over there, unless it's a sequel.
3700399	3701039	Maybe it's a sequel.
3701099	3702840	It could, because this has snowboarding in it, too.
3702880	3703180	Oh, I see.
3703201	3703581	There you go.
3704501	3710665	Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Nakibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of...
3711325	3711705	The Blob
3739095	3741236	and Grow Your Rice and Make Your Citizens Happy.
3744118	3754164	Also, coming out on the portable systems, if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out... Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.
3754524	3757566	On the Nintendo DS, some new casings and so on.
3757586	3760647	A game called Juggler, a Nobunaga game.
3760707	3761728	It's a price reduction there, too.
3762148	3762989	Rhythm to Cooking.
3764270	3771237	Ryusei no Rockman 3, Black Ace and Red Joker, Tyson, Kato-chan no Koronope, Zerokara Hajimiru, Otona no 5,
3783103	3784205	and Kokugo Numion.
3784966	3786268	But you know what?
3786468	3789953	All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.
3790774	3792897	I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week.
3792937	3795040	The Shadows of Almia on DS.
3795661	3796041	Oh, really?
3796382	3796602	Yes.
3796823	3798325	What makes this Pokemon game special?
3798645	3798926	Nothing.
3800267	3807393	On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction and FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.
3808234	3823948	Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot, but you do have a game called Sengoku, Efuda, Yugi, Hoto, Gisu, Ran, and Zero Pilot, Daisanji, Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.
3825149	3854365	also this one I'm sorry I missed this one this is a pretty big one I think over in Japan it's bolded on my list which usually means it's a pretty big deal it's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai and I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of I don't know it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something but it looks like it is a action game coming out over there there you go that's it for Japanese release dates
3855069	3855710	Alright, cool.
3856371	3857292	What about Zimbabwe?
3858454	3858894	What about it?
3859475	3860497	What about their release dates?
3860757	3864042	Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.
3864082	3865624	I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.
3865644	3871833	I know Australia, cry, cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us, but we only have so many hours.
3873194	3883477	Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet, well, there's something that might be able to help you out.
3883677	3887338	Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.
3888158	3891759	They have tools that will allow you to design your
3892779	3910967	your levels basically and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff so go to www.littlebigworkshop.com and check it out and you might be able to create the next big level hopefully not based off of licensed materials otherwise I'll get yanked offline
3911147	3916938	I just want to say I did visit that website and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.
3916958	3919984	You have to use your email address though instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.
3920324	3923570	But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually kind of...
3924127	3925567	have your own little page on there.
3925947	3928548	It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.
3928728	3932489	You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.
3932809	3943151	It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebooky update your current status thing, but I don't think it's really something I would practically use.
3943211	3948093	But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.
3949373	3950113	So, pretty cool.
3951536	3954277	So, and then the copyright levels, right?
3954377	3955918	Yes, but that's the thing.
3956838	3964221	There's been a lot of copyrighted levels or levels with copyrighted materials in them that are being yanked offline.
3964621	3969143	Included in that, of course, like levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.
3969683	3973065	There was even like a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.
3973765	3976186	One weird one, though, was there was a level called Phantasm.
3976426	3977786	Thank you for watching!
3998572	4000474	Good comment from GS68 in chat.
4000534	4001215	Blastworks.
4001355	4004498	Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?
4004518	4005639	I mean, not here on OLR.
4005679	4006980	Loki's been hyping this game up forever.
4007020	4008922	Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much.
4008962	4009743	Well, here's the interesting thing.
4009783	4014268	GS68 says, Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff and nobody gives a shit.
4015066	4016767	Yeah, it's so far under the radar.
4017147	4020850	Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.
4021210	4024933	But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.
4025193	4026954	Like, that Gradius level is still there.
4027514	4029296	It was there just before we went live tonight.
4029456	4039923	Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?
4039943	4040023	Yeah.
4040643	4042144	Yeah, but it's very interesting.
4042184	4053468	I mean, and I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show or at the Tail End of Bobby's show where we're usually on, but there's a Batman level out there too that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.
4053548	4061471	Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it, and that you even unlock that as a reward.
4062012	4064593	So there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.
4065593	4071676	Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off too, unpublished levels are actually being moderated.
4072716	4073156	Weird.
4073557	4074317	How's that possible?
4074637	4077839	I don't know, but it says, for example...
4080010	4087732	One user posted a strategy for keeping a copy of the level offline and republishing it in case it gets deleted.
4088572	4092292	Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated too.
4092753	4095393	I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.
4096273	4096713	Weird.
4097533	4102334	Maybe it's one of those things where once a crook, always a crook.
4102454	4104895	If you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow.
4105939	4107941	and see if you're infringing any other places?
4108081	4108882	I don't know.
4108902	4110643	That's weird.
4110663	4111824	That is weird.
4112004	4125036	This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M or whatever, he said, so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, lighthearted violence have been taken down, like the popular Gears of War Demon Skull level.
4125336	4126377	Yeah, but it's Gears of War.
4127017	4128418	It didn't get taken down because of the violence.
4129239	4136441	What's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it and act to try to please everybody?
4136521	4142643	The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.
4142783	4145764	There's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.
4146125	4150286	I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I played it in the real game.
4150806	4153927	You've got little things dancing on poles.
4154007	4155047	It's no mistaking what it is.
4157388	4162513	Redertainment in chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.
4163393	4165235	I think yes, you can.
4165255	4170019	I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues.
4170239	4172201	I don't think they can moderate your level.
4172921	4173682	That's stupid.
4174182	4175884	I don't think so.
4176564	4179347	As far as these people bitching and stuff, here's the complication.
4179387	4183370	This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end user license agreement.
4183690	4187632	And if you want to be extra safe, just make backups of your saves.
4187932	4189492	I mean, that's really the only thing you can do.
4190093	4193074	Thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.
4193134	4200736	In fact, the other thing is you can download saves online with the PS3 because none of those are linked to your user account.
4200817	4203918	You can just go on GameFAQs, for example, and download stuff.
4205138	4206758	Maybe you could swap levels that way.
4206858	4207359	I don't know.
4207599	4209499	I wish you could because that would be nice.
4210179	4212620	You'll be able to download levels that are awesome to play.
4213100	4220141	Really interesting comment from chat from Shaoran saying, but that's not as offensive as two men kissing.
4220701	4224342	Going back to that whole... What was that?
4224582	4227423	Whattheyplay.com poll we talked about months ago.
4227503	4230484	Remember that whole thing where two men kissing was one of the most offensive things?
4230884	4231844	But that had me thinking...
4232830	4245263	Boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels, see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.
4246624	4247505	Interesting, to say the least.
4249096	4250457	and make the level called What They Play.
4253079	4257942	I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation.
4258843	4264086	Because this has been a topic of controversy lately and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show.
4264447	4267809	But there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.
4268049	4273233	You go through three levels that all center around a wedding and a crazy bride going after her drunk...
4273673	4295178	Drunken Groom which by the way is my favorite level in the game so far is the Skulldozer level if you've played that it would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms I'd be very curious to see what happens anyhow now I'm getting ideas for my first level there you go Rob Roberts Big Gay Adventure
4300887	4301347	Oh, yeah.
4301707	4303888	Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.
4304829	4305570	We'll see what happens.
4306350	4309512	Nothing more inspiring than offending people.
4309652	4310473	It's not offensive.
4310973	4312614	What's offensive about gaiety?
4312774	4313134	Nothing.
4314235	4315416	Am I pushing the envelope?
4315656	4317377	No, to other people maybe.
4317857	4318177	Maybe.
4319158	4319838	Is it offensive?
4319918	4320379	It shouldn't be.
4321573	4321934	Anyhow.
4322414	4328483	Well, you know, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.
4328743	4330065	Yep, that's South America for you.
4331308	4332909	It's like, God, man, seriously.
4333189	4335870	I think I've got some ideas brewing.
4335890	4336550	We'll see what happens.
4336930	4340011	All right, let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.
4340351	4342672	You see, but the thing is, you have to be careful with it.
4342872	4348974	Because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff, there are people out there that would play it and think it's real.
4349794	4353315	So there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.
4353375	4356676	And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea, one, I'll cut you.
4357017	4357217	Two...
4359265	4366587	Be very careful because you can push the envelope, but just be careful because there's some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.
4366647	4369288	Now, Rob, how far have you gotten in LittleBigPlant?
4370628	4376790	Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the... I just beat the boss.
4376910	4379831	Well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.
4380171	4381131	Just past Mexico.
4381271	4384032	Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat.
4384392	4384572	No.
4385113	4386514	Oh, I want a flamethrower and cat.
4387195	4387695	All right, anyhow.
4388516	4397804	Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff, Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool.
4398144	4404370	So pretty soon, you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.
4404390	4405671	Making it even easier to...
4406151	4435389	even easier to infringe on copyrights galore but you could also put in pictures of yourself or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK which I saw on the three speech blog you can actually put pictures of your family in the game you can actually see this in one of the commercials but who do you believe because the developer also has come out this week and said even though it's on their blog a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums image importing is technically viable but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons
4437711	4443516	but here's the thing if people want to get their images in the game they're already doing it how?
4443756	4457087	by printing it out and holding it in front of the camera that's what Bobby did in his level and also in some other levels I've seen out there there's one level I played I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s
4458667	4459027	Actdeft.com
4480897	4485999	I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here, but very interesting to see what happens.
4486579	4491922	You know, I think, though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.
4492462	4500945	And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.
4500985	4504187	Like, it goes to, like, the bottom of the list so that people just don't find it.
4504887	4532182	but I don't know about this whole crazy going on your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the wrist I have a problem with them monitoring stuff that's on your system because that's your stuff if I want to make a Batman level I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends now I do have a problem I don't have a problem with them taking it offline because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else that's fine they should be able to do that
4532722	4541465	But at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.
4541645	4543305	I don't see any harm in that.
4544606	4546006	I'm sure they'll find a reason not to.
4546126	4548687	Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.
4551298	4554039	You guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it.
4554059	4557661	I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.
4557861	4561042	This game has the potential to get so big if it isn't already.
4562683	4565544	It's not like building these levels is that easy.
4566705	4569126	The creator can get pretty involved.
4569466	4577129	I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build a level.
4577169	4578410	It's as easy as it can get.
4579150	4579650	Thanks for watching!
4598834	4599034	Yeah.
4599234	4601455	Because he used the basic artwork.
4601495	4606796	I mean, he built this own little unique car thing and used the eye toy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.
4606816	4609456	Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.
4609596	4612817	I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.
4612857	4616298	Like, there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.
4616858	4617578	It's, like, nuts.
4617938	4618238	Interesting.
4618658	4619699	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
4619879	4621179	We've got so much more news to get to.
4621599	4627303	Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.
4627803	4634807	It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.
4635668	4639170	What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be Wii remotes.
4639710	4643893	The way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye, because the PlayStation Eye has four...
4644693	4645333	Thanks for watching!
4671069	4700577	which is kind of neat and that would be the way to do it integrated I guess now with the current technology that they have on the system hmm so maybe sometime soon maybe we'll see a new controller or something do you think this is something for Sony's next system or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one I think it's their current one because on the actual patent it says PS3 on it and it's showing the Wi-Fi and like the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that hmm
4701997	4731604	I mean it makes sense if they want to expand out because right now I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games I mean they do have like LittleBigPlanet but there's nothing that's really like get in and just you know play even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff they have a little bit more than Sony but I mean the Wii's got them beat big time with like casual more family friendly just play type of stuff you know like tennis or something is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now no okay
4733476	4733696	DarkSakura
4754187	4756910	Sonic, Ultimate Genesis Collection, 40 Titles,
4778555	4781937	40 titles that were on the Genesis for next-gen systems.
4781977	4786699	This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4787459	4804148	It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vector Man 2 and everything in between, including Golden Axe, all three of them, Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kid Chameleon, Echo 1, Echo 2, Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3...
4805268	4809851	Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, you know, pretty much all your... I think Spinball was in there too.
4810652	4811613	Was Sonic Spinball in there?
4811733	4812133	Yes, it was.
4813174	4817797	All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection pretty much, you know, that were first party.
4818377	4819998	They're going to be releasing in spring 2009.
4820679	4821900	But here's the interesting thing.
4823261	4825963	You know, you might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?
4826003	4828424	Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.
4828564	4830766	They've released it as a download.
4831026	4831466	Here's the thing.
4831827	4832707	It's going to output in 720p.
4835715	4839002	and that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go really?
4840725	4843972	720p for my Genesis yeah that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics
4845543	4847564	Just kind of an interesting little addition.
4848284	4850865	It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.
4851125	4851666	Does that make sense?
4852006	4862190	Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out a little bit and it's kind of blurry.
4862730	4869253	Or you can just do it where it scales everything up and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.
4869313	4869653	It's just...
4870453	4871834	and larger pixels, I guess.
4872335	4878059	Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.
4878359	4882463	Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?
4882643	4882823	Yes.
4883043	4884044	It's part of the mandate.
4884164	4890689	Now PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies, but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there, they might as well do the trophies.
4891110	4896914	So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.
4898410	4898770	8 dollars, 75 cents.
4924574	4926575	Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.
4927255	4929776	I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.
4930536	4930816	Hmm.
4931857	4932277	Interesting.
4933397	4936838	Frisbee in chat says, Who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?
4937518	4938419	He'd be surprised.
4939499	4940520	He would be surprised.
4940540	4941660	Alright, let's move on.
4943168	4946810	Remember they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.
4946970	4947430	True statement.
4948151	4949892	Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty nice too.
4949912	4952133	They had like 30-some games in there as well.
4952333	4953174	So, nice.
4954114	4959838	Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,
4960618	4961338	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4983888	4984709	Thank you for watching!
5003257	5004558	So now that would be pretty awesome.
5005959	5019106	The DSi is getting a WarioWare Photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game as well as several WarioWare minigames that will be available to download on the system's online store.
5020647	5026890	So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.
5026910	5028171	I don't know.
5029331	5029912	Interesting.
5031139	5033841	Well, but I do love me some WarioWare.
5033861	5037983	They're always pretty innovative with what they do with whatever new piece of thing.
5038304	5040565	I know, WarioWare myself sounds pretty awesome.
5040765	5042626	Yeah, that'd be very interesting.
5043227	5044807	Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?
5045888	5046709	A remake...
5047826	5051912	Press Your Luck Old School 80s Press Your Luck No Whammies I remember the guy who memorized the screens
5063948	5068093	Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him.
5068273	5069995	And sadly, I missed it, which kind of sucks.
5070075	5072197	But they have this whole thing.
5072638	5079225	And apparently, they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.
5079726	5081728	And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.
5082008	5083249	And it's not just for PC.
5083890	5085352	It's going to be coming for iPods,
5085812	5088274	iPhone, and apparently, consoles.
5088874	5103805	So the people that got the prices right, now unfortunately I haven't played the prices right game, so I don't know if it's any good or not, but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know, if it's a new game, it's going to have new whammy animations and all that fun stuff.
5104446	5106167	This is going to be an awesome party game.
5106187	5107047	It has to have the sound...
5109406	5110347	I know what you mean.
5139889	5140689	GameShows are awesome!
5160854	5163976	Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.
5164757	5169220	The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.
5169600	5174384	Apparently, they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.
5175184	5180068	And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.
5181008	5187073	And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the Digital Rights Management for Spore.
5188033	5188194	And...
5190253	5195254	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5216589	5224394	The trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or Securom whatsoever.
5224974	5235380	The second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri, saying that after installing the DRM-protected Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.
5235460	5239842	Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.
5240422	5244745	Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.
5245825	5258813	She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, impressive, and unscrupulous behavior.
5260054	5263536	So, in other words, EA got sued over Secure ROM.
5263736	5264516	Nobody's surprised.
5264657	5265997	But is it going to hold up?
5266277	5266678	What do you think?
5268519	5270380	I think, well, I don't have...
5272085	5286291	If they came out and disclosed that Sekiram was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, like it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.
5286311	5289932	Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this.
5289972	5292773	If you install this, this is what's going to happen.
5292833	5298736	But if they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.
5299795	5300935	Especially on these demos.
5301355	5302836	That's the real tricky part.
5302976	5305356	I mean, if you buy the game... Who cares?
5305416	5305857	It's a demo.
5305877	5306797	I don't understand, you know?
5307877	5310858	You know... I don't get it.
5311438	5311618	Yeah.
5311898	5312798	Well, we'll see what happens.
5313458	5323901	Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe... DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until Part B. I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.
5323921	5326482	Hollywood, it's time to press your luck!
5333418	5340481	There you go.
5341862	5344923	Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off.
5345324	5345644	What?
5345944	5347044	There's a spore level now?
5347365	5347945	That'd be funny.
5348185	5348765	They should do that.
5350406	5353908	Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.
5353928	5353908	... ...
5370741	5375884	Alright, I could go on and on.
5376244	5378605	Apparently tonight's... I love that sound.
5378765	5381487	Yeah, I do.
5381507	5382347	That's the best sound ever.
5382607	5383748	I'll have to get that for the show.
5384388	5385389	We can use that a little later on.
5386209	5392152	Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.
5392192	5395594	But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.
5397534	5402598	We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from Rob with two Bs.
5403239	5404740	I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.
5405461	5408544	This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.
5408644	5410365	I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.
5410686	5411847	To answer your question, yes it is.
5412367	5416230	In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.
5416611	5416991	And it's a...
5418432	5423337	It's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.
5423718	5428262	Now, obviously, we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show, but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email.
5428782	5429603	That's pretty awesome.
5430364	5431265	The quote here at the end.
5431645	5438672	This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.
5440033	5440414	Interesting.
5442669	5446234	An email from... well, it's not signed.
5446274	5451381	It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.
5451442	5452102	We'll leave it at that.
5452884	5455407	Sent us something like this, but I thought this was an interesting story.
5456148	5459272	Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.
5459833	5488509	and this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October so it looks like the same day as our last show but apparently it was like this giant like cosplay record type thing 342 people posed Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on part of the London Games Festival and the funny thing is they were out there to top the record of 337 set the week before in Germany who knew that World War 3 would be fought with cosplay who knew
5490339	5490880	But there you go.
5490900	5494304	A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.
5495025	5497368	Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?
5497884	5499344	Yeah, well, not the one that he sent.
5499384	5500845	I just happened to find one on YouTube.
5500965	5502885	And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.
5502905	5504086	That's fantastic.
5506346	5507367	I don't know if we learned this.
5507887	5511568	Can you actually save levels from online to your planet and stuff?
5511828	5517409	I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of his show, he was telling us that there's an option you can do that.
5517429	5517970	God, I hope so.
5518590	5519330	I need to go save that one.
5519750	5521711	All right, anyhow, we got another email here.
5521791	5522351	One last email.
5522391	5525332	It's a little bit lengthy, but that's all right since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.
5525352	5526272	And it's from Spazinator.
5527666	5528207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5546364	5548245	I particularly like the Justin.TV feed.
5548345	5553727	Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the All Games Radio feed on Shoutcast on my PSP.
5554007	5556508	Well, now our All Games friends wouldn't like that very much.
5556788	5557428	You should do both.
5557608	5558408	Ideally, you do both.
5558708	5562190	You turn on the Justin.TV and mute it and then listen on the All Games feed.
5562670	5565311	Because the Justin.TV unfortunately has shitty audio.
5565811	5568312	One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.
5569899	5572161	Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a PlayStation 3.
5572481	5573381	Welcome to the dark side.
5574262	5577584	Just out of sheer stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?
5577944	5583848	I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.
5584488	5585169	And you're right.
5585809	5587870	It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.
5588531	5590052	I bought the 80GB, the new one.
5590672	5595495	And it doesn't play PlayStation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a PlayStation 2.
5596356	5597796	And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.
5598357	5598517	Whoa.
5599622	5602703	Hello, hey, no, we're not ready for one gun music yet.
5602963	5603883	That's our break music tonight.
5604563	5609664	Anyway, speaking of PlayStation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.
5610105	5617686	Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this, and it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.
5618487	5623128	I'm speculating that PlayStation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.
5624028	5624268	Out by then.
5642509	5646114	Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.
5646474	5649659	I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.
5650139	5651221	I may be proven wrong on this.
5651261	5654145	I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.
5654205	5654585	Ha ha ha.
5655728	5660311	Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like, you can send me your friend request on PlayStation Network.
5660731	5664613	As my Xbox Live Gamer Tag suggests, my PlayStation Network handle is Spazinator.
5664993	5666694	You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.
5666734	5670256	Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.
5670396	5672378	Well, that won't get pulled or anything.
5672958	5674699	There you go, an email from Spazinator.
5675900	5677420	The grottiest level is well done.
5677821	5679982	It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?
5681751	5686035	I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.
5687716	5688016	Who knows?
5688036	5690418	It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.
5690438	5691299	But then again, it is Sunday.
5692800	5693420	But not in Europe.
5693480	5693761	Shit.
5694601	5695422	It's going to be Monday morning.
5695442	5696803	I just found LittleBigMacross.
5697604	5701447	Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.
5701627	5703208	I think it might actually be Sony.
5703969	5704409	Interesting.
5704509	5704829	You're right.
5704889	5705570	I am assuming that.
5706250	5706551	I don't know.
5708032	5708712	All right.
5709032	5709333	Well...
5710529	5711930	We have a little more news to get to.
5712450	5717013	If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
5717673	5728760	As far as that previous email and the whole release date, I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.
5729140	5731001	So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.
5731141	5735363	That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.
5735403	5738125	If they can one-up Microsoft by making their thing better...
5738925	5749271	They'll wait, but they'll have it out by Christmas, which doesn't leave a lot of time because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before the Thanksgiving rush, but I don't work for Sony.
5749572	5750672	I don't know what they think sometimes.
5751593	5751893	We'll see.
5754505	5754945	That's awesome.
5754965	5755846	I was watching a video.
5755866	5757287	They have Sack to the Future.
5757707	5759048	I'm sure that level got pulled off.
5759488	5760649	Oh, this is sweet.
5761269	5761629	Anyways.
5761849	5762470	I'm telling you, Jamie.
5763030	5763971	Best game I've played in years.
5763991	5765351	I'm looking at the Macross level.
5765652	5766612	It's an amazing game.
5767152	5767353	Amazing.
5767393	5767593	Okay.
5767993	5777098	So anyways, something that's been actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.
5777599	5778579	You know, installs.
5779200	5780801	Well, now they have an...
5781841	5785203	No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.
5786564	5800171	Final Fantasy Dissida, or Dissida or whatever, on the PSP, it now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.
5801011	5803833	That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.
5803853	5806054	Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.
5807471	5808071	Well, that too.
5808952	5809272	I don't know.
5810052	5814214	It says they have different install options.
5814494	5820596	You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.
5824957	5825818	Very interesting.
5826338	5827438	Indeed, very interesting.
5827638	5830759	Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.
5831460	5832320	That's my option.
5833399	5836521	Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.
5838762	5840143	Red Entertainment asked a good question in chat.
5840203	5842104	Does this further facilitate piracy?
5842385	5842965	I don't think so.
5842985	5845426	It's so rampant anyways.
5845687	5847688	And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.
5847948	5852030	And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.
5852111	5853091	True.
5853651	5854092	Very true.
5855192	5859775	Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though.
5859795	5862017	There's plenty more to come in Part B. Um...
5862921	5869425	We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.
5870026	5871427	Not episode, at the start of the next segment.
5871847	5876150	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5883112	5887474	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.
5887494	5889775	We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.
5890996	5895979	And DarkSakura joined us in the middle of part A. And we want to talk about something.
5897239	5902542	I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was...
5902682	5903583	Orange Lounge Radio
5924921	5936067	and also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically, you know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.
5937988	5950614	So obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8, which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.
5950714	5952955	No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican or
5953688	5982287	just the fact that we've elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding and I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech and it's really great things are going to happen here in America I think on that front but it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on
5983007	5988048	and then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.
5989528	5999131	And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, Proposition 8 took away the right here in California of same-sex couples to marry.
5999591	6009613	And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California, you took something away.
6010293	6011274	by passing Proposition 8.
6035342	6036343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6058183	6068131	I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook, from a friend, who was apologizing because it was their fault.
6069032	6069372	I don't know.
6069713	6071574	I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.
6072875	6078420	It's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is...
6079554	6080935	What are you so afraid of?
6082015	6084237	What is the big deal?
6085277	6090681	If people you don't even know aren't required to associate with, get married.
6091661	6095784	And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage.
6095884	6096844	That is not true.
6097144	6099506	I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.
6100767	6106190	In a civil union, if my partner... In a civil union, if I pass away...
6107378	6113623	My partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.
6114503	6129834	If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from, and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families, that could be a real issue in a lot of families.
6130815	6131535	So there's one.
6131715	6132156	One's enough.
6132396	6133296	There's a difference.
6133617	6135178	There's more than just the one, but one's enough.
6136718	6139160	So, it's not the same thing as civil unions.
6139280	6140261	You're not protected.
6140841	6141501	All this BS.
6141822	6145484	And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?
6145844	6148686	By using children and this whole schools thing.
6149147	6152389	If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.
6154090	6158353	Logic tells you they were lying.
6158453	6159254	Here's the logic.
6159875	6162197	Gay marriage was already legal.
6162717	6166220	So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.
6166560	6167701	And here's my other question.
6169654	6171854	So what if they teach it in schools?
6172395	6172935	So what?
6174435	6182056	I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird, but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship, do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?
6182756	6183676	Trust me, folks.
6184157	6185337	These kids are going to hear it.
6185897	6188657	I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.
6189197	6198199	That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time in very difficult parts of my life were right.
6200524	6202926	and do you think it's something I chose?
6203566	6208109	I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.
6208489	6212312	I assure you I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.
6212912	6214133	It was not a choice.
6214773	6216435	This is the way I was born.
6216475	6221898	This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.
6223940	6227542	So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?
6229793	6231099	Dark Sakura, where were you today?
6232037	6239400	I was at the repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps, and it was amazing.
6240121	6241001	What kind of things were going on?
6241982	6243302	There were just a lot of speakers.
6243342	6248144	I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody until I got closer.
6248765	6255748	One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.
6255768	6256548	They were all very good.
6256568	6257869	There were a couple of speakers there.
6258689	6260110	One of them was a school commissioner.
6261951	6270298	And she was there with her family, and they managed to get in right before they weren't doing any more weddings.
6270378	6272200	So she was there with her family.
6273962	6283890	And talking about how a big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.
6285252	6291316	If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it in schools, I don't know.
6291456	6292037	I believe him.
6292717	6294398	Well, another one.
6294418	6300763	I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.
6302905	6305667	But she was just saying that...
6308076	6314980	She gave this really great speech just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives.
6315860	6318782	And that was pretty crazy to hear about.
6319763	6323645	There was just a lot of really good energy there today.
6325566	6327147	Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.
6327727	6332610	And I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting.
6333110	6336512	This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.
6337272	6359509	Um, about, uh, we're saying that it was the simple, that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority when it, and this has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California and I don't see anyone really have authoring anything about it, that any amendment to our constitution, it basically only takes a simple majority when our budget takes a two thirds majority.
6360670	6363052	I mean, if civil, okay.
6363072	6363753	And how, okay.
6364013	6365534	You know, prop two passed, right?
6365848	6366629	Yeah, the chicken thing.
6367129	6370792	If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?
6371693	6374615	I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.
6374955	6376857	Prop 2 is a waste of money.
6376977	6378799	It's a funny contradiction.
6378979	6379559	You know what I mean?
6380520	6382782	Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.
6383222	6385724	I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it.
6385864	6387446	I've put in six and a half years on this show.
6387486	6388927	I can take ten minutes to get political.
6389627	6389707	If...
6394200	6401582	I'm so angry, mostly, at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country, on one hand.
6402162	6406723	And then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.
6408483	6410663	You think some people would know better.
6411203	6412144	It's just disgusting.
6413504	6419365	And, you know, you can say this whole, well, can't, you know, the majority talk is just the way it's going to be, da-da-da.
6419445	6419485	No.
6419665	6419765	No.
6420751	6438349	because you know what the majority isn't always right and that's what's what's happened in the past what we've seen happen in the past is that you know when that's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong
6440083	6453807	But what this has really done for this community, and I'm not talking just the gay community, I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community, is it's really mobilized it.
6454288	6460870	And I think in a way, especially kind of on the tail end of what you see kind of happening with the whole Obama, yes we can, rah, rah, rah.
6461630	6463632	I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.
6463752	6470639	But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say, I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.
6471119	6472280	I just hope they're on the right side.
6475343	6478126	History says they will be, but I don't know.
6478226	6479907	Maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.
6480308	6481309	But what can we do?
6481709	6482830	What do I bring it up?
6482990	6486093	Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?
6486934	6489116	Well, folks, you've been on Xbox Live.
6489176	6490597	You've been on these things.
6490857	6493339	You've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.
6493739	6497522	This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up.
6497662	6503987	On World of Warcraft, I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar.
6504147	6508490	Why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.
6508570	6511092	I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar.
6511772	6515195	He signed on to his horde character and said, what's your problem, fag?
6517614	6520715	So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games because you know what?
6520755	6530876	When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian, I don't give a shit who you are.
6531697	6532277	Stop it.
6532997	6534897	There is nothing to be afraid of.
6534917	6541798	And when you say that stuff, you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it.
6541918	6542698	It's different.
6544039	6545519	Because this is where this all stems from.
6547230	6550592	You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.
6552613	6553633	So just knock it off.
6558416	6559477	And I guess that's all I have to say.
6560177	6561418	Well, it's ridiculous anyway.
6562898	6563179	All right.
6563539	6571843	But when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape and go to a happier place where I rule things like in populace.
6571983	6572183	Yeah.
6572864	6573964	One more politically.
6573984	6574745	Sure, sure, sure.
6575526	6577248	Fuck you majority voters of Arkansas.
6579151	6582335	That's a whole nother issue that, oh my god.
6583376	6584738	I could spend another episode on that.
6585058	6587561	That earned its own FU too.
6587681	6588122	Say what?
6589604	6591747	You know what happened in Arkansas?
6591827	6593168	Only married couples can adopt.
6594031	6596874	and because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.
6597195	6601399	But what about, I don't know, what about... How many more children does that put into the system?
6601679	6603101	They can't even foster children.
6603281	6604262	It's not just adoption.
6604282	6610089	What if grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died and grandma's husband died?
6610669	6611891	It makes no sense.
6612011	6613072	It's so flawed.
6613773	6615775	This all spurns from people's...
6617148	6622232	It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.
6622433	6626076	And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.
6628358	6628798	One would hope.
6628818	6631801	But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.
6632922	6635004	So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.
6635844	6642010	But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.
6644889	6645892	because that's what you did this week.
6646514	6647216	Back to video games.
6648920	6653112	Alright, Activision has taken away some...
6654372	6658433	Songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour servers.
6659013	6662254	The GH Tunes service that they have available.
6663495	6666456	Basically, of course, it's not a big surprise.
6666536	6669236	It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted.
6669837	6674098	Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.
6674958	6681160	So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like
6682478	6687080	I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use too.
6687100	6690642	So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of...
6709159	6717582	A lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess, to emulate it or what have you, only to end up having it deleted.
6718302	6720103	So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?
6720663	6722164	Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.
6722404	6729266	And one of the things, though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.
6729746	6735188	So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again unless someone else throws it up there.
6735668	6737409	But maybe, I don't know, you should...
6738089	6741693	Throw it up there and not name it like Zelda theme or something like that.
6741893	6743154	Not a good idea.
6744375	6745997	So, I don't know.
6747639	6753785	Pretty soon, if it expands like they say there, it'll be really hard to monitor it.
6755090	6764993	Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last 10 minutes of the show in chat room right now, so sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.
6765053	6770414	But has there been any really good original works to kind of come out of this too?
6771615	6778096	All I hear about are, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels too, but I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.
6778416	6778877	You know what I mean?
6778957	6781237	I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.
6781657	6783658	I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...
6784698	6785359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6806707	6813633	I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.
6814934	6820098	And Bobby's in chat right now and says most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid music creator mode like me.
6821278	6822600	Rock Band Rock Band Rock Band
6840798	6861335	and there is a download pack coming out very soon it's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album and you know the song Everlong is from that album it's already in the game and it's a lot of fun to play even if it's a bitch but there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this Monkey Wrench I believe was one of the singles there My Hero of course is another big song from that album so the Color and the Shape album
6861795	6864937	Definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters is the next release.
6865177	6871120	Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free rock band songs have started to hit as well.
6872000	6873621	Yes, I downloaded those finally.
6873641	6875382	I haven't played any of them, but I downloaded them.
6875962	6878223	I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.
6878243	6879824	You know what's awesome?
6879884	6882085	My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2.
6882425	6883406	Our band now is in the top 500.
6885310	6885770	Interesting.
6885810	6886270	Wow.
6886810	6888451	That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.
6888771	6889791	Dang, he must be really good.
6890331	6890871	He is really good.
6891011	6891492	That's cool.
6891852	6892212	Good for him.
6893632	6894492	I distracted him, though.
6894532	6897153	I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.
6897273	6901754	I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason, and it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.
6901854	6905415	I still haven't gotten my Suzy and the Banshees songs, and I really need to do that.
6905635	6907616	I have a new drum set I bought.
6907796	6911997	I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.
6912717	6932023	and I'm not playing it until I get my rock band cymbals for it which supposedly are coming in tomorrow cross our fingers so hopefully once I get the cymbals then I'll start playing my new drum set but until then I'm not touching it alright we'll see what happens but there's other rock band news yes?
6932827	6933228	There is.
6933348	6938795	Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.
6939516	6944583	First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points, but...
6949481	6953402	I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.
6954223	6955403	But here's what's going up.
6956203	6962866	It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.
6963166	6963766	That's a cool song.
6964626	6973749	Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts, Angels and Airwaves, Just What I Needed, The Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes, Finally!
6975130	6977431	Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.
6977451	6978011	No, that's...
6979465	6990012	Monkey Gone to Heaven by the Pixies Rio Duran Duran Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue Simple Man, Leonard Skinner, Snow, Heyo by Red Hot Chili Peppers The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails The Saint of Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy which I like that song too
7007123	7013008	Time is Running Out, Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me, Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Comin', Judas Priest, and Zero, Smashing Pumpkins.
7013248	7013969	Not a bad track list.
7014249	7014810	Not at all.
7015731	7023437	What's kind of neat about that, though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.
7023517	7025839	Like, the Pixies track was from the album release.
7026219	7028942	The Heyo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.
7029262	7029943	It's kind of interesting.
7030703	7033746	It's not just single track releases they picked from.
7033786	7034606	It's really a...
7035407	7056398	Smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band which I think is interesting yeah and what's also cool about that too is once again with this you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1 or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want oh that's kind of neat how would that work on the Wii though?
7057702	7058162	on the Wii.
7058803	7061125	I'm not sure how they're going to... I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.
7062005	7069111	It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on, because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.
7069791	7071213	So, I don't know.
7071433	7072253	Soon, I guess.
7072934	7078498	This is just like printing money, though, for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game, though.
7078839	7083662	You're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
7083842	7086985	This thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.
7087485	7115110	but it's just you know and if you think about it if you're like looking for a really cheap guitar game like you just want something to play I mean you literally can go out there and buy used I saw used rock band guitars for like 12 bucks and then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks there you go you know for less than 50 bucks you can have like a guitar hero type of thing that's a nice way of getting around it I like the way you think
7116398	7119000	I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7119060	7119200	Still.
7140157	7142839	Hey, you know that Top 500 Bands?
7142919	7145021	Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7145342	7152529	You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar and game bundle, but now I'm not so sure.
7152609	7156132	Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.
7156473	7157514	I might just go back and pick that up.
7157734	7158555	Guitar Freaks Drum Mania
7176371	7178993	And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing!
7179273	7180954	With four exclamation points.
7180994	7182055	That's so awesome.
7182735	7186197	And it seems to be fire themed, so that's kind of cool.
7187158	7197985	And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you can believe it or not, 570 plus songs.
7202150	7203531	I guess in all.
7204531	7206313	That's freaking crazy.
7207994	7209655	Over 570 songs.
7210275	7212476	It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.
7212776	7213357	It must be.
7213457	7214638	My god, that's huge.
7214658	7217219	How would you scroll through that damn list?
7218040	7218440	I don't know.
7218840	7221302	Location testing soon, I guess.
7222022	7230147	And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drum Mania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.
7232094	7232854	It's nuts.
7233134	7233554	That is a lot.
7233855	7234495	And you know what?
7235055	7242217	I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.
7242897	7256321	Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which by the way, I just wanted to say quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it, but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.
7256621	7260382	I just, to go back to what I said, I blame
7261681	7268028	and society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.
7268649	7278420	But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.
7279560	7283902	So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat.
7283922	7285062	That's just kind of what I wanted to say.
7286023	7290985	But, I want to say regarding games, SSJ100Matt says, the Microsoft Employee Store has Gears of War 2 for $25.
7292386	7294687	Which, but employee stores always have games dirt cheap.
7294727	7294987	In fact...
7296574	7298395	I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.
7298955	7302376	I still have a copy of Boom Blox I barely touched.
7302536	7303996	This is a little different than the employee store.
7304016	7308978	This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.
7309338	7311999	You can get games for the $3.60 on the first party except for $9.
7312839	7315880	It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.
7316700	7318961	But they're revamping it.
7318981	7321422	They're redoing it because I don't know.
7321442	7322282	I guess it needs it.
7323166	7326609	and SonicM88 says the Explorer is still the best, Rob.
7326989	7330412	And Actdeft says Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.
7330712	7336437	So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking, which sucks.
7337818	7338919	Controller surgery!
7339360	7342763	No, seriously, $8 will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7342783	7343123	Really?
7343203	7345405	Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.
7346245	7350389	Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.
7350840	7351901	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
7352342	7358388	Oh, I forgot to, you know, this is like totally skipped this, but I forgot to mention that... We're all over the place today.
7358508	7359008	Yeah, that's cool.
7359349	7361370	In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.
7361871	7362171	Really?
7362612	7366996	I played Supernova at that one game store I was telling you about.
7367116	7368277	Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out.
7368537	7370698	I can't exercise still for another week and a half.
7370738	7374481	It's another reason I didn't go out today, just because of the timing of what was going on today.
7374521	7379965	I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.
7380225	7383927	So I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.
7384188	7387670	It was fun, but I'm totally out of shape.
7387910	7388891	Supernova is fun.
7417569	7418830	Jonathan Lee Riches
7440902	7444543	That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.
7445223	7447004	And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?
7447444	7457307	Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft and fought cyber monster gangs.
7459327	7463708	And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.
7464429	7469390	So in other words, here's somebody saying, it's Blizzard's fault...
7470560	7472882	That I can't separate game from reality.
7473663	7473983	No.
7475765	7478268	That's called, um, he's stupid.
7479449	7483193	There's no such thing as video game addiction.
7484113	7489098	There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.
7489459	7491200	There are OCD people out there.
7492001	7493643	This guy is just stupid.
7495051	7499693	Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know, dumbs down the whole thing.
7500053	7506316	But it's crazy to think that there are people out there that rationalize this like his lawyer.
7506776	7510898	Or better yet, why are we letting, yeah, exactly, why are we letting inmates sue?
7510958	7514940	Why are we letting these inmates, like, sue everybody?
7514960	7515760	That's just retarded.
7517121	7518622	What else are you going to do when you're in prison?
7518922	7521503	I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.
7523027	7525408	So that, you know, we don't have the shit.
7527048	7528049	You only get three.
7528689	7531370	GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.
7531930	7532250	Oh, sure.
7532270	7533391	Tyra will solve everything.
7534371	7535812	We should give him a stern talking to.
7536152	7537452	We should let Oprah deal with him.
7537492	7540853	And I want to point out, it's a handwritten... Oh my god!
7540874	7543334	I'm actually looking at the text.
7543354	7547616	This is a handwritten testimony there.
7550734	7556888	Redertainment asks can I sue Fanta for being awesome?
7557790	7559254	Seriously, that's retarded.
7561442	7564024	And the fact that it's handwritten, that's also retarded.
7564124	7565905	I mean, dude, get a typewriter.
7566386	7566606	At least.
7566626	7568347	We don't let you have typewriters in prison.
7568467	7572210	This caused Rich's to commit fraud to buy Defendants video games.
7572310	7575252	Rich's chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.
7575672	7578174	Rich's mind became a living video game.
7578294	7580796	I hold Defendants liable and support plaintiffs.
7581476	7583578	Why is he referring to himself in the third person?
7584258	7585899	I think it's like a lawyer or something.
7585979	7586260	I don't know.
7586280	7586740	But anyway.
7586840	7588621	Why did the lawyer then handwrite all that?
7588721	7589362	You know what?
7590879	7594023	Obviously, they gave Jack Thompson a license, so, you know.
7594563	7600630	Yeah, but eventually people got, you know, their brains straightened, you know, took away his license.
7601130	7608839	Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300 some odd episodes, you know what segment's coming next.
7623902	7625883	I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.
7625963	7628123	It's a comment from Marissa in chat.
7628183	7629884	The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here for forever.
7630704	7631584	Who needs to come back, by the way.
7632245	7634245	You learn something new every day on Orange Launch Radio.
7634525	7635906	Marissa says, I work in law.
7635946	7637266	I've seen handwritten pleadings.
7637306	7638086	They're so funny.
7638246	7639887	Apparently this is not uncommon.
7640847	7641087	Anyhow.
7641587	7641767	Sorry.
7641908	7642548	FU's of the week time.
7643488	7646329	FU to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.
7647689	7648329	And Prop 2.
7650750	7652711	Because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.
7653945	7655786	Okay, I understand we love the animals!
7656947	7671638	But for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop... And, sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens, and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8, it's just stupid.
7671978	7678943	Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass!
7680994	7683736	That's why you've got your nose turned up, because all you can smell is your own shit.
7684076	7685598	And it don't smell good.
7687379	7691362	I voted yes on prop 2 because I thought chickens that got the stand-up would taste better.
7693643	7697026	Which actually is partially true, in a way.
7697386	7697947	It really is.
7698947	7701469	Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.
7701609	7703311	This is what people are ignoring with this.
7703391	7704752	First of all, chickens are stupid.
7706173	7707614	But let me finish by what I'm saying.
7708134	7708775	Second of all...
7709495	7721086	For however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into getting up to these new standards, it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.
7721887	7727653	And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is, for people losing their homes left and right,
7728053	7731757	Who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?
7732097	7746431	There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple financial impact this is going to have on everybody just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.
7746691	7749674	Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.
7751525	7752346	It's just stupid.
7752526	7753606	Get those Nevada chickens.
7753727	7758930	It's a frivolous waste of money because people... Ugh.
7759230	7760031	I blame liberals.
7762332	7764434	Alright, let's move on.
7765294	7779744	I also want to say a few of the people that voted yes on 8, but not necessarily... They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything and they were showing... They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on 8 party or whatever.
7780365	7780465	And...
7780965	7783646	It just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.
7784027	7785587	I'd like to actually add another F you then.
7786588	7789689	To the Mormon Church, F you, I'm boycotting all your businesses.
7789709	7795352	I don't know, it just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's alright, you know, so.
7796477	7797058	F you to that, I guess.
7797258	7805285	And F you to the fact that there was another proposition that was passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing.
7805746	7815595	When, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people... It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like...
7816889	7821513	I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.
7821553	7824235	Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same FU.
7824315	7828118	I'm just going to say FU to intolerance.
7828238	7829719	And I was really surprised to learn this week
7846081	7853144	and all walks of life in all places in my life where there is still intolerance and we have a lot of work to do.
7855224	7855624	That's it.
7857005	7857385	Alright.
7857905	7858426	Moving on.
7858546	7859226	Gaming news.
7859526	7860306	Gaming deals.
7861247	7862247	Games that are steel.
7863547	7867749	Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?
7868766	7869126	What do you mean?
7869286	7869906	Tabula Rasa.
7870347	7872227	But I'm bum.
7872827	7873428	Yeah.
7873928	7875768	Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.
7877149	7877509	Really?
7877689	7877909	Yes.
7878209	7880190	Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents.
7880390	7881090	Yes, I checked.
7881671	7886012	Or if you want to translate that into... Is that with free shipping?
7886472	7886672	No.
7887373	7887633	Damn.
7888193	7890934	It would translate to 61 pence, by the way.
7892387	7894748	So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.
7894929	7916118	Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people, but they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of Hammer Space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!
7916818	7920180	You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.
7921340	7925182	But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.
7925542	7927463	If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.
7928103	7931544	You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.
7931764	7933305	I'm actually half-tempted.
7933365	7935366	Tabula Rasa was not terrible.
7935546	7938687	I'm thinking about it, too.
7938727	7941248	It's a month of play for five bucks.
7942388	7942869	Why not?
7943229	7944169	It might be worth a look.
7944989	7945950	I'm kind of curious.
7946010	7947691	I honestly do think this is the tactic.
7948331	7948571	I mean...
7949894	7952456	is a very interesting way to get people on board because that's what they'll make their money.
7952476	7956218	They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game because the retailer gets screwed there.
7956238	7960960	They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something, which I won't do.
7961000	7962081	If the game sucks, it sucks.
7962901	7965043	I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.
7965083	7966243	I'm just thinking about buying it.
7966683	7967424	Just to have.
7967664	7969045	Yeah, to go in the collection.
7969085	7970285	It is a Lord British game.
7970546	7972366	Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?
7972407	7973947	Commander British or whatever his name is.
7974067	7974328	Yeah.
7975860	7976481	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7993050	7993510	You know what?
7993690	7993791	What?
7993811	7994851	There's two words to say.
7994951	7995151	What?
7995572	7996032	Hell no!
7997333	7999013	That's kind of sadly what I had to say.
7999033	8001215	I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.
8001975	8002195	Rob.
8002415	8002956	Bye, life.
8003016	8003216	Rob.
8003416	8003596	What?
8003756	8003976	Rob.
8004116	8005357	What?
8005557	8005657	What?
8005677	8007598	You want to come out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?
8008859	8009119	When?
8009859	8010320	Thursday?
8010660	8011160	No, I'm not going to.
8011200	8012401	I probably won't go by it at midnight.
8012641	8015843	Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?
8017390	8019953	I... Everybody's EPing is going to make them go on there first.
8020274	8021195	I like Ragnarok.
8021815	8022276	It's free.
8022456	8023057	You go, girl.
8023237	8023557	All right.
8024218	8024839	Let's move on.
8024919	8025360	You go.
8025600	8028844	You keep going.
8029344	8029745	Anyways.
8031787	8037294	So there... You know, the DSi just was released and it's apparently, you know...
8039252	8046154	Allowed now the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew slash hacking carts.
8046934	8048094	It's prevented them from working.
8049815	8054556	Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSi has already been hacked.
8054696	8067579	And they've already got... Yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess, developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World...
8068779	8082283	And apparently it was done also with something that has been exploited on... I'd like to, for once, on this Hello World program, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is to simply print Hello World on the screen.
8082824	8087025	In Commodore Basic, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.
8088264	8088925	20, GoTo10.
8090706	8093148	If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.
8093729	8094790	Hello Piracy!
8095190	8110062	But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing, which for people that know, the PSP was done the same way and seems to be something that's pretty typical.
8111103	8111824	Surprise!
8112764	8116808	Where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.
8118905	8122667	And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.
8122687	8125689	Especially now with SD card support, man.
8126090	8127871	That's going to make things even easier, because you know what that means?
8128651	8131753	We kind of knew this was going to happen when they announced that SD card slot was going to be on there, right?
8131773	8132414	Can you imagine that, though?
8132474	8138057	With SD card support, all you're really going to need to do is load a program, and then you're going to be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.
8138097	8139198	You won't even need a cart.
8139578	8141079	It'll be even easier to hack open.
8141219	8141660	Woo-hoo.
8143761	8144181	Alrighty.
8144882	8145102	Well...
8146877	8148178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8169389	8174675	Yaris is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.
8174835	8177618	By the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.
8181073	8191041	What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?
8191722	8195665	Or this game did come out about one year ago exactly.
8196426	8201289	Is it some type of contractual thing going on where it was a Toyota promotion?
8202350	8204292	It was basically a game advertisement.
8204692	8205673	Did the ad run out?
8206313	8206794	It probably did.
8209111	8213058	And Bobby Blackwolf swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.
8215582	8216925	And I wouldn't be surprised at all.
8218888	8223871	But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's coming for you.
8225072	8227554	No, it was a big advertisement game.
8227574	8229455	That's why it probably sucked in the first place.
8230536	8232417	Who puts that much effort into an ad game?
8232977	8234438	I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.
8234658	8236540	Star Hero was cool.
8236640	8237560	Yeah, Star Hero was kind of cool.
8237760	8238921	But I hope I don't lose those achievements.
8239141	8239642	Probably not.
8240082	8240402	That's good.
8240902	8243204	It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.
8243953	8245213	Well, how about something cool?
8245473	8246274	Alright, how about it?
8246794	8250615	Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.
8251995	8252595	Dead Rising 2?
8253336	8253796	Oh, hey!
8254216	8254496	Cool.
8255036	8255276	Yep.
8256256	8265699	They're supposed to be... Well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.
8265859	8267060	Insider info.
8267520	8267740	Yep.
8268380	8271601	No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything.
8271641	8271961	But hey!
8273856	8278400	To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?
8278880	8279341	I mean, no.
8279361	8280102	Zombies!
8280682	8281163	Exactly.
8281243	8281803	And malls.
8283004	8285006	What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?
8286588	8287108	I guess that's true.
8287148	8287909	It might not be a mall.
8288549	8289570	Oh, how about an airport?
8290691	8292513	Where do you think the zombie outbreak's going to happen next?
8292553	8293494	An office building.
8294595	8294875	Hmm.
8295836	8296657	During the lunch hour.
8297529	8298690	and Brains.
8300091	8300851	It's what's for lunch.
8302092	8305054	Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.
8305174	8306294	Rob, you need to play the song.
8307115	8307335	What?
8307515	8308916	This is a Jonathan Colton song.
8309276	8309756	Ah, later.
8309856	8310637	I don't have it right now.
8312178	8315039	But Dead Rising 2 is... Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.
8315840	8317961	What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?
8318041	8319202	Fix the saving.
8320102	8321263	Fix the saving.
8321743	8322784	Fix the saving.
8323665	8324185	There you go.
8326112	8327294	and Rocket Launchers.
8327976	8328798	Or Rocket Launchers.
8329780	8331143	How about Rocket Launchers Save Guns?
8332714	8356939	Rocket Launcher Save Guns could be awesome another thing that could be awesome is some more more stuff that could be coming out and Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games some sound ordinary one sounds really weird of course they just put out Alien Crush Returns which is really awesome um
8358246	8364785	But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii Shop and are probably coming over here at some point as well.
8366620	8373166	First, they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.
8373186	8375988	That's not QQ Sports when you lose.
8376008	8376528	No, not QQ.
8377089	8384314	It features online play for one of the four players and allows you to either do motion controller or button-based play.
8385335	8393322	The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat, sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.
8393522	8394262	That sounds kind of cool.
8395191	8397852	The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.
8401933	8402373	It's weird.
8402433	8413516	It's sort of like a racing game, but you play Pit Crew that fixes different things from fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.
8416837	8418138	Well, how exciting.
8420178	8421379	What did you do on your Wii today?
8421419	8422339	I fixed a toilet.
8423547	8424068	Awesome!
8424248	8426009	You did what Wii with your toilet?
8426950	8432895	Besides the toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game, and boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.
8434636	8435177	Beer Pong?
8436198	8436938	No, what is it?
8437019	8438200	It's not Beer Pong.
8438260	8439340	They changed the name, remember?
8440181	8442303	It's like Pong Toss or something like that.
8442343	8443124	Wasn't that what they called it?
8444825	8447387	Something like that, yeah.
8447447	8447728	Anyhow...
8448956	8449937	Burnout Paradise
8480445	8482186	Who was the creator of the DeLorean?
8482306	8484807	Exactly, so that's what it is there.
8485368	8486088	Seriously.
8486268	8488049	That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.
8488349	8489710	Is there a McLaren clone in there?
8490270	8496854	They also have cars called the Calvary Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.
8496934	8509461	Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not-so-DeLorean, is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it, and if you push the L3 button, it will hover.
8511264	8512865	I'm looking at that in the screenshot.
8512905	8514466	I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.
8514526	8515346	It's bump and jump all of a sudden.
8515366	8515746	It's hovering.
8515766	8516627	That's awesome.
8516647	8517587	It will go in the hover mode.
8517807	8519248	And you know what those other ones are?
8519268	8522029	The bootlegger, that of course is the General Lee.
8523110	8529633	The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1, and the other one, Kit.
8530493	8531033	Sweet!
8531694	8532454	What do they call it, Car?
8534796	8537017	Oh, that's what these other little names are.
8537217	8538197	GT Nighthawk.
8538557	8539678	GT Nighthawk, yeah.
8539838	8540218	I get it.
8540998	8542019	Well, that's pretty awesome.
8542879	8547360	And bless those folks at Criterion Games, because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Burnout Paradise.
8547380	8549961	They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.
8549981	8555403	They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game, so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.
8555923	8557123	Plus, they didn't make the show roll.
8557143	8559604	They have a new party thing.
8559644	8562565	It's like Burnout Party or something like that that's coming out in February.
8562906	8564576	February, I think.
8564657	8565522	It's basically...
8567299	8570201	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.
8570241	8573423	I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.
8573463	8574204	I'm glad I kept it.
8574244	8575044	I think I still kept mine.
8575064	8576025	I'm not sure, but either way,
8597919	8611362	Rebuy it if I have it And also if you're on the Playstation 3 You can just download it That's true, you can't always just download it On the Playstation 3, it's in their little store That's pretty cool Good for them, giving us our money's worth
8612588	8628698	Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money, more actually referring to economy, is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.
8629638	8650643	Um, you basically will be able to, um, take empty space station areas and put in stores, put in shops, um, customize them however you want to, make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue, um, you can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency, you know, that type of thing, so it sounds pretty cool.
8650663	8651743	What is this, Quark the Game?
8655795	8662217	But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on where you can take command of a ship.
8663297	8664097	So that's kind of cool.
8665917	8669418	I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.
8669558	8670938	Maybe.
8671959	8673779	Eve definitely has its following though.
8673879	8678220	Oh come on, they're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.
8679740	8682481	I prefer the chess game.
8683482	8685044	But it's kind of neat.
8685064	8691670	You know, EVE's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO, but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.
8691810	8692871	I've never played it myself.
8693131	8696515	I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.
8700479	8701800	So, speaking of...
8703066	8704687	Thanks for watching!
8721338	8722519	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8750438	8751378	That's an awesome idea.
8751418	8755500	Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game and decide, oh, guess what?
8755520	8756920	You're going to have to pay for it now.
8757160	8757420	Nice.
8757780	8761521	And it's not going to have any songs that are actually, you know, based on other things.
8761581	8762822	It's just all original stuff.
8764502	8765202	Yeah, that'll fly.
8767659	8773543	The other thing that you should know too is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.
8773923	8778006	In fact, they said that Activision 09 lineup is 40% larger.
8778386	8783969	And of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty and multiple Guitar Hero releases.
8784410	8788672	Because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.
8791249	8791889	Interesting.
8792329	8794370	You want to hear something else that's also interesting?
8794390	8800831	Remember NVIDIA when they purchased them and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?
8801351	8802591	You know why they got rid of them?
8803432	8805712	Because they can't keep making sequels for them.
8805812	8806432	That's why.
8806712	8810073	Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.
8810573	8812053	They even came out and said that.
8812414	8817115	That's why they didn't pick up those original games because they only want games that they can make sequels for.
8817255	8818955	Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?
8819515	8821857	There's been many Ghostbusters games.
8822558	8823438	That's not true.
8824699	8827822	They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.
8828322	8830964	Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters 2.
8831245	8833106	I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.
8833266	8834087	That was one of those 386SX games.
8834107	8835448	They don't need them if they have the IP.
8845421	8845801	Just saying.
8845962	8846963	I don't know.
8847223	8848104	I don't think that would work.
8848464	8850046	So, that's why.
8850347	8854031	And so we're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.
8854451	8858816	Remember, there's that, you know, maybe a World War II and a modern and future one.
8858916	8860057	I think this guitar...
8860678	8861198	and so on.
8886107	8893092	Downscale the videos or something like that for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something I think they should do that I think Universe 3, that's out there in the wild now, isn't it?
8893312	8910545	Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360 So many games It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think They basically give away the full song list They don't leave anything secret, so there's no, like, joy in unlocking stuff And it's just, you know, each title's kind of hokey in its own way
8913128	8933119	but Guitar Hero is going to get the same way they're going to have each one for a different band I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into say Guitar Hero World Tour I don't think they're going to do that I think Rock Band will because they've been doing that so far but I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time
8934400	8943744	Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new, I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards DJ Max on the PSP.
8944144	8951146	I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this, because until now you've had to import this game, but there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.
8951206	8952687	It's DJ Max Fever.
8953387	8958169	DJ Max Fever, now, it was going to come out in November, but sadly, the game got delayed.
8958729	8959730	It is delayed a couple months.
8959870	8962871	It's now going to come out probably January-ish is what they're looking at, but...
8963271	8963811	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
8988226	8989487	DJ Maxx Fever DJ Maxx Technica
9008445	9011086	Here's the interesting thing about the game, though, and how it's different from Beatmania.
9011466	9012866	It uses a touch screen.
9013206	9018948	You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line, which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.
9019488	9023149	But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Max.
9023209	9025270	After all, half of the charm of these games is the music.
9025410	9030071	You know, this game almost reminds me that it's almost like they're trying to compete with Juby on this.
9030851	9032012	That's kind of interesting.
9032293	9032913	It is very interesting.
9033193	9036236	Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the U.S.
9036617	9044544	Very interesting because between this, Street Fighter 4, Tekken 6, arcades are slowly getting a little love again.
9044625	9047127	Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.
9047487	9049950	I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.
9050450	9053273	Technica is going to plug into the internet for global lead
9053513	9061820	Leaderboards, internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool, because that means you can get new songs right on the internet, and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.
9062381	9068005	And I believe there's some type of DJ Max soundtrack that you can get that comes with one of these cards, so you can get started.
9069427	9069587	Cool.
9069607	9069967	There you have it.
9070247	9074431	And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you, it's Ubeat, not Ubeat.
9074451	9075031	That's what I said.
9075051	9075432	I said Ubeat.
9075452	9076172	I corrected myself.
9076312	9076773	Oh, there you go.
9078775	9079235	Sorry, I remembered.
9081018	9081438	There you go.
9081578	9085522	And apparently some test locations for DJ Max Technica are going to be released soon.
9085582	9095129	So some folks that have kind of been playing this game on a more like cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year, in 2009.
9095410	9096070	Or it might not.
9096170	9096550	We'll see.
9097111	9098172	But I don't know.
9098432	9100814	I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.
9100994	9108160	I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golfland, that that touchscreen's going to turn to shit.
9108560	9108800	But...
9110605	9111566	It sounds cool.
9112887	9114047	Sounds like it might work.
9115368	9115608	Alright.
9116088	9122952	Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight were probably thinking towards the end of Part A, hey, where's DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week?
9123393	9125974	We tune in every week to hear DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
9125994	9130617	We didn't hear it tonight during Part A. Well, that's because DarkSakura got here a little earlier than anticipated.
9130677	9133719	We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.
9136297	9145065	So get ready to experience a game from gaming history as DarkSakura goes through her archives and picks a game that you all should be playing right now.
9146085	9146746	Absolutely.
9147447	9154092	The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
9155674	9157375	Which, um... What a choice.
9158036	9160338	Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.
9162580	9163901	I love the intro to it, okay?
9165089	9172315	But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.
9172975	9180681	Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X, which is my favorite Castlevania game.
9181722	9191930	Where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X, you're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.
9193972	9204782	The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it where you have different areas that you're exploring and you have to move through the different areas.
9204802	9206764	You hear different weapons on the way.
9209367	9220520	Really, it's just a lot of... This game is just completely unique as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.
9221682	9224145	We've also had various other releases.
9224605	9226668	I've got the Saturn version, which is actually...
9227856	9232338	Graphically, not my favorite because the Saturn didn't have a 3D as well.
9232699	9235540	You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.
9235560	9241343	You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game, you can play as Richter, which is really cool.
9241363	9242123	He's got his own...
9243844	9245526	His own attacks and everything.
9248648	9264581	But basically, through the game you have sort of an RPG element to the game where you've got your familiars with you, you have... I love the sword familiars, sword familiars are my favorite.
9265261	9270242	But you've also got, you know, interactions between characters that go in.
9270582	9275243	You can even choose your path through the game, and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive.
9275923	9278144	Because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.
9278184	9281144	Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.
9281225	9283805	It was done by... Wait, wait, here comes the best part.
9284005	9284225	Okay.
9284685	9285765	Die, monster.
9286306	9287866	You don't belong in this world.
9289192	9293094	It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.
9293994	9299137	I was called here by humans who wished to pay me tribute.
9300257	9300917	Tribute?
9301678	9305299	You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.
9306560	9309481	Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.
9310822	9313583	Your words are as empty as your soul.
9314183	9317185	Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.
9318669	9319871	What is a man?
9320733	9323037	A miserable little pile of secrets.
9323137	9324960	Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.
9324980	9325602	Have at you!
9328928	9331589	It is just as cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.
9331769	9333509	One of the best gaming moments ever.
9334149	9336970	This person, though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing because they wait.
9337670	9340691	When you're fighting Dracula, the first time around is Richter.
9341231	9349132	If you let yourself, like, die, then Maria comes out and says, All my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!
9349753	9350453	Or something like that.
9351753	9353433	But I never needed her help.
9353753	9355694	Anyway...
9357661	9364369	Um, there, um, with the development of this game, actually, there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.
9365030	9376622	Um, it actually, there's a thing that, uh, was called, um, Castlevania the Bloodletting, um, which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in, um, um, in development.
9377203	9377844	But, um...
9379265	9386929	The art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima, doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.
9387710	9389911	Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.
9391752	9397195	Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.
9398016	9398116	Um...
9403109	9405050	I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.
9405691	9414157	But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D, like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.
9415738	9420721	There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.
9420821	9421662	It's actually pretty cool.
9422582	9435235	Um, however, actually, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version, which, you know, we've covered this, it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade, and if you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.
9438957	9441479	Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.
9442060	9445182	It's the greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.
9446764	9452989	But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions that have come out, and also there was the PSP version.
9453890	9456472	This also has the Dart Priest Shaft.
9459176	9460817	Which is right up on the screen right now.
9461337	9462798	Which I just think is the greatest thing.
9462818	9465700	Which I know we're not a TV show.
9465720	9468782	Yeah, it's the same Shaft who is in Rondo of Blood.
9478028	9480289	This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.
9480309	9486393	I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.
9487526	9488067	Metroidvania.
9488427	9489107	Metroidvania.
9506444	9509048	Anyway, there are some particular differences.
9509268	9519963	The original, the name for this, actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him, he imported this game when it first came out.
9520464	9521505	Thank you for watching!
9539196	9540838	There are several differences.
9540918	9544582	First of all, in the Japanese version, it has two extra familiars.
9545042	9547485	There's the sprite familiar and the nose devil familiar.
9548466	9550048	Basically, the sprite is a palette swap.
9550148	9553912	The nose devil basically is the demon one with the Tengu mask.
9554753	9555534	I will not.
9557659	9561762	I'm sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.
9562663	9570188	The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga that came with the Japanese version.
9571048	9573510	And I can tell you it's pretty sweet.
9573550	9574871	It's actually really, really cool.
9576432	9582256	It's sort of like just a little behind-the-scenes thing of Alucard waking up and going off and kicking ass.
9583957	9584937	There's also...
9587572	9591033	Different version of the last stage.
9591813	9599356	Basically, in the US version, you saw it was called Bloodlines when Richter's chapter started up.
9600156	9604238	In the Japanese one, it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.
9605698	9611420	I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows towards the end of the game, boss fight.
9613003	9616984	Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.
9617144	9618845	I love playing as Maria.
9619025	9623146	Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.
9624427	9626467	Some of her attacks are really hard to do.
9627368	9629348	But there's different remixes that play.
9632129	9638114	and, um, of, uh, old Castlevania music, depending on if you play as Richter or Maria, and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.
9638455	9640236	And there are actually really good mixes of them, too.
9641117	9645761	Um, the load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.
9646161	9647302	Oh, that's not the game, sorry.
9647422	9649624	This is somebody's speedrun I'm looking at.
9649744	9650044	Um, sorry.
9650505	9650585	Um...
9654728	9656569	It actually has distorted sprites.
9658190	9663873	And really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better, and they just didn't take advantage of it.
9663893	9666355	It was very rushed.
9666755	9672638	But it did have two extra levels in the game, one of them... And this is me being a nerd, okay?
9674659	9684844	For anyone who has ever done this, when you're in the first level, you'll find a trap door that closes when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?
9685644	9689606	There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trap door.
9690246	9695689	And it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave, and then you go into another room down there.
9696709	9698890	And in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room.
9698930	9699511	That's all it is.
9700251	9701693	Thank you for watching.
9701873	9702493	See you next time.
9715946	9726101	I don't know if this is true or not, but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put in the original release and didn't.
9726642	9731830	Because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.
9732250	9737332	I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there if there was that little, you know, area.
9737352	9739152	There's also another trick, though.
9739632	9741653	I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.
9741693	9756978	I know it works in the PlayStation version where you can do, like, some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area, which is really useful if you have the walk armor because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle, the better defense you have.
9757498	9758779	I know a lot about this game.
9758839	9764004	I also know that it's a pain in the ass trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game, in my opinion.
9766206	9768549	But it's a freaking awesome game and everyone should be playing it.
9768869	9776496	It was voted, in 1998, it was the game of the year by EGM and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.
9776696	9779939	Which was a bit controversial that year because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.
9780680	9781862	I think this is better than Final Fantasy 7.
9783424	9787289	This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy 7 did.
9788751	9789071	Alright.
9789712	9793137	I played this game for hours of time.
9793197	9794278	Me too, I love this game.
9794859	9795300	I love it.
9795400	9796722	Did you bother getting your walk armor?
9797921	9798882	No, I didn't.
9799182	9803905	This came out during that period where I wasn't hardcore into games because I was in school.
9804966	9806988	But I still played a lot of this game.
9807288	9808689	We need to just sit down and play through it.
9809109	9810870	It would be fun.
9810890	9813853	It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.
9813873	9815294	I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.
9816363	9823110	Speedruns for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.
9823911	9826513	They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
9826874	9831859	Because if you really want to beat the game quickly, you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.
9832682	9841245	However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft, call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.
9841925	9842205	Nice.
9842645	9844966	So, that earns the whatever reward.
9845066	9859970	By the way, I just want to say also, the great thing about this game, speaking of the alternate ways you can do things, what a surprise when you kind of might think you're done with the game, but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.
9860382	9862243	Oh no, it really was such a surprise.
9862323	9863023	It was crazy.
9863224	9863844	It was awesome.
9864184	9872188	I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it, which I would hope is not that many people at this point, but if you've never seen it, it's like one of those moments where you're like, ah, god damn.
9872849	9877731	Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.
9877791	9879612	I mean, it really is fantastic.
9884115	9888177	There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.
9890273	9893575	I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.
9893795	9903058	There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library and you do your double jump in one particular place, you can actually pop up under the librarian and knock him into the ceiling.
9903739	9903959	Nice.
9904099	9906440	And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, Whee!
9908080	9909161	It's true, you can!
9909501	9910161	That's awesome.
9910601	9912183	I'd like to see that.
9912263	9914466	And then there's the little chats with Maria.
9914566	9919011	And Maria's kind of... And she says Richter.
9920012	9922575	Like she's going to spit acid in your eye.
9922895	9923155	Alright.
9923476	9923836	Anyway.
9925278	9926639	What a wonderful game for the week.
9927160	9928221	Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
9928241	9931184	If you haven't checked it out, it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
9932165	9942131	Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games that DarkSakura brings up once in a while, like games that were never released here or never will be, Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.
9942451	9943431	So you've got to go play it.
9944872	9949014	All right, let's do a couple more stories, then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.
9949034	9952216	We've been running a little long because of everything else we've been talking about, but we will get to Skypline.
9952256	9957979	We do want to take at least two calls and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.
9958019	9960060	We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.
9960701	9960901	Loki.
9962250	9962593	More news.
9965069	9967551	Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.
9968051	9971713	Of course, you know, I just made my costume, and yeah, that's cool.
9972113	9981900	But if you want to make some other costumes, Indie Mogul, they have a, I guess it's like a podcast or videocast that they do, that's Backyard FX.
9982820	9991145	And one of the segments that they just did was how to build your own Halo 3 armor, or your own Halo armor, I guess, for under $100.
9991185	9991265	Yeah.
9992786	9995448	and they actually have instructions on how to do it.
9995548	9997128	It's done with paper.
9997649	10006993	You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.
10008214	10011217	But it can come out looking really cool if you put the time and effort into it.
10011717	10014640	And the videos are available online.
10015000	10016261	And it's pretty awesome.
10016882	10020525	If you want to check it out, visit IndyMogul.com.
10020665	10024488	I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L Alright.
10027471	10034156	It's interesting because Halloween we had all the official Master Chief costumes, which granted were a lot cheaper because they were...
10035544	10036305	They look like crap.
10036365	10038188	They were like a hefty bag and helmet.
10038769	10043115	But, you know, kind of interesting that you can do this whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.
10043155	10046179	Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.
10046219	10051066	I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor or whatever cosplay stuff you want to...
10052247	10052647	Use it for.
10075595	10076096	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10094458	10101346	which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern for, you know, kind of money under the table, laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.
10102287	10103508	They have just taxed it.
10103528	10104269	20% is the tax.
10106952	10108333	and this announcement just came out.
10108393	10118019	It was distributed to local tax bureaus and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.
10118379	10127025	Taxation officials are granted the right to determine the original price of the online virtual currency if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.
10128466	10129046	Interesting.
10131158	10136279	Do you think we might be next here in America to tax this kind of stuff?
10136439	10141160	We'll try, but I don't know if there's much that they'll want to admit real money transfer.
10141340	10144281	It goes through these Chinese companies and foreign companies anyway.
10144341	10149802	I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax, but I don't know.
10150622	10152683	It would be very hard to police everything.
10153583	10156444	That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law, if you ask me.
10157264	10157424	Yeah.
10158106	10161748	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10161888	10163990	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10164030	10165871	We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.
10168032	10170374	Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute stories for us?
10171701	10173402	Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.
10174342	10177023	One I was going to mention, I don't know if this is out here anywhere.
10177924	10184066	There was a game that they showed off, I want to say it was at Tokyo Game Show, and it was teased in Famitsu Magazine.
10184806	10189548	A Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross-Edge.
10189888	10195950	You may remember such similar games as Namco X-Capcom or Namco Cross-Capcom.
10196170	10196290	Yep.
10196650	10196891	Well...
10198251	10199332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10221996	10235804	Morgan, Felicia, Dimitri, R. Tonalico, Orica, Misha, Shirelia, Disgaea, Atona, Prina, Spectral Souls, Mew, Mana, Kimia, Lilia, Rose, Marie
10240526	10241506	They have kitchen sink.
10241806	10242627	They have everything.
10243447	10245567	And you want to know what the best part about this is?
10245587	10247108	It's coming out to the U.S.
10247768	10248768	spring of next year.
10249728	10250048	Very nice.
10250248	10251189	Hey, I got a caller on hold.
10251209	10251889	Let's go to the phones.
10251989	10253149	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10253169	10253489	Who's this?
10254369	10255009	Solid Goomba.
10255290	10256010	Solid Goomba.
10256030	10256890	What's on your mind, my friend?
10257750	10263331	I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright banhammer on LittleBigPlanet.
10263552	10264152	Yes, please.
10264432	10264932	Speak away.
10266692	10268713	I haven't played the game yet.
10269333	10271994	I just bought a PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.
10272755	10275576	But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.
10276617	10284281	I see it as a homage to the original IP, like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.
10284321	10285702	I think that's perfectly acceptable.
10286362	10294267	And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such, then they should also be going after deviant art users for making fan images.
10296744	10302030	I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of... You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.
10302090	10311799	I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the... Oh, crap.
10312160	10313361	The confines of the game, yeah?
10313381	10313461	Yeah.
10313781	10313961	Yeah.
10315197	10317858	I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off
10336411	10348543	at the same time no one's making money off of it I guess that's true but it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels but then again as I understand it Sony has been pulling levels about the Playstation 3
10350066	10362949	But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that some would say overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.
10363349	10365289	And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this?
10365689	10366529	A Galaga level.
10366689	10366909	Yes.
10367250	10368030	You know who made this one?
10368190	10369330	Same guy who did the Gradius level.
10369350	10370330	Did it just come out or something?
10370550	10371870	No, he's got a bunch of videos.
10371891	10374491	He also did a Tetris level that's even better than the other one that they showed off.
10374511	10375131	Oh my god.
10376031	10376731	That's crazy.
10377332	10378992	But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.
10380441	10381441	because they're in Japanese.
10381902	10383522	And the company is a European company.
10383562	10385103	They probably can't read what his level says.
10385783	10389605	Now, a comment from chat room, and I apologize if I mispronounce this name.
10389685	10390785	It's a new name I haven't seen before.
10390885	10391526	Sanchez?
10391806	10392366	Sunchees?
10392626	10393046	Sunchees?
10393506	10394627	I like cheese, so Sunchees.
10395027	10397128	But it's two Zs.
10397768	10400029	Two Zs, not two Es, so Sanchez, maybe.
10400329	10402110	I'm tired of playing Super Mario Bros.
10402130	10403270	1-1 again and again.
10405151	10408593	It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Bros.
10408633	10408913	Level 1-1.
10410216	10418179	but there is even though yeah I'm sick of playing it too there is that moment of hey cool when you first see it right?
10418719	10419079	I don't know.
10420319	10426441	So if you had this game or you're going to be getting this game soon enough Solid Goomba what kind of level are you going to make?
10426501	10432443	Are you going to go and just make something original or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?
10433144	10434184	Oh I'm going to infringe.
10434224	10436245	I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.
10437125	10437925	There you go.
10439486	10439786	Awesome.
10440323	10442225	Anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3?
10442465	10444767	Because you're just now picking one up.
10444827	10446488	Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?
10447209	10449671	I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.
10450852	10453334	One more thought on the whole user-created content.
10454155	10458258	I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the PC.
10458318	10463323	Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.
10463443	10465745	Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?
10465965	10467186	And if we'll see it anytime soon?
10470456	10473758	Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.
10474018	10476780	So who knows?
10477680	10479501	In a way, yes, I think so.
10480482	10489347	It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember 10 years ago, the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point.
10489387	10494049	And the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems, you didn't have to have a monitor.
10494069	10494970	You could hook it up to your TV.
10496650	10502852	So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.
10505232	10507313	Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.
10508453	10510694	Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.
10510734	10512214	Alright, thanks, man.
10512234	10512695	Have a good one.
10512755	10513335	You too, buddy.
10513775	10514055	Take care.
10516661	10527128	It's very interesting, you know, so much joking and funny things at Sony's expense, but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.
10528429	10529750	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10531151	10532052	Hey, this is Actdeft.
10532192	10533273	Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?
10536355	10540818	Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.
10541238	10543140	I heard you, lucky bastard.
10543200	10543740	How is it?
10543900	10544601	Are you enjoying it?
10545859	10546839	It's pretty cool.
10547820	10558003	It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.
10558164	10561865	Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.
10564346	10594030	basically the parties the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome I haven't tried it yet but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good the interface it's totally revamped it's easier to use than the old one I have still to get accustomed to it but like I said it's pretty easy to use the whole interface huh
10595168	10595688	Very cool.
10597489	10602292	Have you been able to try, I don't know if you do Netflix, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh?
10602712	10603673	Do they have the Netflix thing?
10604333	10605634	Yeah, we don't have Netflix.
10605754	10610837	Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.
10610897	10612978	But I heard it's pretty cool.
10614159	10616661	I imagine you spent a little time building an avatar.
10616741	10618642	How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?
10619528	10620928	It's pretty easy to use.
10621008	10622869	It's pretty easy to create an avatar.
10622929	10629771	Though, what I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.
10631371	10638573	You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.
10639113	10639473	You have
10643615	10653861	Predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.
10655482	10669411	So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Mii, and you could really customize that, but because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited, is kind of the impression I'm getting.
10670236	10671337	Yeah, it's kind of limited.
10671397	10692615	You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff, but not like in the Wii, that you have more choices to...
10693902	10700463	Hey, quick question from SSJ100 Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friend list limit in it?
10701643	10702263	I don't think they did.
10703424	10704524	I really don't know.
10705364	10709325	I'm going to search that, but I think they haven't.
10709845	10711545	I don't think they have either, based on what I heard.
10711825	10712565	But I was just curious.
10712725	10715706	Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut.
10715846	10716186	I don't know.
10717206	10722047	Well, ActDeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?
10723376	10725499	Well, it's pretty good, like I said.
10725899	10734850	I hope we Mexicans, we could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.
10734890	10738234	But from what I have seen and what I have...
10741064	10758583	well, play with it's pretty good it's a whole new experience for the Xbox alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent I don't know, so be nice I hope so alright, well Actdeft, have a good one buddy
10759821	10768544	and have fun playing that experience I can't have right now because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off because I have surgery.
10768965	10770505	Boo hoo, QQ, cry cry.
10771145	10772686	One more call.
10772746	10774927	I said two, but I'm feeling nice.
10775687	10779589	Do one more call.
10779609	10783070	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10783490	10785391	Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?
10786482	10787843	Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me.
10788544	10799151	Apparently the Melgar Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.
10801473	10801873	Interesting.
10801893	10803254	Alright, let's go to the phones.
10803274	10804215	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10804235	10804575	Who's this?
10806017	10807338	Oh, it's Spazinator.
10807738	10809139	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10810600	10815283	Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment.
10815784	10815904	Um,
10816750	10827338	In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell video game soundtracks?
10827858	10838346	The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely have soundtracks, and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd, so...
10840120	10841760	Video game soundtracks.
10843181	10844701	CD Japan still in business?
10845081	10846202	It's been years since I bought one.
10846222	10846942	I'm sure they are.
10847082	10848702	Yeah, that would be one.
10850423	10853164	There's other Japanese-based sites, too.
10853444	10857185	I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.
10857245	10858045	Amazon Japan.
10858165	10860165	I've ordered CDs from them before.
10860426	10860986	PlayAsia.
10861026	10861326	That's right.
10861366	10862986	PlayAsia soundtracks.
10863006	10863766	Definitely PlayAsia.
10863826	10864327	Check them out.
10864527	10867367	Because they sell games, too, if you want to import games and all that stuff.
10867467	10868868	So they specialize in that stuff.
10868968	10869128	And toys.
10870947	10871367	There you go.
10871527	10873288	So there's some sites to check out.
10873388	10875729	And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.
10877930	10878911	Toys and Joys.
10880592	10898742	Also, as far as the Guitar Hero World Tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not, or at least tried it, but if you had any issues with the main menu at all where
10899437	10901138	The graphics in the menu would essentially glitch out?
10901258	10903819	Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?
10930250	10931891	Well, so far, just myself.
10933913	10955429	One thing I noticed is that, you know, the initial, like, logos and the loading screen and whatnot, you know, will appear normal, but as soon as you get to the actual menu where it says, you know, solo play options, so on and so forth, that's when, you know, the background gets all wacky.
10955449	10959112	You can't even see what you're selecting, stuff like that, you know.
10960440	10961541	I haven't heard of anything.
10961741	10969284	I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you.
10970165	10973606	I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched.
10973686	10979429	Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.
10981490	10983671	And you said you had a comment or another question?
10986161	10998817	Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar.
10999498	11000539	Do you know what that's for?
11003503	11006487	I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal.
11007629	11009471	Didn't we talk about this on a show a long time ago?
11009491	11010553	Loki, I don't know if you remember.
11010573	11012936	You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller?
11013136	11013317	Yeah.
11013417	11014138	They never used it.
11014238	11016541	Wasn't it going to be for an effector pedal or something at one point?
11016561	11018824	Yeah, and they even said it in the Guitar Hero...
11019905	11020306	What was it?
11020326	11021587	Guitar Hero 2 Manual.
11021767	11022707	But they just never happened.
11022847	11023588	Never materialized.
11024048	11025830	They opted for the fog machines instead.
11026070	11028732	Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?
11028812	11029833	It came out, I think.
11029893	11030393	Did it really?
11030513	11031294	I think it did.
11031334	11032715	Why are we not in possession of one?
11032735	11033255	Because they're $100.
11034216	11034556	So?
11034836	11036638	And I haven't thought about buying it yet.
11036718	11041742	I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog.
11042802	11045204	It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want.
11045845	11046185	Maybe not.
11046434	11057201	Yeah, actually, I've seen it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Reformer or Official Xbox Magazine, I forget which.
11058201	11061524	And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago.
11062324	11067587	And I think they may list a website where you can buy it.
11069188	11072471	I can look it up and email you...
11073957	11079802	Link or something It got really good reviews too because they actually made it It's not just like something that randomly does it with
11081348	11082789	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11111184	11112405	Yikes.
11112585	11116149	Why do we need this?
11116169	11116689	Because!
11116729	11117770	Smoke and lights!
11120893	11122715	If you want me to gag, then get one.
11122735	11124757	I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.
11125462	11126522	I just want one in my house.
11126982	11128223	No, I'm just kidding.
11128263	11129483	We're not going to waste the money on this.
11129563	11130943	Loki, do not waste money on this.
11131304	11131624	Ooh.
11131884	11132124	All right.
11132664	11133644	Symbols have come in.
11133664	11134144	He's going to do it.
11134544	11134804	All right.
11135005	11138205	Hey, Spazinator, we've got to go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.
11138665	11139206	Take care, buddy.
11140226	11143187	See if they have this over at the one near me.
11143727	11146868	Roseville, in Gallery at Roseville, they have it.
11147088	11147428	All right.
11147548	11148808	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
11148848	11150889	I know there are a lot of people still trying to get through.
11151449	11151929	It happens.
11153362	11153602	All right.
11153622	11154023	Yeah, you're right.
11154043	11154463	You don't need it.
11154683	11154964	All right.
11155304	11156345	Any more last-minute stories?
11156385	11156945	I'm sorry, Loki.
11157886	11158507	Or DarkSakura.
11158527	11159988	I don't know if you have any that you found.
11160068	11160369	Five.
11161690	11162551	Is your last-minute story?
11162631	11162851	Yes.
11163231	11163511	Awesome.
11164460	11167941	There's also a glitch in LittleBigPlanet that will ruin your game.
11169421	11179684	Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying.
11180164	11186666	Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.
11186966	11188066	Oh man, that sucks.
11188166	11192348	So remember, once again, because... Oh god, and people are going to put that shit on the internet.
11192689	11193969	There'll be those custom levels.
11193989	11194710	Hold on, hold on.
11194770	11200273	Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that.
11200913	11202054	Just back up your save.
11202094	11203154	That's all you gotta do.
11203174	11204995	That's a good warning.
11205236	11206136	Well, here's the thing.
11206576	11210438	If you spawn in the level all of a sudden you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it.
11210478	11212400	Just quit the game and say, fuck this.
11213706	11215647	So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing.
11215707	11216807	A giant death wheel.
11217088	11218488	Don't make a towering death wheel.
11218528	11221329	There are some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet.
11221509	11226312	There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest.
11226452	11233835	It was as hard as those crazy games online like I Want to Be the Guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.
11234015	11236736	I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here.
11236756	11238137	I'm just kind of going through some of them.
11239117	11245421	One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're going to do it.
11246001	11249163	There's a 9-11 level where the guy... Oh, God, no.
11249183	11254506	The guy flings a thing through buildings, and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.
11256167	11261730	Now, the guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome.
11262951	11265112	He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.
11266293	11267674	And a Beatmania level.
11268374	11269275	No, no Beatmania level.
11269295	11271516	No, Bobby said on his show he did a Beatmania level as well.
11271957	11272237	Really?
11272417	11272597	Yeah.
11273078	11273738	Oh, cool.
11274579	11278161	It's kind of crap, but it's supposedly Beatmania.
11278222	11279863	It's Beatmania inspired.
11280643	11280904	Okay.
11280924	11281664	There's a good way to put it.
11282044	11283345	But he says you won't find it on YouTube.
11283365	11283726	It's in the game.
11284417	11286299	I was going to show you this one real quick here, Rob.
11287340	11288340	It's got poops in it.
11288501	11290642	In a butt that poops out.
11291143	11295647	Those little Japanese cute little doody things.
11296327	11296988	Oh, please.
11297208	11297548	Please.
11297869	11298929	I really want to see this.
11299410	11299750	Hold on.
11299810	11305475	I've got to find the part where it's at here.
11306456	11311120	Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.
11311320	11313482	Okay, as you can see, the butt right there.
11313582	11314243	Can I just start it?
11314263	11314864	Yeah, just start it.
11314944	11315224	Okay.
11316726	11317166	Did I hit it?
11317807	11318087	Start.
11318227	11318347	Oh.
11320370	11321451	Little turds fall out.
11321731	11325715	Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster!
11325795	11326556	That's amazing.
11327157	11327517	Oh yeah.
11329219	11330160	What will they think of next?
11330200	11332202	I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...
11333533	11335614	And then they have this other one that some guy made.
11335734	11338695	It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome.
11338715	11342177	It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race.
11342237	11343998	It's like Excite Truck, but not.
11345438	11347359	Alright, we're going to get out of here.
11348240	11351121	We've got to wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here.
11351261	11352902	DarkSakura, your final thought is poop.
11353502	11354563	Loki, your final thought.
11354863	11357544	My final thought is I've actually got to start messing with this editor now.
11358344	11358985	It looks awesome.
11359105	11361486	My final thought is pie.
11363304	11372308	and for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.
11373149	11377430	All we ask, just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth.
11377771	11383533	And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, Boko Fett wrote a really nice one this week.
11384134	11386795	The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world.
11387095	11390296	The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues.
11392277	11397341	and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.
11397801	11401303	Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met, but you know well.
11402444	11402604	Aww.
11403785	11404706	Almost makes you want to barf.
11404746	11405286	It's so nice.
11405546	11406967	No, but thank you very much for that nice review.
11407167	11407788	Hope to see some more.
11407928	11409369	I feel squishy, Rob.
11409509	11411010	I need to go to the bathroom now.
11411250	11414132	Alright, you need to open up your poppet and hit the explode button.
11415533	11416474	Little Big Planet joke.
11417293	11418755	Anyhow, until next week.
11419536	11422440	God, we've told you about 50 games you need to go out and play right now.
11422500	11424543	Everything from Symphony of the Night to LittleBigPlanet.
11424563	11428469	So go play some games and we'll see you next time.
11429810	11430630	Here on Orange Lounge Radio
11459622	11460447	See you next week!
