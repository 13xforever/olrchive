{"text": " Today, November 30th, 2008, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC gets controversial DRM, a 10 year old game gets a new patch, and could Sackboy soon become a street fighter? And we're back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, we are that show on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, not joining us tonight sadly is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summer, she is out tonight, hopefully we'll be back next week. Also joining us, why am I saying hopefully, she better be back next week or we're going to be in trouble. Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki. Hello. How you doing, Loki? Good. And it's just Loki night tonight, which is kind of odd having come off a week of no show, apologies for there not being a show, and man if you're listening on the podcast you got double screwed because you had to wait forever for episode 302 to hit the feed, but I was having some problems getting the file back and forth, and so it really caused a big delay just with the holiday and everything, but hopefully y'all have just taken some time away to enjoy the holiday, you know, relax a little bit, and now we really start to get towards the really effed up part of the year. You're grinning like a madman, Loki. You should tell them how you got injured. Okay, the reason why there was no show last week, for one, Dark Sakura was out of town, she was stuck out of town, but usually if one of us is gone, the show will go on. But then two of us ended up being gone last week because I kind of hurt myself, and it's really stupid, but my roommate decided to put on his own version of The Amazing Race. You know that show on TV? Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's on the same time, I think, as we do our show, so I shouldn't be encouraging people to watch it, but we TiVo it, so you know, it's a lot of fun, it's a good show. He did a local version here in Sacramento, and I signed up to do this like, you know, months ago before I had had my surgery, and I just kind of thought, you know, after talking to the doctor, he said I'd be okay to resume all physical activity after two weeks. Well, I think I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much because, you know, when we were doing this race, we were running, I mean, everybody that was racing was really into it, and it was a lot of fun, my roommate did an awesome job with the whole thing, I gotta say, it was very, you should have done it low-key, except you probably wouldn't have been able to do it because you would have been... Like me, after... No, I don't get out of breath, my legs get sore before I get out of breath. That's what ultimately happened to me, is that actually I started getting sore in the area where I had my surgery and I had to come home and take, like, painkillers, it was so bad. So I ended up passing out pretty much during the time we had the show, so... A little embarrassing, yeah, but, you know, we've all done dumb shit that sometimes takes us out of, you know, our other commitments, so... Yeah, last week I went and played Airsoft, and I got, I think, poison oak, but I don't know if it's poison oak. It doesn't itch, so that's... God, I hope you didn't bring that in this house. Luckily, I think I'm immune, I've never had it, but I don't want it now. I don't, I've never had it either, so I don't know if it's poison oak, it's just, it looks like a rash on my arm, where I was crawling through, like, brush and grass and stuff like that, so... Who knows, you know, what it is, but, you know, I just made a rash and it doesn't really itch, so... I thought poison oak is really itchy and spreads like crazy, but... I don't know, whatever. It was fun, though. We shot each other with guns. Hey, shooting each other is always fun, so... It was, you know what's interesting is what I ended up doing last week instead of the show is I was kind of, like, waking up in the night, I actually was using the Xbox 360 to kind of check out Netflix, you know, and all the streaming movies, and one thing I am loving, obscure-ass documentaries that you can only find on Netflix. Seriously, I watched a couple of them, I watched, get this, there was a documentary I watched on Netflix about strippers that, they were these girls that turned to stripping to make ends meet after Hurricane Katrina. And the movie was called, I know, the movie was called Hurricane Strip was the name of the movie, and I'm like, I have to watch this, how obscure is that, seriously, right? But here's the thing, the movie itself kind of was dumb, because on one hand you had a documentary about Hurricane Katrina, and then, you know, which was very powerful to see that imagery and impactful, you know, it was obviously a terrible tragedy that happened, you know, years ago when it happened. But then on the other hand, you had this documentary about strippers, and like, why do women want to strip? Well, for money and attention, you know, okay, we could have told you that. It really never, for me, it never tied it into why did they feel the need to do it because of Hurricane Katrina or anything like that, like, it felt like I was watching two completely different movies. In a blender. They probably started out making a documentary about strippers and it was just too, whatever, and then all of a sudden Hurricane Katrina happened, they're like, hey, there we go, that's how we can tie this into it, and people are interested in Hurricane Katrina, so they will watch our crappy movie. Or it will end up free on Netflix someday, you know, who knows? It was not good. Like seriously, don't waste your time with it. I know it's like, you're like, hey, strippers, or hey, interesting documentary on Hurricane Katrina, but I'm sure there are plenty of more informative documentaries on Hurricane Katrina that are much more powerful than this, which was kind of garbage, it was just garbage. But there's some other good stuff out there that is worth watching, but maybe if I ever have a Netflix review show, I'll talk about that someday. But for now, let's talk about our gaming weeks. We can review some of the games we've been playing this week, and I definitely have one I want to talk about. I don't know about you, Loki, how was your gaming week? I really only played scenes for a two, I mean, I've been playing a lot of scenes for a two, I'm done with it, I'm almost 100% complete with the game. By the way, he's not lying, like every time I've logged on to Netflix this week to watch something, I see Loki and his little avatar there in Saints Row 2, which, by the way, we haven't talked really, because we weren't here last week, we haven't gotten to talk a lot about NXT, the new Xbox experience, I don't know what your thoughts are on it, I guess I've already talked about Netflix and how much I love that, that's an awesome addition, but what are you thinking about NXT? There's some things I like, the avatars are kind of neat. I don't like the new friends list on there, I think it's too hard to find what people are playing, it takes me forever to scroll through that list, whereas, you know, I can just hit the guide button again and just pull up my friends list and it just has a drop down on what people are playing, so I can look at it at a glance real quick. I do like the community games, those are pretty fun. I kind of like the new shop, how they have it set up with where you can see screenshots and box art and stuff like that for the games, that's kind of neat. It does seem to be a little harder just to browse stuff sometimes, but I'm just getting used to it. That's kind of my thoughts on it, I really love the new features, the avatars are cute, Netflix is awesome, community games are awesome, so I appreciate that Microsoft tried to modernize everything, which sounds weird because not only is the Xbox an old system, but they're basically trying to put some of these new stuff in an all new package, but I'm not sure I like the navigation, I think it is kind of a hard thing to navigate, especially compared to the old one, it's kind of hard to find some things in there, which I don't like. And I don't know about you, I was kind of expecting a little more out of that whole party system, like I actually thought it was going to be like you would actually have rooms that you would actually be walking the avatars around, like I don't know why I got this impression, so maybe I was just setting myself up for disappointment, but I didn't think it would just be, oh, when I'm looking at the friends list, I'll just see all the people they're playing with's avatars too. That's true, yeah. It'll come out later, who knows. Well, that's true, it may, and it sounds like they've kind of built on the back end a chance to be expansive, and some of these things like the photo party, you know, as silly as that application is, it does show you that it's very easy for them to push out these new features that you can just download and use. I don't like the- So there's a lot of problems, I can't say it's a negative thing, you know, NXC overall is a positive thing, I just think some things are a little more difficult when they don't need to be. I don't like all the advertisements on there, like for example, when you first bring it up it's like the what's going on in the Xbox and stuff like that, and they have all this crap that I gotta scroll through, it's just, you know, that's kind of annoying, I wish I could take that away. I love the little intro video when you first install it, that's pretty awesome. I don't know. Don't you think gold users shouldn't have to see as many of those ads? You know, I understand, some of them are for, you know, like their little inside Xbox videos and things, I don't mind it, because it's free stuff, you know, I know. It's just, it's, at least it's not, you know, Flash here, you know, your IQ is smarter than Sarah Palin and all the stuff you see on the internet, at least it's not that bad, you know what I mean? It's just small gripes. Now going to the community games, I did play, I tried to play everything on there, or at least a lot of it. Geez, it's taken you a while. Well, I haven't gotten to play everything, a lot of it, you know, I downloaded and I looked at it again, I'm like, ehhh, I don't want that, you know, I'm just deleting that. But I ended up buying a couple of them, I bought a weapon of choice, which is awesome, it's kind of like a Contra type game, which is really weird weapons and weird characters and enemies and stuff that you fight. So that's kind of neat, it's kind of quirky. And then the other one, I don't know why I bought it, but it was kind of fun was, I think it was like sign surfing, and that was kind of cool. It's just really simple, just a little fun, like, mess around game, which is kind of neat. The word puzzle one, I kind of thought about buying that, but I haven't gotten a chance to yet, and then I just go on there every, you know, every time I'm on there, usually if I'm on there for an extended period of time, I'll look to see the new ones that have come up and stuff like that. As I was complaining before on when we were talking to Bobby, some of the graphics, it looks really unpolished, just a lot of it looks like the games aren't done and they're just putting them up to see if they can make any money off of them. I don't know, it's just really bad. Even some of these independent developers and stuff, like some of the Japanese ones, like we were talking about in Warning Forever, just really simple freeware games that are pretty popular out there, they have the polish and the graphics on there, it's just, if these people took a little bit more time on their games, I think they'd be a little bit better, but for some reason, it just looks really bad, just even, I don't know, the textures are bad for like the 90s type stuff. I don't know, it's just not the same polish that you would see in like a shareware game or something like that. Now other than that, like I said, Saints Row 2, playing through that, just getting to the point now where I'm just doing the 100% stuff so I can finish the entire game. Playing Grand Theft Auto 4 now because everyone got hooked on that because they thought for some reason that they can't beat me in Saints Row 2, so let's try Grand Theft Auto 4 and I'm starting a new run on that, so that's kind of cool. We did an hour long marathon during the week last week and I ended up winning that, that was kind of fun. And the other games have been, not really playing, but I've watched a lot of my wife playing Animal Crossing, haven't gotten, you see, because every time she's done playing it, she's already done everything in the town, it's like, well shit, I can't go play the game now because you've already shaken all the trees, dug up everything, you know, fished the rivers clean or whatever, it's just, I don't know, I played it actually the other day during the Harvest Festival thing and did the Harvest Furniture which, sad to find out it's all girly crap, so I ended up selling all of it, but I don't know, that game is very sad, it's just, it's very sad because they didn't do anything to it and they in fact actually took things out of like, say if you played the original GameCube one, you'll know that they have like a fountain and stuff like that, well now you have to buy those things and I think that was the way it was in Wild World, I can't remember, but it's still sad that they took stuff out and they made stuff simpler and there's no reason for it, it's not, I don't know, they could have added so much to this and it would have been very little effort on their part, but once again, they don't want to put the effort in if they don't think that it needs to be done for the, you know, mom and pops that are buying, you know, the Wii for Wii Sports. Have you seen the commercials for Animal Crossing? Yes I have. Oh my god. Yes I have. I swear to god it makes me feel like I'm playing a chick game, it's just seriously, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just, it makes the game so damn casual, as if you needed to be told that it was a casual game, it's just like, I laugh every time I see the commercial, oh I hear there's a new boutique in town, god you're stupid, I mean, are you excited about a store in a fictional city in a game? I mean come on. You know, I can appreciate what Nintendo's trying to do, I mean even though they have gotten pigeonholed as the casual game company and the, you know, the one that's catering to women, and rightfully so, let's face it, they're selling like crazy, and if it helps enable more people that usually wouldn't play games to play games, I'm okay with it, I'm okay with Nintendo reaching out to a different audience as gay as it might make you feel. Okay, well here's the thing though, is their games, as of after Mario Kart basically that's come out, all the games that have been released by Nintendo haven't sold very well, and it's been going downhill fast, especially the fourth quarter stuff, Wario Land Shake It surprisingly didn't sell very well, Wii Music, well we don't even need to go there, and Animal Crossing surprisingly not that big of a seller, it's just people realize that they haven't changed anything, and the people that don't realize it are the people that probably aren't going to buy it anyways. What about the overall picture, because the pool's getting pretty diluted out there when you look at all the third party titles, I mean is it just because people that would have bought Animal Crossing are instead tempted by these cheaper budget games that are shovelware? I don't think so, because there's nothing really competing with those genres of games, like Wario Land Shake It doesn't really have any good side-scrolling platformers that are competing with it, Wii Music, maybe Guitar Hero would have competed with it, but I think Wii Music was bad to begin with, and Animal Crossing really the only thing that kind of compares to it that came out around the same time is My Sims Kingdom, which sold even worse than Animal Crossing, so I don't think, I think it'll do pretty well, but right now they haven't given us any hope to like, there's nothing really different, that's the problem, it's like, oh my god, and then the next- Okay, I gotta read some comments from chat here, chat.orangelandtrudy.com, of course always our other guest here on the program, the fourth guest, or tonight, they've been promoted to third guest, because Dark Soccer is not here tonight, Game Guru says, how do we know City Folk isn't selling well, we don't have an MPD, but you have a little, kind of an insider perspective on it. Well, I just, from what I've seen, and it could be selling very well, but from what I've seen- On a grander scale, but from what you are seeing, it is not. I mean, we're selling out, but it's just not, there wasn't that many to begin with to sell out from, we didn't, you know, buy it that heavy. Okay, let's see, looking at Biohaze20 said, wasn't Rob anti-Nintendo, or am I missing something here? No, I'm not anti-Nintendo, just like I was never anti-Sony when I was mad at the PlayStation 3, and that was getting the bane of everything I had negative to say, you know, it's just that I think Nintendo's made a lot of very disappointing decisions in the past two years, and a lot of that has affected the hardcore gamers like you and me, and you know, and it just kind of goes right into what Acidic Vampire says in chat, Nintendo is reaching out to other people and neglecting the hardcore gamers frown, and that's kind of my issue. And the whole thing- Right there. Yeah, and my thing was too, is before with the GameCube, when they were done with the GameCube and they're developing the Wii and they're promoting the Wii, it's like, listen, the Wii is for everybody, the Wii system is not, we're not going to be pigeonholed in being, you know, known as a company that puts out games only for like children, we are trying to appeal to everybody, but they're not, they're just doing the same thing that they've been doing before, they're just complaining that everyone sees them as a company that puts out, you know, games for like, you know, too many family games and too many just casual games, and well, complain all you want, but that's what you're doing. And here's the other thing too, I can respect what Nintendo does from a business perspective, which is what I'm kind of saying with these commercials and things, it's like, you know, as a business move, it's a smart idea and it's something new, but at the same time on a personal level, I can still kind of go, but it sucks, you know, because for me personally, the selfish gamer in me wants something else, you know, wants the Wii to have been HD capable in the first place and, you know, and so on and so on, you know, from that perspective. And also I kind of think that, you know, hardcore gamers kind of push the Wii to be so in demand in the first place and Nintendo's going to need them if they, you know, launch another system or an upgraded version of the Wii, which is kind of my fear is what's going to happen is that we're going to see the next system that comes out of Nintendo is going to be, and it could be as soon as next year, maybe 2010, I would say no later than 2010, you're going to see it Wii HD or something where now they're going to start catering into all those features, you know, but their big selling point is going to be, but it's also a Wii, just like the Wii was also a GameCube, you know what I mean? So you know, I think to get that support, they're going to need to win us hardcore gamers back and the more you push us away and the more that Xbox and even now Sony starts to woo us over, which who would have thought that would have happened a few years ago that we'd be talking so great about Sony, but whereas Nintendo has been making a lot of disappointing decisions this year, Sony has been making a lot of, I can't say great decisions, but satisfying decisions, let's put it that way, you know, they're, we're content with Sony right now. Let me just put it this way. They're coming out for the first two months of 2009 from Nintendo and it's sad. I mean, it's sad if you own a Wii, let me put it that way. If you own a DS, you might not be so disappointed, but seriously, this is the trend that they're doing now is let's start remaking GameCube games. Can you put any less effort into that? I mean seriously, what we got, but play for Wii Mario Tennis and play for Wii Pikmin is the first two games of next year for the Wii. I mean, woo! With Pikmin! Oh, awesome! It's Pikmin all over again. Well, we're going to get to a story later tonight about that there's something, a surprise cooking over at Nintendo, one of their developers. Is it possible that Nintendo is setting the stage to really knock our socks off next E3? They better. That's all I'm saying. I have a feeling next E3 it's going to be about the DSi. And I hope that they do something good because, man, my bar for them is set so low right now, it's like there's very little, maybe a new Zelda game, or F-Zero or something. Or that Kid Icarus game that's been rumored for a long, long time. Yeah, that'll never happen. Well, I'm just saying, you want to win me back, here's some ways. And they've got to be good. It can't be shovelware. You shovelware Kid Icarus, I'm going to be pissed, I'm going to be twice as pissed as I was before. You've got to make it good. Well, anyway. Just stop being so stingy is what they need to do. Game Guru says the thing is that the core gamer and the third party's abandoned Nintendo. Yeah, we're going to get to another story later tonight about how some of these companies are now starting to say, look, Louise is not capable of doing what we wanted to do, so bye. Yeah, but the core gamer's finicky, okay? If they come out with a really kick-ass game, they're going to come right back, okay? So it doesn't matter. That's a damn good point. The core gamers are extremely finicky. I mean, God, this even ties into something else that kind of came up while we were gone. We've kind of missed a lot. It was a pretty busy time of the year. But there was this whole interview and look into as to why do game blogs and even podcasters like us and so on find the need to nitpick the negative in every single game out there. And I think it's centered around Mirror's Edge and how Mirror's Edge is really getting these reviews that are just all over the map. Some people are giving it, oh my God, best game ever, et cetera, et cetera. And some people are saying, and just really nitpicking the shit out of the game. You know, are people doing it just to be negative on something? They're not fucking Power Trip is what they are. They're getting treated like royalty, getting promo shit sent to them. They're getting basically blown by these game companies. And then they're just like, oh, well, this game isn't as good as buh buh buh buh buh, you know? And this is why I'm going to nitp- meh meh meh meh meh. You know, just like I'm playing about little shit, and that's probably because they're- You know, this is so ironic coming from you. But you know what, though? I find fun in different things. I mean, like Earth Defense Force, perfect example, that game is absolute shit. If you were to look at it, like, by, you know, graphics, AI, everything is goddamn retarded in that game. But it's fun. And that's the whole point is that's really all that counts is if the game is fun. Who gives a crap if it's ugly? It's fun. That's the whole point. You just were sitting here dogging on the community games for having crappy graphics. Exactly. But they aren't fun either. Okay. All right, then. All right, fine. And seriously, though, I mean, there are lines that, you know, can be crossed, you know, where it's like, okay, yeah, it might be fun, but seriously, man, that looks awful. Just, I don't know. All right. Any other games you've been playing this week? We've kind of gone on all these tangents, but it's been fine. Any other games you've been playing this week? No. I've been using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player quite a bit. Katung Pupan is pretty awesome. Sweet. Mamma Mia is coming out pretty soon. Dark Knight and Sing Star Abba on PlayStation 3 is this week, isn't it? Yeah, I believe it is. Oh, I'm excited. Well, I, was it, I, someone had mentioned, like, I have pre-ordered right now one of the limited editions of Dark Knight with the stupid Batpod thing because I want a piece of crap for my desk, you know, like, running out of cool things to put on it. So we'll see if I actually buy that, but, I don't know. All right, games I've been playing this week, pretty much, you know, same old stuff. I was talking about Netflix. I did dive into community games. I picked up Snake 360. You know, we had Aaron on last week, who was the, really the dude behind Snake 360, and, you know, I had a good time with Snake 360. I really like that Aaron has pushed the limits of everything that you can kind of possibly do within the confines of what community games lets you do. Like, you know, he just has all these different modes, all these different maps. You know, when you take a really basic game, you know, Snake is not the most complicated game. You know, it's basically an evolved Atari 2600 game, right? Surround evolved into the cell phone snake game evolved into what we have here now, Snake 360, right, with some, with Tron Light Cycles mixed in there somewhere. You know, he's really kind of done a lot that you can do with this game when it comes to having the multiplayer, having the timed mode, having the, you know, pick up a certain number of pods in a level mode, having the different mazes. And I think the soundtrack, it was really smart of him to pair up with, you know, Kyle Ward and his company and have the music, because it adds a certain uniqueness to the game, which is kind of cool. The only drawbacks to Snake 360 are out of this guy's control. The biggest problems I have with the game is that when I'm playing these multiplayer modes, I'm kind of like, this would be so much more fun if I could play it on Xbox Live with people across, you know, the nation. But I realize at the same time, that's something that Microsoft just plain won't let him do. But I worry for community games as a whole, because I think there's going to be a lot of people that don't know so much about, you know, well, community games have all these restrictions to them. And like, he can't do online leaderboards, because Microsoft won't let them. But you know, he's found a lot of very creative workarounds, I'll give him that. Instead of achievements, he has goals, and the goals will unlock things. Instead of the leaderboards, he has the online leaderboards where you go and put in the codes. Instead of, you know, he's done some very creative workarounds, especially when he considered this is for all intents and purposes a launch title for community games. So it's definitely worth your $5 if you're a fan of like 80s arcade games that were very basic and to the point. I think you'll find that this is pretty extensive. But if you think a game like Snake is going to bore you, like, you know, you don't play it for more than 5 seconds on the cell phone, or you have a very short attention span, there's not going to be a lot here for you, I don't think. I think you probably won't enjoy the game. But I think as a local multiplayer, especially, it's a lot of fun. I crave it to be on Xbox Live, and I'm kind of disappointed Microsoft won't let some of these games go to the next level. I hope they will. I hope some of these really good, you know, impressing community games, such as, you know, Weapon of Choice I think is doing very well. You mentioned it earlier, Bobby had the dude on his show tonight from Weapon of Choice. Maybe some of these guys will get to upgrade if they want to a full on game. I don't know, we'll see. But it's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of like old school 80s games, like, you know, arcade games. It's fun. Not worth your time whatsoever, I'm sorry, I know I'm going to piss a lot of people off with this. Another Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix is poop. I didn't like it one bit. I checked it out on PlayStation Network when it came out. My friend actually bought it, so I did get to take a look at the full version. I didn't even look at the demo first. I didn't realize that the Xbox 360 demo was as handicapped as it was. I actually kind of did most of my play on this game on PlayStation Network, and I'll tell you what. It's the same game you've had already, and I know you already know this about Street Fighter II, but to me it's a little bit insulting that, you know, they would charge $10 for that first game and then come around a year later and charge $10 for essentially the same game. You have an additional $5 or whatever you want to say for this game, and yes, I realize Street Fighter II is a classic, but at the same time, there's only so much you can do with it, and I think Street Fighter IV is more of what, in my opinion, a redone Street Fighter II ought to be, is Street Fighter IV. Here's the thing. What do you get in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD remix that you didn't have before? It's the same game with four new characters, of which, you know, give or take, in my opinion. I guess I like Fei Long, but I don't know. They're kind of give or take. It isn't worth the $5 to me, or so there's that, and then there's the new graphics and the new sound. And the rebalancing. I'm going to say something here. Well, the rebalancing for a casual fighter person like me is irrelevant. The graphics aren't bad. I'll give it that. The HD is pretty cool. The sprites are done fairly well. Although, it's not a smooth game, because you still have very, you know, but I understand you can't do that without breaking the original mechanics of Street Fighter, but don't expect that the game is necessarily going to run smoother or look that much smoother, because, you know, the sprites are just prettier, and that's about it, okay? And I'm being corrected by chat, because five new characters when you count, Akuma, but whatever. But here's the thing, okay? Now I'm going to make a statement that's really not going to make me popular, but the other thing that, you know, you have besides the new graphics is the new sound, and the soundtrack sucks. Like, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate what they tried to do with Street Fighter 2. I appreciate that they tried to go to the indie community and this OC remix thing, and they actually got people to remix the songs, but for me, they don't work. They don't match the mood of the original songs at all, and I could tell this from the minute the character select screen came up. I was like, what did they do to the character select music? This is awful! So sorry, I know that statement's probably not going to make me popular amongst fans of the OC remix circuit, and it's not to say that website hasn't done a lot of great things in the past, but I think it's left best these tracks that made it into this game as remix, and I realize it's a whole play on that word, remix, and da-da-da-da-da, but it didn't work in the game at all for me, and sound to me is very, very important in the game and the music, and if you're going to try and rate me for $15 more based on nostalgia, I want my tunes to have some sense of nostalgia. Yes, I realize I can revert to classic mode, but again, what are you trying to sell me? If you just wanted to sell me the classic songs, you already sold that to me a year ago! So, I expect that these remixes are going to have some type of, maybe I'm just bothered because I've heard remixes of these songs before that were more true to the originals, and that were better for me, but I did not like the soundtrack at all, you know? Call me names, tell me I'm hatin' if you want, but in this particular circumstance, I did not like the music, I'm sorry. I'm not a real big fan of Street Fighter II anyway, so I didn't even look at it. I was just like, eh, $15, screw that, I'm not going to buy it, I'm not going to buy the original either. Now, if they came out with yet another Bionic Commando game, then yes, I would probably, shit, I gotta go back and play the Bionic Commando again. So, it nearly came out later this whole thing on the Xbox 360, how the demo on Xbox 360 only was local multiplayer, and like, so if you're a solo player, you can't do crap with the demo, and you know, I was talking about this on Bobby's show, I don't know if he has, hopefully you're listening to him too, but I kind of theorized this might be because Capcom didn't want to do a demo for this game. I think they are afraid if people check out this game, they're going to realize it's a waste of their money. That there's not enough here besides the continued whoring of your nostalgia, which, God, I feel like I've been through that enough in the past two years thanks to Nintendo. You know what I mean? But I gotta give them credit, at least the sprites look good, they put the effort into the graphics of the game and stuff, it's not just blurry, you know. But yeah, I mean really, if you're not really, if you bought the first one on Xbox Live, you probably don't need to buy this either. Honestly, don't bother with it on Xbox at all if you don't have the right controller. Don't try to play this game with a regular Xbox 360 controller unless you have somehow been able to overcome that whole, I'm telling you, every bad thing you hear about the Xbox 360 controller is true for this. Don't, if you have to get it, get it on PlayStation Network for the controller alone, unless you have an arcade stick on 360 or something. And of course, folks in chat are completely disagreeing, which is fine, I kind of expected that. Hitstun says, but really, STHD is the definitive Street Fighter now even more so than Street Fighter IV, all fighting game players need to buy it. Acidic Vampire says, that's what some movie studios do, when they know a movie's going to suck, they don't release it to the press for advanced reviews. Well, here's the weird thing, I think the game overall is getting good reviews, I realize, and I'm not doing it for the sake of going against it, I just personally, I did not like it, I'm sorry. No, I'm not sorry, I didn't like it, deal with it. But that's another thing too, is this whole game review stuff, because they remember, and this all just like Chrono Trigger and stuff, no offense, Chrono Trigger is an awesome game and stuff, but they didn't really do too much to the DS game, and it's getting like almost perfect scores and stuff. It's kind of weird. But you know, it is Chrono Trigger, so it's pretty awesome. Then Hitstun goes on to say, if you don't have a 360, and I might be taking this out of context, I apologize, says, if you don't have a 360 or PS3, it's a good reason to buy the console just to get the game. Oh god, do I disagree with that comment. If the game in question is Street Fighter, because it's really not. You can't put games out there like LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid IV, and say, those are the reasons, those are the reasons to get a PlayStation 3, and then Gears 2, Fable 2, countless games on 360. Dude, if you're going to buy a console, and you're going to spend like $300 on a console, or $400 in the case of a PS3, I haven't really priced them lately, or at all, but I would be willing to bet you could probably get a full-size arcade cabinet with Street Fighter 2. It probably wouldn't be that expensive, I mean, that would be my guess, just the original Street Fighter 2, or whatever. You might even be able to get it for just slightly more than $400, if you're really that insane that you'd buy a console for a freaking downloadable game, I mean that's weird. I have a comment that'll piss off the Street Fighter fans even further. Now this I will say, just for the sake of pissing people off, I'll admit this, playing Street Fighter 2 HD Remix almost made me want to go buy Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. That's how much I did not enjoy the game. No, that's not right. You think that's taking it too far? That's taking it too far. Taking it too far? I mean, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is, cannot even begin to be compared to Marvel vs. Capcom. It's just like, on another subpar level, I don't even know. But it's really sad, and that's insulting to me, and I don't even like either one of those games, really. I'm getting yelled at by chat for that comment, that was pretty bad. Alright, look, let's get into some of tonight's games. Okay, see, here's what I'm saying right here. Street Fighter 2, you can get Street Fighter Alpha 2 Arcade Cabinet, $600. So you better believe that you can get an original Street Fighter 2 machine, yeah, they're like about $600 bucks. So just, if you're really that insane that you would buy a console for this, seriously, just go buy the real arcade game, I mean, there you go. Alright, before we get to some gaming news tonight, let's talk about some housekeeping tonight. We're gonna do a contest soon to give away the code for Banjo-Kazooie. We were supposed to do it last week, but we're gonna retool it to be something that both our live and our podcast listeners can do. So we're not gonna be doing it tonight, but there will be something probably next week, and we'll kind of give you more details on that when everybody's back and when it's not the holidays. Also, I don't think we have a lot else to talk about in housekeeping tonight, just the stuff with our Facebook, of course, we have OL Army on Facebook, MySpace at username OrangeLoungeRadio, and LiveJournal at OrangeLounge. So unless you can think of anything for housekeeping tonight, as far as news goes, but not a lot going on with the show otherwise. Same old, same old. No, I can't think of anything other than Burger King Tender Crisp sandwiches aren't that great. Nice. Alright, we're gonna get into the news tonight. Oh, before we get into the news tonight, you know, we usually do our little thing on Bobby Show before we go live, you know, Bobby Black Wolf, the man who we follow on all games radio live, Sunday nights. I don't know if you guys heard of there was some weird little like cryptic message. And I tried to ask Bobby about it, but he's like, totally ignoring my text. But I'm trying to figure out like what that website was like, I don't know, did you guys hear it? It was something like flive.net or something FNG live, I couldn't hear it all, but I don't know. I'll have to go back and download it and check it out, something weird going on. Alright, let's get into the news and tell Bobby to stop ignoring me, this is very rude, Bobby. Alright, I'm calling you out. Alright, let's get into tonight's gaming news, Loki, why don't you start off. Okay, well, a couple weeks ago, the brand new download content for Grand Theft Auto 4 was announced. Grand Theft Auto's Lost and the Damned, or Lost and Damned I guess, which is gonna revolve around the biker gang that was in Grand Theft Auto 4, The Lost. And would be a brand new thing, I guess a brand new story mode, doesn't really add anything like I wanted to it, like tanks and crap, but hey, new story, sweet. It was going to be released in February. Right now though, what's interesting is GameStop has the download content available to purchase on their website, which is supposed to be released in February on the 17th. And so apparently you'll be able to buy this redemption card at GameStop. I mean, talk about a way to whore that out, but here's a hint folks, if you go to GameStop you're gonna pay sales tax. If you buy it online, you're not gonna have to pay sales tax, at least you shouldn't have to pay a sales tax. So don't buy it from GameStop. That's pretty easy right there. Don't some states charge you sales tax even on the download stuff? Well in that case it doesn't matter then. But then again, it costs you gas to drive down the GameStop. Gas is cheap right now, have you noticed? In the two weeks we've been off, gas dropped a dollar, what are you talking about? It's still a cost, and even after all that, it's just to buy a code that you would enter in to download it anyway. So just save yourself the time, save them the ego of being able to pre-order cards. I mean, that's sad. Just go buy it online. Why do you even need to buy the GameStop? Well maybe it's just the conv- you know what, it's- well wait, when is this coming out? I was gonna say February. Oh never mind, I was gonna say so people could buy it as a Christmas present. So they can pre-order more stuff, so they can get you to turn in some games that pre-order download content, so they can get another five bucks from you. I'm sorry, but the fact that you would pay for download content as a store and then go home and download it is just stupid. According to me, I mean, what do I know though? Well maybe somebody doesn't have internet capability or what have you. Then you wouldn't buy the download content! This isn't a disc! It's a card with a code that you enter it in online and download it! It's stupid! Alright, I guess, I guess, fine. It's absolutely retarded. Zushi says free poster at Gamestop? Woo hoo! Free poster! Okay, well if they've- well if they got a free poster then I better go down there right now! Sorry I can't do the rest of the show, I gotta get my free poster. Well look, look, look, hey I like free things and maybe I am- in fact I would be probably one of the three people who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto Vice City. And if you actually want to order Grand Theft Auto 4 pre-order, if you want to do it for your PC, order Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, you can actually get a free copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City just for placing the pre-order. This is all via Steam, so Valve and Rockstar Games teamed up, and if you pre-order Grand Theft Auto 4 PC via Steam, then Vice City will be free! Well that's awesome! Which by the way you gotta do it like right now because Grand Theft Auto 4 releases like what Tuesday on PC? That's awesome except Anadras was way better anyways, and Vice City this time is really old. I don't know. Just buy Grand Theft Auto 4, you don't even need like extra stuff for it. So anyways, speaking of other things, Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC has the ever infamous secure ROM in it now. Well thankfully though, there's not going to be as much limitation as some of these other games. There is no limit on concurrent installations, but you will have to authenticate it once you've installed it, and you'll have to I guess authenticate it again if you reinstall it. So it's basically just to make sure that the CD-ROM I guess is, I don't know, in your drive when you're playing the game or something like that. Something stupid. But I can't help but think this is probably going to be cracked next week already. I mean, secure ROM has really been no obstacle for a lot of people anyways. It's quite a controversial thing, I mean it's not just the limited installations is pissing people off, but the whole you know that whole thing and I don't know whether you would call it a rumor if it's a proven fact or what, but the whole like you know that it might screw up your drive. Well I already have it installed in my system and nothing's messed up so far, so yeah it doesn't really matter for me. But then again I'm not buying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. Dark Tetsuya relays an interesting comment, he said it's like I told the people at Game Politics, considering how hard secure ROM is to get rid of, I'd rather take my chances with Trojans and Keyloggers. You just, you know, have a trusted place to download your wares I guess. I guess so, although you shouldn't be advocating piracy, I don't think we should be advocating secure ROM either. I'm not advocating piracy, I'm just saying I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC. Because you already have it on 360, what do you need it on PC for, right? I'm not buying Grand Theft Auto IV on PC. Well yeah because I do have it, I've already finished it, there's no reason for me to actually play this on PC other than it looks prettier and well you know I do have a game PC now, might as well put games on it. Alright, I gotcha. You're just looking forward to all the hacking that people can do with Grand Theft Auto IV. Can secure ROM prevent that? Or do you think that they wouldn't bother because that's kind of the reason why people get it on PC is to screw with it? No, it's not going to affect it at all because secure ROM only really protects the main executable for it. The data files are what's going to be modified to whatever you want to do with it. Make naked people run around, I don't know, whatever floats your boat I guess. Alright, before we get into more gaming news tonight, what did we miss last week? Do we miss some stuff last week? I know we weren't here and the one thing that comes to mind, the big story I know we were going to cover last week before the plug got pulled on the show was the whole PETA Cookie Mama thing. Oh yeah, PETA did a little spoof on Cookie Mama. They have, apparently they don't really care about people's trademarks or anything like that because it's parody. But I mean, seriously, it's just. It was really just an overall excuse to get people to watch the video that's embedded there. And Majesco had a really cute response to it where they actually quoted Mama and I thought that was very cute what they did. But as far as PETA goes, love them or hate them, it's working. People are talking about it. And I'll tell you what, probably hundreds and thousands of people saw that video that wouldn't have before simply because it did tie into video games. So love them or hate them, they did what they had to do. And it worked for all intents and purposes, I suppose. As much as I don't necessarily agree, you know, it's not that I don't agree with PETA 100%, but, well, you know what I mean, I'm all for treating animals nice and all that stuff but I think that particular organization sometimes goes a little bit too far and they'll kind of stop at nothing to get their message across. But the more we talk about it, the more free publicity they're getting, so whatevs. But I just wanted to say Majesco had a very cute response to it and props to them. I was going to say that there was another story that I think is kind of big and sort of kind of got blown over a little bit. Eidos, once again back in the spotlight, for trying to fix their Metacritic scores for Tomb Raider Underworld. Apparently, and they sort of blew, you know, tried to make it blow over, but apparently they were telling their UK press outlets that they could not post bad scores, low review scores. It says, that's right, we're trying to manage review scores at the request of Eidos. When asked why, the spokesperson said just that we're trying to get the Metacritic rating to be high and the brand manager in the US that's handling all the Tomb Raider has asked that we just manage the scores before the game is out. Really, just ensure that we don't put people off from buying the game basically. So basically, the positive reviews can go out but the lower scored reviews have to wait. That's not the first time I've heard of something like that though and not, I mean, that's the first time I've heard of the Metacritic spin on it but I've definitely heard of companies saying like, you know, well what review are you going to give it? Oh, well if you're going to give it a high review then you can post it early. You can break the embargo but if you're not going to give it a high review then you have to wait till, you know, the street date. That's kind of messed up and there's probably a good reason why that a low review might be, you know, warrant this game but apparently the Tomb Raider Underworld version for the Wii has a glitch at the end of the game that prevents you from finishing it. If you, I don't know exactly the circumstances but apparently from what I heard is if you kill certain soldiers or whatever in the wrong order that there will be a lever that's supposed to be there that you're supposed to pull won't be there somehow and apparently there's no way to fix that at all and Eidos' workaround is that they will just give you a save that's past that point. How do they give you a save? You have to go download it off the internet and you have to do this. Oh, because I'm sure everybody can just do that. Yeah. I think it's really annoying. Interesting. I'm just kind of trying to check out the Metacritic scores. 78 is the current score on the PlayStation 3 version. That's not bad. That's not a bad score all things considered. Look at the Wii version. Wii version has a 68. That's not too bad. That's actually not a horrible score. It's in the yellow but it's not horrible. But see at the same time that makes me wonder though it's like if this glitch does actually exist in a game where you can't finish the game how many of these getting like sevens and eights? Well maybe there's a very specific order you have to do things to glitch it. No apparently it's pretty easy to do. You have to do a very specific order not to glitch it is what it anyways they have a workaround or some way that you're supposed to play the game in order not to glitch it either way this glitch shouldn't exist in the game. But you know I'm sure they played through the game enough. So guess what Wii game speaking now that I'm just happen to be on Metacritic right now guess what Wii game has the lowest Metacritic score out of anything out there and what it is? A 28 for this game called Game Party 2 by Midway. Oh yeah. It's known as more game party overseas. It's got lawn darts, bean bags, horseshoes the highest score was a 35 from GameSpot and most places are giving it like a 20 and they're just it's unoriginal it's based there basically everybody says it's a shit game. It's unoriginal it's also dirt cheap it's 20 bucks and that sold actually pretty well from what I remember. But that's 20 bucks that honestly you know despite all the crap I gave it earlier it's 20 bucks that's better spent on Super Street Fighter 2 HD Remix. And honestly you know despite the hard time I gave Street Fighter 2 I mean it still is Street Fighter 2 which is better than like 80% of the Wii games out there right now if not more. Some of the other stuff from last week there was a new update to the Wii that broke the Twilight hack and all that stuff and also targeted modded save files and some other stuff. And apparently yeah there it was you know bad and what did enhance those it added I guess the ability to use USB keyboards during in the Mii channel or something like that for when you're typing stuff. What's funny though is it got re-broken again a few days later by hackers and they released a new version of the Twilight update or the Twilight hack that allowed you to install the homebrew channel. But still though thanks for trying. And then finally one last thing a couple things that were kind of interesting new arcade games and Guitar Hero apparently is coming to the arcade and the weirdest part about it is Konami is helping them by partnering up with Activision to actually make the hardware for the game. It's apparently going to be based around Guitar Hero 3's engine and it's being developed by Roth Thrills who did I guess some of the big buck hunter games. So I don't know they've got a little bit of experience there. There is going to be some online functionality with it. No word if they're going to actually have any additional songs or if it's just going to be stuff from Guitar Hero 3 but the hardware itself looks like the kind of the world tour guitars but with arcade parts. So look for those essentially that were hoping that Konami would one day bring Guitar Freaks out to the US forget it. Forget it. It's done. These folks at Activision and Neversoft and well I guess you can't say Neversoft but Activision and so forth and Red Octane have their mouths firmly planted on Konami's cock where it ought to be because it's kind of where the idea came from in the first place one could argue and Konami likes it and you know they're getting theirs from it so it's you know it's a win win deal all around. This is what it's going to be. Yeah. Take it or leave it. And of course they say that that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be a Guitar Freaks game but that this basically means that there's not going to be a Guitar Freaks game I mean more or less. Then all the other games that were being shown off as well American Idol they're going to have a game that you can record your performances and burn it off to a DVD. That's crap. And then finally something that some people might actually care about BeatMania 2DX16 Empress was finally released in arcades and has a lot of fun stuff with that lots of new songs and hopefully a few that will actually make it over here someday some machines. And then lastly EA apparently is teaming up with Gamestop and it's an idea that they're throwing around right now they're offering people a season pass according to a survey that's been sent out they were throwing out the idea of having like an EA Sports season pass where someone would buy this for say a twenty dollar enrollment fee and what would it do is it would cut thirty three percent of the cost from all EA Sports games are purchased in that year. So if you bought the pass and you say you're a person that buys you know the Madden's NCAA football and all that stuff you would save you know thirty three percent off each game. Which I mean it's not a bad deal if you think about it because you're actually saving you know twenty bucks a game about. So if you buy a lot of games or if you even buy one game with this deal I mean it's worth it to do it because you actually break even with the first game and then you start saving money with the second game but once again they get you to buy more than one game so. This is the solution for a weakening economy I suppose get you get you hooked in early season pass deals I guess that's how it's going to go all right because see here's the other thing with the season pass is that you say for example you may have bought NBA 2K you know 10 or whatever next year well now say if you buy the season pass for like Madden or something like that and you're thinking about buying an NBA game you might be more likely to buy NBA Live 09 because now you're saving twenty bucks. True true interesting I guess we'll see how this plays out but I'm not much of a sports game fan so it's not like it's a deal I'm going to take but I know there are people out there that might just want to jump on the deal because the deal is a deal and if you are a person that buys these games is this isn't necessarily bad news and this isn't an enemy if you are a person to buy sports games think about it this way get with your friends one person buys that you know or chip in for the season pass and you just have one person buy all your games and there you go save a lot of money work the system but I don't know if this is actually going to happen but we'll see all right we will see what happens wow so it sounds like it was a pretty busy busy week last week yes and here I was spending my gaming time watching Netflix on the 360 and I watched a documentary about gay bars in Mississippi no kidding I'm telling you they have everything they have documentaries on everything on Netflix everything I started a documentary about Walmart I haven't finished it yet but it's a documentary about nothing but Walmart the high price of yeah yeah it's like an anti Walmart thing but you know I'm trying to watch it with an open mind I'm not a fan of Walmart in the first place and it really has nothing to do with this whole blob it's just I just think Walmart's kind of dirty that's my biggest problem maybe it's just the one here but yeah so I thought I'd check out the document documentaries on everything on Netflix everything all right well we were talking a little bit about Street Fighter 2 during our gaming week and it's interesting to kind of coincide with the Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix they're actually doing a lot of different promotional stuff you may remember with pinball effects they had a special table for it they have special themes out for Xbox your you know Xbox dashboard and I think there's some on the PlayStation Network as well well also coming to your favorite sack puppet game LittleBigPlanet is getting four Street Fighter 2 skins they're gonna have a Chung Li a guile looks like Zangief and Ryu and those are all gonna be available soon apparently it's actually been leaked out but they have the pictures online and I'd say that's pretty conclusive if you ask me but uh you know matter of time before these are released I could see maybe even next week so got me and I'm sure they're gonna be probably about like five bucks or something because they're usually about two bucks a skin yeah I don't know how I feel about paying for LittleBigPlanet skins I don't know it's just a little silly I just download all the free ones yeah I don't know the free ones to get the turkey stuck on your head no I forget to get that one I got the the Venus flytrap one those last one I remember they also have one that's a TV stuck on their head to be honest I haven't played a lot of LittleBigPlanet lately thanks to WorldWarCraft but I'm you know and just real life too I mean just this I was gone for the past four days I know I didn't talk a whole lot about this we didn't talk a lot about what was going on in our real lives this week but I've been gone for a few days I was in LA I know a lot of people kind of do different things for Thanksgiving and I hope everybody in the US had a good Thanksgiving and and even those that don't live in the US so they don't celebrate Thanksgiving and you know hope you've had a good time watching the antics that go on here on the day after Thanksgiving on Black Friday which is like Canada's Boxing Day but without any significance whatsoever it's a completely fabricated made up by the company's holiday and it's like speaking of Walmart and did you hear about the poor person that got trampled to death at Walmart like this is I price pay for going the wall nobody I talked to the high price for low prices nobody I talked to you're horrible nobody I talked to will admit to going out on Black Friday so who's buying stuff I didn't go out on Black Friday I went out to breakfast on Black Friday that's in and we had a hard time trying to find a place to park in the damn parking lot you know what it was a parking lot for Mervins you know what's big about Mervins they all went out of business like they're not even doing anything for Black Friday except further liquidations so I went to a theme park for Black Friday and I actually had a lot of freaking fun it was it was fairly empty and I got to ride some pretty awesome coasters those of you from SoCal X2 is awesome just wanted to get that out there anyhow sorry let's talk about more gaming news and you know I did dog on the soundtrack for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix but you know what hey the people at OC Remix do a lot of great remixes and although I didn't enjoy these remixes in the particular game I think these might be kind of fun to listen to outside of the game and if you want to you can download the remix soundtrack for free it's available right there at Overclocked Remix if you go over to ocremix.org you can download the soundtrack for free and you know what despite the hard time I gave this game earlier is very hard to complain about something that's free so props to all these folks who you know spent their time putting it together and don't get too mad at me because I I dogged it in the game earlier I do think it's a good thing they're putting it out there for free so thanks guys also speaking of Street Fighter 2 HD Remix if you live in Europe you have a little more time to think about whether you want to purchase it or not especially if you're a PlayStation owner no worries for you Xbox 360 folks but the game was delayed on PlayStation Network it was released in North America as scheduled the day before it came out on Xbox 360 European 360 owners hopefully got the game a little late I don't know if it actually ended up coming out at all hopefully somebody in chat can clarify it but it was delayed there in Europe just you know funny now that I think of it is you know before they were thinking I think they've got it by now just you know well I was just saying you know I was wondering why they were releasing the PlayStation 3 version a day before you know the Xbox 360 but now that we think about it that they don't have a demo for the PS3 version people don't know that it sucks and so you know that kind of goes back to your theory that that's why they kind of rushed the demo for it and maybe you know one extra day without the demo people can't try it and I don't think it's necessarily that Capcom thinks the game sucks because it's getting good reviews you know obviously I'm just missing something and you know I guess for the fighting fan diehard all the little tweaks they've done with the game and so on to balance and so on make it worth it for them which is fine keep in mind I am not a hardcore fighting game fan or if I ever confessed to be but I do enjoy the occasional fighter I I actually do enjoy the Mortal Kombat games I know that makes me weird but whatever Soul Calibur especially love Soul Calibur games are a lot of fun anyhow whatever sorry I'm getting off track that's right something else coming to the PlayStation Network which has been teased before I think by us Soldner X which was a PC game originally available I think mainly on like playasia.com I remember tons of advertisements for it pretty awesome looking HD you know classic shooter game and they do have it available it's gonna be coming apparently next week for $10 and it should be you know of course full HD you know 1080p two op or two player co-op support leaderboards and trophies support and it looks fantastic so that should be coming out I think actually that's this Thursdays when that's we'll be making out oh yep on the fourth for $10 so definitely worth checking it out especially if you're like a fan like you know grottiest or something like that really cool looking game I would love to check this game out but sing star Abba I mean I I just I'm not gonna have time you know I got dancing queen to sing to my heart's content personally I just haven't really been downloading anything on the PlayStation Network because they don't have those prepaid cards and you know I don't like buying my points I like trading in crap that I don't want for points and I thought they did now I thought they did all the cards now in certain stores I don't think GameStop has them yet which is kind of weird I mean it's like Walgreens has them but GameStop doesn't this kind of weird well let's talk about some releases around the world that are gonna be coming out in this next week and we'll start off with Japan and what's coming out there on December the 4th on the Xbox 360 fallout 3 gets its Japanese version this week so check that out Saints Row 2 also gets a Japanese release on December 4th so if you live in Japan I want to check out one of Loki's favorite games Saints Row 2 is where it's at on the 360 this is one of those rare cases of usually we we like to cover Japanese release dates because they get them before we do but here's a rare case of they're getting it after we do which is always kind of interesting on the PlayStation 3 Assassin's Creed is getting a price reduction but if you want some new games you can check out Pro Yaku Spirits 5 Kanziban is coming out as well as Saints Row 2 on the PlayStation 3 both on December 4th if you want to look at some other consoles like the Nintendo Wii you can get Wii Speak comes out on December 4th it's the standalone thing there Cooking Mama 2 Taehan Mamawa Oshio Gashi comes out from Taito Cooking Mama 2 in Japan on the Nintendo Wii and if you want to check this game out 428 is the name of the game 428 Fusa Sarita Shibuade comes out and that's an interactive graphic novel yeah it's like that looks kind of neat actually it's actually looks like a perfect score from Famitsu really yeah perfect 40 out of 40 yet you don't hear much about now here now here's a game that looks like it could work for a hardcore game oh it's got like live cutscenes mixed in it and stuff so it this isn't a game that they can really release here at all now without some major overhaul they have the reasoning yeah reshoot everything that's too bad because there's a game that might be something that us American we hardcore gamers are looking for and unfortunately I'll have to understand Japanese I guess hey PlayStation 2 Dragon Ball Z Infinite World comes out on December 4th on the PlayStation 2 yet another pachinko game it's volume 11 of pachislot koryuku series and yes it's another Evangelion PlayStation pachinko game Rio Road also comes out that's R-O-D-E Road Rio Road comes out in regular and limited edition flavors on the PlayStation 2 this week and it looks to be an adventure game but kind of with some role-playing elements coming out over there kind of almost looks like it has like a board like a cold step type game I don't know if that's like part of the setup of the game but kind of looks interesting let's check out the handholds real quick on the Nintendo DS blazer drive comes out this week as well as drawn to life comes out on the Nintendo DS some new pouches if you're a collector of the various hardware princess on ice also comes out and just it's kind of a busy week on the Nintendo DS another pachinko game there as well Hajime no Ippo the fighting comes out as well busy busy and as far as the PSP goes I don't think there's a whole lot oh no they got a big big game coming out this week in Japan on PSP one big release one big big game Loco Roco 2 comes out this week in Japan yeah that's a big big title there in Japan heading over to Europe since Dark Sakura's not here tonight to talk about the Europe release dates there really isn't a lot to mention just a few handful of titles here coming out this week in Europe Banjo Kazooie comes out and Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC that's really it Sing Star Classics also on PlayStation 2 if you're still collecting Sing Star titles oh there's a few more on the fifth I should say Animal Crossing let's go to the city comes out which is you know city folk I guess they don't like the word folk overseas no we heard we had a story about that a while ago I thought they were only calling it that new name in Australia did the title get adopted for the rest of Europe as well who cares I guess who cares Prince of Persia is the other big game you can only keep an eye out for on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and Nintendo DS all this next week in Europe and also if you're a Fire Emblem fan that's a big title coming out on the DS as well some Dragon Ball Z titles Dragon Ball Z Origins and lastly one PC title I want to get out there Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods those are your Europe early states this week filling in for Dark Soccer tonight all right US not a whole lot coming out this week but this is the biggest week of December that's pretty sad but this week we have Destroy Humans Path of the Fearon on Xbox 360 let's see Neopets Puzzle Adventure on PC DS and Wii I believe Mushroom Men Rise of the Fungi for DS Nancy Drew the White Wolf on the Wii Slingo Quest on the DS Mushroom and the Spore Wars on the Wii Prince of Persia you know can't forget that on PS3 and Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC my Fitness Coach on the Wii Tales of Despereaux on the PS2 Wii and DS the last game from Brash because they went under fun fun my Fun Facts Coach from Ubisoft Wordfish from Ubisoft both on the DS there Kingdom Hearts Chains of Memories on PlayStation 2 that's the remake of course and Sing Star Abba on PlayStation 2 and PS3 Vampire Story on PC kind of a fun little adventure game there and let's see here Ski and Shoot on the Wii Prince of Persia the Fallen King on DS and Animal Boxing on the DS I remember that Destiny game kind of a weird looking thing Family Party 30 great games that's from Game Factory and I think it's actually a port of a simple series game from the Japanese lineup Dreamer Puppy Trainer very cute little cover there King of Fighters Orochi Saga on the Wii a nice collection of fighting games and let's see here real quick Happy Cooking from DS you got another or Happy Cooking on the DS from Ubisoft Spray and that's kind of a weird little I think like a Zelda type game for the Wii some crappy French games Emma at the Farm and Emma in the Mountains I love your description that's just some crappy French they are really bad it's for little girls it's really bad and then Bigfoot Collision Course on the Wii and that is it for the first week of December and sadly that is like the most populated week of the month well it makes sense I think everybody blew their load in November because they wanted to make Black Friday so the rest of the month it's all kind of crap it's gonna it's gonna really slow down now until April I well we do have something because you know Street Fighter IV January and all that you would be surprised actually January and February are looking pretty decent especially February right now interesting I think some of the game companies have figured out hey no one releases games in February that would be a perfect place to put our games interesting Capcom for example they have a ton of stuff coming out in those two months there all right fair enough fair enough all right well hey you know if you're not looking to get new games you can still continue to supplement the ones you have from download content and in January Fallout 3 is going to be getting some new download content people look Fallout 3 is one of those games I probably won't have the time to check out and until January so this will be just in time for that but there's a def excuse me definitely people out there that love their Fallout 3 I don't know if Loki's one of them or not I haven't gotten the plate yet I know it's just so much so much we're doing right now but hey there's gonna be some more download content coming to the 360 and the PC versions right now nothing said about the PlayStation 3 but I can't imagine it won't come within time these expansions are plotted for January Operation Anchorage which is like where you go into like a military simulation and you actually get to save Anchorage Alaska from Chinese communist invaders no not Sarah Palin I guess it's in the Fallout story the pit you get to go to a raider town called the pit which is outside of Pittsburgh get it the pit ha that's coming out in February and then broken steel is coming out in March at least it's not we get to join the Brotherhood of Steel and forget it I how can I follow a 90210 joke fable 2 is getting some download content as well they just announced the brand new island that they're adding called not whole island and it's gonna feature a bunch of cool stuff they're gonna have three unique quests and three unique dungeons you can unravel the mystical secrets of the resurrection shrine plus they're gonna have some new outfits like an armored knight outfit an assassin a barbarian leather-clad biker the hell and six new weapons a dozen of unique potions that I guess will drastically alter your appearance new weapon customization I guess I have new augments and 30 or 50 additional leaderboards and along with that they're gonna have actually some free download content as well in case you don't want to buy it and of course that not whole pack is gonna be 800 Microsoft points can I just say though that not whole is a terrible name because it makes me think of a very naughty place because not whole sounds too much like balloon not you know what I mean like it's that's a really bad bad name for an expansion back not whole island with the biker outfit yeah I'm just saying yo you thought Animal Crossing was gay I'm just saying yes and apparently I guess the free download pack they're gonna have is some stuff I guess teasing from the main download thing they're gonna have knights boots assassins gloves a special weight loss potion and a collectible silver book and you'll also want to download that in case you don't want to buy this content so you can play co-op with people that do and that might be good too there's a rumor now that fable 2 will be hitting PCs sometime soon apparently an inside source claims that they've heard some information I guess from someone at lion head that fable 2 would be coming to PCs on February 15th I don't see why they wouldn't release it on PC they did with the original fable and it was after the Xbox version came out so it makes sense why not if they're trying to make games for windows more and more popular why not exactly makes sense it does make sense well hey Loki since you're you know a really big fan of Animal Crossing I bet you're a big fan of C-man and C-man is going to be getting a type of release on the iPhone apparently all right it's not the actual C-man game which yeah you remember C-man 2 we were talking about that a while ago you know that whole game where you actually raise your own it just has a funny name because we're what four years old it's a game called Gabo and it's actually a reworked version of C-man 2 apparently this is all coming from Yoot Saito's blog and he's the guy who he invented C-man if you can believe it and apparently I guess it's still like a like a year away it's a it's a ways off for this game but they have actually a little demo on the blog that you can look at which is kind of interesting so if you're a if you're a big fan of this series which you know the series did have its fans despite our whole little five-year-old joking and it's just interesting to see the iPhone kind of get more and more and more games you know there there was some rumor out there that the iPhone has crossed like 10,000 different apps I think that's a little high but there's definitely a lot of stuff available on the iPhone now there's always room for C-men on an iPhone exactly anyways there was a rumor that I may have talked about a few weeks ago I don't remember or do I about the new 360s will be coming out actually shipping now apparently with onboard memory that's right the new arcade systems are supposedly shipping with the new Jasper chipset which is a promises I guess a cooler 65 nanometer GPU on the motherboard and they have expanded the onboard flash to 256 megabytes which would be enough for you know storing the new next box or next Xbox experience so I guess going forwards of course going to be pre-loaded on all the different systems you can also use that space for game saves or whatever else you want to use it for it's just like an extra you know 200 megs of space which is kind of cool and apparently I think the arcade system still will be coming with an external 256 megabyte memory card so they're kind of doubling the onboard space with that which is kind of and new is always good but you've known this for a while now haven't you maybe I don't know just say you tell me I'm just saying all right anyhow let's move on to some other news and close out this statement here pretty soon professor Layton professor Layton you know the old popular DS game well what's interesting about this apparently professor Layton has been scheduled to be released as a movie yes that's right professor Layton the first movie is going to be coming out in January of 2010 in Japan so there you go and if you don't know this series Studio Ghibli definitely kind of influenced these games so it's probably not much of a surprise they didn't make the game they just influenced the games it's not a big surprise that these this is going to be made into a movie eventually but you'll have to get a sub or something if you want to watch it here in the US or just pray that it'll come out here eventually I don't know yeah I mean they've had with like at least three or four different releases in that series in Japan it's just we haven't seen them all over here yet so it makes sense and they're insanely popular over there heck I mean they made an Animal Crossing movie over there too remember just to answer game grew's thing in chat is Studio Ghibli making it no they are not I was just saying that the games are Studio Ghibli-esque that's it just a just a comparison don't want to alarm anybody that's all don't be alarmed that's right do not be alarmed okay all right um let's see we're going to get into now the classic game of the week and it's a little different tonight because Dark Soccer is not here tonight but we can't let this segment die when she's not here either Loki or I will steal the segment and that's exactly what's going to happen tonight so in the absence of Dark Soccer I will be taking over tonight because it's been a little while since Loki or I have gotten to steal this segment and I believe Loki had the last one a while ago now so now it's my turn tonight to pick a classic game of the week that I think you all ought to be playing and I'm going to really dig deep tonight because I've been promising for quite some time that if I ever get to do another classic video game of the week I would pick something from the Commodore 64 this is exactly what I've picked tonight is a game from my childhood that I remember from a long time ago it's a game called Lazy Jones is tonight's classic game of the week now the interesting thing about Lazy Jones is that it was like it was a game that was kind of made up of all these other smaller games that kind of came together in this big entity it was like it was like WarioWare back before there was WarioWare if this makes any sense at all and like yeah we're looking at a video of this game in progress here on here in the studio and you can see like this mini game you are stabbing turkeys coming off a conveyor belt with a giant fork and you have to avoid stabbing the telephone that's randomly bouncing around the screen it was just so awesomely random but anyway look Lazy Jones was originally I believe actually made for the MSX it actually was ported to MSX Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum and the Einstein system it was a game written by David Whittaker the Spectrum version was just a port though basically Lazy Jones is made up of 15 smaller games and you're in this giant hotel and you basically walk around here trying to avoid some of the monsters in the hotel while you sneak into these rooms and play different video games the video games are somewhat inspired by other games there are definitely games that are like Frogger like Space Invader in here but there's also some games that have funny names like there's a game in here called 99 Red Balloons this is a game where you just have red balloons that continually go up towards the top of the screen you try to get a hold of a couple of the balloons and you're able to do that then you can get up to the top and give a woman a big kiss and then you get a balloon to go back down where you go up and down by grabbing these different balloons and none of these games go on a particularly long time you just play the game for about a minute until the clock runs out and your score basically transfers to the larger score that you have so this game is really wacky and just kind of takes us back to a time when you know really really was only one person that made games but the other thing that kind of made Lazy Jones special at least to me was the fact that it had a really unique soundtrack and I know you can kind of hear it in the background this is definitely kind of its own little thing actually I want to play for you one clip in particular from the game Lazy Jones by David Whittaker and I want to see if it sounds familiar to you at all here's a clip from the game now that's a clip from the Lazy Jones game that came out years ago did that sound familiar to anybody at all yeah it actually was sampled years later in 1999 by a band it was actually sampled by the group Zombie Nation current craft 400 oh yeah it's the same song so kind of funny because the game was you know originally made with the C64 sound chip in it and it's that kind of unique noise that is still used today so there you go so back to the clip here a little bit you know I think one reason I just really remember this game was you know like I say it was really awesome to have one video game with all these mini games in it and you could just kept trying to really increase your score in the mini games because some of them were really hard because some of them would end like just once you've died and once you would be done with it so you I find it was really trying to push myself to get higher scores in the game by getting higher scores than other little mini games it was pretty awesome so you know again and it's kind of cool I see a lot of people lighting up in chat like oh that's kind of a random fact that it went inspired this song like 15 years later after the game first came out what maybe like 14 years later when did this game come out I think 84 I want to say yeah 84 is in this game first came out by the way this game did not get that great reviews when it came out it's it's definitely a game I'm picking for nostalgia purposes so there you go that's my classic video game of the week lazy Jones oh yeah here's the random there's two random door because only 15 minigames will like 18 doors there's random things you'll walk into as well like there's a broom closet that you'll randomly walk into and then a potty and you watch your guy go to the bathroom not like it's not explicitly or gross but he just like walks in there and flush and then walks out it's so random but there it is lazy Jones for the Commodore 64 my classic game of the week and stowing away on a dark soccer's classic game of the week segment she'll be back next week with her own pick all right that's gonna do it for part a of orange lounge radio tonight and when we come back we'll have plenty more in part B we're gonna talk about the Nintendo Wii a little bit and some of the top-secret things going on with a Wii talk a little chrono trigger and talk some PC games which we don't talk about enough and we'll also open up the mailbag all when we come back with more of orange lounge radio and we're back here on orange lounge radio on this lovely Sunday evening November the 30th of 2008 one more month left in the year if you can believe it tomorrow be in the 1st of December and then 2009 will be here before you know it which will hopefully be a much better year than 2008 in my opinion yeah I'm not just talking about games I'm talking about personally and all that stuff as well so anyhow we have plenty more game news to cover in this segment then we want to get to your calls on the skype line at 1 877 game olr we'll get to that in a little while but first we have some more gaming news Loki start us off just looking me here tonight by the way Dark Sakura has a night off yes there is a new mystery title being worked on by monster games apparently there was some speculation apparently of what they're gonna be working on and it's no surprise the monster games works on basically racing titles and the last racing title they worked on was excite truck here so far excite truck too because I really awesome however though you know I believe because Nintendo would not be so kind as to release an excite truck to so soon is probably going to be at zero would be my guess who is not necessarily bad excite truck was awesome I even think about that so you keep that kind of you know awesome control you know what I don't mind if they release an excite truck too because I would be there lined up at midnight already the game that game was awesome I truck absolutely most favorite game of the week ever I do think f0 has got to come out sooner rather than later I'm even though the AXGX thing I guess must have disappointed some folks I love f0 gx that's an amazing game I I really hope as game grew says chat f0 wx be awesome or as a deaf says in chat chat at orange dot com dot com excite truck to excite yourself I think it's a trick to be harder don't even need to know this is one of those games that I would hope that they don't go back and try to tweak too much of it just add a lot more tracks add the ability to download new tracks later on maybe four player you know split-screen multiplayer or four-player you know multiplayer over the we Wi-Fi service just stuff like that it's really simple stuff they don't really need to go too crazy with it maybe improve the graphics hey good on f0 you could have up to 30 people in a race on the GX I don't know if they could do that online that would be pretty awesome that would be pretty cool long as you can't cheat like you know Mario Kart everybody cheats well I would have a feeling they probably would be able to cheat somehow but yeah gs68 says it perfectly in chat f0 we needs to not have exploits dammit f0 X has wall raping f0 GX has space flying and snaking and so on so hopefully yeah hopefully it's whatever it is it's probably gonna be awesome because like I said excite truck was awesome f0 be really cool I'm hoping for another excite trucker f0 game if it's something new great you know news always you know optimistically good I guess all right well this maybe this will be something they announce at e3 maybe that's why they have a big secret and then they have been working on for two years now so that's true because what have you seen since excite truck that's why you haven't seen excite truck too and do you think it would take them two years to make a psych truck to I'm hoping it is that's maybe if they're gonna make it super awesome maybe do you think it might be randomly a non racing game or do you think no I don't think this company only makes racing games all right that's good because you know what they know how to make a good racing game so I'm optimistic all right I hope it pays off well hey um you know what's interesting you know Capcom has been porting a lot of their titles to different systems lately like you know you see super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix ps3 and Xbox 360 bionic commando rearmed Xbox 360 PlayStation Network Street Fighter 4 you know Resident Evil 5 these games are all coming out to the two big systems but they will not come out on the Wii yet people seem to be demanding it which is kind of interesting well um Capcom has actually kind of put out a statement about why these games are not coming out on the Wii quote part of the reason HD remix and bionic commando rearmed or digital is because we don't believe that the right content for the retail channel the economics will be highly unfavorable as compared to their digital counterparts counterparts and we wear we're finding only works for titles built from the ground up for we wear as the lead skew given the file size restrictions Street Fighter 2 couldn't ever be we wear even at 480p the file size is just too large given the storage restrictions for we wear theoretically it could be discs based but there are no plans at the moment here you go and the beyonds mean how good-looking would it really be if you took like an HD title and downscaled at the 480p it's just not even worth redoing especially when you consider that isn't Super Street Fighter 2 already available I mean granted it's not turbo but whatever close enough like already available in the god what I've even forgot what it's called virtual console yes and also in Japan you remember next week we get Street Fighter versus was it Tatsunoko whatever oh yeah Capcom versus yeah see that's what you need to be playing on there they port that over and do something with it you know that'd be pretty awesome all right well there you go moving on to stuff going on on the DS hey chrono trigger is coming out on the DS here it just came out this week I don't know I don't know anybody personally that picked it up I I'm curious I haven't got I haven't played I did enjoy chrono trigger but I stopped to finish file has he for on the DS I got a lot of DS playing to do well on in Europe of course they got screwed and they don't have the game yet apparently though it is coming out in February that's what some sources have told Eurogamer is that the game is supposed to be making its way out there in February this of course the new chrono trigger DS version with the new dungeon the new ending to screen display touchscreen controls Wi-Fi multiplayer and so on and so on I don't get why it takes longer I don't get it it's it's already localized so what's the delay for the only thing I can think of is this time of year as far as duplication goes a lot of the plants that duplicate games are at full capacity right now and if they're thinking that they're not going to be able to duplicate this game enough to have adequate supplies for Europe and North America or whatever other territories they're trying to cover that might be why there's a delay for Europe that because Nintendo and every other game company hates Europe for some reason I don't know why let me go back actually to the last story because we have a little bit of a delay between when we say things when our term comments on it because of the you know internet encoding and everything but I want to get this comment from chat because I think it's a good chat at orange on twitter.com VX Jason XV says the only people clamoring for Street Fighter HD remix on the Wii are the 13 14 15 year olds who don't have the money for their own systems and only have the family Wii and won't be getting the 360 or ps3 is a gift or anything hmm good point and get a job I don't know go out and get a job just wait seriously I mean if you if there's anything you'll be learned from this whole Street Fighter you know turbo HD remix thing is it pays to wait because if you bought the original Super Street Fighter 2 turbo or whatever on Xbox Live Arcade now there's a new one that's coming out that's better it's like crap I just wasted money on that remember if you wait you know for things to get ironed out there will be a version that will be coming to the Wii I'm sure just have to be patient that is a nation now I'll get a job something else that might be coming to the Wii and once again this kind of goes back to the chrome trigger thing hours and why they couldn't just bring it over the localizations done already disaster day of crisis maybe coming to North America apparently one person was emailing Nintendo customer support I guess regarding whether they would have a chance to actually play this game in North America and the response back was hello I am pleased to report that disaster day of crisis has been announced for North America but no release date yet and then they you know for future reference go to our website I mean I don't see why they wouldn't because it's a Nintendo game it takes no effort on their part to bring it over here I mean all the works done already at the same time though what if the dude was wrong you know I think that people a lot of people are putting a lot of stock in what this you know rep says what if they made a mistake well if they made a mistake then yeah I could see but my point is it's done it's already been released in Europe so it's translated already they've got it done it's just it bring it over if it's in English already you can bring it over here I'll see what the big while you're at it how about mother three right am i right translation hasn't been done over there I have with uh there's a duty it's better it's coming out right well there's the fan fan done one yes but there's not an actual cart release because if there was a car release it wouldn't matter because people will be importing that bitch like crazy it's just this is already done I mean it's just I don't know why they wouldn't bring it over here other than maybe it didn't perform that well and I don't see why they wouldn't I mean come on it's better than we music didn't mother three come out in the UK no I thought it did no why did I think if it did everyone wouldn't be bitching because they would be importing it all right I'm just crazy there's yeah because there wouldn't be an issue with why would even have to do a fan translation then because it's already done for them there would be no more bitching all right well um apparently we and we fit have been a big cause of part of the Black Friday chaos on the most popular products out there on Black Friday this year and of course if you've never heard of this you probably don't live in the US Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where people go fucking nuts over sales just in time for Christmas is basically Canada's Boxing Day without any any sort of a fit it's all a consumer holiday specifically whereas I think there's actually some reason for it in Canada but here no it's just it's all it was all made up by the stores number one most popular product on Black Friday was the Nintendo Wii console there you go big surprise number five we fit was the number five biggest product on Black Friday not surprised a I'm not surprised you know people play it for a while they'll be all excited about it and then they'll put it away but I bet it's a bunch of parent parents also buying it for their fat kids right I don't know about that fat kids won't play that exercise game vxj snacks V says I thought Boxing Day was December 26 yes it is instead of the day of Thanksgiving they have the day after Christmas but same same idea it's chaos at the stores but I don't I don't hear about Canadian massacre at Walmart on Boxing Day either so just you know Canadians are smart not to shop at Walmart exactly well not just that they're I'm assuming you know a little more civil because they didn't trample each other yeah sorry apparently there's some news that rate or rare may do a new killer instincts game you know how fucking often does this rumor come up what now what now is provoked the new killer instinct of the week rumor well basically this is coming from you know there's studio manager Matt better edge and he says a killer instinct is an IP that is finally remembered and we may do something with it but it's a tricky market to be like the old killer instinct so basically we would have to blow it out your ass just tell us already is there or is there not gonna be a game quit cock teasing us are you gonna do it or not look rare are you listening is somebody from rare listening to the show knock it off stop playing with my emotions just tell us already is the game coming out or just say no it's not happening stop getting your damn hopes up go away be honest stop with that awesome so I don't really care if it comes out and to be honest I don't really care about most things that rare puts out so no I gotta say it is pretty awesome I I love me some killer instinct I really do this white is you god it just doesn't I don't care kid vs. final come on this game was awesome well they would have to put a lot of work into it and as long as they throw in cameo as an unlockable character savvy weird and you could brutally murder her and that'd be funny all right anyhow um why why our chat says I'm from rare our official announcement is that there will be an official announcement made in an undisclosed time in our own heads there you go anyhow I am so angsty every time I hear this rumor about a freaking new killer instinct game because seems like every other week there's some cryptic goddamn quote coming out of somebody's mouth from rare that cock teases a new killer instinct game and I'm getting the more angsty the more and more time that goes by they won't announce something already so you know what this means look you can start us off tonight Stark soccer is not here F you to popcap games I was busy transferring all my saves and all my information from my old 20 gig hard drive to my new 120 gig hard drive for my xbox 360 because I bought the hard drive used I do not have a transfer cable that can facilitate just transferring everything in all one foul swoop so I've actually used memory cards and can you guess what two saves would not fucking transfer on their Zula and bejeweled to both popcap games and why the fuck will they not transfer over all the other games for all the other systems including some of the popcap games transfer just fine but for some reason but jeweled to and Zuma have to be which happened to be the two the wife has to have exactly and so and they will not transfer I put something on their Twitter you know saying hey what the fuck you know why is this not working they're like well we're looking into it which means blah blah blah complaint go away hold on now now I know now you know despite this whole thing the yelling at rare I know there are actually people from popcap games that do listen to this fair program catch the bitch that patches so they will move well maybe this is the first time they're finding out about it this is a that's an odd error I mean that's not something that I think you could have foresight into either that's just an that's a an error out of the blue yeah and that sounds like Microsoft's involved somehow too but well no it is strange that it is just those two games no I mean limitation is that you can only transfer files to a memory card with the same profile so for example I had to have a profile signed in on the one console with the old hard drive and logged in as being that had another console logged in as me as well I just you know copy of the profile and I had to transfer you know from the one profile to the memory card back to my profile on the other system and it will allow you do that won't allow you like say transfer from a different profile or something like that because you can't do that but those are the only two games that we just would not let me transfer them at all you know what else would not let me transfer it hexa HD would not let me transfer that game to the other hard drive and see that's one of Microsoft's own games so you think there's there's something on a deeper level going on here it's I think you have misdirected anger well that they won't even let me redownload that's stupid so not that I really play that game but it's still come on man all right so like if I deleted that game somehow by accident then that would never be able to get it back all right my F use of the week I don't really have a lot I want to say I'm F you to F you to alcohol for being so nummy because I have my first little sip of alcohol in like seven months the other day I had I said I would have a glass of wine on Thanksgiving and I had a pinot noir Thanksgiving evening and it's I was literally buzzed after one glass of wine because my tolerance has dropped that much from not drinking so remember kids don't drink and drive drink responsibly blah blah blah but I missed wine I really did then I had a Guinness the next night there you go that's it for the F use of the week tonight very short because there's only two of us here yes well it's kind of interesting they were coming off of the F use of the week to this but there's a brand new website called bad hacks

alright whatever look let's talk about PC look if it's gonna be a slow news week then why don't we talk about some things we don't normally talk about here on the show that's PC gaming news alright you know the game fear this is a pretty popular game that came out and there actually was console as well as a PC but I think it was pretty well known for the PC fear to project origin is the sequel to this game it's apparently being banned in Australia was just recently refused classification by the Australians classifications board don't they ban nowadays due to high violence apparently Warner's trying to kind of assess the situation and they are right now appealing with the ACB and trying to figure out their options I'm trying to get fear to released in Australia was supposed to be coming out February 11th in Australia and they're hoping they can turn that around but you might have to like import an underground copy of this game if you want to play this over in Australia just by the ps3 version region free there well it's also PC is region free to write exactly are you alright let's get to the mailbag guy it's the part of the show every week or we like to take some time to interact with you guys you guys send us emails at mailbag orange laundry calm and we take some time to read our favorites here on the air I'm opening up the mailbag right now and I hate it when we get freaking spam email did somebody sign us up for spam email this is like a hahaha thing jerks now I think spiders signed us up for spam email it sucks don't we disguise our emails on the side I don't remember yeah but they still find a way ah yyr sent us an email wants to know please tell us what the meaning of life is thanks Loki what is the meaning of life to live you can make the easy 42 joke here or I could give you like a serious deep in answer but this is a show about dick and fart jokes I don't know if it would fit in here I'll let me put it this way the meaning of life is to have impact on others that's what I believe meaning there was a good quote and I hate to say this from kung fu Panda and oh great all right no it's actually it was actually pretty good it was they were talking about was it the past is history the future is a mystery and the and the present is a gift because it's the present wow that's way too deep for this program all right moving on we have another email from Katakos also sometimes goes by Reese Lord Katakos wants to say congratulations on episode 300 even though it's not over 9000 but yeah you guys and girls just keep on going so you can get to 9001 to be a prodigy right now we're at 50% but that's halfway there PS Rob you need to get a hundred percent healed come to the server Illidan and I'll use healing wave on you and you'll be good to go just a general note to wow players out there I'm not changing servers I mean I don't mean to be rude but I have a guild of real-life friends where I'm at on Raven Crest as much as the community calls that server Raven fail because we have no progression whatsoever on our server it's pretty sad when our social guild is like one of the top 10 horde raiding guilds on the entire server and we kind of sleep our way through I don't mean like literally but you know we just we don't you know we we're very casual in our approach it's not say we don't work out we're very casual in our approach and we've managed to clear quite a bit of stuff as a guild these are most of the death cake people you remember a fantasy 11 yes I remember I was gonna say that we have over 9,000 minutes worth of programming so there you go that's true that's true that's a good way to look at it if you can't yeah I don't if you count up like all the to-go podcasts and all that stuff when we were doing like almost five hours a night for a little while remember that we yeah do a three and a half hour show than an hour long podcast oh my god those are the days right well anyway how was an email there from I'm not sure what the point was but hey whatever we have an email from Fabrice in Belgium wants to say hello and I hope there's a show tonight and this was written last week when there was no show so I want to apologize to Fabrice from Belgium I'm sorry he says anyways he puts that in quotes anyways like Loki style I'm planning on buying a pinball machine in the future as I understand the best pinball machines are arguably the Adams family and Terminator 2 but I'm a big fan of Sega this will probably be a question for dark soccer which is the best Sega pinball machine she's not here tonight but if she were I bet you anything she would say World Cup 98 because I I'm almost positive that was a Sega table and that's like her favorite machine of all time so I'm I'm I'm 99% certain that would be her answer I know they're not the best machines by far but I'm too big of a Sega fan to let this pass by is Independence Day any good I'll probably have a chance to buy that one I do not know much about that table you're right dark soccer be the expert that one did you remember that being good no did Sega do the Jurassic Park one I like that one I don't remember they did that I was gonna say they should have a sonic spinball table wouldn't it be awesome that would be kind of awesome with a blue pinball well they're cute I don't know um you know I'm and and thanks to Fabrice I'm sorry the real pinball expert isn't here tonight to answer the question I'll have to ask her for next week boy boy you just struck out on first we didn't do a show the night you were gonna stay up and listen and I really apologize for that and then the night you have your question read on air dark soccer is not even here to answer it did take a do Jurassic Park that was that was a fun I don't remember we'll have to ask her next week hopefully I remember let's go to another email it's from Dan shadow hey guys survived the gaming season what surprised you the most personally left for dead blew me away I'm gonna be up in the area next weekend which I believe is this weekend whoops maybe we can meet up I'd like to meet you all oops well hopefully he comes back because apparently he didn't make it out tonight because we were off last week and didn't even ever get to our emails are bad here's our last email tonight from cheeseburger hey well I want to buy my dad a PlayStation 3 for Christmas that's pretty ambitious we just got a 52 inch plasma LCD TV and all we have is crappy cable where do you guys and girls think is the best place to buy it all I want is the blu-ray player and don't intend on playing any games websites are ok options too as long as I can use my unverified PayPal account whoo in that case you might just want to go for a used PlayStation 3 from my eBay why not well if you're buying it online yeah or even just like a retail store probably online you get a little bit of a discount because you're if you're buying news or something and it might actually work out a little better well if you're trying to buy a 20 or 60 you're probably gonna have to pay more than you know $500 for it but you know keep an eye out for the Christmas ads and stuff because I know ps3 systems are moving pretty good but not as fast or not selling out right away and stuff and you might get some good deals hopefully well too bad you weren't really you know stalking amazon.com because they had that $1.99 deal for a while there with the limited supply ring get a ps3 a little big planet in a movie something else to keep in mind too is that you know how I said the Black Friday is like a totally corporate invented holiday that they had they also have now the online retail community is inventing their own holiday in response and it's called Cyber Monday and it's tomorrow so tomorrow would be a good day to kind of check your big retailer websites to look for big deals and the reason why they wait until Monday is because a lot of people do their online shopping at work and Monday's the first day back to work for most people including myself so you're gonna see a lot of good deals on Cyber Monday online if that's where you're looking to buy things so I keep an eye out keep it out and don't be afraid to use sites like frugal you know Google's shopping site to look for good deals you know ps3 is a ps3 is ps3 cheap-ass gamer anyone so that well that's a good site too especially with like games you know yeah so keep an eye out there you go it's funny I was looking in chat they're talking about commander keen they actually have ported a clone of commander keen for the weeds in their homebrew community now you can download a commander keen for the Wii that's kind of neat I got one more email from Rob with two B's about the Wii and says this one's for Matt I recently upgraded my Wii firmware guess what my SD card was completely wiped clean this is a shame because I don't have a homebrew channel or anything on it did you hear of anything similar I had painstakingly backed up my game channel so that I wouldn't need to download them again some I deleted from my Wii memory because the incredible daunting size of we wear grr argh well here's the thing I didn't update my system at all because I don't connect to their you know internet for I don't connect to the store because to be honest I don't buy anything on there and there's nothing I need to download and if I wanted to download I'm not buying it but I don't really pirate virtual console games because I don't have time to play any of them so there's no point for me to do that so the only update I did was the update that came with Animal Crossing and I think the update was only for the we speak stuff so you know unless I get a we speak microphone I'll need to update it for the we speak channel which I probably still wouldn't do because I wouldn't use that so no I haven't updated it yet although if you are if you have updated it I believe there is a new Twilight hack out now for the 3.4 firmware and you can download that and redo all your stuff if you need it it sounds to me though that Rob is not into this whole hacking homebrew thing at all like me like I just I'm just not into it because I don't yeah I don't have time you know so why did he does his SD card get picked on well I don't know why it wiped your SD card unless you had modified saves on there or something but you know unless they're trying to get you to update it I don't understand why they would want you to re-download everything that doesn't make any sense but yeah Nintendo sucks what it what's it the Twilight hack is what they call it now yeah see now I'm gonna think it's about vampires that sparkle well I'm with Rob D in chat does it come with a hotmail vampire I don't even play far enough to use finally princess but yeah the new Twilight hack is out and they're saying that even if that gets fixed there's team twizers or tweezers or whatever they're called so there's other games that they've already figured out exploits to that you know can be used instead of Twilight Princess so this by all means is not an end all right well that's gonna do it for tonight's mailbag if you want to send us an email dark soccer will hopefully be back next week to read your emails mailbag orange launch radio.com all right other fun stuff that's going to be going on here well this isn't really fun but fun calm the company behind you know such wonderful games like the age of Conan well they've had to cut staff apparently you know hard times have been had and last Tuesday they actually had to caught a bunch of their staff which is interesting but I know a lot of the companies have been hit hard especially with the economy and stuff and fun calm said that they have actually cut 70% of their staff yikes well plus just age of Conan I don't think lived up to expectations I think there were a lot of people that bought that played the one-month trial and didn't stay with it yeah I could see that bummer I was going to check out the game but just kind of never got around to it no now it seems to be going the way of tabula rasa which is kind of sad to it there's a lot of MMOs out there and Warcraft is kind of owning a lot of them in the face only very few are able to hold their own against it I'll tell you what though if you like God of War and you own a 360 we'll have never an opportunity to play God of War on the 360 you should check out Conan their actual Conan game that they released because it is such a blatant ripoff of God of War it's not even funny but there's boobies and lots of blood and that's all you really need all right that's all you need hey PC games really old PC games but really classic PC games Starcraft is over 10 years old and just got patched this past week to patch one point one six came out for Starcraft on some of the big changes they made in the game I mean these are this is still a pretty major patch now in-game chat will actually save in the replays so you can relive every f you it's cool the actual match that's pretty cool also this is pretty important Starcraft will now only use as much central processing power as it needs to run smoothly because obviously in the past 10 years there's been a lot of upgrades and changes to our computers Starcraft no lead no longer needs to hog all your memory so it'll only use as much as it needs there's some other tiny little exploits too it does some little exploits with the zerg race especially that were fixed but that's that's that's great the blizzard is still patching this game 10 years later and we have somebody chat VX takes me is like I've been waiting for that and Korea rejoices there you go but this is you know what's neat about that is going to make a lot of people go back and relook at Starcraft you know it's it's a great it's just like the burnout paradise thing is a great way to keep your game alive even after maybe it's some kind of being being cut out yeah well there's some interesting stuff coming out of course some more download content for rock band and you know the weekly stuff this week actually have a new free track that you can download which is the track headphones on by Miranda Cosgrove that's going to be released alongside a bunch of other songs including children the are you dead yet by the children of bottom looks like a Finley with Toto II possible and these are all European bands by the way and then this is kind of weird naked brothers band they've got a body I occupy and I don't want to go to school I guess crossing over to the Nickelodeon crowd there platter oh why to with hey poco rock and roll squeeze with tempted Tokyo hotel with ready set go that's pretty cool and all American rejects with real world and it should be noted that all these are for 80 Microsoft points usual 160 and they're only on sale I believe for the month of December so after that they will go back up to their normal price but sales everywhere for the holiday season we have a lot of sales actually on the PlayStation Network is a bunch of tiles are half off you know I do I do I didn't even talk about my gaming we've got to play echo chrome my friend has a game echo chrome what what a strange little puzzle game it's kind of fun but I don't know it's I I think it's now the right price five dollars but I notice I have all these like user-created levels and things it's a pretty chill game is a good way to put it to chill chill out game I was another thing I played this week while I was waiting for my family to get done eating Thanksgiving stuff I was playing flow remember that game oh yeah yeah yeah I went back and played a little bit of that because now he's like what's that it's a lot of relaxing music there I'm like yeah it's this game flow you move the controller around she's like I don't want to have to move the controller around like that like too bad then in other news apparently obsessive gamers are not necessarily addicted to games apparently 90% of hardcore gamers do not have a legitimate addiction problem this is coming from a brand new survey mainly focused on I think some of the Wow players and stuff of course there's all sorts of disorders out there but you know some people just take their hobbies a little bit more seriously than others but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't stop although sometimes I think I can't stop so maybe I have a problem or not I'm not playing well so that's already saying something hey wait a minute we try to say but J but every time I power on the Xbox there you are in Saints Row table I'm gonna play that until I'm done with it and then once I'm done with it then whatever you'll move on to something else yeah well you know I'm so sad dark soccer isn't here because I purposely planned this story to come after the story about addicts and it's obsessive gamers and she's not even here to make fun I'm a little sad but you guys can fill in for her three new downloadable scenario expansions have been announced for Final Fantasy 11 yes Shane gonna go back well you know what's interesting about these expansions is that that they're not there's no new classes there's no new you know there's not a lot of big things that are expanded here their story expansions they're only gonna be downloadable through the play online viewer and they are all supposed to come out in spring 2009 I'm sorry I take that back the first one is supposed to come out in spring 2009 with the other two following the first one is called called a crystalline prophecy ode of life bestowing apparently it's where a giant crystal appears in the skies above Juno and it makes all these unexplained things happen and so on and so on the other scenarios that are gonna happen a moogle kupodata kudata get basically kupodata evil and small doses which sounds like it's gonna center all around the moogles which I'm sure will be extremely popular and then the third will be called a shantoto ascension the legend torn her empire born is the third one coming out you know all things considered despite the crap I've given this game ever since I've quit when you consider how long this game has been out now because when did we start playing this game 2003 I think a while and it was out in Japan a year before that I mean this game has been going for quite a while the US October 28 2003 in fact I kind of wish they would update it you know what I mean like I wish they'd kind of overhaul the engine to make it kind of you know newer gen graphics and all that stuff make it I don't think they release a new file fancy online game do you would you go back you think I don't know oh I fixed it that's that's the first effort well you know I hear this whole level sync thing really helped like you know you know that whole thing where basically if you're a level 75 you can downgrade yourself in level and all your gear will scale so that you can level up with your level 40 friend who can't find a party because he's level 40 yeah and level with them and you both gain experience see that'd be nice that's that and I'm like oh my god that's what that game needed three fucking years ago level down to like level one just grind down there hell yeah I know exactly it'd be awesome so I got that's too hard to go over there I'm just gonna keep hacking up bunnies interesting comments from chat as well with the whole attic thing ospher and chat says I throw gamers and while players in two different categories I'm already starting to get a little offended here ospher says like I have a friend whose behavior completely transforms when he plays well bye-bye social interaction otherwise he's just fine when playing other games no he is kind of a social game though you know in a way I mean I you real life there's an old saying though you know amongst people who know better real life greater than Wow so you know I don't I don't put Wow first before realized commitment Final Fantasy online just felt really different it was like kind of it was it was cool because like when I first started it was like oh my god you know you think when you first get to the first force and stuff it's so big and then you you're like oh there's planes beyond that's like holy crap it's actually discovering like the world stuff and then you go through all of it and it's like yeah like the first time you board an airship you're like this is so fucking epic and you know just all this of the I will never forget the first time getting on a ship in Final Fantasy 11 and then pirates fucking attacked the ship and I was like oh my god this is so scary and I was like I had to like having to run into the basement of the ship and lock yourself in there well jaywalking yeah while the higher level characters were taking out the things but I thought that was so amazing how like you would basically be forced to work together with the other players to take out the threat or you're all die basically neat or you have to lock yourself in the basement like a scared little kid like I did of course and I do some of those area effect spells and it might still hit you anyway that's right swipe back into the corner and cry curl into slash fetal all right gosh that's gonna do it believe it or not for tonight's gaming news it was a little bit of a slow news week this week but hey that just leaves us some time to get to your call so one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio while we wait for some calls any last-minute things you want to talk about Loki um maybe well you can think about it cuz we got a call coming in hello you're on orange launch radio who's this oh it's spazinator spazinator what's on your mind dude um this may be kind of a downer for the show but I'm not camera with sound right here and I could use a little help from the all games radio you know audience at large specifically any watchers that may be in the puffle area what's up if I if I had mentioned to Loki in a private message earlier in the week on xbox live I just recently had my PlayStation 3 stolen and I'm hoping that any ball no letters out there there may be in the puffle area may have heard or heard and seen something to grapevine you know maybe rumor seen someone that normally doesn't have a PlayStation 3 on them and could relay any information to the puffle you know police department specifically district me basically any kind of lead would be great cuz well it's kind of like twofold for me a is not exactly something I can easily replace and be well it should be fairly evident that I'm disabled and the PlayStation 3 X is like a coping skill for me and in dealing with my disability and subsequently we have to answer well I'm really sorry to hear about the PlayStation getting stolen you know and and unfortunately I worry because you know we don't have too big a listenership all throughout the world that's you know we have a few listeners here and there but I'm hoping maybe the right personal here but here's my thought do you maybe have a PlayStation that signs on to the PlayStation network automatically like whenever I turn on my PlayStation it signs on the PS Network automatically yeah well that way I could kind of like as long as you only have one user will do that otherwise it will sit in the select user screen type thing yeah technically my profile did and the key thing was a it had my credit card information on that and there were and because of that I I really did two things hey I canceled my credit card and no idea but I was able to remote access my account using my PSP to change the password on my my PlayStation Network account that way no one could get on to the profile and buy anything any chance that you called Sony and see I don't know if they would do this but maybe if you've told them what happened see what the last IP was to access it I don't know I'm reaching here I don't know what you can do in these scenarios but that that would be my first thought is to call Sony and see when the last time that thing signed in was oh well I did bring this up and in fact I stopped up the same thing and the only thing they can do is if I were to have left my password as was the only thing they could do is see if anyone would try to input their own credit card information onto my profile and and if they did no no you know I would have their no name and address and whatnot but at the same time is I'm not totally sure but I think it's trying yes because if they input their credit card information chances are they could also change my password too and get them even I won't be able to access my own account you know that seems a little weak from Sony I think they'd be a little more they could do to help in the situation but maybe they need a police report or something to be able to do it I have no idea unfortunately I've never been in the situation but well buddy I I hope it I hope it helps for whatever reason again if anybody has heard of anything about this I you know let us know and we'll forward it over to spazz nator or just contact the police for heaven's sake you know if you know that you know and this goes in general I mean I guess we could kind of turn this into a more of a community thing for everybody in all parts of the u.s. because unfortunately these gamers like spazz nator in the cold if we support you know purchasing these stolen systems and things like that so if you know of these things going on do the right thing and and let police people know so all right well we're hoping for you spazz nator keep us posted all right good good luck buddy bye what a bummer I'm not gonna ask how it was stolen I hope like the house didn't get broken into or something like that but yikes not a fun situation higher on orange launch radio who's this time of day orange lounge radio land it's Jason hey Jason I hope you have some better news the last call was a little bit of a downer yeah I was hearing bits and pieces because I was helping Ryan with something and trying to make sure all the volumes are set nicely in here and whatnot how is I just wait wait wait how is Ryan how is she doing she's busy she's in school now I guess I know she used to listen to show back in the day but hasn't had enough time lately but let her know we said hello they said hello oh yeah she's listening over my shoulder wonderful wonderful yes what's in your mind Jason that's Starcraft news was really good to hear yeah I saw you get all excited in chat I mean this is something that dates back to when I lived in New Mexico in like I don't know maybe 2001 or 2000 I did maybe 10 years ago Jason how old this game is but when I remember that the thing that sticks out most of my mind this is gonna be the weirdest thing I've ever really said but the thing that sticks out most in my mind is just how just how far back reaching this goes in the sense that the the the fact that online replays were able to be saved at I don't know 1.03 or something like that when that feature came out that was amazing especially because the file size for any average game was less than 10k yeah that when I first did it I played a couple games with some people and then I went back and watched the replays I was like well wait a second I was discussing I was discussing with them strategy and whatnot I want to see that too never could they just now put this in that's my high school life coming back to say hey I'm cool again isn't that weird like why would they add that now of all things isn't that but I mean they still they still have leagues people are still all over battle net I think I mentioned it on the show when I got Starcraft working on my macbook again and that was a that was a good day I went through yeah it's when the Starcraft 2 news was coming out well I got Starcraft working on my mac again and I started playing through the campaigns again it was fun it still is one of the other little features in the patch we didn't mention is that now you can use slash R to reply directly to the person you last talked to that's another new feature in the patch that's a Warcraft thing which I thought was kind of funny because that's exactly what you do and Wow to reply to a surprise I know I know a synergy amongst the thing and speaking of Wow I know you didn't call the talk Wow but I've got to mention this the armory got a huge upgrade this week and those achievements that you've been getting on your character now you can look at them in the armory online but not only that like if I were to look like I got a show Loki this because he's a big achievement horse so he'd kind of think this is funny but I'm explaining what I'm doing I'm going to the armory right now and I'm looking up the achievements for my character okay and like you look at this it breaks down exactly which achievements I have and what categories and all that but not just that like if I want to look at a particular achievement let's say like general okay here's one achievement I've been going for lately is to all the squirrels I've loved before show the critters of Azeroth how much you slash love them so you get a ten point achievement if you're able to find every little creature among in Azeroth and type slash love right well not only is the armory tracking that I have that achievement enough but if I click on it it shows exactly which six I've slash loved and which ones I have yet to do that's fairly comprehensive see integration like this is a great thing it's always cool you know ten years delayed in Starcraft case but anything like this to integrate that much you don't have to start up the entire game just to see this information it's almost always a good thing to have and I also want to show Loki this I can put in my ex-boyfriend's account and compare and I can see right there that no no but I can I can see just I can notice that I have 360 more achievement points than he does and that makes me feel better about myself awesome no Rob's not an achievement for no not at all no I'm just sad and pathetic anyway so back to Starcraft any anything else you want to share about what's going on I'm I just want to see what the Starcraft 2 requirements are going to be I mean I'm it's not like it's coming out holiday season or anything so I shouldn't be jumping the gun or anything but it's going to be wasn't it either that or Diablo 3 that isn't actually likely before to 2010 now I yeah I think I remember hearing something about that but yeah that makes sense I bet you we seized I bet you will finally get Starcraft 2 next year I mean it was playable at PAX for heaven's sake it will probably be out next year just in time for the holidays and then you'll probably get Diablo 3 in 2010 I mean it's time late to buy three games what we've already beat that topic to death I got consider we're one month away from 2009 and 2010 doesn't seem that far off because that's probably when we're gonna see Final Fantasy 13 as well this year went by so fast yeah it was it was a crazy year all right buddy we're gonna let you go to get two more calls all right such is life all right have a going buddy my books bite our very own webmaster VX chase next to me you know that's something I should get done during the holidays because that's something I wanted to do last holiday but I was too lazy to do it was to get around to a redoing the website hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey hey dark Tetsuya what's up buddy not a whole lot I wanted to call in last week because of where I was but there was no show yeah failed I know no I saw the pictures in your live journal tell us about the trip you went on well we usually we go to Pismo every year for Thanksgiving but we couldn't make it this year so instead we went to San Francisco for the weekend and where exactly did you go in San Francisco a few different places there were there was a well now when we saw the Black Museum so what I wanted to call about was this all this incredible arcade that I got to go to mm-hmm there was a whole bunch of old games like like this link I'm posting there's an old arcade it's a pinball game which which which arcade was this at because I go to San Francisco quite often and I I for some reason have decided to never see I somehow have never seeked this place out you know I know the Pier 39 arcade and some of those other things but where exactly was this now did you find it oh man I don't I don't remember that I'd have to ask about it but well what made you think to go there I don't know it's my mom's suggestion huh interesting would have thunk it I know I guess sometimes parents can be pretty cool well where can I see the pictures of your trip maybe I'll have to try to figure out where it's at and go take my own visit at some point oh yeah where are the pictures that can we look can you link it in chat so we can all take a peek yeah awesome um anything else you want to share about your week well yeah go for it one of the games I was playing one of the games I was playing in that San Francisco was the old 1976 game death ray oh yeah this game oh man that's an old old game I think I remember that coming up on the show not that long ago it's okay what would you what'd you think you'd you got to play that and what'd you think yeah I thought it was pretty cool I even I even made a remake for the PC I have to dig that up and link it in chat to hmm you know and this I think was an old game that was one of the first like controversial games because I see you remember like you're really over people it's also original better movie yeah yeah exactly exactly so well cool sounds like you had a pretty interesting and historical week so I look forward to digging through the pictures and seeing what the folks who aren't local San Francisco are missing out on and I might just have to check that out myself at some point so all right well dark Tetsuya you have a going buddy we're gonna take some more calls okay all right take care bud bye if you want to give us call one eight seven seven game olr would probably about time for me one more call we're gonna wrap it up a call tonight here at orange launch radio Loki do you have any last-minute stories yes I did oh never mind we got a call hey you're on orange launch radio who's this it's gs68 hello gs68 what's in your mind buddy oh well it is always cutting out hey can you hear me or you're cutting out a little bit if you have any other things running like torrents whatever up whoa hello all right no okay I'm hanging up let's do this I don't usually do this but we'll try this this will sometimes help hey there gs68 okay let's try to shit again all right it sounds a little better this time what is on your mind gs68 well okay besides that I get around to playing well echo I think there might be an audio thing going on go ahead shit all right I agree fuck this shit hi radio who's this oh wow he got a little frustrated what's on your mind buddy who's this okay this is Oscar hey Oscar what's on your mind sorry I tuned in a little bit late time if you covered this story or not but did you see that part where it was talking this is on joystick there's an article about the Zelda director saying he wouldn't quit until he surpasses Ocarina of Time like you won't quit working with the Zelda series you know what fuck this shit sorry I had to use that good but I was wondering what do you guys think needs to happen and there's all the series to make it surpass Ocarina of Time or do you think there's already been a game in the series that's better I think the way they can make it better is to fuck the shit no um that's just not gonna get old I don't know why I'm so mature yes I think there is a game that has surpassed Ocarina of Time and it's called the Legend of Zelda link to the past so in my opinion he can quit already because he already made the better game really I have a friend that likes links to the past the best too but I don't know just for me Ocarina of Time is still the best I like he was also talking in terms of sales too mm-hmm you know I think it's gonna be tricky to do I think you Twilight Princess was pretty darn good I mean it would I think it really showed with the Wii games could it could be pretty awesome although you know that game was kind of originally designed for the GameCube so I think what it really might take to really knock people's socks off is to kind of take that same approach but with a Zelda game that is designed for the system it's gonna be out for and it'll probably be this we HD thing that'll be out in 2010 or 2011 which will be a port of a Wii game because you know they do a Wii version and a Wii HD version you know I wouldn't be surprised if we see a play on Wii Wind Waker game I would like to see a Wind Waker game that wasn't in you know world that was flooded with water it was just you know spoiler but you know in Wind Waker you actually go under the ocean you find out oh my god it's Hyrule but flooded and it looks pretty awesome and I'm like why the fuck couldn't they have just done this you know and made it really cool it's kind of like Wind Waker to me is kind of like Mega Man Legends was there's another game that needs more you know I'm thinking if Zelda wants to really really expand its audience and really cater to many people are crossing different types the game that's just persist no no what you what you do you just need to add a few things into the game you need to add kiddich matches you need to add vampires that sparkle and you need to add Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus somehow and then did that's that's how you would reach into Nintendo's other markets I think Miley Cyrus as Princess Zelda I think there's huge market ability in this so basically and stuff a wolf link turns into a sexy vampire guy and then so I'll just start singing see you again I think I think we're on to something here and then then he then he sparkles and we just talk about how beautiful he is and that's okay waiting at midnight all right I I don't know you know honestly the thing that's gonna make Zelda better is something we haven't thought of yet that's my cryptic answer I mean it really is it's something we have real controls that is like what with Loki said about when waker I think it'd be cool like if they made a Wii version of it like you know how like you conducted with the one waker you could actually probably do that with the Wii remote and that'd be just something interesting you know and I I know a lot of people hated the look of when waker I thought it looked really cool and with the cell shading and everything if they just had applied that much effort to the game and actually made it like a traditional Zelda game hell you can almost do something that was not necessarily a remake of but like a links with links awakening or whatever it's all the three you know I mean dude whatever happened to links crossbow training I put it in a CD case to where it would be forgotten forever remember what was what the hell was that thing called it came with a zapper we zapper whatever happened to the we zapper there's games that actually use it like Call of Duty that world war uses it I say but we need we need like in the next Zelda game we need more links crossbow training with sniper rifles and cannons and things that are more explosive than a stupid crossbow Zelda Call of Zelda oh my god that's wrong but no seriously they could just do you know they're the first thing they're probably gonna do is just do that play on we think for Wind Waker and then you'll probably see a new Zelda game yeah unfortunately I don't think it's gonna be on the Wii I agree with why we are in check coming soon super links crossbow training turbo HD remix they do come out like a we HD they're just gonna remake all the stupid games that were on the Wii and they're gonna make them all HD now and you'll buy them anyway that's right all right Oscar we're gonna let you go but thanks so much for the call and you know I know you really didn't get an answer out of us but I think it's because probably I sure there could be a game that one day surpasses Zelda if they just want to put the effort into it and hopefully they will and appease as hardcore gamers we'll see I think you were right though when you said that it would have to be something that we haven't seen in a game yet like the thing with Ocarina of Time for me was just how expansive it was like that that feeling I got when I first stepped out in the Hyrule field I was just like holy crap there's so much to do and maybe there's something to be said for the potential of a Zelda MMO I don't know maybe a little weird but you know when in doubt sparkles yeah have a good one buddy all right see you all right that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight thanks so much for you guys calls you didn't get through I'm sorry but you know I send us an email mailbag at orange on traded calm and we'll take more calls next week last minute stories to get out of the way before we take off tonight there was a bunch of rumors coming out about stuff coming from Sony apparently this was leaked from some sort of Sony staff meeting some of the stuff we've been hearing about over and over now a little big planet on the PSP Motorstorm on the PSP apparently are in the works maybe as early as next year you know I'm not surprised they need something because there's nothing really coming out on the PSP they said that Motorstorm was shown off on the PSP but it was target footage and not the actual game also there was supposedly you know God of War 3 stuff shown apparently it's you know really awesome looking and uncharted 2 also shown you mean not big surprises they're gonna make it a second uncharted game and kills unto stuff was shown off as well so yeah that's kind of interesting another interesting thing would be the PSP 3000 system a new system that came out one of the things about that was it was pretty impossible to hack the custom firmwares on well now it's even easier to do that because a mod group has actually released a new tool now called the PSP light blue tool and what it is is it's a memory card that will act like the Pandora's battery and will allow you to add the custom firmwares to your system and what's funny is it will sell for 30 bucks and apparently it came out last weekend so that's kind of neat then finally we know about gardening mama that's going to be coming to you know the DS soon well there's a new trademark being made title is trademark pet shop mama and it is actually a port of a DS game that's apparently available now I'm really if I think mama might have to be euthanized I think mama's I got a lot of mama's getting spread too thin yeah pet shop mana ghatari is the port of the game is being ported and has everything from penguin washing to apparently a bear that's jumping in the air that's interesting another game though that is being ported and thankfully coming to the United States finally track mania DS will be coming thanks to Atlas March 17th to the US so that's pretty cool this track mania is all sorts of awesome I would like to see a mama game where mama is trapped in Silent Hill fix this mama mama's brothel stripping mama you know it's funny I don't think mama here's something I would just like to bring up where the fuck's PlayStation home I thought it should have been a release by now it's coming out December 31st 1159 technically there's the version 1.0 and they said that everybody in the PlayStation Underground got an invite I'm part of PlayStation Underground I still haven't gotten an invite so that's apparently a lie and to be honest I really couldn't care less but I'm just kind of curious you know that they promise it's supposed to be here for 2008 are they so white you didn't get into home so what fuck that shit I really don't care I like I said you know yeah fuck that shit but I just think it's funny though that they still haven't come out with something you know even though they've been teasing this for over two years and hell it's still in the commercials you know they're teasing for the PlayStation 3 look at all these cool games you can play on it including PlayStation home no you can't you cannot play that I love what joshi16 in chat says Britney mama where you get to neglect your kids for points you were teasing home back in January in December of last year when you know with the new PlayStation 3 commercials with what was it a ladies and gentlemen I don't know it's sad all right well that's it for last minute stories and that's it for the show here tonight orange launch radio I know it's a little bit shorter but that's what happens when you take a co-host out for a night but thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting us as you do every week hey remember if you like your orange launch radio please help us spread the word tell two friends about the show that's really how we you know spread the word about the show because we are an independent podcast we don't have any big name magazines or you know big websites backing us it's just us as it always has been for the past seven years and without fans we're nothing we're just crap so we appreciate you guys and your support even if you disagree with me on your particular views on a video game right hits done right hits done anyway we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts we'll start with well I guess we'll go to um Loki I'm gonna try to play some more games this week and it's gonna suck because my co-workers leaving and my boss procrastinated on having me learn his territory and you know the accounts I'm gonna take over until I don't know tomorrow and he leaves on Tuesday so way to be proactive my final thought is thank you Aaron for putting us in the credits of snake 360 I thought that was pretty cool I forgot to tell you about that in the little in the credits screen that really it says special thanks orange launch radio whoo so we we now not only do we have a gamer pick on Xbox Live and now we are actually mentioned in a downloadable game so well well now we just need to take that big step and actually get the orange launch radio game released on Xbox 360 I don't know I don't know who we have to blow to make that happen but we might we might have to get working on that might be a new year's resolution for oh nine I don't know what you think it's just you know it I've thought about it a few times now and it's just when you actually get down to figuring it out game developments really hard and it makes something game development is hard to make something really good takes a lot of time and it's just like holy crap that's a lot is hard right Loki yes all right well thankfully what you cannot make yourself you steal so my gosh all right that's it we're gonna say goodnight and get on out of here so we'll see you next week on orange lounge radio for another great show until next time until next week fuck this shit you've been listening to orange lounge radio orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for
