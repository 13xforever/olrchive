00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You're listening to All Games Radio.

00:03.000 --> 00:31.000
Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio Live.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Tonight, November 9th, 2008.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
EA gets hit with more lawsuits over their controversial DRM.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Copyright concerns hit Guitar Hero and LittleBigPlanet.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
And has Yaris become the first casualty of Xbox listing?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
We are back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Jamie Summers, not here yet.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
She's running a little late tonight.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And we'll talk a little bit about why.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
It's very interesting, but she will be joining us for Part B tonight.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
She'll get here about 7 o'clock Pacific for those listening live.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
For those on the podcast, she'll be here for Part B to kind of talk about where she's been.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
And it is a little bit related to some things we've talked about previously on the show, but not gaming.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Very interesting. I'll leave you with that.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
In the meantime, we'll talk to Techmaster Loki.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm doing okay.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Awesome.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
But how did you enjoy the time off?

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I remember I did last Sunday, to be honest.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I think I played games.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
I know I didn't play Fable 2 because I had left it at work and Nellie was disappointed because she was playing that.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
And I offered to go get it for her because I actually have a key to the building, but she said no.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
So, probably was either playing LittleBigPlanet or Saints Row 2.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
So, it was very late at night.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
But, you know, I can't live without my cell phone.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Alright, well you started talking about games like Fable 2, so we'll ask you, how was your gaming week, Loki?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
My gaming week was alright.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.

02:41.000 --> 02:52.000
I did play Fable 2 a bit mainly to cheat and how I cheated.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Let me count the ways.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
First, I cheated to get lots of money.

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property and then time travel and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
So, I have lots of money now.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And then I decided to get lots of experience.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
And the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
And you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
So, that's what I did.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I did all that.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
And then I played a few missions and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
So, I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
In fact, now I am almost done with the game.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I have two missions left, I think.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And that game is awesome.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It's just a lot of fun.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
In fact, they're kind of hating me.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And I've been winning with over 20 points.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And it's not really fun.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
But it's alright.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
And then I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Just a lot of activities.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I really appreciate Saints Row 2.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I think this is the game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2 and I don't plan on it.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Which is too bad.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And then Little Big Planet, I've been playing a lot of that.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Just trying to go back and collect 100% of everything in each level.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
And now I've kind of gotten a little bit bored with doing that.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
I've been continuing through the game and now I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
But it's really cool.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Slightly offensive still.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
His character's interesting, to say the least.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
We'll just leave it at that. Interesting.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But it's a fun game.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
But that's the thing.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess. I don't know.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Then, let's see, what else did I play?

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo. Holy crap, is that awesome.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
It's pretty awesome.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
Now this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Still got to go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
Which is cool because that game is really cheesy anyways and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim I guess would be really fun.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But they're going to have downloadable characters.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
They're going to have Obama and Sarah Palin.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh lord.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
So that would be funny.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
But yeah, basically Mirror's Edge, very intense.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
The game reminds me kind of like playing out a scene in Bourne Identity, which is pretty cool.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And the music kind of fits with it as well.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
But that's about it.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
It's a lot of trial and error because when I was trying to jump from building to building, I'd miss the other building a lot.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
Let's get some comments from the ever-present fourth panelist on our show, the Chat Room at chat.orangelandradio.com, live on this Sunday night.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Tigerclaw starts off, he's also played the Mirror's Edge demo.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
He says the Mirror's Edge demo has some pretty cool music, a combination of ambient and trance music.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
So that's basically been what I've been playing this week.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I have Fallout 3.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
It's just too much.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Just a lot of stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh, and I got Resistance 2.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
That was the other game I played.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Resistance 2.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm not liking it as much as the first one.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I think what it is is there's not a lot of setup.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
But this is just, it's too much.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Just too quick.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
But it's been good.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
I think it's going to be about as big as like, say, maybe Assassin's Creed.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Interesting.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
But it'll be fun.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
I mean, it's one of those games that they could add like, you know, kind of the Melgir Solid challenge levels and stuff later on and stuff to it.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Because it's a lot of, a lot of it feels just kind of like the VR missions or something like that.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
It's a lot of just linear running and, you know, having to figure out how to do tricks and stuff.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And there's very few buttons that you use in the game.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
But the way you do stuff is pretty cool.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'll have to check it out.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm not usually a big fan on the first person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Just because it's not really a shooter.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Like, you can't really call it a first person shooter, right?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
It's more of a first person free running sim.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, and I do love, see, and then like Portal, I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first person, you shoot portals, so who knows.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
They're okay, it just takes a lot of getting used to.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Because, like I said, I kept falling off the building. A lot.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Alright, if you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That's it.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Alright, let me answer the questions in the chat room, because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Obviously I'm here, so I'm doing fine.

09:59.000 --> 10:07.000
And to answer what Marin in chat said, no the doctor did not have my gallbladder with some fava beans and an ice canteen.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
So, yeah, I had the operation on Wednesday, and I was pretty much out for the next few days recuperating.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
And I did try to get some gaming in. I took my DS over to my parents' house where I was recuperating.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
And, by the way, speaking of the gallbladder, they did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And, you know, I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And they didn't put it in a jar for me.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
And I didn't really get to, I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
But see, Loki? That was my gallbladder there on the left.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
So, yay. Yeah, exactly.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So I'll be showing those to Jamie when she arrives, too, because I know she was really excited to see.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
But there you go. So I do at least have pictures.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
And to answer Redertainment's question in chat, Skye, did you vote?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes, I went and voted. That's a very important thing.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
So hope you all did, too, no matter what you did. I hope you did go vote.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I voted on the monorail. I mean, bullet train.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
As pro-monorail.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah, I did vote. I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
If I was a little worried that, you know, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the cargo vote.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So there you go.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
So I'm doing great. I feel a lot better. I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including ORR.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Be sure to download it, in case you haven't done it yet, the free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh yeah, I already did.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, those are funny.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Really?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yep.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I wanted a card.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, not that I really care.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Sorry.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Anyhow, let me talk about some other stuff as far as games go.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So I was playing DS while I was recuperating.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I went back and revisited an old classic DS game, Clubhouse Games.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
I was playing for a little while, which is, you know, it's a good way to pass the time when you're doped up.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
and I asked him to pick me up a game, and he did it, and that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it, so I don't really remember it at all.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Like, I do.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
I remember thinking it was very much, like, here's my thing with Castlevania games.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait till Castlevania Judgment comes out.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
That'll innovate you up the ass.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony of the Night is one hella good game,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It makes me miss them on the console.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
But keep in mind, Vicodin.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
So I'm not really at my peak.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Did you try to hit it for massive damage?

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
That's because it only applies to...

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I didn't have 6-axis on the DS, that's why.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It didn't work.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
But I do have 6-axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Wait, I gotta read this.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I gotta read this comment in chat.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Marin in chat says,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Castlevania Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Anyhow.

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
The other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called Little Big Planet.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
And as far as my thoughts on Little Big Planet, I love it.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I love the sense of humor in the game.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I think the graphics look great.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
I think, even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
Just even as a standalone game, I would have paid 20 bucks as an arcade title for just the story, which was a lot of fun.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
But then you add this whole online component to it, and wow.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
I think my thoughts on this were kind of best summed up by a Twitter post I made earlier this week where I was like,

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
You know what? I think this game is the new ZZT for me.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Little Big Planet is kind of the new ZZT.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
No, no, no. Nothing will ever replace ZZT.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It won't. It won't.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
ZZT always has a fond place in my heart, but I think that's because...

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Sony's not trying to rip ZZT levels off the internet for you.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
ZZT also had a more comprehensive programming language that Little Big Planet doesn't have.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Even though you can do some pretty fancy things in Little Big Planet, you could do a little more in ZZT.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
But anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that the whole creation and the potential for really doing anything

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
is really out there in Little Big Planet.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
And you really see that out there on some of these community levels.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Now granted, there's a lot of shit out there.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
There's a lot of these levels that are like, Get 9 Trophies in 30 Seconds, which I'm sure we all played once.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I never played that one.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
You better believe it was the first level I played.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
But because we're all playing it as the first level, it's never going to go away.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
And all the clones are never going to go away from the top page.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But there's some really interesting stuff too.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
And we're going to talk a little later in the show about the copyright infringement and all that stuff.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
But I've seen some pretty interesting stuff that's really blurred the lines of copyright infringement.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Like I played a Batman level that was kind of funny. It was a little stupid.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
I mean, the level itself was very short, but it was really neat how the guy really worked in all these little Batman logos

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
and little Joker faces and things into the game, even though it's a huge copyright problem.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But whatever, he hasn't been shut down yet.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
And then it was interesting. Some levels I played, you actually could unlock little stickers.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Awesome.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And that was a sticker I unlocked because people are holding things up to the camera.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
Like in Bobby's level, you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf on AllGames.com,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
he has a level he did during the beta.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
And as a part of that, you can unlock the AllGames logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
But that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
But that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels.

17:07.000 --> 17:15.000
And to be honest, even if you go in the non-copyright stuff, there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
It's a lot of fun.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
And then he had multiplayer into it.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
And that's also a lot of fun. It's hard as hell to do without a headset.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
But because LittleBigPlanet is international, you might be playing with somebody from Japan or playing with Europe,

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
you could all have headsets and you might still not be able to communicate very well.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
But people have come up with really efficient ways of communicating.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Like people use the arrow stickers to point at things.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
Like one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.

17:59.000 --> 18:08.000
Also if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the poppet and just hover on it in a minute to show heart.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Good thing. Heart.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Plus you can also hit people with your character.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Exactly. My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan and he's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I wouldn't need you with a frying pan.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
A little tip from me to you.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Ace the first area, the little England area. If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And it's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
But if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
So it's pretty awesome.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
As you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
It's a lot of fun and just exploring it and there's so much more potential this game has.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Does the game have minor flaws?

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah. Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
There are some frame rate issues sometimes.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.

19:06.000 --> 19:16.000
But I don't know. I look past all that because I still see laid out in front of me an amazing game that I think is going to still be a big deal a year from now.

19:16.000 --> 19:26.000
I just hope Sony keeps it under control with how much they hoard this because there's really the potential to microtransaction the shit out of this game and just make it old real fast.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
But so far, they released a Halloween costume, albeit a week late.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But there's been a lot of neat things in LittleBigPlanet.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
So if you have a PlayStation 3, get it. You're going to love it.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?

19:43.000 --> 19:51.000
That's a big investment. Especially, I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Maybe not. You really have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
But hey, Christmas is coming around. You're going to be getting gift certificates. It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that fancy stuff.

20:01.000 --> 20:12.000
Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 80-gig system and you get a $100 gift card.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Which is not a bad deal.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
It is not a bad deal.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Solid Goomba in chat says, too late Rob, I already did.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
You know what? To be honest, remember the golden rule of gaming we always talk about on Orange Laundry.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

20:28.000 --> 20:37.000
I had my foot down. I was not going to buy a PlayStation 3 until the games were out that I wanted to finally start playing.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
And LittleBigPlanet was the first must-have for me.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
And then I was finally like, you know, I really want to have a Blu-ray player. They're not making the HD DVDs anymore.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I want to have a better player hooked up to my HDTV.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
And between that and knowing that home is on the horizon and so on and so on, I finally decided to take the plunge.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Honestly, I've been liking the system.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
We did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
But through the magic of patches and all this stuff, they've been making the system quite a bit better.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And now the games are really starting to come out.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
I use it a lot for streaming video files.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Like, for example, we had the Halloween party we went to.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
We downloaded a copy of a synced version of the Rift Tracks for Harry Potter and the Goblet of...

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Or not Goblet of Fire, the...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Sorcerer's Stone? The second one.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Chamber of Secrets.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Wow.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
We're bad muggles.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It was hilarious.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Nice.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
What did you do to my cat?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
You will now become a new cat.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
I always thought it was interesting. Honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
But it's so odd to me that the freaking, like, Microsoft Vista...

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
What do they call that? The whole media sharing media center?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
That whole thing on the 360? What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It's slow and it doesn't work.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
If you use that. Never use that though.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
I actually set it up. I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
It is slow as hell. It doesn't work right at all.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
PlayStation 3? I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yes.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
In one minute.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
What you need to do, what I normally use...

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm hoping the NXC makes that all go away.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Media center is really old though.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
What you need to use, I use Teversity, which is awesome.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And, you know, I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I prefer my PS3. I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
would interface better with Windows than Sony.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Five minutes.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
You see, I don't really use the Zune stuff for their new media center.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Or, not media center, Windows Media.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up and up.

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
So, Teversity works really well with those not so legitimate copies of Windows.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Well, mine's the real deal because it came with my computer and everything.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
And it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
But, don't get me wrong, the Sony is not perfect because I've had problems.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
You can't run that and your internet thing at the same time,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
or you'll keep getting booted off the internet.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So, you do kind of, it has its own faults.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
But, as far as streaming video for a party or whatever, it works far better.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
By the way, one other game I want to quickly mention, I played the demo for.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't think the full game is out yet.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I think it comes out next week.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
It is out? I might have to pick it up.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Valkyria Chronicles from Sega.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
It's kind of like an RTS type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
Like, it's first person, like you go from the top,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
like the way it zooms in from this top down view into a first person view,

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
and then you move your pieces around like live and attack things.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's actually kind of neat.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And, from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
I might pick that one up. I actually had quite a good time with that.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
So, check out the demo if you haven't, Valkyria Chronicles.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Dark Soccer, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I want to say something about the podcast delays,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
because I've been getting some emails about it,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
and I've seen posts on the forums about it,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
and that the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It took a couple weeks to get on the feed,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
and I'm really sorry about that, you guys.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It's never our intent to, like,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
and I know it's kind of been like a recurring thing that's been going on lately,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
is that the shows have been extremely delayed,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
and I apologize.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
This whole two computer setup I have going on in the garage

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
has not been very helpful with that.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
a hell of a lot faster in the future.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
So I'm really sorry about that.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
and if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
because we had so many people here in house,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
so check out episode 300.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And, you know, again, I'm really sorry, but please understand,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
you know, I usually am the one that puts all those shows together

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
just because I just have traditionally,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
and I got so busy before the surgery trying to take care of everything else

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I was trying to take care of,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
and then, like, after the surgery, like, literally for a week and a half,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
I could not bend over to switch the computers to change the cords.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Like, I would not, it was too much pain to do that.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
So, you know, I'm okay now.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
That's why I was able to get it done now.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
But, you know, and just with everything else going on in the world,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
there was just a lot more on my mind than just, you know,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Orange Lawn's radio, and honestly, for me,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I can't speak for Loki or Dark Soccer,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
So, I hope you all understand, you know, in the real TV shows,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
they do, what, like 26 episodes a year?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
If that, 23, what's a season order?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Shit, last season we only had 11 episodes all year?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
It's usually 26, I think.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So, please bear with us.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
We do our best.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
It's not an anti-podcast thing.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Little Britain, that's six a season.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Yeah, so, there you go.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
like, oh, look at me, cry for me.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
We're on season 50.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
But we're here.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
We're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
because, again, it's a great show.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I had a lot of fun.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Loki came in costume, if you haven't heard it yet.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
He did finally wear a costume for all you people.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It's not the one you'd expect.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
He dressed up as Sackboy from Little Big Planet,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
but I want to ask a quick follow-up before we get into

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
tonight's gaming news.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
How did the Sackboy costume go over at the Halloween party?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
It went over well.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, at the Halloween party, I won second place.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
What did you lose to?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
My sister.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
She won with grr.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh, like, was she, like, a full-blown grr?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Well, that's pretty awesome.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
If you're going to lose to anything, lose to her.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Well, it's all good, you know.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And it was just for fun.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
You have, like, this family to be reckoned with

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
in Halloween costume contests.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Well, I normally don't make costumes.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
I mean, this is, like, the first costume I've made, period.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
So she makes stuff all the time.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Like, she did, like, a fawn one year,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
where she actually made, like, the fawn legs and everything,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
because she was really, she's real into, like, the fantasy,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Kralka-Linardia crap, you know,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
just, like, the whole fantasy world

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
and the mythological creatures and that kind of crap.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
So, yeah, so that's, I won second there.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
I mean, it was just for fun.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
It was just whatever.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And then at my work, I won most original costume,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
which is cool.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That's awesome.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And you haven't mentioned this yet,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
but I don't even know if you know,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
but there's some blog out there.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I think the dude who actually made the costume.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah, I sent him the email.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
He put your picture on it.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah, because I sent him an email.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Nice.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
So you're actually, if you want to,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
if you haven't seen Loki in the costume yet,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
what's the blog?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
MakeAsackBoy.com.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
MakeAsackBoy.com.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Loki's right there in the OLR shirt.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
What a great plug for the show.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Good job, Loki.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Mm-hmm.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Good job.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
All right, let's start things off.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
We'll talk about a program called Boku.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
to the little big planet.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
It's a programming language meant, well,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
it looks like it's meant for little kids.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
And basically, you can use this to create your own games.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
And, you know, it's sort of like XNA to a certain extent.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
And we've talked about this before.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a...

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Damn, episode number and everything.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Nice, Loki.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Very nice.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
and whether I liked them or not.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
So I hated them all.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
No, they were all right.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
But the programming language itself, it looks very basic.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
But, you know, much like little big planet,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And they showed some examples of different games.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
And there's basic AI that you can assign to objects

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
and tell them how they behave and that kind of thing.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
And the games itself look like they're...

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
The levels almost look like they're made out of Legos,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
which is kind of cool.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
So, no word on when exactly this is going to be available.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
although it's been at a few different conventions.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
It's just been so much...

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Didn't they have a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo,

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
if I remember right?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
There was something about it.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It was almost like an informational thing only,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
if I remember right.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
No, no, the thing at...

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
I thought I saw it somewhere.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
No, the thing at Penny Arcade was something different.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
That was not Boku.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
That was...

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Well, it was similar to Boku.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It wasn't quite the same thing.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
It was...

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I don't remember what they called it at the time,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
but this is totally different than that.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
No, that's alright.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
The program that they were showing off was...

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That was really basic.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It was for Flash games, I think.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And, I mean, you're talking like stuff...

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
I don't know if anyone remembers Maxis's...

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Click and Play.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
God, I love that game.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But it's that basic.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Actually, it was even more basic than that.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
The one that they were showing off at Penny Arcade Expo,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and I can't remember for the life of me what it was called,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
but it wasn't Boku, because I would have remembered that.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
No worries.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
But this, though, is supposed to be available,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I guess it looks like now.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
They're saying early next year.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
So, it's pretty cool.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
And they have a video.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and they have it mirrored on joystick.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So, you know, definitely check it out.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's pretty cool looking.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And you know what's funny is the entire time

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
that I was playing LittleBigPlanet,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I was thinking,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Honestly.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
You know what I mean?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
They're always trying to one-up, especially Sony.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
So, it's just funny that this is coming to light.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Hey, don't forget about us.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
We got a game coming.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Well, yeah.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I mean, this has been around for a while now.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
It's been in development for at least a few years.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
So, I don't know.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
They definitely won't be the last people to do something similar to LittleBigPlanet.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I mean, this is, I think, going to be a trend going forward.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
You're going to have a lot more games where it's all about creating stuff

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and sharing it with the community and that kind of stuff.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Because that's what people like.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
They like being creative and having the tools to be creative.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
All right.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, I'm very curious to see what Xbox's kind of response is to this.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
So, we'll see.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You know, it's something I would definitely give it a try.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I mean, I like making games and I think it'd be fun.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
SonicM88 in chat, chat.ornisontraday.com says,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
There's so many games out there to catch up on.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
It's insanity.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Well, the thing is-

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
But, of course, this is the holidays every year.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Yeah.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
And also, you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
I mean, especially during the holiday, it feels like you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
You know, like, Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I gotta get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
But, I'm like, I got too much shit I gotta play.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm not gonna go buy another game.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That's how I feel.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Because I've heard, like, Fallout 3 is Oblivion with guns and nothing could, like, sell a game better for me.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
But, I just, I don't have fucking time between all the other games I'm trying to play.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And then, add on top of that Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Addict.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Oh, it sounds like Dark Sakura's here with us.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
How are you doing, Jamie?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
There you go.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh, you sound a little raspy.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Have you been yelling a lot today?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I've been yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Alright.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Did you notice at the top of Part B, a little bit where Dark Sakura's been screaming her head off at?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Did you notice I have a giant sandwich?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
It was a lot more giant earlier.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Holy fucking shit.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
That's a 24-inch family-sized sandwich.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
You didn't talk about this on the show.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
You just talked about it on JustinTV before we went live.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I have only one word to ask in regards to that sandwich.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yes.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Why?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Because I'm hungry.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
It's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Yes.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
And Dunkin' Donuts, even, I think.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.

34:00.000 --> 34:06.000
Togo's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm like, family-sized sandwich?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm like, really, you say?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
That is a size that I was unaware of.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
24 inches for you, not them?

34:35.000 --> 34:43.000
And so, basically, what I'm going to do with this is, it's not I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it, like, throughout the week.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So, it's lunch for all week.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
20 bucks.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
That's not bad.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
That isn't bad.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
That's not bad at all.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about 2 bucks, and then, so it's, like, 90 bucks.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Doesn't Subway do something?

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
These drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs without profit?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Like, 5 cents.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Doesn't Subway have a similar thing?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
I mean, most sub-shops do. I'm pretty sure Quiznos does the huge subs, too, if you ask.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Quiznos, yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah, but this is something that they actually have available, like, anytime.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Normally, if you order a sandwich that's larger than, like, Subway, they don't make anything larger than a foot.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Oh, yeah.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Because that's their thing, their foot long.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
But, you know, you can go in there, in fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than 2 feet.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
But, no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger,

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a 3-foot-long sandwich to come in to work with that,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
because it'd be funny, because people are like, what the hell are you doing?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
They've done that for work events where I worked before.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
I usually save these things till the end of the show, but it just, it works too much now.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews,

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
because, you know, it makes us feel really good about what we're doing, it helps us spread the word out about our show,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
and increases our rankings in iTunes.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
And we need our E-peen stroked.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
We do, we need our E-peen stroked once in a while.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
And a couple of you have stroked in the past couple weeks, including this review from Biohaze20,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
who says, one of the best podcasts out there.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And, yes, this is related.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Orange Lawns Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.

36:26.000 --> 36:35.000
And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Dear Orange Lawns Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
All right.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Signed, Jamie.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
I was just hoping they'd have some really cool, like, long box that you could put it in or something,

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
because they didn't, they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to, like, take it home and, I don't know.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And I didn't have them cut it either, because I figured that would-

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
All right, enough sandwich! Jesus.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
All right. How was your gaming week, of all things?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I played Fable 2 a little bit.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
And what'd you think?

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
I smashed beetles, and I tried to be a good little girl.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Dan had an interesting experience.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
He is a big beefy man, got turned into a big beefy woman.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
He drank the gender potion.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
And so he decided just to be evil.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
And went around killing everybody, and his dog turned black, and he lost his halo and grew horns.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Awesome.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
The end.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
I still haven't played Fable 2, I'm having to live another one of those games on the back burner.

37:32.000 --> 37:41.000
Also, one of our listeners, who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
so I'm just gonna say Rob.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And it's a good name.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yes, it's a very good name.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Nice.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
So, I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming.

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
Alright, fair enough.

38:07.000 --> 38:16.000
I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality, and instead move to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Fair enough.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
And in your DS game, he will be.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yes.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
So there you, you just have to never watch the show again.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
It's just it's got Martha in it, and Martha's not fun.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I like Donna.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Dr. Donna.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
What else was I gonna ask you?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Oh, you!

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
You!

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
What?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
You need to play LittleBigPlanet.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
I'm gonna!

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
It is, when it arrives.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Rocking amazing.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
We're supposed to get a free copy.

38:36.000 --> 38:45.000
And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in the traditional English style, making those little puns,

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I think of you.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Because I know you live for that stuff.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I want to move there.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
The narrator is some famous guy too.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
He's the guy that narrates.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
He's the witch hanker's guy from the galaxy.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah, he's.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Oh, sweet.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Yeah, he's pretty famous.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I want to move there, okay?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
You want to move to LittleBigPlanet?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
No.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
It's pretty rad.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
You can decorate your pod and fire.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I want to, sweet.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
You know.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
There's levels on there that are just, fire!

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
You know I'm gonna have HellPod.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
You should.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Anyhow.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but I am proud to say.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Yes.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
I finished the entirety of season two of Supernatural, and I'm moving on to season three.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Quel Tipo, Stephen Fry is the gentleman's name.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Thank you.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
It was on the tip of my tongue.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
I didn't want to have to go look it up because I'm lazy.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I am going to be watching more Supernatural.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
I vow by the end of the semester, I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Because that is now my favorite TV show.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Is that on the CW?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Yes.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Yes.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
You know what else they show on the CW?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
What?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
90210.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Just saying.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
It's alternate reality, Rob.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
You shut your mouth.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
Apparently post episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
You know what?

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Excuse me.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Masters of the Wiki.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
Can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
Also, I ate at a very good restaurant speaking of food.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Not today.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
I have to talk about it, Rob.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Alright.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
It's called Something Bohem.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Lost Something Bohem.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Lovey Bohem?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Like the Rent song?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
No, but it's kind of.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Okay, it's an Italian song.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's an Italian Czech restaurant.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Nice.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.

40:31.000 --> 40:38.000
I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi, and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
What?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Shut your mouth.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Just talk about Shaft.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Shut your mouth and chew.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
So, I had to share that antidote.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
So, in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
from Shaft?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
At least once per meal.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Alright.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
Well, back to gaming news.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I don't know what to say, but hey, if you like to blow things up.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That would be us.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Who doesn't like to blow things up?

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8, and Dark

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Sakura's a bit of a vigilante herself.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
It's actually, speaking of Shaft, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
to it, so maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
It's kind of the sequel.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
You know what?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
It was really good food, okay?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It had really, really good beer on tap.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Nice.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Does it have good beer?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Actually, this is an old game.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
It's being remade.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
No, original PlayStation.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Alright, well there you go.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But now you can play it online with eight people.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
That's why it's Vigilante 8.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
800 Microsoft points for the game.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Does it have good beer?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
I don't know.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You can drive a bus.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
A school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
School bus.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Was that last week's release?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah, this week.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Well, we were off for a week.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
What's coming out this week on this Wednesday?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
I know it's coming out next week.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
I don't know about this week.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
It's next week's...

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
Well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
This week...

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
I don't know what's coming out this week.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
I'm sure we'll learn soon enough.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Alright, well let's move on.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Yes, so one thing that...

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
They have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon since the game comes out in a couple days anyways.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
So, yeah.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
But at least it's kind of cool.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody.

42:53.000 --> 43:00.000
And apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
And it's all sorts of fun.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
But for the full game, you'll have to play it.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
I think it comes out on the 12th.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
How much does 890 megs actually weigh?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Not much.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
They're not light if one falls on your head.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
My first hard drive in my first computer...

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
They hurt.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
My first hard drive in my first computer, PC...

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Okay, my first hard drive...

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
486!

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
It was a 3... no, I remember.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
286.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I remember clearly.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
A 386 SX16.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
SX for sexy.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Yes, exactly.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
SX for sex.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Was it Scuzzy?

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
But here's the thing.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Oh my god, Rob!

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
And that's how I got on Prodigy to post my intentions.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
You know what we used to call Prodigy?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Huh?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Buttigy.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
I always heard Prodigy.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
I remember we had a 386 FX 20.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
And the 20, that was when it was running in turbo mode.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
That's right!

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Computers with turbo buttons.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Because who didn't use the fucking turbo button?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
I mean, really.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Unless you were trying to play an old ass game.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
I know, and seriously now.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
So I remember, and that thing was a brick.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
Because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
And now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Amazing memory is so damn cheap.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Technology.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
You're quite feisty today.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I think I rather like it.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
You need to have wine, you need to get loaded more often before coming to the show.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
I'm not loaded!

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Exactly.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
But you need to loosen up a little bit.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
That's cool, that's cool.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
All right, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again since we're talking a little bit retro.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
They are saying the game will come out in November.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
And hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Don't you think?

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Yes.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Even though, isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Yes it is.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.

45:21.000 --> 45:28.000
But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
So there you go.

45:29.000 --> 45:35.000
So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
You never know, if the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
But they have submitted it.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
It is very soon to go.

45:43.000 --> 45:50.000
Yes, and if you can't wait that long, well this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
It's a Street Fighter themed level and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft Points.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
And hmm, looks pretty cool.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
That's not bad though. 200 Microsoft Points is what? 250?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Now Jamie, you would probably know this.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables?

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
There was one. There was, oh god, and I've played one before. It wasn't very good.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
That's too bad.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I seem to recall that too. I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.

46:19.000 --> 46:25.000
If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body. I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
You know, I'm going to find out actually. I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
But this is not a remake of that table.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
This is to celebrate the HD remix coming out, so it's not that.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
But not all tables based on video games are bad.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
One of my favorite, favorite tables they ever did was the Mario Brothers table.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
Not the little one, because there were two versions of it.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
There was a tiny one that was for kids and there was a big one.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It was a Gottlob.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
And so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlob game.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
And that was a lot of fun speaking of pinball.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I think that's the one I'm thinking of. I think that's it.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I wonder if that was in Mario World.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
No, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlob collection for Wii?

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but I doubt it.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlob.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Gottlob was in the UK.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
It was a Street Fighter II pinball that was developed by Gottlob in 1993.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
And I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it, so I am personally not...

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice, I mean, pinball is pinball.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
And there are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Actually, we picked up a new pinball table. Did I tell you?

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
No, what'd you get?

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
We have a Revenge from Mars.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
No, take that back.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Oh, wow.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
I take that back. We have an Episode 1.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Wow, that's cool.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah, we picked up...

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
That's a hologram one. Those are rad.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
What do they call it? The pin 2000 or whatever?

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
Pinball 2000, exactly. We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Nice.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
Are there some good... Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
We should do a pincast.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
There ought to be a couple others that are already up and running out there. I'm kind of curious.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
There's only so much pinball news, to be honest.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
I guess not.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Pinball's still got a massive following.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, I mean, they do these conventions and stuff. I mean, I'm sure there's plenty to talk about.

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
I know, but I can't imagine that there's that much. I mean, maybe our podcast is still talking about...

48:27.000 --> 48:33.000
Thank you, Frisbee. He says ballcast. I don't know if he's making that up. That could be just a joke, but I don't know.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't know.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
All right, well, moving on to other news. You know, the new ExitBox experience is coming out pretty soon,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
I didn't even sign up because it was like the... I think it was like the day before my surgery or something.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Yeah, it was such a small window.

48:52.000 --> 48:59.000
Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part right about now,

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
but that's all right. I had to make do with regular Netflix.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new XBox experience were cut,

49:09.000 --> 49:18.000
and I'm not talking about like things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about they have this big list of things they wanted to accomplish,

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
and according to the head of XBox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said,

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new XBox experience,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
but, assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do. Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard,

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
These are the type of things we're going to start doing.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
So a photo party, that sounds kind of neat.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
Well, that's fine. I mean, I can't say that there's...

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
It's not like there's...

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
What other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?

50:19.000 --> 50:25.000
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
That's lame. That's what email's for.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
What the hell is up with your live journal icon?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
What is up with my live journal icon?

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
It looks like pasta.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
I don't... Oh.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
It's shrimp chow.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Ask me later. We're trying to do a show here.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some release dates.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
Yes. This week there's a ton of stuff coming out. Absolute myriad of things.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
To start things off, of course, we have Call of Duty World at War coming out on pretty much everything out there.

50:53.000 --> 51:02.000
Also this week, we've got Mirror's Edge on PS3 and Xbox 360.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
A game we were talking about earlier. Pretty awesome.

51:05.000 --> 51:13.000
Today, actually, this Sunday, SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 is out on pretty much everything.

51:13.000 --> 51:22.000
We've got a party game called MLB Superstars from 2K Sports. It's a baseball themed party game.

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
Pony Friends Mini Breeds Edition on the DS.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
Populous on the DS. That's kind of neat.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
They were putting out a... Dude, I remember Populous. That game was awesome.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
They're putting out a Three Stooges game on PC. I'm sure that'll be awesome.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Supposedly they're doing a new Three Stooges movie that's fast tracking for next year.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
And I think I want to say the Farley Brothers were attached or something?

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
I thought I heard something like that at one time.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts coming out this week on Xbox 360.

51:54.000 --> 52:00.000
Command and Co... That's with this week on Xbox Live Arcade. It's Banjo-Kazooie.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Alright. We may be giving some of those away.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
Ooh! Possibly. I'll look into that.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 on Xbox 360 this week.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Star Wars The Clone Wars Jedi Alliance on DS.

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
And there's also Star Wars Clone Wars Lightsaber Duels on the Wii.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on PS2, PS3, PSP, and Xbox 360.

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
Tecmo Bowl Kick-Off on DS.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
There's also Amazing Adventures The Forgotten Ruins on DS.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
That's a PopCap adventure game.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Let's see here.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Big League Sports for the Wii.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
That's another collection of games very similar to Deca Sports.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Block Party on the Wii.

52:51.000 --> 52:58.000
That's also another collection of games similar to that Game Party game.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Eternal Poison on PS2.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
That's a Koei RPG.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Facebreaker KO Party on the Wii.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Family Game Night on the Wii.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Another Hasbro game.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
Guinness World Records The Video Game on DS and Wii.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
Yes, with that game you can actually get into the Guinness Book of World Records.

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
And they have a bunch of other crappy games that are coming out like Fantasy Aquarium.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
But that's pretty much it for the US.

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
Lots of good stuff.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And then Rob has disappeared.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
But it's my turn. He said I could take a turn.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
There's a whole ton of crap coming out in the UK.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So I'm just going to start from the beginning.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I'm going to start off on the 7th and the 15th.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It's pigs. Remember the dice game pigs?

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Where you roll the pigs.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It says November.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
That's for the UK.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
That's UK.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
What? You bastards get it earlier there?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
You bet I'm gonna Import the Bitch.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000

Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. Those are actually the 18th.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Yeah, I'm done.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
That's alright, alright.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chat room listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
GS68 says Sing Star Loki.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
Redertainment says My Horse in Me 2 Adventures in Tijuana.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Now that would be a game worth playing.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
SSG100 Matt says No Sing Star Matters Unless it's Abba Sing Star, you damn right.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Don't we have that? Isn't it called Live Journal?

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
No, it's called Zonga.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
I don't use Zonga.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
Hey Rob, you missed it. They have Hello Kitty Daily, which is a diary.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
My God.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
Act Def says Is Top Model Smarter than a 5th Grader?

59:03.000 --> 59:09.000
Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
For what it is, it's not bad.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
The game itself.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
But I think the thrill of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader could only really last so long.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
It's kind of one of those haha for about 15 minutes.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a 5th grade.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Ah, there you go.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I think, yeah.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
But they released the US version here on Xbox Live.

59:35.000 --> 59:40.000
Or they could just forego release it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?

59:40.000 --> 59:53.000
For what I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck, but the fact is it is a game based off a TV show that can kind of just go away.

59:53.000 --> 59:59.000
They should have just called it Are You Smarter than an American and it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone was like,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Oh my God, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Alright.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
As a collective?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
As a collective.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I'm not, even, forget it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Alright, moving on.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Let's talk about Japanese release dates.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Speaking of people smarter than Americans.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on November 13th on the Xbox 360.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
A brand new Xbox 360 pack.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
It's the 60 gigabyte live pack.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Also comes out in Japan on the 13th.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Could that be because The Last Remnant is coming out next week?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I don't know.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But I'm thinking yes.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Major League Beast...

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Beastball?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Baseball!

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Beastball!

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'd like to see that.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Major League Beastball!

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Also Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey race then there you go.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Quite a bit of stuff.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
New Ono Kids Wii.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Jinsei Game Wii.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
FIFA Soccer 09 Allplay.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Because you know EA likes to do the Allplay thing.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Family Ski.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
World Ski and Snowboard if I'm not mistaken.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
That's the Wii mat game.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Wii Fit that uses that, right?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
No, Family Athletics would be the one.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Family Ski was Wii Ski.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Oh, okay.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Is that a price reduction?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
No, it's coming out from Namco and it's not a price reduction.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That already came out over there unless it's a sequel.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Maybe it's a sequel.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It could be because this has snowboarding in it too.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh, I see. There you go.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Na Kibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The Blob.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 2 if you're still rocking it old school on the PlayStation 2, you are going to have the release of Major League Baseball 2008.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
As well as Nobunaga gets a price reduction that's specifically Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And if you've never played a Nobunaga game, go back to the NES and play the very first one.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And then take a nap.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And grow your rice and make your citizens happy.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Also coming out on the portable systems if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out...

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Ah, Nintendo DS.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Some new casings and so on.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
A game called Juggler.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
A Nobunaga game gets a price reduction there too.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Rhythm to Cooking.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That's what they're calling it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Ryusen no Rockman 3, Black Ace, and Red Joker.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm assuming that's their tactical Mega Man series over there.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
ZX, er, not the ZX.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Mega Man Star Force games.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Taisen ka 2chan no Koronope.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Zero kara Hajimiru.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Otona no 5 Kokugo Numion.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But, you know what?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week. The shells of Almia on DS.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Oh really?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Yes, I think that's...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
What makes this Pokemon game special?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Nothing.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Alright then.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But you do have a game called Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hoto Gisuran and Zero Pilot Daisanji Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Oh, also this one. I'm sorry, I missed this one.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
This is a pretty big one, I think, over in Japan.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It's bolded on my list, which usually means it's a pretty big deal.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I don't know, it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But it looks like it is an action game coming out over there.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
There you go. That's it for Japanese release dates.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Alright, cool.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
What about Zimbabwe?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
What about it?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
What about their release dates?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I know Australia, cry cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
But we only have so many hours.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
well, there's something that might be able to help you out.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000
They have tools that will allow you to design your levels, basically,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So go to www.LittleBigWorkshop.com and check it out,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and you might be able to create the next big level,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
hopefully not based off of licensed materials, otherwise they'll get yanked offline.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I just want to say I did visit that website,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
You have to use your email address, though, instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually have your own little page on there.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebook-y update your current status thing.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But I don't think it's really something I would practically use.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So, pretty cool.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And the copyright levels, right?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yes, but that's the thing.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000
There's been a lot of copyrighted levels, or levels with copyrighted materials in them, that are being yanked offline.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Included in that, of course, levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
There was even a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
One weird one, though, was there was a level called Failure to Launch that someone took offline.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Because, I guess, there's that movie Failure to Launch.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's a little much.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Which, to be honest, if you heard Failure to Launch, I don't think you would think of the romantic comedy.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
No, I wouldn't.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Did anyone actually see that movie that plays Little Big Planet? Probably not.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Unfortunately, I did. And I can't take that away.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But, good comment from GS68 in chat.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Blastworks. Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I mean, not here on OLR. Loki's been hyping this game up forever.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much, either.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Well, here's the interesting thing. GS68 says Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff, and nobody gives a shit.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah, it's so far under the radar.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Like, that grottiest level is still there. It was there just before we went live tonight.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yeah, but it's very interesting. I mean, I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
or at the tail end of Bobby's show when we're usually on.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But there's a Batman level out there, too, that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and that you even unlock that as a reward.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So, there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off, too.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Unpublished levels are actually being moderated.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Weird. How's that possible?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I don't know, but it says, for example, one user posted a strategy, I guess, for keeping a copy of the level offline,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and republish it in case it gets deleted.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It says, but Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated, too.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Weird. Maybe when you break, maybe it's kind of one of those things where, you know, once a crook always a crook,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.000
so if you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow, and see if you're infringing in the other places.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I don't know. That's weird.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That is weird.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M, or whatever, he said,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, light-hearted violence have been taken down,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
like the popular Gears of War demon skull level.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, but it's Gears of War.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It didn't get taken down because of the violence.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So what's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and act to try to please everybody?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Like, there's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I've played it in the real game,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:17.000
and, you know, you've got little things dancing on poles, it's no mistaking what it is.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
It's interesting.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Redertainment in Chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I think yes, you can, because I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I think is what it is.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I don't think they can moderate your level if you have a public- that's stupid.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I don't think so.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
But, you know, and as far as these people bitching and stuff, though, here's the complication.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end-user license agreement.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And if you want to be, you know, extra safe, just make backups of your saves.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I mean, that's really the only thing you can do, and thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
In fact, the other thing is you can, you know, download saves online with the PS3,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
because none of those are linked to your user account.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
You can just go, like, on Game Facts, for example, and download stuff, so maybe you could swap levels that way.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I don't know.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I wish you could, because that would be nice, you know, to be able to download levels that are awesome to play.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Really interesting comment from Chat, from Shahram, saying, but that's not as offensive as Two Men Kissing,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
going back to that whole- what was that?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
WhatTheyPlay.com poll we talked about months ago.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Remember that whole thing where, like, Two Men Kissing was one of the most offensive things?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But that had me thinking, boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:46.000
see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Interesting, to say the least.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And make the level called What They Play.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
or, you know, because this has been a topic of controversy lately,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
but there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
You go through three levels that all center around a wedding,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and a crazy bride going after her drunken groom, which, by the way,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
is my favorite level in the game so far, is the Skulldozer level, if you've played that.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I'd be very curious to see what happens.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Anyhow, now I'm getting ideas for my first level.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
There you go.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Rob Robert's Big Gay Adventure.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
We'll see what happens.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Nothing more inspiring than offending people.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It's not offensive!

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
What's offensive about gayety? Nothing!

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Am I pushing the envelope?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
No, to other people maybe.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Maybe.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Is it offensive? It shouldn't be.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Anyhow, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Yep, that's South America for you.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It's like, God, man, seriously.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I've got some ideas, Bruin. We'll see what happens.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
You have to be careful with it, because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
there are people out there that would play it and think it's real,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
so there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
one, I'll cut you.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Two, be very careful, because you can push the envelope,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
but just be careful, because there are some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Now, Rob, how far have you gotten into LittleBigPlanet?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I just beat the boss, well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Just past Mexico? Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
No.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Oh, I want a flamethrowing cat.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
so pretty soon you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Making it even easier to...

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Even easier to infringe on copyrights galore, but you could also put in pictures of yourself,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK, which I saw on the 3Speech blog,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
you can actually put pictures of your family in the game.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You can actually see this in one of the commercials.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But, who do you believe, because the developer also has come out this week and said,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
even though it's on their blog, a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.000
image importing is technically viable, but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
But here's the thing.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
If people want to get their images in the game, they're already doing it.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
How? By printing it out and holding it in front of the camera.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
That's what Bobby did in his level, and also in some other levels I've seen out there.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There's one level I played.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
that somebody obviously just held the video box in front of the camera and took a picture of it,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
which is copyright infringement, but it's how people are getting their pictures in anyway.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So, why not make it easier?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And as Retertainment says, of course, somebody in chat had to say it, importing porn.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Little big porn, says Zach Deft.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
but very interesting to see what happens.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You know, I think though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Like, it goes to the bottom of the list, so that people just don't find it.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
But I don't know about this whole crazy going onto your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the list.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I have a problem with them moderating stuff that's on your system, because that's your stuff.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
If I want to make a Batman level, I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Now, I do have a problem with them taking it offline, because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else. That's fine. They should be able to do that.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:41.000
But, at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I don't see any harm in that, but I'm sure they'll find reasons not to.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000
So, you guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it type of thing.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
This game has the potential to get so big, if it isn't already.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And it's not like building these levels is that easy.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I mean, the creator can get pretty involved.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build the level.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I mean, it's as easy as it can get, considering how intricate your levels can get.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
But, you know, if they just delete your level, that's a lot of time.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I think Bobby said on his show tonight when I was listening, it took him like eight hours to build that level.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Which, with all due respect to the level and the fun I had playing it,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
was not nearly as complex as some of the things I've seen on LittleBigPlanet so far.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yeah.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Because he used the basic artwork.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I mean, he built his own little unique car thing, and used the iToy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Like there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It's like nuts.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Interesting.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
We've got so much more news to get to.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000
It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be like Wii remotes.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And the way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Because the PlayStation Eye has four microphones built into it.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Actually, I don't know why it has four microphones built into it.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Maybe for such a thing.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But the way they're going to do it is the camera will track the X and Y movements.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Whereas the ultrasonic part of it will detect how far away the controller is from the camera.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
So that will control the Z axis.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
So with that, you could have a 3D controller much like the Wii remote is.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Which is kind of neat.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And that would be the way to integrate it, I guess, now with the current technology that they have on the system.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Hmm.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So maybe sometime soon, maybe we'll see a new controller or something.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Do you think this is something for Sony's next system?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I think it's their current one because on the actual patent, it says PS3 on it.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And it's showing the Wi-Fi and the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Hmm.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I mean, it makes sense if they want to expand out.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Because right now, I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I mean, they do have LittleBigPlanet, but there's nothing that's really like get in and just play.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
They have a little bit more than Sony.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But I mean, the Wii's got to be big time with casual, more family friendly just play type of stuff.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
You know, like tennis or something.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
No.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Okay.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Alright, I look like a sex toy.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
No, it's something that was posted in chat there saying it was a hoax, this other one.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I just want to make sure it wasn't the same thing you were talking about, but it's something completely different.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
No.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Alright, something else completely different from Sony games and LittleBigPlanet.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Sega!

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Who doesn't love Sega, right DarkSakura?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Sony.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
But here's...

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Well, Sega makes games for Sony now, so I would hope they like them now.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But, you know, the thing about Sega is, boy, do they know how to whore their 16-bit nostalgia.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And guess what?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
They're going to whore it all over again.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Sega has announced this week the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It's 40 titles that were on the Genesis for next gen systems.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vectorman 2 and everything in between,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.000
including Golden Axe, all three of them, Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kidd Chameleon, Echo One, Echo Two,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3, Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, pretty much all your...

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I think Spinball is in there, too.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Was Sonic Spinball in there?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Yes, it was.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection, pretty much, that were first party.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
They're going to be releasing in Spring 2009.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
But here's the interesting thing.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
You might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
They've released it as a download.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Here's the thing.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
It's going to output in 720p.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go, really?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
720p for my Genesis game.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yeah, that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But just kind of an interesting little addition.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Does that make sense?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out, I guess, a little bit, and it's kind of blurry.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Or you can just do it where it just scales everything up, and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's just larger pixels, I guess.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yes.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It's part of the mandate.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Now, PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
they might as well do the trophies.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It's going to be interesting for the achievement horse.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And, you know, what's funny is there's no Wii version, which makes sense because...

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Well, they can't do 720p.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Also, virtual console.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Yes, exactly.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So, hmm, I could pay $8 a pop for the old games, or I could pay $30 for 40.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
That means, like, 75 cents a game.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
$8, 75 cents.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Hmm, interesting.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Frisbee in chat says, who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
He'd be surprised.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
He would be surprised.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Remember, they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
True statement.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And that's supposed to be pretty nice, too.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
They have, like, 30-some games in there as well.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So, nice.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
it's about this time that they need to announce some more WarioWare games.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And not to be su- no, not too surprising that they're going to actually have some WarioWare games.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Now, I'm not sure if these are actually going to be downloadable games,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
because it sort of sounds like they might be.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
One of the games they have is called WarioWare Myself.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And I guess it's supposedly some sort of game where you can actually use user-created content as well.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Players will be able to reportedly create their own frantic minigames and share them with others.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
So that kind of sounds cool.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
There's also talks of, like, a WiiWare application that allows these creations to be played,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
though not designed on the Wii.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So now that'd be pretty awesome.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:33.000
The DSi is getting a WarioWare photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.000
as well as several WarioWare minigames that'll be available to download on the system's online store.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I don't know.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Interesting.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Well, but I do love me some WarioWare, so they're always pretty innovative with what they do,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
with whatever new piece of thing.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I think WarioWare Myself sounds pretty awesome.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That'd be very interesting.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
A remake of Press Your Luck.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And I'm not talking about that shatacious show on Game Show Network, Whammy.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm talking old-school 80s Press Your Luck.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
You remember this game show? It was one of the best.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Oh, hell yeah!

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
You remember that whole thing?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I remember the guy who memorized the screens with all that money.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
and sadly I missed it, which kind of sucks.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But, you know, they had this whole thing,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000
and apparently they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And it's not just for PC.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It's going to be coming for iPods, iPhones, and apparently, consoles.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
So the people that got the Price is Right,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
now unfortunately I haven't played the Price is Right game,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
so I don't know if it's any good or not,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
if it's a new game, it's going to have new Whammy animations and all that fun stuff.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
This is going to be an awesome party game.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It has to have the music, the sound, wah wah.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I used to have the actual theme song somewhere around here.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I'm trying to dig for it right now.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But man, Press Your Luck was awesome.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I should have more games that are like game show based,

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
because I think that'd be fun.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Everyone likes watching game shows.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I actually have them like, so that they're literally a half an hour long or something like that.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Well isn't that what they're kind of trying to do with the whole Xbox,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
the new thing they're doing on Xbox?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I forget what they officially call it, but as part of the NXC, you know what I'm talking about, right?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
So yeah, I know exactly. Who doesn't love game shows?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Game shows are awesome.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Exactly.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
There you go.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Something not so awesome though is two class action lawsuits.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Both of these of course have to do with the whole digital rights management

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
that EA sort of secretly slipped in there on a few games.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Although you'd be surprised though, Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Apparently they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the digital rights management for Spore.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And, you know, interesting.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000
The first suit, I guess, says it was lodged by a Pennsylvania man who installed the Spore trial.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It says that the installation of DRM on a freely distributed program constitute a major violation of the computer's owners' absolute right to control what does and what does not get loaded onto their computers and how their computers shall be used.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I mean, that kind of is like spyware.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And it says apparently the trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or secure arm whatsoever.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And then the second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri saying that after installing the DRM protected The Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:39.000
She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, and oppressive, and unscrupulous behavior.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So, in other words, EA got sued over secure arm. Nobody's surprised.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But is it going to hold up? What do you think?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:06.000
If they came out and disclosed that secure arm was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, that it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this, if you install this, this is what's going to happen.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
If they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Especially on these demos. That's the real tricky part. I mean, if you buy the game...

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Well, who cares? It's a demo. I don't understand, you know. I don't get it.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until part B.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
There you go.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off there.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
What? There's a spore level now?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That'd be funny. They should do that.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Alright, I could go on and on. Apparently tonight's...

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I love that sound.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Yeah, that's the best sound ever.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I'll have to get that for the show. We can use that a little later on.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to do it.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.000
We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from RobWithTwoBees.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
To answer your question, yes it is.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And it's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Now obviously we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email that's pretty awesome.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
The quote here at the end.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Interesting.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
An email from, well it's not signed.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
We'll leave it at that.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Sent us something this, but I thought this was an interesting story.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
And this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So it looks like the same day as our last show.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
But apparently it was like this giant, like, cosplay record type thing.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
342 people posed.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Part of the London Games Festival.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And the funny thing is, they were out there to top the record of.337 set the week before in Germany.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Who knew that World War III would be fought with cosplay?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Who knew?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But there you go.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah, well not the one that he sent, I just happened to find one on YouTube.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
That's fantastic.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I don't know if we learned this.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Can you actually save levels from online to like your planet and stuff?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of the show, he was telling us that there's an option you can.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
God, I hope so.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I need to go save that one.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Alright, anyhow, we got another email here, one last email.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
It's a little bit lengthy, but that's alright since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And it's from Spaznator.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Hi folks, I'm sending you this within a few minutes of finishing watching episode 300 live on Justin TV.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
This is the first time I saw OLR on Justin TV live rather than listening on my PSP.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I would have called in, but unfortunately I could not get through tonight.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Oh well, as they say, shit happens.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Firstly, I'd like to relay to you a now belated happy 300th episode.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It was a pretty good show.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I particularly liked the Justin TV feed.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the all games radio feed on shoutcast on my PSP.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Well, now our all games friends wouldn't like that very much.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You should do both. Ideally you do both.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
You turn on the Justin TV and mute it and then listen on the all games feed.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Because the Justin TV unfortunately has shitty audio.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a Playstation 3.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Welcome to the dark side.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Just out of sheer, stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And you're right.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I just bought the 80GB, the new one.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And it doesn't play Playstation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a Playstation 2.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Whoa. Hello. Hey. No, we're not ready for one gun music yet.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
That's our break music tonight.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Anyway, speaking of Playstation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
And it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I'm speculating that Playstation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
The reasoning behind this is simple.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
On November 19th, Microsoft, as we all know, is releasing the NXT, the new Xbox experience,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
which includes, among other things, avatars, a revamped menu interface, Netflix support, and so on.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
If Sony is smart and wants to stay competitive as well as not lose any more ground to the 360,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
they'll have home out by then.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I may be proven wrong on this.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
you can send me your friend request on Playstation Network.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
As my Xbox Live gamertag suggests, my Playstation Network handle is Spazinator.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Well, that won't get pulled or anything.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
There you go, an email from Spazinator.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
The Gradius level is well done.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Who knows? It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But then again, it is Sunday.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
But not in Europe. Shit.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
It's going to be Monday morning.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I just found LittleBigMacross.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I think it might actually be Sony.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Interesting.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
You're right, I am assuming that.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I don't know.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
All right.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Well, we have a little more news to get to.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send those emails.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
As far as that previous email and the whole release date, you know,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
So, you know, if they could one-up Microsoft by making their thing better, they'll wait.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
But they'll have it out by Christmas.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Which doesn't leave a lot of time, because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before, you know, the Thanksgiving rush.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But I don't work for Sony.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I don't know what they think sometimes.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
We'll see.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
That's awesome. I was watching a video.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
They have SAC to the future.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I'm sure that level got pulled off.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Oh, this is sweet.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I'm telling you, Jimmy, best game I've played in years.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I'm looking at the Macross level.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
It's an amazing game. Amazing.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So anyways, something that's come actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You know, installs.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Well, now they have an...

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Final Fantasy Dissida, or whatever, on the PSP now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Well, that too.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I don't know.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And it says they have different install options. You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Alright.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So, very interesting.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Indeed, very interesting.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
That's my option.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Retertainment asks a good question in chat. Does this further facilitate piracy? I don't think so.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It's so rampant anyways.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
True.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Very true.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though. There's plenty more to come in Part B.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:49.000
We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Not episode, the start of the next segment.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
We.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So, alright.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And Dark Sakura joined us in the middle of Part A.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
And we want to talk about something.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was-

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Oh shit, we always talk about leather stuff.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
If we can talk about sandwiches and check food, we can talk about this too.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Because it's a topic that's come up on our show before.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And, you know, Orange Lounge Radio started with this whole concept of, it was kind of inspired by two different things.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It was inspired by the previous show I was on before, Understation Live, which is obviously, as you know, still kicking on the All Games Network in its new form.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
You know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:05.000
So, obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:24.000
No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, you know, just the fact that we have elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And, you know, I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And it's really great things are going to happen here in America, I think, on that front.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:42.000
But it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, you know, Proposition 8 took away the right here in America, not America, sorry, in California of same-sex couples to marry.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida, and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California you took something away by passing Proposition 8.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Gay couples were allowed to marry in this state from period of June till now.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And you took that away by passing Proposition 8.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And it's been difficult for me, you know, as an openly gay gamer here on this show, which, you know, obviously that topic comes up once in a while.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And I'm pretty sure I gave a pretty angry rant about it in previous episodes.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So I've just been kind of trying to think about it.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
That's one other thing that's kind of been weighing on my mind this time that we've had off here.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And what really surprised me in a very positive way was a lot of the emails that I got from listeners.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And it was not just one, I'm talking several emails from listeners that were kind of like apologizing even though it's not their fault.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook from a friend who was apologizing because it was their fault.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And, I don't know, I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And it's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is, what are you so afraid of?

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
What is the big deal?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
If people you don't even know, aren't required to associate with, get married.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000
And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage, that is not true.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:54.000
In a civil union, if I pass away, my partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.000
If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.000
and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
that could be a real issue in a lot of families.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So there's one, one's enough, there's a difference.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
There's more than just the one, but one's enough.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So it's not the same thing as civil unions.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
You're not protected, all this BS.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
By using children and this whole schools thing.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Logic tells you they were lying.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Here's the logic.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Gay marriage was already legal.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And here's my other question.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So what?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
If they teach it in schools, so what?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Trust me, folks, these kids are going to hear it.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
in very difficult parts of my life were right.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And do you think it's something I chose?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I assure you, I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It was not a choice.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
This is the way I was born.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.000
This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
DarkSakura, where were you today?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I was at the Repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
and it was amazing.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
What kind of things were going on?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
There were just a lot of speakers.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
until I got closer.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:16.000
One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
They were all very good.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
There were a couple speakers there.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
One of them was a school commissioner.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
She was there with her family, and they managed to get in

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
right before they weren't doing any more weddings.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
So she was there with her family.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:40.000
A big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
in schools, I don't know. I believe them.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Well, another one.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
She was just saying that she gave this really great speech

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000
just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and that was pretty crazy to hear about.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
There was just a lot of really good energy there today.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting is how many people were.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000
This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000
We're saying that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
This has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California,

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000
and I don't see anyone really offering anything about it,

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
that any amendment to our Constitution basically only takes a simple majority

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
when our budget takes a two-thirds majority.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
You know Prop 2 passed, right?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Yeah, the chicken thing.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Prop 2 is a waste of money.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It's a funny contradiction, you know what I mean?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it, I've put in six and a half years on this show.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I can take ten minutes to get political.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I'm so angry mostly at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country on one hand,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.000
and then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
You think some people would know better.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
It's just disgusting.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And you can say this whole, well, can't the majority talk?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Is this the way it's going to be?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
No, because you know what?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.000
The majority isn't always right, and that's what's happened in the past.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
What we've seen happen in the past is that...

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
The majority is uninformed and lied to.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
That's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
But what this has really done for this community,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and I'm not talking just the gay community,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
is it's really mobilized it.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And I think in a way, especially on the tail end of what you see happening with the whole Obama,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
yes we can, rah rah rah, I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I just hope they're on the right side.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
History says they will be, but I don't know, maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
But what can we do? What do I bring it up?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Well folks, you've been on Xbox Live, you've been on these things,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
you've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up, on World of Warcraft,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar,

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000
why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar, he signed onto his Horde character,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and said, what's your problem, fag?

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games, because you know what?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000
When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian,

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I don't give a shit who you are, stop it.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
There is nothing to be afraid of, and when you say that stuff,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.000
you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it, it's different.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Because this is where this all stems from.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.000
So just knock it off.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And I guess that's all I have to say.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Well, it's ridiculous anyway.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Alright, but when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
and go to a happier place where I rule things, like in populace, yeah.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
One more politically?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Sure, sure, sure.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Fuck you, majority voters of Arkansas.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That's a whole other issue that, oh my god, I could spend another episode on that.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That earned its own F.U. too.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Say what?

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
You know what happened in Arkansas?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Only married couples can adopt.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
But what about, I don't know, what about-

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
How many more children does that put into the system?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
They can't even foster children.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
It's not just adoption.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
and grandma's husband died.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It makes no sense. It's so flawed.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
This all spurns from people's-

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.000
It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
One would hope.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000
So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Because that's what you did this week.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Back to video games.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Alright.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Activision has taken away some songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour's servers.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:06.000
The GH-Toon service that they have available basically, of course, is not a big surprise.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:14.000
It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like mainstream songs and that kind of thing.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
So they only want your original stuff on there.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And they're going to promise to delete any copyright unfriendly material.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use, too.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:54.000
So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
To emulate it or what have you.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Only to end up having it deleted.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:09.000
And one of the things though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Unless someone else throws it up there.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:22.000
But maybe, I don't know, you should throw it up there and not name it Zelda theme or something like that.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
That would not have been a good idea.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
So, I don't know.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Pretty soon, if it expands to stay there, it's going to be really hard to monitor it.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last ten minutes of the show in chat room right now.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
So sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000
But has there been any really good original works to come out of this, too?

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
All I hear about, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels, too.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
But I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Here's what I'd be curious about. A little indie band, the type that's trying to publicize through MySpace,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
putting their own song in Guitar Hero, if it's even possible.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I don't know to what extent you can even do it.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
But would that be okay?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I'm sure it'd be okay if it's like that, because it's their own stuff.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And probably if they're in a little indie band like that anyways.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And Bobby's in chat right now and says,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid Music Creator mode like me.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Yeah, and we're going to get into some other stuff about the Music Creator mode and the Guitar Hero tunes thing and stuff.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
It just sounds less and less appealing as time goes on.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Alright, let's talk about Rock Band, the other music game that's still out there, still kicking and still releasing new expansions.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And there is a download pack coming out very soon.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
And you know the song Everlong is from that album. It's already in the game.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
And it's a lot of fun to play, even if it's a bitch.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
But there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Monkey Wrench, I believe, was one of the singles there.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
My Hero, of course, is another big song from that album.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
So the Color and the Shape, definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters, is the next release.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free Rock Band songs have started to hit as well.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Yes, I downloaded those. I haven't played any of them by downloading them.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
That's awesome.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000
My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2. Our band now is in the top 500.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Interesting. Wow.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Dang, he must be really good.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
He is really good.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
That's cool. Good for him.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I distracted him, though. I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I still haven't gotten my Susie and the Banshee songs.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Here's the thing.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I really need to do that.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I have a new drum set I bought. I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And I'm not playing it until I get my Rock Band symbols for it, which supposedly are coming in tomorrow.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Cross our fingers.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So hopefully, once I get the symbols, I'll start playing my new drum set.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
But until then, I'm not touching it.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Alright, we'll see what happens.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
But there's other Rock Band news, yes?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
There is. Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:46.000
First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:53.000
But, you know, I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
But here's what's going up.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That's a cool song.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts Angels and Airwaves, Just When I Needed the Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes Finally.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
You know what?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
See?

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
These are all...

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
No, I know, I know, I know, they're already download songs that are on the CD, but I'm just saying, that song does rock.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I've played it.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
It needs to be in... anyway.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
This one, it's like my favorite Police song.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Monkey Gone to Heaven by The Pixies, yay.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Rio Duran Duran, Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue, Simple Man, Leonard Skynyrd, Snow Hayo by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails, This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy, which I like that song too.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Time Is Running Out by Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Zero Smashing Pumpkins.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Not a bad track list.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Not at all.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:03.000
What's kind of neat about that though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Like the Pixies track was from the album release, the Hayo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:19.000
It's kind of interesting, it's not just single track releases they picked from, it's really a smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band, which I think is interesting.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Yeah, and what's also cool about that too is once again, with this, you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Oh, that's kind of neat.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Yeah.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
How would that work on the Wii though?

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
On the Wii? I'm not sure how they're going to, I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:49.000
It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
So, I don't know, soon I guess.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000
This is just like printing money though for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game though.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I mean, you're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing, this thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
But, it's just, you know.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And if you think about it, if you're looking for a really cheap guitar game, like you just want something to play, I mean, you literally can go out there and buy a used, I saw a used Rock Band guitars for like 12 bucks.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks, here you go, for less than 50 bucks you can have like a Guitar Hero type of thing.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
That's a nice way of getting around it, I like the way you think.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Actually it's funny, through the Microsoft training site that I'm a part of, they had Guitar Hero Aerosmith guitars for 99 cents.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Really? I need one of those.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Well, they're not available now apparently. They put them up on the old site because they're revamping it and they're doing a new site or something.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
But they're like, these won't be available until the new site comes out.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller. Still.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Hey, that's, you know, that top 500 bands? Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:16.000
You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar in game bundle, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I might just go back and pick that up instead. I don't know.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Those guitars are dirt cheap, especially like game solving stuff. Interesting, really cheap.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Anyways, so Guitar Freaks Drummania, you know, that spawned the whole guitar music game thing anyways.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Well, there's a new arcade release in Japan, Guitar Freaks V6.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing! With four exclamation points. That's so awesome.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
And, you know, it seems to be like fire themed, so that's kind of cool.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you could believe it or not,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:10.000
570 plus, I guess, in all. That's freaking crazy. Over 570 songs?

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
It must be. My god, that's huge.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
How would you scroll through that damn list?

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I don't know. Location testing soon, I guess. And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drummania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That's nuts.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
That is a lot.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:42.000
And you know what? I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which, by the way, I just wanted to say, quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I just, to go back to what I said, I blame society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:18.000
But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:25.000
So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat, that's just kind of what I wanted to say.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:31.000
But, I want to say, regarding games, SSG100Matt says, the Microsoft employee store has Gears of War 2 for $25.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Which would mean that employee stores always have games that are cheap. In fact, I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I stole a copy of Boom Blocks I barely touched.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Well, this is a little different than the employee store. This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Like, you can get games for the 360 or the first party set for 9 bucks. It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:02.000
But, you know, they're revamping it. They're redoing it because, I don't know, I guess it needs it.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And SonicM88 says, the Explorer is still the best, Rob.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And Act F says, Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking. Which sucks.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
8 bucks will buy you-

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Controller surgery!

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
No seriously, 8 bucks will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Really? Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Oh, I forgot to mention that-

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
We're all over the place today.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Yeah, that's cool. In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Really?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I played Supernova at that one game store.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out. I can't exercise still for another week and a half. It's another reason I didn't go out today.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Just because of the timing of what was going on today.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.000
And just, I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And so I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.000
It was fun. It was fun, but I mean, I'm totally out of shape for DDR anymore.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.000
But I still play doubles, so I don't know if, you know, I could probably go back to singles and do that a little bit more.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
But still fun. I don't know. Supernova was fun.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Anyhow, let's talk crazy. Let's talk real crazy.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Crazier than anything I've brought up so far on this show. Very fucking crazy, okay?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
It's this guy, in fact, so crazy that I have to bring in the background music.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000
This guy is Jonathan Lee Riches, and apparently he's spending his time in South California.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Or, sorry, South California, which pretty soon might happen, who knows.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.000
South Carolina, he's spending his time in a South Carolina prison suing people.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
He sues a lot of people.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
But one kind of particular interest of note that he's been suing, he sued Blizzard.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
and fought cyber monster gangs.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
So in other words, here's somebody saying,

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000
it's Blizzard's fault that I can't separate game from reality.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:39.000
No. That's called, um, he's stupid.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
There's no such thing as video game addiction.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000
There are OCD people out there. This guy is just stupid.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.000
dumbs down the whole thing. But it's crazy to think that there are people out there

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
that rationalize this like his lawyer.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Or better yet, why are we letting inmates sue?

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
The lawyer's getting paid if he wins or not.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Why are we letting these inmates sue everybody? That's just retarded.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
What else are you going to do when you're in prison?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
So that, you know, we don't have this shit.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
You only get three.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Oh, sure. Tyra will solve everything.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
She can give him a stern talking to.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
There's no Oprah to deal with him.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
And I want to point out, it's a hand written.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Oh my god.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I'm actually looking at the text and this is a hand written testimony there.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And it all fits on one page. My god.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Pertainment asks, can I sue Fanta for being awesome?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Seriously, that's retarded.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And the fact that it's hand written, that's also retarded.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I mean, dude, get a typewriter. At least.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I don't let you have typewriters in prison.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
This caused Riches to commit fraud to buy defendants' video games.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Riches chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Riches' mind became a living video game.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I hold defendants liable and support plaintiffs.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Why is he referring to himself in the third person?

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I think it's like a lawyer or something. I don't know, but anyway.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Why did the lawyer then hand write all that?

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
You know what? Obviously they gave Jack Thompson a license, so you know.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Yeah, but eventually people got their brains straight and took away his license.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300-some-odd episodes,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:07:03.000
you know what segment's coming next.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
It's a comment from Marissa in chat.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000
The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here forever, who needs to come back, by the way.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
You learn something new every day on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Marissa says, I work in law. I've seen hand-written pleadings. They're so funny.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Apparently this is not uncommon.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Anyhow, sorry. F.U.'s of the week time.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
F.U. to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
And Prop 2.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
And for... because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Okay, I understand we love the animals, but for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop...

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:51.000
and sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8 is just stupid.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000
You know, that's why you've got your nose turned up because all you can smell is your own shit.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And it don't smell good.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I voted yes on Prop 2 because I thought chickens that got to stand up would taste better.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Which actually is partially true, in a way. It really is.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000
This is what people are ignoring with this. First of all, chickens are stupid.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Well, yeah.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
But let me finish what I'm saying.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Second of all, for however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into making up these, you know, getting up to these new standards,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:46.000
And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is,

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.000
for people losing their homes left and right, who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.000
There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple, you know,

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:06.000
financial impact this is going to have on everybody, you know, just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
It's just stupid.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Get those Nevada chickens.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It's a frivolous waste of money because people...

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:22.000
I blame liberals.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
All right, let's move on.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I also want to say, F.U., the people that voted yes on eight, but not necessarily...

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.000
They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything, and they were showing...

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.000
They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on eight party or whatever,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000
and it just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I'd like to actually add another F.U. then.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000
To the Mormon Church, F.U. on boycotting all your businesses.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I don't know. It just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's all right, you know.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
So, F.U. that, I guess.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And F.U. the fact that there was another proposition that has passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000
when, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people...

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:18.000
It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like, you know, time of war or something like that.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
They just have to be enlisted in the military to get these extra benefits,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
and trust me, they get plenty of benefits as it is already, so F.U. that.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
And the chickens, well, I just vote on that because it tastes.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same F.U. I'm just going to say F.U. to intolerance.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:50.000
And I was really surprised to learn this week, in all walks of life, in all places in my life,

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.000
wherein there is still intolerance, and we have a lot of work to do.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
That's it.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
All right.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Moving on, gaming news, gaming deals, games that are steel.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
What do you mean?

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Tabula Rasa.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But I'm bummed.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Yeah, Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Really?

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Yes.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents?

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Yes, I checked.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Or if you want to translate that into a...

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Is that with free shipping?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
No.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Damn.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
It's also, it would translate to 61 pence, by the way.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000
So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.000
But they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:50.000
hammer space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.000
first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I'm actually half-tempted.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Tabula Rasa was not terrible.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I'm thinking about it too.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000
It's a month of play for five bucks.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Why not?

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
It might be worth a look.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I'm kind of curious.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I honestly do think this is the tactic.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I mean...

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
It is a very interesting way to get people on board, because that's what they'll make

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
their...

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game, because the retailer

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
gets screwed there.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
which I won't do.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
If the game sucks, it sucks.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I'm just thinking about buying it.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Just to have.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Yeah, to go in the collection.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000
It is a Lord British game.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Commander British or whatever his name is.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
I do have a soft spot in my heart for Ultima.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
It's a very tiny, soft, squishy spot, but it's there.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.000
But you say that and I still think of Salamander.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.000
You know my friend was trying to get me to come back to Final Fantasy XI?

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Who?

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Oh, one of my online friends.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
But...

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
You know what?

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
There's two words to say.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
What?

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Hell no!

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
That's kind of sadly what I had to say.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Rob, buy life.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Rob?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
What?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
What?

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Are you going out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
When?

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Thursday?

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
No, I probably won't go by at midnight.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Everybody's E-peen is going to make them go on there first.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
I like Ragnarok.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It's free.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
You go girl.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
You go!

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.000
You keep going!

02:13:50.000 --> 02:14:05.000
So, the DSI just was released, and it's apparently allowed the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
slash hacking carts, it's prevented them from working.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSI has already been hacked.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.000
We've already got, yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:30.000
developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World program, and apparently

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000
it was done also with something that has been exploited on, I'd like to, for once, on this

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Hello World program, I'd like to, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
to simply print Hello World on the screen.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000
In Commodore BASIC, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
20, go to 10.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Hello Piracy!

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.000
But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:08.000
which, for people that know, the PSP was done the same way, and it seems to be something

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000
that's pretty typical, so, surprise!

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:19.000
You know, where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Especially now with SD card support, man, that's gonna make things even easier, because

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
you know what that means?

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I know, we kinda knew this was gonna happen when they announced that SD card slot was

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
gonna be on there, right?

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Yeah, can you imagine that, though?

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
With SD card support, all you're really gonna need to do is load a program, and then you're

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
gonna be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
You won't even need a cart!

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
It'll be even easier to hack open!

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Woohoo!

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Alrighty, well, guess what?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Speaking of hacked, apparently, something has been hacked out of the Xbox Live Marketplace.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
You remember how a while ago, Xbox, they were threatening to delist games based on a Metacritic

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
score and or sales, basically, was the thing?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It apparently appears the first casualty may have disappeared, the game is gone, Yaris

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:19.000
But, here's the question, and by the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000
What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:31.000
something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Or, you know, this game did come out about one year ago exactly, is it some type of contractual

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:44.000
thing going on where, you know, it was a Toyota promotion, it was basically a game advertisement,

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
did the ad run out?

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
It probably did.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:55.000
And Bobby Blackwell swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And I wouldn't be surprised at all.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
coming for you?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.000
No, it was just, it was a big advertisement game, that's why it probably sucked in the

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
first place.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Who puts that much effort into an ad game?

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Citar Hero was cool.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Yeah, Citar Hero was kind of cool.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
But I hope I don't lose those achievements, that'll piss me off.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Probably not.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.000
That's good.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Well, how about something cool?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Alright, how about it?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Dead Rising 2.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Oh, hey, cool.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Yep.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
They're supposed to be, well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000
by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Insider info.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Yep.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000
No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything, but hey, maybe

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
it'll be.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I mean, no.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Zombies!

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Exactly.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
And malls.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I guess that's true, it might not be a mall.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Oh, how about an airport?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Where do you think the zombie outbreak's gonna happen next?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
An office building.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Hmm.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
During the lunch hour.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Mmm, brains.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
It's what's for lunch.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Rob, you need to play the song.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
What?

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
This is a Jonathan Coulton song.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Ah, later.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't have it right now.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
But Dead Rising 2's, Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Fix the saving.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Fix the saving.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Fix the saving.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
There you go.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
And rocket launchers.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Or rocket launchers.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Or rocket launcher save guns.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Rocket launcher save guns.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Could be awesome.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Another thing that could be awesome is some more stuff that could be coming out.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:07.000
And Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Some sound ordinary, one sounds really weird.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Of course, they just put out Alien Crush Returns, which is really awesome.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii shop.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
And probably coming over here at some point as well.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:34.000
First they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
That's not QQ Sports when you lose.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Not QQ.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
It features online play for one of the four players.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
And allows you to either do motion control or button based play.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:51.000
The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
That sounds kind of cool.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000
And it's weird.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:08.000
It's sort of like a racing game, but you play a pit crew that fixes different things.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:14.000
From fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Well, how exciting.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000
What did you do on your Wii today?

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I fixed a toilet.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Awesome.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
You did what Wii with your toilet?

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Besides a toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Beer Pong?

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
No, it's not Beer Pong.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
They changed the name, remember?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Pong Toss or something like that. Wasn't that what they called it?

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Something like that, yeah.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Anyhow, Burnout Paradise.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Man, they just keep trying to make this game better.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
And to some extent, they're succeeding.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Because this is very, very cool.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
It's something coming out from, of course, Criterion Games.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
The folks behind Burnout Paradise.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
It is actually...

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Now, they don't say it's a DeLorean, but it looks a lot like one.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Yeah, there's no licensed cars in this game.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
But it's the Legendary Cars Pack.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
And they call this the Jansen 88 Special.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Well, who was the creator of the DeLorean?

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Exactly. So that's what it is there.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Seriously.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Dude, is there a McLaren clone in there?

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:37.000
They also have cars called the Cavalry Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not so DeLorean,

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000
is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And if you push the L3 button, it will hover.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I'm looking at that in the screenshot.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
It's hovering.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
It will go in the hover mode.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
You know what those other ones are? The Bootlegger.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
That, of course, is the General Lee.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
And the other one, Kit.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Sweet!

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000
What do they call it, a car?

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Oh, that's what these other ones are.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000
That's what the other ones are.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000
GT Nighthawk.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.000
GT Nighthawk, yeah.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I get it.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Well, that's pretty awesome.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
And bless those folks at Criterion Games,

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Bird Out Paradise.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game,

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Plus, they didn't make the show roll.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
They have a new party thing.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
It's like Burnout Party or something like that,

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
that's coming out in February, I think.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And it's basically the game with all the updates that they've added so far,

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
and I think some of the download content.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
But they are having a new party mode that will be downloadable as well,

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.000
that they're going to add some different Pass the Controller games and stuff.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
They're adding, I think instead of putting it on another Burnout game,

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
they'll just keep adding to this one.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Yeah.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I'm glad I kept it now.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.000
I think I still kept mine.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:19.000
I'm not sure, but either way, I can rebuy it if I have it,

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000
and also if you own the PlayStation 3, you can just download it.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
That's true.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
You can't always just download it on the PlayStation 3.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
It's in their little store.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.000
That's pretty cool.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Yeah.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Good for them.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Good for them, giving us our money's worth.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money,

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
actually referring to economy,

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:44.000
is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:50.000
where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:55.000
You basically will be able to take empty space station areas

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:00.000
and put in stores, put in shops, customize them however you want to,

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:05.000
make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000
You can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency,

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
you know, that type of thing.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So it sounds pretty cool.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
What is this, Quark the Game?

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:20.000
But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.000
where you can take command of a ship.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Hmm.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Maybe.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Maybe.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
A bit.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Eve definitely has its following, though.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Oh, come on.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
They're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I'd prefer the chess game.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
But it's kind of neat.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.000
You know, Eve's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO,

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I've never played it myself.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Mm-hmm.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
So speaking of community, there's, of course,

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
the whole Guitar Hero songs that are available online,

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000
lots of community-made stuff.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Well, Activision wants to expand that.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
They figure, you know, hey, this service is so awesome

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000
because we're so awesome for coming up with such an original idea.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
They said that so far, just in ten days,

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000
that Guitar Hero Tunes has attracted over 25,000 user-generated songs,

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
probably many less now that they've taken them all down,

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.000
and will likely have up to 100,000 songs by year's end.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
These songs are easily downloaded by consumers,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and the ability to offer these songs on a subscription basis

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:50.000
may very well result in the newest subscription opportunities in our portfolio.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
That's an awesome idea.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000
and decide, oh, guess what?

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
You're going to have to pay for it now.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Nice.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
And it's not going to have any songs that are actually based on other things.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
It's just all original stuff.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Yeah, that'll fly.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
The other thing that you should know, too,

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000
is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.000
In fact, they said that Activision's 09 lineup is 40% larger,

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
and of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
and multiple Guitar Hero releases

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Interesting.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
You want to hear something else that's also interesting?

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Remember when they purchased them

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:41.000
and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
You know why they got rid of them?

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Because they can't keep making sequels for them.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
That's why.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
They even came out and said that.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
That's why they didn't pick up those original games,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.000
because they only want games that they can make sequels for.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
There's been many Ghostbusters games.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Well, you can only make so many.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
That's not true.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000
They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters II.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
That was one of those 386 SX games.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Would that be something that would be easily...

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Would they be able to convince the writers and the actors and stuff

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
to be able to continue doing it?

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
They don't need them if they have the IP.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Just saying.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I don't know.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I don't think that would work.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
That's why.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
We're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Remember, there's maybe a World War II and a Modern and Future War.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I think this guitar whoring thing is going to really blow up in their faces

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
if they don't start playing it smarter.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
They've got to innovate these franchises or they're going to disappear.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
But then again, DDR games are still selling, aren't they?

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Yeah, but DDR, though, they only do...

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000
It's only one game a year, but it's one game on each platform.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
I mean, if they just decided, hey, let's just release one...

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
I think they should just do that with one title

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
and release it on all the platforms.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Just make it, you know, downscale the videos or something like that

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I think they should do that.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I'm going to get Universe 3. That's out there in the wild now, isn't it?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
So many games.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000
It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
They basically give away the full song list.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
They don't leave anything secret, so there's no joy in unlocking stuff.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And it's just, you know, each title is kind of hokey in its own way.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
All right.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
But Guitar Hero is going to get the same way.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.000
They're going to have, you know, each one is going to be for a different band.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And they're going to make it...

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into, say,

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I don't think they're going to do that.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I think Rock Band will, because they've been doing that so far.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
But I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new,

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
DJ Maxx on the PSP.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this,

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
because until now you've had to import this game.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
But there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
It's DJ Maxx Fever.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.000
DJ Maxx Fever, now, it was going to come out in November,

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
but sadly the game got delayed.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
It is delayed a couple months.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
It's now going to come out probably January-ish, is what they're looking at.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But the good news is they're supposed to be going back to make it actually

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
compatible with the PSP 3000.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Remember, it kind of had its own issues going on there with the PSP 3000,

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.000
with the whole scan lines and all that stuff.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000
So they're going to go back and fix that to make sure everything works with all

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.000
the PSPs, and they're going to put in new gear, new items,

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000
and apparently some extra hidden content.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
So apparently the wait won't be all bad for fans of DJ Maxx.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000
And also, the PSP sounds like it's not going to be the only place

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
to catch DJ Maxx Fever.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Apparently DJ Maxx Technica is coming to arcades,

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:59.000
and that's not DJ Maxx coming to special Korean arcades

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
that you can only find in very limited places in America.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Nope, this is actually being licensed to come out in America this December.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Here's the interesting thing about the game, though,

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
and how it's different from Beatmania.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
It uses a touch screen.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line,

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000
which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.000
But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Maxx.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
After all, half of the charm in these games is the music.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.000
You know, this game almost reminds me that they're...

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
It's almost like they're trying to compete with Jubeet on this.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000
It is very interesting.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the US,

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:41.000
and very interesting because between this, Street Fighter IV, Tekken 6,

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000
arcades are slowly getting a little love again.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Technica is going to plug into the internet for global leaderboards,

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
because that means you can get new songs right on the internet,

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000
and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
And I believe there's some type of DJ Maxx soundtrack

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
that you can get that comes with one of these cards,

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
so you can get started.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
There you have it. And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you,

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
it's U-Beat.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
That's why I said I should be U-Beat. I corrected myself.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Oh, there you go.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Sorry.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
There you go, and apparently some test locations for DJ Maxx Technica

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.000
are going to be released soon, so some folks that have been playing this game

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:34.000
on a more cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year,

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
in 2009, or it might not. We'll see.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.000
But I don't know. I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golf Land

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
that that touchscreen is going to turn to shit,

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.000
but it sounds cool.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Sounds like it might work.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.000
All right. Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
were probably thinking towards the end of Part A,

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
hey, where's Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week?

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000
We tune in every week to hear Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
And we didn't hear it tonight during Part A.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Well, that's because Dark Soccer got here a little earlier than anticipated.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000
We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Yep.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:21.000
So get ready to experience a game from gaming's history

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
as Dark Soccer goes through her archives and picks a game

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
that you all should be playing right now.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Absolutely. The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
which-

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
And what a choice.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:45.000
And I love the intro to it, okay?

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:53.000
But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X,

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
which is my favorite Castlevania game,

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000
where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
You're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard,

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:14.000
trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:20.000
The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it,

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.000
where you have different areas that you're exploring,

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
and you have to move through the different areas.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.000
You hear different weapons on the way.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Really, it's just a lot of-

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
This game is just completely unique,

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000
as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
We've also had various other releases.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I've got the Saturn version, which is actually graphically not my favorite,

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
because the Saturn did the other 3D as well.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:59.000
You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game,

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
you can play as Richter, which is really cool.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:08.000
He's got his own attacks and everything.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:15.000
But basically, through the game, you have an RPG element to the game,

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:22.000
where you've got your familiars with you.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I love the sword familiar. The sword familiar was my favorite.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000
But you've also got interactions between characters that go in.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.000
You can even choose your path through the game,

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000
and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive,

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
It was done by-

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Wait, wait, here comes the best part.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Okay.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Dime monster, you don't belong in this world.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:00.000
I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Tribute? You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Your words are as empty as your soul.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
What is a man?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000
A miserable little pile of secrets.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Have at you!

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It is just this cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.000
One of the best gaming moments ever.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
This person though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing,

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
because they wait.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
When you're fighting Dracula the first time around as Richter,

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000
if you let yourself die, then Maria comes out and says,

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.000
all my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Or something like that.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.000
But I never needed her help.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Anyway, with the development of this game,

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000
actually there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Actually, there's a thing that was called Castlevania the Bloodletting,

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:17.000
which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in development.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:24.000
But the art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima,

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.000
doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D,

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:54.000
like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.000
There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
It's actually pretty cool.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.000
However, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version,

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000
which, you know, we've covered this and it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.000
If you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.000
It's a greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.000
But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions to come out,

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:39.000
and also there was the PSP version, this also has the Dart Priest's shaft.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Which is right up on the screen right now.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Which I just think is the greatest bad guy ever.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Yeah, it's the same shaft who was in Gameplay.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:38:00.000
This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
You know what I mean?

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000
This was also the first one I think that Igarashi was in development on,

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.000
so I think that it's his input that specifically brought this style about.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I got to meet him, that was so cool.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Anyway, there are some particular differences.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.000
The original name for this...

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him,

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000
he imported this game when it first came out, because he was that anxious to play it.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000
The original name of it was Akumajo-Jakula X Geka no Yasukyoku,

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:54.000
which is not Turn in the Moonlight, pretty much.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Which is why you've seen it referred to as both names.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
There are several differences.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:05.000
First of all, in the Japanese version it has two extra familiars.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000
There's the Sprite Familiar and the Nose Devil Familiar.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Basically the Sprite is a palette swap,

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.000
the Nose Devil basically is the demon one with a Tengu mask.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I will not.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:28.000
The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.000
that came with the Japanese version.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.000
I can tell you it's pretty sweet, it's actually really, really cool.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000
It's sort of like just a little behind the scenes thing of Alucard waking up

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000
and going off and kicking ass.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:52.000
There's also different versions of the last stage.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Basically, in the US version you saw it was called Bloodlines

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
when Richter's chapter started up,

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:07.000
and in the Japanese one it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows up

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
towards the end of the game boss fight.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I love playing as Maria.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.000
She just has some of her attacks are really hard to do.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:34.000
But there's different remixes that play of old Castlevania music,

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
depending on if you play as Richter or Maria,

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.000
There are actually really good mixes of them, too.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000
The load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Oh, that's not the game, sorry. This is somebody's spear run.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I'm looking at it.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Sorry.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:58.000
It actually has distorted sprites.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better,

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
and they just didn't take advantage of it.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.000
It was very rushed.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.000
But it did have two extra levels in the game.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.000
This is me being a nerd.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000
For anyone who has ever done this,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:21.000
when you're in the first level, you'll find a trapdoor that closes

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000
when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:30.000
There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trapdoor,

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
and it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave,

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
and then you go into another room down there,

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000
and in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room, that's all it is.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.000
In the Saturn 1, you go down that same series of cave, you know, there,

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:51.000
and it takes you into the underground garden, or whatever they called it,

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
and that was really cool. It was also kind of a difficult place to get through.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.000
But I don't know if this is true or not,

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.000
but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.000
in the original release and didn't,

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:12.000
because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000
if there was that little, you know, area.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
There's also another trick, though.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I know it works in the PlayStation version,

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000
where you can do like some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat,

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area,

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
which is really useful if you have the walk armor,

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle,

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
the better defense you have.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I know a lot about this game. I also know that it's a pain in the ass

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game,

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000
in my opinion.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000
But it's a freaking awesome game, and everyone should be playing it.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000
It was voted in 1998.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
It was the Game of the Year by EGM

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.000
and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Which was a bit controversial that year,

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000
because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I think this was better than Final Fantasy VII.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:09.000
This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy VII did.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
I played this game for hours at a time.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Me too, I love this game. I love it.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Did you bother getting your walk armor?

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:23.000
No, this came out during that period where I wasn't like hardcore into games,

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
because I was like in school.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
But I still played a lot of this game.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
We need to just sit down and play through it.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.000
It would be fun.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.000
It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Speed runs for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.000
They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy,

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
because if you really want to beat the game quickly,

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:52.000
you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.000
However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft,

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:02.000
call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Nice.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
So that earns the whatever reward.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
By the way, I just want to say also the great thing about this game,

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.000
speaking of the alternate ways you can do things,

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.000
what a surprise when you might think you're done with the game,

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.000
but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Oh, no, it really was such a surprise.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.000
It was crazy.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000
It was awesome.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it,

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
which I would hope is not that many people at this point,

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
but if you've never seen it, it's one of those moments where you're like,

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000
ah, goddamn.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:43.000
I mean, it really is fantastic.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:51.000
There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000
I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.000
There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
and you do your double jump in one particular place,

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.000
you can actually pop up under the librarian

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
and knock him into the ceiling.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Nice.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.000
And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, whee!

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000
It's true.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000
You can.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.000
That's awesome.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000
I'd like to see that.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000
And then there's the little chats with Maria,

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000
and Maria's kind of ickter.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I think she says ickter.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Like she's going to spit out acid in your eye.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.000
All right.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Anyway.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Well, what a wonderful game for the week.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night, if you haven't checked it out,

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000
that Dark Soccer brings up once in a while,

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
like games that were never released here or never will be,

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
So you've got to go play it.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.000
All right.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Let's do a couple more stories,

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000
then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:50.000
We've been running a little long

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.000
because of everything else we've been talking about,

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
but we will get to Skypline.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
We do want to take at least two calls

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Loki, more news.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Yes.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Of course, you know, I just made my costume and, yeah, that's cool.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.000
But if you want to make some other costumes,

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Indie Mogul, they have a...

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I guess it's like a podcast or video cast that they do.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
It's Backyard FX.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.000
And one of the segments that they just did

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:28.000
was how to build your own Halo 3 armor,

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
or your own Halo armor, I guess,

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
for under $100.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:35.000
And they actually have instructions on how to do it.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
It's done with paper.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.000
and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000
and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
But it can come out looking really cool

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
if you put the time and effort into it

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
and the videos are available online.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And it's pretty awesome.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
If you want to check it out,

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
visit indymogul.com.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.000
I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:06.000
All right.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.000
It's interesting because, you know, Halloween,

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
we had all the official Master Chief costumes,

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
which, granted, were a lot cheaper

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
because they were, you know...

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000
They looked like crap.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
They were like a hefty bag and a helmet.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:21.000
But, you know, it's kind of interesting that you can do this

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000
I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:33.000
or whatever cosplay stuff you want to, you know, use it for.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Very cool.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Well, one more story before we get to the Skype line tonight,

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
and it has to do with China

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.000
and something very interesting that they are thinking about doing on...

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Actually, or they are going to be doing on real money trades.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.000
You know what that is?

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000
That whole MMO thing, you know, where you basically trade money

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
for gold in the game.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Guess what?

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
China, the government in China,

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:57.000
they have now instituted a tax on real money transactions,

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
which, you know, if you think it's a big industry here in China...

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000
I mean, you know, if you play any MMO at length,

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.000
then you will hear the mandatory Chinese gold farmer joke in the game.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.000
You know, it's a huge industry in China,

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.000
and they've decided to tax it over there,

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:17.000
which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
for, you know, kind of money under the table,

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
They have just taxed it.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Twenty percent is the tax,

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
and this announcement just came out.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
It was distributed to local tax bureaus,

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.000
and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:38.000
from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Taxation officials are granted the right

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000
to determine the original price of the online virtual currency

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:48.000
if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Interesting.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Do you think we might be next here in America

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
to tax this kind of stuff?

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
We'll try, but I don't know if there's much, you know,

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
that they'll want to admit real money transfer.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
And it goes through these Chinese companies

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
and, like, foreign companies anyways.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000
I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax,

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
but, you know, I don't know.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
It would be very hard to police everything.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law,

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
if you ask me.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line,

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.000
We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Loki, while we wait for some calls,

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
do you have any last-minute stories for us?

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:34.000
Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.000
One I was going to mention,

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I don't know if this is out here anywhere,

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.000
there was a game that they showed off,

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.000
I want to say it was a Tokyo game show,

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.000
and it was teased in Famitsu magazine,

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:50.000
a Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross Edge.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.000
You may remember such similar games as Namco X Capcom

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
or Namco Cross Capcom.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Yep.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Well, this game right here, which is out on the PS3,

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.000
combines a bunch of things.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
So far, the ones that they've announced,

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000
all sorts of different companies are involved.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Idea Factory, Gus, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Compile Heart.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
It's a gaming orgy.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:16.000
It's seriously a gaming orgy.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.000
It features characters from Darkstalkers.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000
They have Morgan, Felicia and Dimitri,

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:29.000
R. Tonolico, Orica, Misha, and Shirelia.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Wow.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000
They've got Atona and Prina, Spectral Souls.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Pretty dude.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Monokimia 2.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.000
They've got Lilia, Rose, and Marie.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000
They have Kitchen Sink.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
They have everything.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
And you want to know what the best part about this is?

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000
It's coming out to the U.S. spring of next year.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Very nice.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Hey, I got a caller on hold.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Who's this?

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Solid Goomba.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Solid Goomba.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:03.000
I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright ban hammer on LittleBigPlanet.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Yes, please.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Speak away.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I haven't played the game yet.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.000
I just bought PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.000
But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I see it as a homage to the original IP,

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.000
like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
I think that's perfectly acceptable.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.000
And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such,

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:36.000
then they should also be going after DV and art users for making fan images.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Interesting.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000
I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of...

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:51.000
I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the...

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Oh, crap.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
The confines of the game, yeah?

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Yeah.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:58.000
I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:03.000
But, I mean, just to be devil's advocate a little bit, I think some of these levels are pushing it.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Like Gears of War-inspired levels is kind of pushing it.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:11.000
I mean, maybe it isn't even an IP thing at that point.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Sony just doesn't want that crap out there.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000
They don't want free advertising for Gears of War.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Yeah, but at the same time, no one's making money off of it.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:20.000
I guess that's true.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.000
But it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:29.000
But then again, as I understand it, Sony has been pulling levels about the PlayStation 3.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Right.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:43.000
But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that kind of, some would say, overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000
And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this, a Galaga level.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Yes.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:48.000
You know who made this one?

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Same guy did the Gradius level.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Did it just come out or something?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:51.000
No, he's got a bunch of videos.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.000
He also did a Tetris level.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
That's even better than the other one.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Oh my god.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
That's crazy.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Because they're in Japanese.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
And the company is a European company.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
They probably can't read what his level says.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Now, a comment from Chatroom, and I apologize if I mispronounced this name.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000
It's a new name I haven't seen before.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Sunchez? Sunchez? Sunchez?

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:14.000
I like cheese.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
So Sunchez says, uh, that's Two Zs.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
It says Two Zs, not Two Es.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
So Sunchez, maybe.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:25.000
I'm tired of playing Super Mario Brothers 1-1 again and again.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000
It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Brothers level 1-1.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:36.000
But even though, yeah, I'm sick of playing it too, there is that moment of, hey, cool.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
When you first see it, right?

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I don't know.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.000
So if you had this game, or you're going to be getting this game soon enough, Solid Goomba,

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.000
what kind of level are you going to make?

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Are you going to go and just make something original?

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Oh, I'm going to infringe.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.000
I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
There you go.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Awesome.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Hey, anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3 besides, you know,

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.000
because you're just now picking one up?

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
One more thought on the whole user-created content.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Please.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:18.000
I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the, like, you know, the PC.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
And if we'll see it any time soon?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:37.000
So who knows?

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.000
In a way, yes, I think so.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:45.000
It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember ten years ago,

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000
the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point,

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000
and the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems,

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000
you didn't have to have a monitor.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
You could hook it up to your TV.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:59.000
So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:05.000
and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
All right, thanks, man. Have a good one.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.000
You too, buddy. Take care.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
It's very interesting, you know.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:22.000
So much joking and funny things at Sony's expense,

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.000
but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind?

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I heard, you lucky bastard. How is it? Are you enjoying it?

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
It's pretty cool.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:58.000
It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Basically, the parties, the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I haven't tried it yet, but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:23.000
The interface, it's totally revamped. It's easier to use than the old one.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:33.000
I have still to get accustomed to it, but like I said, it's pretty easy to use the whole interface.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Huh. Very cool. Have you been able to try the Netflix? I don't know if you do Netflix.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:44.000
No, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh? Do they have the Netflix thing?

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Yeah, we don't have Netflix. Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.000
But I heard it's pretty cool.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:59.000
I imagine you spend a little time building an avatar. How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:04.000
It's pretty easy to use. It's pretty easy to create an avatar, though.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:11.000
What I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:19.000
You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:35.000
You have predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:41.000
So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Miis, and you could really customize that.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:50.000
But because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited is kind of the impression I'm getting.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Yeah, it's kind of limited. You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:14.000
But not like on the Wii that you have more choices to make.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Hey, quick question from SSJ100Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friendless limit in it?

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
I don't think they did.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:30.000
I really don't know. I'm gonna search that, but I think they haven't.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:37.000
I don't think they have either based on what I heard, but I was just curious. Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut. I don't know.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Well, Akdeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Well, it's pretty good. Like I said, I hope we Mexicans could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:07.000
From what I have seen and what I have played with, it's pretty good. It's a whole new experience for the Xbox.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico, even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent, I don't know, so be nice.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:17.000
I hope so.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Alright, well, Akdeft, have a good one, buddy. And have fun playing that experience I can't have right now, because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off, because I'd have surgery.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:38.000
Boohoo, QQ, cry cry. One more call. Well, I said two, but I'm feeling nice. Do one more call.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:43.000
1877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?

02:59:46.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me. Apparently the Melger Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Interesting. Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Oh, it's Spazinator.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:10.000
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment. In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell like video game soundtracks?

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:40.000
The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely, if ever, have soundtracks and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Video game soundtracks. CD Japan still in business? It's been years since I bought one.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:47.000
I'm sure they are.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Yeah, that would be one. There's other Japanese based sites too. I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Amazon Japan, I've ordered CD's from them before.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Playasia, that's right. Playasia soundtracks. Definitely Playasia, check them out. Because they sell games too if you want to get import games and all that stuff.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
So they specialize in that stuff.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
And toys.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:18.000
There you go. So there's some sites to check out. And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Also, as far as Guitar Hero will tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not. Have you noticed any issues with the main menu at all where the graphics and the menu would essentially glitch out?

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:52.000
No, I don't even own the game at all yet. And when I do get it, I'll probably get it on 360 because that's where I have all my rock band games and I want the guitar to be compatible with everything.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:59.000
But I haven't heard anything of that specifically. I've been hearing of bugs left and right in Guitar Hero.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:08.000
But not anything with the menu. Although, something about I'm hearing band mode. Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Well, so far just myself. One thing I noticed is that the initial logos and loading screen and whatnot will appear normal.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:39.000
But as soon as you get into the actual menu where there's solo play, options, so on and so forth, that's when the background gets all wonky. You can't even see what you're selecting. Stuff like that.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:03:00.000
You know, I haven't heard of anything. I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you. I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched. Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:04.000
And you said you had a comment or another question?

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar. Do you know what that's for?

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:36.000
I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal. Didn't we talk about this on the show a long time ago? You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller? They never used it. Wasn't it going to be for an Effector pedal at one point?

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:41.000
Yeah, and they even set it in the Guitar Hero 2 manual.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:49.000
But it just never happened. Never materialized. They opted for the fog machines instead. Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:56.000
It came out, I think. Did it really? I think it did. Why are we not in possession of one? Because they're a hundred bucks. So? And I haven't thought about buying it yet.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:06.000
I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog. It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want. Maybe not.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:35.000
Yeah, actually, I see it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Informer or official Xbox magazine, I forget which. And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago. And I think they may list a website where you can buy it. I can look it up and email you a link or something.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:53.000
It got really good reviews, too, because they actually made it. It's not just something that randomly does it with sound or whatever. They programmed in triggers in Rock Band 1 and 2 that will trigger different lighting and smoke effects based on what's going on in the game.

03:04:53.000 --> 03:05:05.000
That's so rad. It will actually sync up with it, and it's pretty awesome. I think they are available now. In fact, I should probably get one when I get my bonus. That'd be funny.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:11.000
First thing that comes up, Rock Band Stage Kid, available right now on GameStop.com. It will cost you twenty bucks to ship it, though.

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Why do we need this? Because, spoken lights! If you want me to gag, then get one. I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:47.000
I just want one in my house. No, I'm just kidding. We're not gonna waste the money on this. Loki, do not waste money on this. Ooh, alright. He's gonna do it. Hey, Spaznator, we gotta go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Take care, buddy.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Alright, sorry to those that didn't get through. I know there were a lot of people still trying to get through. It happens. Alright, yeah, you're right. You don't need it. Alright, any more last minute stories? I'm sorry, Loki. Or Dark Soccer. I don't know if you have any that you found.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Five. Is your last minute story? Yes. Awesome. There's also a glitch in Little Big Planet that will ruin your game.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:27.000
Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed, and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying. Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod, and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Oh man, that sucks. So, remember, once again, because- Oh god, and people are gonna put that shit on the internet. There'll be those custom levels. Hold on, hold on. Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that. Just back up your save. That's all you gotta do.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Yes, people could- Well, here's the thing. If you spawn in the level, and you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it. Just quit the game and say, fuck this. So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing. A giant death wheel. Don't make a towering death a wheel.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:14.000
There were some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet. There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest. It was as hard as those crazy games online that I want to be the guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:35.000
I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here. I'm just kinda going through some of them. One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're gonna do it. There's a 9-11 level where the guy flings a thing through buildings and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:47.000
The guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome. He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:08:04.000
And a BeatMania level. No, no BeatMania level. No, Bobby said on his show he did a BeatMania level as well. Really? Yeah. It's kinda crap, but it's supposedly BeatMania inspired. There's a good way to put it. But he says you won't find it on YouTube, it's in the game.

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:16.000
I was gonna show you this one real quick here, Rob. It's got poops in it and a butt that poops out those little Japanese cute little doody things.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:31.000
Oh please, please, I really want to see this. Hold on, I gotta find the part where it's at here. Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Okay, as you can see the butt right there. Can I just start it? Yeah, just start it. Okay. Did I hit it? Start. Oh. Little turds fall out.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster! That's amazing. Oh yeah. What will they think of next? I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...

03:08:53.000 --> 03:09:05.000
And then they have this other one that some guy made. It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome. It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race. It's like Excite Truck, but not.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:15.000
Alright, we're gonna get out of here. We gotta wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here. DarkSoccer, your final thought is poop. Loki, your final thought?

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:19.000
My final thought is I actually gotta start messing with this editor now. Looks awesome.

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:32.000
My final thought is pie. And for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:44.000
You know, all we ask is just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth. And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, BocoFett wrote a really nice one this week.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:58.000
The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world. The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:08.000
Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met but you know well. Aww. Almost makes you want to barf. It's so nice. No, but thank you very much for that nice review. Hope to see you soon.

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:11.000
I feel squishy, Rob. I need to go to the bathroom now.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:24.000
All right. You need to open up your poppet and hit the explode button. Little big planet joke. Anyhow, until next week, God, we've told you about 50 games you need to go out and play right now. Everything from Symphony of the Night to Little Big Planet.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:31.000
So go play some games and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
