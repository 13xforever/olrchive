00:00.229 --> 00:02.813
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to All Games Radio.

00:03.414 --> 00:08.000
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio, live.

00:13.988 --> 00:16.952
[SPEAKER_05]: The following program is intended for mature audiences.

00:31.223 --> 00:31.563
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.294
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:52.354 --> 00:58.617
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:59.017 --> 01:05.560
[SPEAKER_10]: And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:05.881 --> 01:07.041
[SPEAKER_10]: Not here yet.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.602
[SPEAKER_10]: She's running a little late tonight.

01:09.042 --> 01:09.523
[SPEAKER_10]: TechMasterLoki.com

01:32.065 --> 01:32.305
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:32.605 --> 01:33.146
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Loki?

01:33.446 --> 01:34.327
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.

01:34.987 --> 01:35.367
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

01:35.848 --> 01:39.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?

01:39.890 --> 01:45.995
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.

01:46.055 --> 01:47.616
[SPEAKER_10]: But how did you enjoy the time off?

01:48.296 --> 01:52.039
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what I did last Sunday, to be honest.

01:52.139 --> 01:53.160
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I played games.

01:54.417 --> 01:55.217
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:15.317 --> 02:31.933
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it so it was very late at night but you know I can't live without my cell phone alright well you started talking about games like Fable 2 so we'll ask you how was your gaming week Loki and we always like to start off the show with a little bit of that

02:32.373 --> 02:33.293
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week was alright.

02:33.353 --> 02:37.155
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.

02:37.215 --> 02:40.736
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.937
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play Fable 2 a bit.

02:46.297 --> 02:47.338
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly to cheat.

02:49.198 --> 02:50.739
[SPEAKER_09]: And how I cheated.

02:51.939 --> 02:52.839
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me count the ways.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.560
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I cheated to get lots of money.

02:56.241 --> 02:58.501
[SPEAKER_09]: And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property.

02:58.981 --> 03:00.502
[SPEAKER_09]: And then time travel.

03:01.850 --> 03:23.544
[SPEAKER_09]: and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again so I have lots of money now and then I decided to get lots of experience and the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own and you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything

03:24.344 --> 03:25.184
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I did.

03:25.565 --> 03:26.165
[SPEAKER_09]: I did all that.

03:26.325 --> 03:30.967
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I played a few missions, and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.

03:31.447 --> 03:33.408
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.

03:34.429 --> 03:37.270
[SPEAKER_09]: And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.852
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, now I am almost done with the game.

03:40.412 --> 03:42.253
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like two missions left, I think.

03:42.773 --> 03:44.294
[SPEAKER_09]: And that game is awesome.

03:44.594 --> 03:45.935
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a lot of fun.

03:46.415 --> 03:48.116
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.

03:48.176 --> 03:48.936
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they're

03:49.356 --> 03:50.577
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of hating me.

03:51.317 --> 03:53.498
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.

03:54.418 --> 03:56.559
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been winning with like over 20 points.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.282
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.

04:04.343 --> 04:05.783
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not really fun.

04:06.003 --> 04:12.846
[SPEAKER_09]: The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.

04:14.227 --> 04:14.687
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's alright.

04:15.643 --> 04:20.566
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.

04:20.646 --> 04:22.387
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a lot of activities.

04:22.527 --> 04:24.988
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate, you know, Saints Row 2.

04:25.028 --> 04:29.210
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.

04:29.911 --> 04:34.653
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2.

04:34.853 --> 04:35.774
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't plan on it.

04:36.074 --> 04:40.016
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.

04:40.816 --> 04:43.578
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.

04:44.690 --> 04:46.352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:00.307 --> 05:03.451
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.

05:04.112 --> 05:06.275
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's really cool.

05:06.755 --> 05:08.117
[SPEAKER_09]: Slightly offensive still.

05:08.297 --> 05:09.899
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.

05:09.939 --> 05:16.648
[SPEAKER_09]: Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.

05:16.908 --> 05:17.769
[SPEAKER_09]: His character's...

05:19.030 --> 05:20.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting, to say the least.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.571
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just leave it at that, interesting.

05:23.311 --> 05:28.692
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a fun game, and it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.

05:29.092 --> 05:35.573
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the thing, now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.994
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess.

05:38.514 --> 05:38.834
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Then, let's see, what else did I play...

05:45.546 --> 05:48.127
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo.

05:48.527 --> 05:50.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap, is that awesome.

05:50.268 --> 05:55.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.350
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.

05:56.430 --> 06:02.653
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.

06:03.553 --> 06:06.135
[SPEAKER_09]: So I gotta go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.

06:06.175 --> 06:08.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.

06:09.898 --> 06:24.010
[SPEAKER_09]: They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there, which is cool, because that game is really cheesy anyways, and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim, I guess, would be really fun.

06:25.011 --> 06:26.392
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're gonna have downloadable characters.

06:26.412 --> 06:28.654
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna have Obama and Sarah Palin.

06:29.015 --> 06:29.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh lord.

06:30.135 --> 06:30.776
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be funny.

06:31.697 --> 06:31.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

06:33.186 --> 06:33.867
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

06:51.334 --> 06:51.814
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

07:13.223 --> 07:15.584
[SPEAKER_09]: That's basically what I've been playing this week.

07:16.045 --> 07:17.385
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Fallout 3.

07:18.106 --> 07:21.347
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

07:21.387 --> 07:24.829
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.

07:24.869 --> 07:25.550
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just too much.

07:26.310 --> 07:30.012
[SPEAKER_09]: And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.

07:30.712 --> 07:34.034
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a lot of stuff.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.296
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and I got Resistance 2.

07:38.476 --> 07:39.517
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the other game I played.

07:39.857 --> 07:40.357
[SPEAKER_09]: Resistance 2.

07:41.038 --> 07:41.178
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

07:42.335 --> 07:48.663
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.

07:49.504 --> 07:51.487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not liking it as much as the first one.

07:51.567 --> 07:54.230
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what it is, is there's not a lot of setup.

07:54.310 --> 07:57.174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.

07:57.214 --> 07:59.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...

08:00.778 --> 08:09.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything, I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.461
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is just, it's too much.

08:12.241 --> 08:12.981
[SPEAKER_09]: Just too quick.

08:13.141 --> 08:18.402
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.

08:18.502 --> 08:20.223
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's been good.

08:20.383 --> 08:23.843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.

08:24.044 --> 08:27.104
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.

08:27.704 --> 08:29.885
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?

08:31.297 --> 08:33.980
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.969
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be about as big as, like, say... Maybe Assassin's Creed, but I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.

08:42.429 --> 08:42.870
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

08:43.370 --> 08:44.291
[SPEAKER_09]: But it'll be fun.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.635
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's one of those games that they could add, like, you know...

08:48.936 --> 08:50.117
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:10.197 --> 09:10.958
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to check it out.

09:10.978 --> 09:15.481
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not usually a big fan on the first-person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.664
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because it's not really a shooter.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.445
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't really call it a first-person shooter, right?

09:20.866 --> 09:23.508
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of a first-person, free-running sim.

09:23.568 --> 09:25.329
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I do love Portal.

09:25.389 --> 09:27.871
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first-person.

09:27.911 --> 09:29.493
[SPEAKER_10]: You shoot portals, so who knows?

09:31.174 --> 09:34.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.

09:35.497 --> 09:38.260
[SPEAKER_10]: CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.

09:39.180 --> 09:39.661
[SPEAKER_09]: They're okay.

09:39.761 --> 09:44.383
[SPEAKER_09]: It just takes a lot of getting used to because, like I said, I kept falling off the building a lot.

09:45.124 --> 09:49.887
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Anything else for your gaming week?

09:50.547 --> 09:50.867
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

09:51.267 --> 09:55.770
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me answer the questions in the chat room because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.692
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I'm here, so I'm doing fine.

09:59.372 --> 10:01.694
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer what Marin in the chat said...

10:02.694 --> 10:03.974
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:25.239 --> 10:30.420
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube and I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.501
[SPEAKER_10]: And they didn't put it in a jar for me.

10:33.481 --> 10:38.502
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't really get to... I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.

10:39.123 --> 10:46.264
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin.TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.

10:46.544 --> 10:47.165
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, Loki?

10:47.465 --> 10:48.885
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my gallbladder there on the left.

10:49.952 --> 10:51.814
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, did you vote?

10:51.834 --> 10:53.056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I went and voted.

10:53.096 --> 10:54.157
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very important thing.

10:54.177 --> 10:55.319
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope y'all did too, no matter what you did.

11:08.256 --> 11:09.017
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you did go vote.

11:10.078 --> 11:11.239
[SPEAKER_10]: I voted on the monorail.

11:11.319 --> 11:12.900
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, bullet train.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.181
[SPEAKER_09]: I was pro-monorail.

11:15.882 --> 11:16.502
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did vote.

11:16.562 --> 11:18.944
[SPEAKER_10]: I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.

11:19.044 --> 11:28.091
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was a little worried, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time, I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the car and go vote.

11:28.431 --> 11:31.013
[SPEAKER_10]: If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.

11:31.533 --> 11:31.954
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

11:33.314 --> 11:34.074
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm doing great.

11:34.575 --> 11:35.395
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel a lot better.

11:35.435 --> 11:37.295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.

11:37.395 --> 11:43.017
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including OLR.

11:43.357 --> 11:45.598
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to download it in case you haven't done it yet.

11:45.618 --> 11:48.559
[SPEAKER_09]: The free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.

11:48.579 --> 11:49.099
[SPEAKER_09]: I already did.

11:49.319 --> 11:50.319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are funny.

11:50.799 --> 11:54.440
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.

11:54.981 --> 11:55.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

11:55.501 --> 11:55.641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

11:55.861 --> 11:56.521
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted a card.

11:57.376 --> 11:58.637
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not that I really care.

12:15.350 --> 12:21.333
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out and I asked him to pick me up a game and he did it.

12:21.713 --> 12:24.074
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

12:24.474 --> 12:26.615
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.

12:26.915 --> 12:34.238
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it.

12:34.898 --> 12:36.459
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't really remember it at all.

12:36.499 --> 12:40.401
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I do, I remember thinking it was very much like...

12:41.454 --> 12:42.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my thing with Castlevania games.

12:43.056 --> 12:46.060
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.265
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.408
[SPEAKER_10]: They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.

12:52.648 --> 12:57.294
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait until Castlevania Judgment comes out.

12:57.394 --> 12:58.956
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll innovate you up the ass.

12:59.176 --> 13:07.044
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony Night is one hella good game, but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?

13:07.544 --> 13:09.005
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me miss them on the console.

13:09.646 --> 13:11.648
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.

13:11.728 --> 13:15.291
[SPEAKER_10]: I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.

13:15.351 --> 13:19.595
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.

13:19.916 --> 13:23.139
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.

13:23.539 --> 13:23.559
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

13:24.580 --> 13:26.561
[SPEAKER_10]: But keep in mind, Vicodin.

13:26.741 --> 13:28.522
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not really at my peak.

13:28.622 --> 13:33.505
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.

13:33.805 --> 13:35.186
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you try to hit it for massive damage?

13:36.365 --> 13:39.086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.

13:40.546 --> 13:45.407
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because it only applies to... I didn't have six axis on the DS, that's why.

13:45.827 --> 13:46.227
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't work.

13:46.948 --> 13:52.989
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do have six axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.

13:53.069 --> 13:53.749
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, I gotta read this.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.290
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta read this comment in chat.

13:56.790 --> 14:00.631
[SPEAKER_10]: Marin in chat says, Castlevania, Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.

14:01.011 --> 14:04.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.

14:06.354 --> 14:14.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, the other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called LittleBigPlanet.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.963
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as my thoughts on LittleBigPlanet...

14:17.934 --> 14:19.175
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

14:19.555 --> 14:24.299
[SPEAKER_10]: It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.821
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the sense of humor in the game.

14:27.662 --> 14:29.123
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the graphics look great.

14:29.523 --> 14:35.247
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.

14:35.748 --> 14:42.213
[SPEAKER_10]: I think even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.

14:43.374 --> 14:44.194
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

15:05.973 --> 15:06.453
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

15:27.262 --> 15:28.543
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

15:48.451 --> 15:50.516
[SPEAKER_10]: All the clones are never going to go away from the top page.

16:00.370 --> 16:00.890
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

16:29.165 --> 16:58.201
[SPEAKER_10]: and then it was interesting some levels I played you actually could unlock little stickers like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera and that was a sticker I unlocked because people were holding things up to the camera like in Bobby's level you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us Bobby Blackwolf on allgames.com he has a level he did during the beta and as a part of that you can unlock the all games logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox so

16:58.601 --> 17:21.282
[SPEAKER_10]: so but that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself but that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels so and to be honest even if you go in the non-copyright stuff there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with

17:21.923 --> 17:22.363
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

17:44.335 --> 17:47.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, people use the arrow stickers to point at things.

17:48.016 --> 17:56.679
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.660
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.

18:00.561 --> 18:09.384
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, like, if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the pop-it and just hover on it in a minute to show, you know, heart, good thing, heart.

18:10.404 --> 18:11.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, you can also hit people.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.365
[SPEAKER_10]: with your character.

18:14.605 --> 18:15.066
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

18:15.626 --> 18:17.286
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan.

18:17.426 --> 18:19.606
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.

18:19.787 --> 18:23.367
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.

18:23.387 --> 18:24.848
[SPEAKER_10]: A little tip from me to you.

18:25.308 --> 18:28.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Ace the first area, the little England area.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.509
[SPEAKER_10]: If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.

18:30.929 --> 18:37.950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge, but if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.

18:38.270 --> 18:40.911
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.

18:41.911 --> 18:42.651
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty awesome.

18:44.372 --> 18:47.652
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, as you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.

18:47.712 --> 18:49.913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot of fun and just exploring it.

18:50.073 --> 18:52.773
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so much more potential this game has.

18:53.153 --> 18:54.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the game have minor flaws?

18:56.334 --> 18:56.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

18:56.654 --> 19:00.655
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.

19:00.695 --> 19:02.795
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some frame rate issues sometimes.

19:03.135 --> 19:06.096
[SPEAKER_10]: When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.

19:06.576 --> 19:07.496
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

19:07.596 --> 19:07.936
[SPEAKER_10]: I look...

19:08.536 --> 19:09.477
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:35.919 --> 19:36.219
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.

19:36.960 --> 19:37.620
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to love it.

19:38.440 --> 19:43.023
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?

19:45.707 --> 19:46.548
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big investment.

19:47.468 --> 19:51.269
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.

19:52.490 --> 19:52.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.451
[SPEAKER_10]: You really have to weigh the pros and the cons.

19:55.491 --> 19:56.592
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, Christmas is coming around.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.732
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be getting gift certificates.

19:58.112 --> 20:01.734
[SPEAKER_10]: It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that other fancy stuff.

20:01.934 --> 20:11.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 40 gig system, or I'm sorry, the 80 gig system, and you get a $100 gift card.

20:13.752 --> 20:14.955
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20:22.472 --> 20:23.452
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

20:48.624 --> 21:08.737
[SPEAKER_10]: and between that and then knowing that Home is on the horizon and so on and so on I finally decided to take the plunge and honestly I've been liking the system we did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out but through the magic of patches and all this stuff they've been making the system quite a bit better and now the games are really starting to come out I use it a lot for streaming video files

21:09.457 --> 21:10.718
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do to my cat?

21:10.738 --> 21:12.379
[SPEAKER_09]: You will now become a new cat.

21:36.104 --> 21:36.925
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought it was interesting.

21:36.965 --> 21:41.508
[SPEAKER_10]: The place, honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.

21:41.868 --> 21:48.232
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's so odd to me that the freaking Microsoft Vista, what do they call that?

21:48.272 --> 21:49.853
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole media sharing media center?

21:50.173 --> 21:50.714
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole thing on the 360?

21:51.694 --> 21:54.156
[SPEAKER_10]: What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.

21:54.296 --> 21:56.057
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's slow, and it doesn't work.

21:56.217 --> 21:57.338
[SPEAKER_10]: If you use that.

21:57.598 --> 21:58.539
[SPEAKER_10]: Never use that, though.

21:59.039 --> 22:00.020
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually set it up.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.761
[SPEAKER_10]: I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.

22:02.041 --> 22:03.302
[SPEAKER_10]: It is slow as hell.

22:03.602 --> 22:04.703
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't work right at all.

22:05.043 --> 22:05.604
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3?

22:06.805 --> 22:08.406
[SPEAKER_10]: I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.

22:08.686 --> 22:08.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

22:09.006 --> 22:09.506
[SPEAKER_10]: In one minute.

22:09.807 --> 22:16.712
[SPEAKER_10]: What you need to do, what I normally use... I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.

22:16.772 --> 22:18.633
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping the NXE makes that all go away.

22:18.653 --> 22:20.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Media Center is really old, though.

22:20.915 --> 22:24.657
[SPEAKER_09]: What you need to use... I use Tversity, which is awesome, and...

22:25.818 --> 22:28.280
[SPEAKER_09]: I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.481
[SPEAKER_09]: I prefer my PS3.

22:29.921 --> 22:32.303
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.

22:32.343 --> 22:34.845
[SPEAKER_10]: I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.

22:35.205 --> 22:40.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product would interface better with Windows than Sony.

22:40.649 --> 22:41.029
[SPEAKER_10]: Five minutes.

22:41.169 --> 22:58.738
[SPEAKER_09]: You see, I don't really use the Zoom stuff for their new Windows Media because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up-and-up, so Diversity works really well with those not-so-legitimate copies of Windows.

22:59.539 --> 23:01.039
[SPEAKER_09]: But it works great.

23:01.059 --> 23:07.182
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, mine's the real deal because it came on my computer and everything, and it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.

23:07.202 --> 23:07.983
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

23:08.877 --> 23:09.638
[SPEAKER_10]: Valkyria Chronicles

23:33.081 --> 23:33.741
[SPEAKER_10]: from Sega.

23:34.442 --> 23:38.044
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.

23:38.664 --> 23:42.747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like an RTS-type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.

23:42.847 --> 23:55.455
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's first-person... Like, you go from the top... It zooms in from this top-down view into a first-person view, and then you move your pieces around live and attack things...

23:56.195 --> 23:57.779
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of neat.

23:57.919 --> 24:00.104
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.

24:00.164 --> 24:01.467
[SPEAKER_10]: I might pick that one up.

24:01.547 --> 24:03.190
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had quite a good time with that.

24:03.611 --> 24:04.974
[SPEAKER_10]: So check out the demo if you haven't.

24:05.175 --> 24:06.057
[SPEAKER_10]: Valkyria Chronicles.

24:08.662 --> 24:10.804
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.

24:11.144 --> 24:16.650
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week, but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.

24:17.971 --> 24:27.621
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say something about the podcast delays, because I've been getting some emails about it, and I've seen posts on the forums about it, and yes, the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.

24:28.402 --> 24:28.902
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

24:45.251 --> 24:45.951
[SPEAKER_10]: Helpful with that.

24:46.271 --> 24:53.234
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine, so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show a hell of a lot faster in the future.

24:54.055 --> 24:55.175
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really sorry about that.

24:55.275 --> 24:57.676
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode.

24:57.696 --> 25:02.278
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny because we had so many people here in-house.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.198
[SPEAKER_10]: So check out episode 300.

25:03.238 --> 25:11.762
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I'm really sorry, but please understand I usually am the one that puts all those shows together just because I just have traditionally.

25:12.282 --> 25:12.402
[SPEAKER_10]: And

25:12.962 --> 25:14.344
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:31.801 --> 25:37.247
[SPEAKER_10]: And just with everything else going on in the world, there was just a lot more on my mind than just Orange Lounge Radio.

25:37.527 --> 25:47.758
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, for me, I can't speak for Loki or DarkSakura, but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.

25:47.998 --> 25:49.599
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope you all understand.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.681
[SPEAKER_10]: In the real world,

25:52.455 --> 25:53.316
[SPEAKER_10]: TV shows.

25:53.396 --> 25:55.978
[SPEAKER_10]: They do, what, like 26 episodes a year, if that?

25:55.998 --> 25:55.978
23?

25:56.099 --> 25:57.480
[SPEAKER_10]: What's a season order?

25:57.500 --> 25:59.322
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?

25:59.742 --> 26:02.645
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, last season we only had, what, 11 episodes all year?

26:02.665 --> 26:03.626
[SPEAKER_10]: It's usually 26, I think.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.668
[SPEAKER_10]: So, please bear with us.

26:06.048 --> 26:06.849
[SPEAKER_10]: We do our best.

26:07.249 --> 26:08.210
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not an anti-podcast thing.

26:08.290 --> 26:14.517
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example, Little Britain, that's six a season.

26:15.077 --> 26:15.578
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so...

26:16.078 --> 26:16.498
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

26:16.739 --> 26:21.102
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, like, oh, look at me, cry for me.

26:21.122 --> 26:21.862
[SPEAKER_10]: We're on season 50.

26:22.823 --> 26:29.088
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand, sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.

26:29.428 --> 26:36.513
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're here, we're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.

26:36.894 --> 26:44.019
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday, to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody, because, again, it's crazy.

26:44.039 --> 26:45.080
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:03.029 --> 27:03.710
[SPEAKER_09]: It went over well.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.572
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Halloween party, I won second place.

27:07.273 --> 27:08.394
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you lose to?

27:08.574 --> 27:09.074
[SPEAKER_10]: My sister.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.856
[SPEAKER_10]: She won with Gurr.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, was she like a full-blown Gurr?

27:15.059 --> 27:15.299
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.201
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's pretty awesome.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.142
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to lose to anything, lose to Gurr.

27:19.482 --> 27:20.924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good, you know.

27:21.684 --> 27:22.805
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just for fun.

27:22.905 --> 27:27.829
[SPEAKER_10]: You have like this family to be reckoned with in Halloween costume contests.

27:28.269 --> 27:29.650
[SPEAKER_09]: I normally don't make costumes.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.152
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is like the first costume I've...

27:32.205 --> 27:34.266
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:52.768 --> 27:55.550
[SPEAKER_09]: MakeASackBoy.com What a great plug for the show.

28:22.509 --> 28:23.169
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Loki.

28:24.010 --> 28:24.410
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

28:24.811 --> 28:27.132
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

28:27.192 --> 28:28.213
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

28:28.553 --> 28:30.234
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's start things off.

28:30.274 --> 28:32.675
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk about a program called Boku.

28:33.076 --> 28:38.179
[SPEAKER_09]: And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer to LittleBigPlanet.

28:38.599 --> 28:42.622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a programming language meant... Well, it looks like it's meant for little kids.

28:43.502 --> 28:48.085
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, you can use this to create your own games and...

28:49.567 --> 28:52.993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of like X and A to a certain extent.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.479
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've talked about this before.

28:57.788 --> 29:05.250
[SPEAKER_09]: Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282, back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a... Damn!

29:05.490 --> 29:07.270
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode number and everything.

29:07.351 --> 29:08.011
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, Loki.

29:08.111 --> 29:08.531
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

29:09.771 --> 29:13.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.

29:14.272 --> 29:20.234
[SPEAKER_09]: They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters and whether I liked them or not, so I hated them all.

29:21.034 --> 29:21.694
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're alright.

29:22.094 --> 29:41.038
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um, the programming language itself, it's very, um, looks very basic, but, you know, much like LittleBigPlanet, you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it, and they showed some examples of different games, and, um, you know, there's basic AI that you can assign to, you know, objects and tell them how to behave and that kind of thing.

29:41.718 --> 29:46.619
[SPEAKER_09]: And the games itself, um, look like they're, the levels almost look like they're made out of Legos, which is kind of cool.

29:47.499 --> 29:48.259
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

29:49.801 --> 29:52.302
[SPEAKER_09]: No word on when exactly this is going to be available.

29:52.662 --> 29:54.742
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.

29:54.782 --> 30:00.183
[SPEAKER_09]: They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.

30:01.383 --> 30:06.524
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week, although it's been at a few different conventions.

30:06.584 --> 30:11.065
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just been so much... Didn't they have, like, a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo, if I remember right?

30:11.085 --> 30:12.326
[SPEAKER_10]: There was something about it.

30:12.366 --> 30:14.966
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it was almost like an informational thing only, if I remember right.

30:15.066 --> 30:17.007
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, the thing at... I thought I saw it somewhere.

30:17.207 --> 30:17.847
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the thing at...

30:19.247 --> 30:19.847
[SPEAKER_09]: PENI Arcade

30:44.753 --> 30:45.854
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:03.763 --> 31:07.668
[SPEAKER_09]: This is supposed to be available, I guess it looks like now.

31:07.708 --> 31:09.210
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying early next year.

31:10.232 --> 31:10.672
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

31:10.753 --> 31:11.514
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a video.

31:11.594 --> 31:13.116
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra.

31:13.136 --> 31:14.918
[SPEAKER_09]: They have it mirrored on Joystick.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely check it out.

31:17.161 --> 31:18.022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool looking.

31:19.765 --> 31:21.387
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.

31:22.611 --> 31:31.117
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what's funny is the entire time that I was playing LittleBigPlanet, I was thinking, how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?

31:31.618 --> 31:36.822
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by, you know what I mean?

31:37.382 --> 31:39.524
[SPEAKER_10]: They always are trying to one-up, especially Sony.

31:39.884 --> 31:42.206
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just funny that this is coming to light.

31:42.246 --> 31:44.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, don't forget about us, we got a game coming.

31:44.627 --> 31:48.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I mean, and this has been around for a while now.

31:48.410 --> 31:51.793
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been in development for at least a few years, so...

31:53.424 --> 31:58.800
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, they definitely won't be the last people to do that, you know

31:59.699 --> 32:00.640
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:23.917 --> 32:29.165
[SPEAKER_10]: SonicM88 in chat, chat.artistonsradio.com says, I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.

32:29.446 --> 32:31.409
[SPEAKER_10]: I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.

32:31.429 --> 32:32.791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.

32:32.811 --> 32:34.534
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many games out there to catch up on.

32:34.854 --> 32:36.136
[SPEAKER_10]: It's insanity.

32:36.156 --> 32:38.500
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, this is the holidays every year.

32:38.540 --> 32:38.760
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like,

32:38.820 --> 32:42.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and also you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.

32:42.643 --> 32:48.568
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's like, especially during the holiday, it feels like that you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.

32:49.028 --> 32:53.552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I got to get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.

32:53.612 --> 32:55.453
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm like, I got too much shit I got to play.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.815
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go buy another game.

32:56.835 --> 33:02.479
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I feel, because I've heard like Fallout 3 is oblivion with guns and nothing could like sell a game better for me.

33:02.559 --> 33:04.261
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just, I don't have fucking time.

33:04.921 --> 33:06.063
[SPEAKER_10]: between all the other games I'm trying to play.

33:06.103 --> 33:08.706
[SPEAKER_10]: And then add on top of that, Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.

33:08.726 --> 33:10.368
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.

33:10.769 --> 33:11.049
[SPEAKER_12]: Addict.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.093
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it sounds like DarkSakura is here with us.

33:14.674 --> 33:15.595
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing, Jamie?

33:15.755 --> 33:17.177
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.

33:17.277 --> 33:17.818
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

33:18.159 --> 33:19.360
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound a little raspy.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been yelling a lot today?

33:20.742 --> 33:22.384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.

33:42.796 --> 33:44.097
[SPEAKER_09]: because I'm hungry.

33:44.377 --> 33:49.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.

33:49.219 --> 33:51.940
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.862
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.

33:56.042 --> 33:56.222
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

33:56.282 --> 33:57.663
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dunkin' Donuts even, I think.

33:57.743 --> 33:59.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.

34:00.104 --> 34:00.324
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

34:01.284 --> 34:06.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Toko's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.

34:06.686 --> 34:10.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.

34:11.828 --> 34:16.090
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.

34:16.850 --> 34:21.192
[SPEAKER_09]: And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.

34:21.252 --> 34:23.472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, family-sized sandwich?

34:23.873 --> 34:25.733
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, really, you say?

34:27.874 --> 34:30.055
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a size that I was unaware of.

34:30.675 --> 34:33.637
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.

34:33.657 --> 34:35.098
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 inches for you, not them.

34:36.319 --> 34:43.604
[SPEAKER_09]: And so basically what I'm going to do with this is, it's not, I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it like throughout the week.

34:43.724 --> 34:46.206
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's lunch for all week.

34:46.306 --> 34:48.047
[SPEAKER_12]: How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?

34:48.067 --> 34:48.188
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 bucks.

34:50.228 --> 34:55.391
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?

34:55.551 --> 34:56.051
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

34:56.191 --> 34:56.932
[SPEAKER_04]: That isn't bad.

34:57.072 --> 34:57.732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad at all.

34:57.772 --> 34:59.973
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.

35:00.714 --> 35:05.776
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about $2, and then, so it's like $19.

35:05.836 --> 35:10.319
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Subway just, drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs?

35:10.899 --> 35:11.319
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

35:33.451 --> 35:34.552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you can go in there.

35:34.652 --> 35:37.693
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than two feet.

35:37.753 --> 35:40.715
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.

35:40.755 --> 35:43.856
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger.

35:43.896 --> 35:47.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a three foot long sandwich to come in the work with that.

35:47.938 --> 35:48.699
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it would be funny.

35:48.859 --> 35:50.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people are like, what the hell are you doing?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.501
[SPEAKER_12]: They've done that for work events where I worked before.

35:53.181 --> 35:58.143
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually save these things until the end of the show, but it works too much now.

35:58.723 --> 36:05.806
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews because it makes us feel really good about what we're doing.

36:05.946 --> 36:09.407
[SPEAKER_10]: It helps us spread the word out about our show and increases our rankings in iTunes.

36:09.927 --> 36:10.247
[SPEAKER_10]: We do.

36:10.307 --> 36:11.848
[SPEAKER_10]: We need our EP stroked once in a while.

36:12.128 --> 36:19.291
[SPEAKER_10]: And a couple of you have stroked it in the past couple weeks, including this review from BioHaze20, who says, one of the best podcasts out there.

36:19.691 --> 36:20.732
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, this is related.

36:21.012 --> 36:26.054
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.

36:28.630 --> 36:29.731
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fantastic.

36:29.771 --> 36:34.896
[SPEAKER_10]: And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.

36:34.916 --> 36:39.001
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.

36:39.661 --> 36:40.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Signed, Jamie.

36:41.123 --> 36:48.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just hoping they'd have some really cool long box that you could put it in or something because they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to take it home and...

36:49.531 --> 36:49.871
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

36:50.192 --> 36:52.914
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't have them cut it either because I figured that was... All right!

36:52.974 --> 36:54.035
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough sandwich!

36:54.636 --> 36:55.256
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus!

36:55.316 --> 36:59.500
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.

36:59.700 --> 37:00.120
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

37:00.421 --> 37:02.583
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week, of all things?

37:03.360 --> 37:04.480
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Fable too.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.241
[SPEAKER_04]: And what'd you think?

37:06.501 --> 37:09.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I smashed beetles and I tried to be a good little girl.

37:11.603 --> 37:13.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan had an interesting experience.

37:13.263 --> 37:16.724
[SPEAKER_04]: His big beefy man got turned into a big beefy woman.

37:17.564 --> 37:26.327
[SPEAKER_04]: He drank the gender potion and so he decided just to be evil and went around killing everybody and his dog turned black and he lost his halo and grew horns.

37:27.606 --> 37:27.766
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

37:27.786 --> 37:28.126
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.327
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't played Fable 2.

37:29.567 --> 37:30.087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm having to live.

37:30.107 --> 37:32.368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another one of those games on the back burner.

37:32.649 --> 37:42.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one of our listeners who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat, so I'm just going to say Rob.

37:44.114 --> 37:44.855
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a good name.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a very good name.

37:46.516 --> 37:49.237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.

37:49.697 --> 37:49.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

37:51.198 --> 37:51.638
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.260
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming, but...

37:55.782 --> 37:58.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?

38:01.064 --> 38:03.906
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.

38:04.226 --> 38:04.886
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

38:05.106 --> 38:05.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

38:07.747 --> 38:15.411
[SPEAKER_04]: I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality and have instead moved to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever!

38:16.251 --> 38:16.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

38:16.971 --> 38:18.512
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, and in your DS game, he will be.

38:18.992 --> 38:19.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

38:19.252 --> 38:19.652
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

38:19.692 --> 38:20.733
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to never watch the show again.

38:20.753 --> 38:21.893
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's got Martha in it.

38:21.993 --> 38:23.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Martha's not fun.

38:24.314 --> 38:25.055
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Donna.

38:26.716 --> 38:27.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Donna.

38:27.376 --> 38:28.217
[SPEAKER_10]: What else was I going to ask you?

38:28.317 --> 38:28.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you.

38:29.337 --> 38:29.637
[SPEAKER_10]: You.

38:30.177 --> 38:30.517
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

38:30.577 --> 38:32.578
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to play LittleBigPlanet.

38:32.858 --> 38:33.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.379
[SPEAKER_04]: It is fucking amazing.

38:35.399 --> 38:36.499
[SPEAKER_04]: We're supposed to get a free copy.

38:36.699 --> 38:46.002
[SPEAKER_10]: And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in, you know, the traditional English style, making those little puns, I think of you.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.283
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know you live for that stuff.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.323
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to move there.

38:49.443 --> 38:51.404
[SPEAKER_10]: The narrator is some famous guy, too.

38:51.464 --> 38:54.285
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the guy that narrates... He did Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

38:54.525 --> 38:55.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's... Oh, sweet.

38:55.905 --> 38:57.386
[SPEAKER_10]: Season 2 of Supernatural Season 3 of Supernatural

39:23.988 --> 39:24.728
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

39:24.828 --> 39:26.689
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on the tip of my tongue.

39:26.729 --> 39:28.070
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to have to look it up because I'm lazy.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.831
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to be watching more Supernatural.

39:30.111 --> 39:34.074
[SPEAKER_04]: I vow by the end of the semester I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.

39:35.074 --> 39:36.735
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that is now my favorite TV show.

39:36.995 --> 39:38.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that on the CW?

39:39.337 --> 39:39.657
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.518
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else they show on the CW?

39:41.998 --> 39:42.699
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

39:42.999 --> 39:42.699
90210.

39:43.279 --> 39:43.719
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.061
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't exist in my alternate reality, Rob.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.882
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut your mouth.

39:48.982 --> 39:52.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, post-episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.

39:53.609 --> 39:54.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

39:54.570 --> 39:54.870
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

39:55.411 --> 39:55.792
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

39:56.272 --> 40:01.760
[SPEAKER_10]: Masters of the Wiki, can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?

40:03.064 --> 40:05.764
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I ate at a very good restaurant, speaking of food.

40:06.405 --> 40:06.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Not today.

40:07.425 --> 40:08.785
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?

40:08.805 --> 40:09.445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to talk about it, Rob.

40:09.465 --> 40:10.265
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to talk about it, Rob.

40:10.345 --> 40:10.645
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

40:10.965 --> 40:13.426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called something Bohem.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost something Bohem.

40:15.126 --> 40:15.746
[SPEAKER_10]: Lovey Bohem?

40:15.826 --> 40:16.606
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the Rent song?

40:16.926 --> 40:19.507
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's kind of... Okay, it's an Italian song.

40:19.607 --> 40:20.367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Italian song.

40:20.847 --> 40:22.227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Italian Czech restaurant.

40:23.248 --> 40:23.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

40:24.068 --> 40:30.909
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.

40:33.604 --> 40:37.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy gnocchi.

40:38.185 --> 40:38.485
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

40:39.545 --> 40:40.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth.

40:40.286 --> 40:42.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Just talk about Shaft.

40:42.266 --> 40:43.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth and chew.

40:44.727 --> 40:46.767
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to share that antidote.

40:47.788 --> 40:51.849
[SPEAKER_10]: So in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme from Shaft?

40:51.969 --> 40:52.789
[SPEAKER_04]: At least once per meal.

40:56.272 --> 40:58.933
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, back to gaming news.

40:59.354 --> 41:00.214
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to say.

41:00.314 --> 41:02.175
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, if you like to blow things up.

41:02.695 --> 41:03.516
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be us!

41:03.576 --> 41:05.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Who doesn't like to blow things up?

41:05.076 --> 41:08.678
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8.

41:09.578 --> 41:11.739
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura is a bit of a vigilante herself.

41:12.980 --> 41:18.803
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually, speaking of Chef, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel to it.

41:18.863 --> 41:23.285
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.

41:23.545 --> 41:24.365
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of the sequel.

41:24.385 --> 41:24.805
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

41:24.885 --> 41:26.266
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good food, okay?

41:26.606 --> 41:27.766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.

41:27.826 --> 41:30.007
[SPEAKER_04]: They had really, really good beer on tap.

41:30.567 --> 41:30.787
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

41:30.967 --> 41:33.948
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.

41:34.048 --> 41:35.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have good beer?

41:35.549 --> 41:37.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, this is an old game that's being remade.

41:37.689 --> 41:39.370
[SPEAKER_10]: Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.

41:39.410 --> 41:40.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?

41:40.950 --> 41:42.231
[SPEAKER_10]: No, original PlayStation.

41:42.251 --> 41:43.291
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, there you go.

41:43.431 --> 41:44.912
[SPEAKER_10]: But now you can play it online with eight people.

41:45.072 --> 41:45.712
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it's Vigilante 8.

41:45.752 --> 41:48.353
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.

41:48.373 --> 41:49.733
[SPEAKER_10]: 800 Microsoft points for the game.

41:50.193 --> 41:50.853
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have good beer?

41:51.894 --> 41:52.234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

41:52.745 --> 41:56.546
[SPEAKER_09]: You can drive a bus, a school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.

41:56.926 --> 41:57.266
[SPEAKER_09]: School bus.

41:57.366 --> 41:58.486
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that last week's release?

41:59.346 --> 42:00.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this week.

42:00.147 --> 42:02.447
[SPEAKER_04]: You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.

42:03.107 --> 42:04.027
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we were off for a week.

42:04.067 --> 42:07.088
[SPEAKER_10]: What's coming out this week, on this Wednesday?

42:07.148 --> 42:08.448
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's coming out next week.

42:08.729 --> 42:09.589
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about this week.

42:10.809 --> 42:14.950
[SPEAKER_09]: It's next week's, well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.

42:15.030 --> 42:19.831
[SPEAKER_09]: But this week, I don't know what's coming out this week.

42:20.963 --> 42:24.759
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm sure we'll learn stuff alright well let's move on

42:26.513 --> 42:37.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so one thing that... Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War, they have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.

42:38.819 --> 42:44.202
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon, since the game comes out, what, in a couple days anyways?

42:44.802 --> 42:48.123
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, but at least it's kind of cool.

42:48.204 --> 42:53.626
[SPEAKER_09]: What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody, and...

42:55.507 --> 43:02.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs and is all sorts of fun.

43:03.516 --> 43:08.080
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the full game, you'll have to play it and I think it comes out on the 12th.

43:08.321 --> 43:09.362
[SPEAKER_04]: How much does 890 megs actually weigh?

43:09.382 --> 43:09.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

43:12.805 --> 43:13.145
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

43:13.185 --> 43:14.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.

43:15.586 --> 43:17.666
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not light if one falls on your head.

43:17.966 --> 43:26.548
[SPEAKER_10]: My first hard drive, my first computer, my first hard drive, my first computer, PC, you know, back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.

43:26.968 --> 43:28.109
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my first hard drive.

43:28.129 --> 43:28.109
486.

43:28.169 --> 43:30.169
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a three.

43:30.229 --> 43:30.809
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I remember.

43:30.829 --> 43:30.809
286.

43:31.489 --> 43:32.449
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember clearly a 386SX16.

43:35.589 --> 43:37.813
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.

43:37.853 --> 43:38.554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

43:38.815 --> 43:39.596
[SPEAKER_10]: SX for sex.

43:39.636 --> 43:41.139
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.

43:41.179 --> 43:41.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it scuzzy?

43:42.681 --> 43:43.162
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

43:43.382 --> 43:45.746
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.

43:46.840 --> 43:47.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Rob!

44:10.993 --> 44:16.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?

44:16.797 --> 44:30.325
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously now, and that thing was a brick, because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later, and now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too, now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.

44:31.946 --> 44:32.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

44:32.387 --> 44:33.727
[SPEAKER_09]: Memory is so damn cheap.

44:34.348 --> 44:37.630
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.

44:39.087 --> 44:40.127
[SPEAKER_10]: You're quite feisty today.

44:40.187 --> 44:41.168
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd rather like it.

44:41.468 --> 44:43.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.

44:43.749 --> 44:46.130
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to get loaded more often.

44:46.150 --> 44:46.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not loaded!

44:47.131 --> 44:48.471
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.

44:48.731 --> 44:49.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

44:49.151 --> 44:50.852
[SPEAKER_10]: But you need to loosen up a little bit.

44:50.932 --> 44:53.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.

44:53.933 --> 44:54.754
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, that's cool.

44:55.234 --> 45:04.718
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again, since we're talking a little bit retro, I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.

45:04.778 --> 45:06.559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.

45:06.959 --> 45:14.823
[SPEAKER_10]: They are saying the game will come out in November, and hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere, don't you think?

45:15.655 --> 45:16.435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

45:16.535 --> 45:18.476
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?

45:18.656 --> 45:19.036
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

45:19.376 --> 45:21.817
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.

45:21.837 --> 45:28.160
[SPEAKER_10]: But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.

45:28.860 --> 45:29.340
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

45:29.830 --> 45:35.393
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, though, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.

45:35.674 --> 45:36.234
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

45:36.274 --> 45:40.617
[SPEAKER_10]: If the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.

45:40.677 --> 45:41.557
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have submitted it.

45:42.037 --> 45:43.378
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very soon to go.

45:43.939 --> 45:44.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

45:44.519 --> 45:50.823
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't wait that long, well, this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.

45:51.443 --> 45:57.527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Street Fighter-themed level, and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft points.

45:58.407 --> 45:58.547
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

45:59.790 --> 46:00.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks pretty cool.

46:00.390 --> 46:01.071
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not bad, though.

46:01.091 --> 46:02.912
[SPEAKER_09]: 200 Microsoft points is what?

46:02.932 --> 46:02.912
250?

46:03.312 --> 46:05.273
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Jamie, you would probably know this.

46:05.853 --> 46:08.995
[SPEAKER_09]: Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables.

46:09.704 --> 46:10.324
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one.

46:10.684 --> 46:13.025
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, oh God, and I've played one before.

46:13.045 --> 46:14.045
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't very good.

46:14.065 --> 46:15.646
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too bad.

46:15.926 --> 46:16.946
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to recall that too.

46:17.466 --> 46:20.067
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.

46:20.227 --> 46:22.208
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body.

46:22.288 --> 46:25.309
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.

46:25.369 --> 46:26.329
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find out actually.

46:26.369 --> 46:30.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.

46:30.290 --> 46:30.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Gatleib

46:50.542 --> 46:52.723
[SPEAKER_10]: and so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlieb game.

46:53.224 --> 46:54.645
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a lot of fun, speaking of pinball.

46:54.665 --> 46:57.666
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.

46:57.686 --> 46:58.827
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

46:58.967 --> 47:00.348
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's it.

47:00.388 --> 47:01.268
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it was like a Mario Bros.

47:01.288 --> 47:06.571
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that was in, no, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlieb collection for Wii?

47:07.112 --> 47:11.274
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but...

47:12.282 --> 47:14.823
[SPEAKER_09]: The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlieb.

47:15.223 --> 47:16.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Gottlieb was in the UK.

47:16.483 --> 47:20.744
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Street Fighter 2 pinball that was developed by Gottlieb in 1993.

47:22.824 --> 47:25.405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it.

47:27.505 --> 47:33.166
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice... Pinball is pinball.

47:33.506 --> 47:40.928
[SPEAKER_10]: There are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, we picked up a new pinball table, did I tell you?

47:44.221 --> 47:44.721
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what'd you get?

47:44.901 --> 47:47.741
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Revenge from Mars.

47:48.542 --> 47:49.142
[SPEAKER_04]: No, take that back.

47:49.242 --> 47:49.802
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

47:49.842 --> 47:50.282
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

47:50.302 --> 47:50.862
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an Episode 1.

47:51.522 --> 47:53.083
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's cool.

47:53.543 --> 47:54.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we picked it up.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.203
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a hologram one.

47:55.243 --> 47:56.063
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are rad.

47:56.103 --> 47:57.744
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they call it, the Pin 2000 or whatever?

47:57.784 --> 47:58.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball 2000, exactly.

47:58.744 --> 48:01.385
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.

48:01.765 --> 48:02.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

48:02.185 --> 48:03.885
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.

48:04.165 --> 48:07.006
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?

48:08.348 --> 48:08.668
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

48:08.708 --> 48:09.208
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

48:34.443 --> 48:36.104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, moving on to other news.

48:36.564 --> 48:45.646
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the new Exit Box Experience is coming out pretty soon, and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test, which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.

48:45.946 --> 48:49.707
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even sign up because it was like the day before my surgery or something.

48:49.948 --> 48:52.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was such a small window.

48:52.308 --> 48:57.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part.

48:58.870 --> 49:00.051
[SPEAKER_10]: Right about now, but that's alright.

49:00.451 --> 49:01.952
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to make do with regular Netflix.

49:03.113 --> 49:09.436
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new Xbox experience were cut.

49:09.756 --> 49:18.081
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not talking about things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.

49:18.101 --> 49:18.721
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not talking about that.

49:18.741 --> 49:21.883
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about they had this big list of things they wanted to accomplish...

49:23.058 --> 49:33.804
[SPEAKER_10]: and according to the head of Xbox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new Xbox experience.

49:34.065 --> 49:36.726
[SPEAKER_10]: But assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.

49:37.046 --> 49:40.708
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.150
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do.

49:43.550 --> 49:45.932
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.

49:46.372 --> 49:49.674
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.

49:50.434 --> 49:58.916
[SPEAKER_10]: The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard, and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.

49:59.176 --> 50:00.836
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the type of things we're going to start doing.

50:01.176 --> 50:02.196
[SPEAKER_10]: So a photo party.

50:02.896 --> 50:03.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's fine.

50:03.676 --> 50:14.778
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't say that there's... It's not like there's... Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?

50:14.818 --> 50:17.859
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?

50:18.999 --> 50:19.379
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

50:19.919 --> 50:20.259
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

50:20.299 --> 50:24.720
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.

50:24.740 --> 50:25.040
[SPEAKER_09]: That's lame.

50:25.060 --> 50:25.820
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what email's for.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.441
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is up with your LiveJournal icon?

50:28.421 --> 50:29.521
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with my LiveJournal icon?

50:29.541 --> 50:30.421
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like pasta.

50:30.941 --> 50:31.801
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't... Oh.

50:32.162 --> 50:33.042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shrimp chow mein.

50:33.142 --> 50:33.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask me later.

50:33.842 --> 50:34.982
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to do a show here.

50:35.002 --> 50:37.242
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

50:38.223 --> 50:39.843

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done!

58:17.345 --> 58:17.685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

58:17.705 --> 58:18.046
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

58:18.706 --> 58:24.028
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chatroom listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.

58:24.549 --> 58:32.032
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says SingStarLoki Redertainment says My Horse and Me 2 Adventures in Tiawata Now that would be a game worth playing.

58:32.752 --> 58:35.874
[SPEAKER_04]: That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.

58:37.168 --> 58:49.650
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says no SingStar matters unless it's Abba SingStar you damn right Redertainment says my secret diary finally a place to go on and on about the things that people could honestly give a rat's ass about don't we have that?

58:49.690 --> 58:50.511
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it called LiveJournal?

58:52.662 --> 59:03.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, is Top Model smarter than a 5th grader?

59:03.785 --> 59:08.806
[SPEAKER_10]: Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?

59:09.826 --> 59:12.227
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.

59:12.307 --> 59:13.287
[SPEAKER_10]: For what it is...

59:14.321 --> 59:21.825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not bad, the game itself, but I think the thrill of are you smarter than a fifth grader could only really last so long.

59:21.925 --> 59:24.387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of one of those ha-ha for about 15 minutes.

59:24.427 --> 59:28.489
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a fifth grade.

59:29.090 --> 59:30.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, there you go.

59:30.671 --> 59:31.311
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah.

59:32.650 --> 59:34.611
[SPEAKER_10]: They released the US version here on Xbox Live.

59:35.772 --> 59:40.995
[SPEAKER_09]: Or they could just forego releasing it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?

59:41.055 --> 59:45.098
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck.

59:46.119 --> 59:50.582
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact is, it is a game based off a TV show that

59:51.994 --> 59:55.377
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have just called it, Are You Smarter Than An American?

59:55.557 --> 01:00:03.404
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone's like, Oh my god, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.

01:00:04.025 --> 01:00:04.345
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:06.126
[SPEAKER_04]: What, as a collective?

01:00:06.307 --> 01:00:07.568
[SPEAKER_10]: As a collective.

01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:09.690
[SPEAKER_10]: Even, forget it.

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:10.750
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, um...

01:00:11.531 --> 01:00:12.572
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I'm thinking yes

01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:37.749
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.

01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:40.750
[SPEAKER_10]: A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.871
[SPEAKER_10]: Major League Beast... Beastball?

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:43.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Baseball!

01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:44.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Beastball!

01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:46.413
[SPEAKER_10]: Beastball!

01:00:46.553 --> 01:00:47.274
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see that.

01:00:47.874 --> 01:00:49.275
[SPEAKER_10]: Major League Beastball!

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:51.796
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.

01:00:52.077 --> 01:00:54.158
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.

01:00:55.824 --> 01:01:00.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey racing, there you go.

01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:05.272
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week, quite a bit of stuff.

01:01:06.493 --> 01:01:13.839
[SPEAKER_10]: New Ono Kids Wii, Jinsei Game Wii, FIFA Soccer 09 All Play, because you know EA likes to do the All Play thing.

01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:19.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Family Ski, World Ski and Snowboard, if I'm not mistaken, that's the Wii Mat game.

01:01:19.524 --> 01:01:19.784
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Fit!

01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:24.570
[SPEAKER_10]: that uses that, right?

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:28.252
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Family Athletics would be that one.

01:01:28.292 --> 01:01:30.633
[SPEAKER_09]: Family Ski was Wii Ski.

01:01:30.873 --> 01:01:31.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:34.075
[SPEAKER_09]: But it sounds like that's... Is that price reduction?

01:01:35.716 --> 01:01:38.057
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's coming out from Namco, and it's not a price reduction.

01:01:38.618 --> 01:01:40.339
[SPEAKER_10]: That already came out over there, unless it's a sequel.

01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:41.039
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's a sequel.

01:01:41.099 --> 01:01:42.840
[SPEAKER_10]: It could, because this has snowboarding in it, too.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.180
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.

01:01:43.201 --> 01:01:43.581
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:50.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Nakibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of...

01:01:51.325 --> 01:01:51.705
[SPEAKER_10]: The Blob

01:02:19.095 --> 01:02:21.236
[SPEAKER_10]: and Grow Your Rice and Make Your Citizens Happy.

01:02:24.118 --> 01:02:34.164
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, coming out on the portable systems, if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out... Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.

01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:37.566
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Nintendo DS, some new casings and so on.

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:40.647
[SPEAKER_10]: A game called Juggler, a Nobunaga game.

01:02:40.707 --> 01:02:41.728
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a price reduction there, too.

01:02:42.148 --> 01:02:42.989
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhythm to Cooking.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:51.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Ryusei no Rockman 3, Black Ace and Red Joker, Tyson, Kato-chan no Koronope, Zerokara Hajimiru, Otona no 5,

01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:04.205
[SPEAKER_10]: and Kokugo Numion.

01:03:04.966 --> 01:03:06.268
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

01:03:06.468 --> 01:03:09.953
[SPEAKER_10]: All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.

01:03:10.774 --> 01:03:12.897
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week.

01:03:12.937 --> 01:03:15.040
[SPEAKER_09]: The Shadows of Almia on DS.

01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:16.041
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

01:03:16.382 --> 01:03:16.602
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:03:16.823 --> 01:03:18.325
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes this Pokemon game special?

01:03:18.645 --> 01:03:18.926
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:27.393
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction and FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.

01:03:28.234 --> 01:03:43.948
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot, but you do have a game called Sengoku, Efuda, Yugi, Hoto, Gisu, Ran, and Zero Pilot, Daisanji, Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.

01:03:45.149 --> 01:04:14.365
[SPEAKER_10]: also this one I'm sorry I missed this one this is a pretty big one I think over in Japan it's bolded on my list which usually means it's a pretty big deal it's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai and I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of I don't know it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something but it looks like it is a action game coming out over there there you go that's it for Japanese release dates

01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.710
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, cool.

01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:17.292
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Zimbabwe?

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:18.894
[SPEAKER_10]: What about it?

01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:20.497
[SPEAKER_12]: What about their release dates?

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:24.042
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.

01:04:24.082 --> 01:04:25.624
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.

01:04:25.644 --> 01:04:31.833
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Australia, cry, cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us, but we only have so many hours.

01:04:33.194 --> 01:04:43.477
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet, well, there's something that might be able to help you out.

01:04:43.677 --> 01:04:47.338
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.

01:04:48.158 --> 01:04:51.759
[SPEAKER_09]: They have tools that will allow you to design your

01:04:52.779 --> 01:05:10.967
[SPEAKER_09]: your levels basically and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff so go to www.littlebigworkshop.com and check it out and you might be able to create the next big level hopefully not based off of licensed materials otherwise I'll get yanked offline

01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:16.938
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say I did visit that website and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:19.984
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to use your email address though instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.

01:05:20.324 --> 01:05:23.570
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually kind of...

01:05:24.127 --> 01:05:25.567
[SPEAKER_10]: have your own little page on there.

01:05:25.947 --> 01:05:28.548
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.

01:05:28.728 --> 01:05:32.489
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.

01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:43.151
[SPEAKER_10]: It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebooky update your current status thing, but I don't think it's really something I would practically use.

01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:48.093
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.

01:05:49.373 --> 01:05:50.113
[SPEAKER_10]: So, pretty cool.

01:05:51.536 --> 01:05:54.277
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and then the copyright levels, right?

01:05:54.377 --> 01:05:55.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but that's the thing.

01:05:56.838 --> 01:06:04.221
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of copyrighted levels or levels with copyrighted materials in them that are being yanked offline.

01:06:04.621 --> 01:06:09.143
[SPEAKER_09]: Included in that, of course, like levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.

01:06:09.683 --> 01:06:13.065
[SPEAKER_09]: There was even like a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.

01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:16.186
[SPEAKER_09]: One weird one, though, was there was a level called Phantasm.

01:06:16.426 --> 01:06:17.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

01:06:38.572 --> 01:06:40.474
[SPEAKER_10]: Good comment from GS68 in chat.

01:06:40.534 --> 01:06:41.215
[SPEAKER_10]: Blastworks.

01:06:41.355 --> 01:06:44.498
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?

01:06:44.518 --> 01:06:45.639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not here on OLR.

01:06:45.679 --> 01:06:46.980
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's been hyping this game up forever.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much.

01:06:48.962 --> 01:06:49.743
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

01:06:49.783 --> 01:06:54.268
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff and nobody gives a shit.

01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:56.767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's so far under the radar.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:07:00.850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.933
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.

01:07:05.193 --> 01:07:06.954
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that Gradius level is still there.

01:07:07.514 --> 01:07:09.296
[SPEAKER_10]: It was there just before we went live tonight.

01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:19.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?

01:07:19.943 --> 01:07:20.023
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:07:20.643 --> 01:07:22.144
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's very interesting.

01:07:22.184 --> 01:07:33.468
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show or at the Tail End of Bobby's show where we're usually on, but there's a Batman level out there too that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.

01:07:33.548 --> 01:07:41.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it, and that you even unlock that as a reward.

01:07:42.012 --> 01:07:44.593
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:51.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off too, unpublished levels are actually being moderated.

01:07:52.716 --> 01:07:53.156
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird.

01:07:53.557 --> 01:07:54.317
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that possible?

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:57.839
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but it says, for example...

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:07.732
[SPEAKER_09]: One user posted a strategy for keeping a copy of the level offline and republishing it in case it gets deleted.

01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:12.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated too.

01:08:12.753 --> 01:08:15.393
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.

01:08:16.273 --> 01:08:16.713
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:22.334
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's one of those things where once a crook, always a crook.

01:08:22.454 --> 01:08:24.895
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow.

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.941
[SPEAKER_10]: and see if you're infringing any other places?

01:08:28.081 --> 01:08:28.882
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:08:28.902 --> 01:08:30.643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's weird.

01:08:30.663 --> 01:08:31.824
[SPEAKER_09]: That is weird.

01:08:32.004 --> 01:08:45.036
[SPEAKER_09]: This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M or whatever, he said, so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, lighthearted violence have been taken down, like the popular Gears of War Demon Skull level.

01:08:45.336 --> 01:08:46.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's Gears of War.

01:08:47.017 --> 01:08:48.418
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't get taken down because of the violence.

01:08:49.239 --> 01:08:56.441
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it and act to try to please everybody?

01:08:56.521 --> 01:09:02.643
[SPEAKER_10]: The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.

01:09:02.783 --> 01:09:05.764
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.

01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:10.286
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I played it in the real game.

01:09:10.806 --> 01:09:13.927
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got little things dancing on poles.

01:09:14.007 --> 01:09:15.047
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no mistaking what it is.

01:09:17.388 --> 01:09:22.513
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment in chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.235
[SPEAKER_10]: I think yes, you can.

01:09:25.255 --> 01:09:30.019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues.

01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:32.201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they can moderate your level.

01:09:32.921 --> 01:09:33.682
[SPEAKER_10]: That's stupid.

01:09:34.182 --> 01:09:35.884
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:39.347
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as these people bitching and stuff, here's the complication.

01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:43.370
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end user license agreement.

01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:47.632
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to be extra safe, just make backups of your saves.

01:09:47.932 --> 01:09:49.492
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's really the only thing you can do.

01:09:50.093 --> 01:09:53.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.

01:09:53.134 --> 01:10:00.736
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the other thing is you can download saves online with the PS3 because none of those are linked to your user account.

01:10:00.817 --> 01:10:03.918
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just go on GameFAQs, for example, and download stuff.

01:10:05.138 --> 01:10:06.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could swap levels that way.

01:10:06.858 --> 01:10:07.359
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:10:07.599 --> 01:10:09.499
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish you could because that would be nice.

01:10:10.179 --> 01:10:12.620
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be able to download levels that are awesome to play.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:20.141
[SPEAKER_10]: Really interesting comment from chat from Shaoran saying, but that's not as offensive as two men kissing.

01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:24.342
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to that whole... What was that?

01:10:24.582 --> 01:10:27.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Whattheyplay.com poll we talked about months ago.

01:10:27.503 --> 01:10:30.484
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that whole thing where two men kissing was one of the most offensive things?

01:10:30.884 --> 01:10:31.844
[SPEAKER_10]: But that had me thinking...

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:45.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels, see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.

01:10:46.624 --> 01:10:47.505
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, to say the least.

01:10:49.096 --> 01:10:50.457
[SPEAKER_10]: and make the level called What They Play.

01:10:53.079 --> 01:10:57.942
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation.

01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:04.086
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this has been a topic of controversy lately and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show.

01:11:04.447 --> 01:11:07.809
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.

01:11:08.049 --> 01:11:13.233
[SPEAKER_10]: You go through three levels that all center around a wedding and a crazy bride going after her drunk...

01:11:13.673 --> 01:11:35.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Drunken Groom which by the way is my favorite level in the game so far is the Skulldozer level if you've played that it would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms I'd be very curious to see what happens anyhow now I'm getting ideas for my first level there you go Rob Roberts Big Gay Adventure

01:11:40.887 --> 01:11:41.347
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

01:11:41.707 --> 01:11:43.888
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.

01:11:44.829 --> 01:11:45.570
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.512
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing more inspiring than offending people.

01:11:49.652 --> 01:11:50.473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not offensive.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.614
[SPEAKER_10]: What's offensive about gaiety?

01:11:52.774 --> 01:11:53.134
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

01:11:54.235 --> 01:11:55.416
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I pushing the envelope?

01:11:55.656 --> 01:11:57.377
[SPEAKER_10]: No, to other people maybe.

01:11:57.857 --> 01:11:58.177
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

01:11:59.158 --> 01:11:59.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it offensive?

01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:00.379
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't be.

01:12:01.573 --> 01:12:01.934
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

01:12:02.414 --> 01:12:08.483
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.

01:12:08.743 --> 01:12:10.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, that's South America for you.

01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:12.909
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, God, man, seriously.

01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:15.870
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've got some ideas brewing.

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:16.550
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:20.011
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.

01:12:20.351 --> 01:12:22.672
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, but the thing is, you have to be careful with it.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:28.974
[SPEAKER_10]: Because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff, there are people out there that would play it and think it's real.

01:12:29.794 --> 01:12:33.315
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:36.676
[SPEAKER_10]: And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea, one, I'll cut you.

01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:37.217
[SPEAKER_10]: Two...

01:12:39.265 --> 01:12:46.587
[SPEAKER_10]: Be very careful because you can push the envelope, but just be careful because there's some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.

01:12:46.647 --> 01:12:49.288
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Rob, how far have you gotten in LittleBigPlant?

01:12:50.628 --> 01:12:56.790
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the... I just beat the boss.

01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:59.831
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.

01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:01.131
[SPEAKER_09]: Just past Mexico.

01:13:01.271 --> 01:13:04.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat.

01:13:04.392 --> 01:13:04.572
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:13:05.113 --> 01:13:06.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I want a flamethrower and cat.

01:13:07.195 --> 01:13:07.695
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

01:13:08.516 --> 01:13:17.804
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff, Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:24.370
[SPEAKER_10]: So pretty soon, you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:25.671
[SPEAKER_10]: Making it even easier to...

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:55.389
[SPEAKER_10]: even easier to infringe on copyrights galore but you could also put in pictures of yourself or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK which I saw on the three speech blog you can actually put pictures of your family in the game you can actually see this in one of the commercials but who do you believe because the developer also has come out this week and said even though it's on their blog a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums image importing is technically viable but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons

01:13:57.711 --> 01:14:03.516
[SPEAKER_10]: but here's the thing if people want to get their images in the game they're already doing it how?

01:14:03.756 --> 01:14:17.087
[SPEAKER_10]: by printing it out and holding it in front of the camera that's what Bobby did in his level and also in some other levels I've seen out there there's one level I played I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:19.027
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft.com

01:14:40.897 --> 01:14:45.999
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here, but very interesting to see what happens.

01:14:46.579 --> 01:14:51.922
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think, though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.

01:14:52.462 --> 01:15:00.945
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.

01:15:00.985 --> 01:15:04.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it goes to, like, the bottom of the list so that people just don't find it.

01:15:04.887 --> 01:15:32.182
[SPEAKER_09]: but I don't know about this whole crazy going on your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the wrist I have a problem with them monitoring stuff that's on your system because that's your stuff if I want to make a Batman level I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends now I do have a problem I don't have a problem with them taking it offline because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else that's fine they should be able to do that

01:15:32.722 --> 01:15:41.465
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.

01:15:41.645 --> 01:15:43.305
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any harm in that.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.006
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they'll find a reason not to.

01:15:46.126 --> 01:15:48.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.

01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:54.039
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it.

01:15:54.059 --> 01:15:57.661
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.

01:15:57.861 --> 01:16:01.042
[SPEAKER_10]: This game has the potential to get so big if it isn't already.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:05.544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like building these levels is that easy.

01:16:06.705 --> 01:16:09.126
[SPEAKER_10]: The creator can get pretty involved.

01:16:09.466 --> 01:16:17.129
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build a level.

01:16:17.169 --> 01:16:18.410
[SPEAKER_10]: It's as easy as it can get.

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:19.650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:38.834 --> 01:16:39.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:16:39.234 --> 01:16:41.455
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he used the basic artwork.

01:16:41.495 --> 01:16:46.796
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he built this own little unique car thing and used the eye toy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.

01:16:46.816 --> 01:16:49.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.

01:16:49.596 --> 01:16:52.817
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.

01:16:52.857 --> 01:16:56.298
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.

01:16:56.858 --> 01:16:57.578
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, like, nuts.

01:16:57.938 --> 01:16:58.238
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:16:58.658 --> 01:16:59.699
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

01:16:59.879 --> 01:17:01.179
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got so much more news to get to.

01:17:01.599 --> 01:17:07.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.

01:17:07.803 --> 01:17:14.807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.

01:17:15.668 --> 01:17:19.170
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be Wii remotes.

01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:23.893
[SPEAKER_09]: The way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye, because the PlayStation Eye has four...

01:17:24.693 --> 01:17:25.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:17:51.069 --> 01:18:20.577
[SPEAKER_09]: which is kind of neat and that would be the way to do it integrated I guess now with the current technology that they have on the system hmm so maybe sometime soon maybe we'll see a new controller or something do you think this is something for Sony's next system or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one I think it's their current one because on the actual patent it says PS3 on it and it's showing the Wi-Fi and like the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that hmm

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:51.604
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it makes sense if they want to expand out because right now I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games I mean they do have like LittleBigPlanet but there's nothing that's really like get in and just you know play even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff they have a little bit more than Sony but I mean the Wii's got them beat big time with like casual more family friendly just play type of stuff you know like tennis or something is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now no okay

01:18:53.476 --> 01:18:53.696
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

01:19:14.187 --> 01:19:16.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic, Ultimate Genesis Collection, 40 Titles,

01:19:38.555 --> 01:19:41.937
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 titles that were on the Genesis for next-gen systems.

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:46.699
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:19:47.459 --> 01:20:04.148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vector Man 2 and everything in between, including Golden Axe, all three of them, Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kid Chameleon, Echo 1, Echo 2, Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3...

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:09.851
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, you know, pretty much all your... I think Spinball was in there too.

01:20:10.652 --> 01:20:11.613
[SPEAKER_10]: Was Sonic Spinball in there?

01:20:11.733 --> 01:20:12.133
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

01:20:13.174 --> 01:20:17.797
[SPEAKER_10]: All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection pretty much, you know, that were first party.

01:20:18.377 --> 01:20:19.998
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be releasing in spring 2009.

01:20:20.679 --> 01:20:21.900
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the interesting thing.

01:20:23.261 --> 01:20:25.963
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?

01:20:26.003 --> 01:20:28.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.

01:20:28.564 --> 01:20:30.766
[SPEAKER_10]: They've released it as a download.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:31.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:32.707
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to output in 720p.

01:20:35.715 --> 01:20:39.002
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go really?

01:20:40.725 --> 01:20:43.972
[SPEAKER_10]: 720p for my Genesis yeah that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics

01:20:45.543 --> 01:20:47.564
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kind of an interesting little addition.

01:20:48.284 --> 01:20:50.865
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.

01:20:51.125 --> 01:20:51.666
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

01:20:52.006 --> 01:21:02.190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out a little bit and it's kind of blurry.

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:09.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can just do it where it scales everything up and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.

01:21:09.313 --> 01:21:09.653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:11.834
[SPEAKER_09]: and larger pixels, I guess.

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:18.059
[SPEAKER_10]: Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.

01:21:18.359 --> 01:21:22.463
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:22.823
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:21:23.043 --> 01:21:24.044
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of the mandate.

01:21:24.164 --> 01:21:30.689
[SPEAKER_10]: Now PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies, but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there, they might as well do the trophies.

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:36.914
[SPEAKER_10]: So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:38.770
[SPEAKER_10]: 8 dollars, 75 cents.

01:22:04.574 --> 01:22:06.575
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.776
[SPEAKER_10]: I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.

01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:10.816
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

01:22:11.857 --> 01:22:12.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:16.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee in chat says, Who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?

01:22:17.518 --> 01:22:18.419
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd be surprised.

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:20.520
[SPEAKER_09]: He would be surprised.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

01:22:23.168 --> 01:22:26.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.

01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:27.430
[SPEAKER_09]: True statement.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty nice too.

01:22:29.912 --> 01:22:32.133
[SPEAKER_09]: They had like 30-some games in there as well.

01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:33.174
[SPEAKER_09]: So, nice.

01:22:34.114 --> 01:22:39.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,

01:22:40.618 --> 01:22:41.338
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:23:03.888 --> 01:23:04.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:24.558
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that would be pretty awesome.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:39.106
[SPEAKER_09]: The DSi is getting a WarioWare Photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game as well as several WarioWare minigames that will be available to download on the system's online store.

01:23:40.647 --> 01:23:46.890
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.

01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:23:49.331 --> 01:23:49.912
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:23:51.139 --> 01:23:53.841
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but I do love me some WarioWare.

01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:57.983
[SPEAKER_10]: They're always pretty innovative with what they do with whatever new piece of thing.

01:23:58.304 --> 01:24:00.565
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, WarioWare myself sounds pretty awesome.

01:24:00.765 --> 01:24:02.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be very interesting.

01:24:03.227 --> 01:24:04.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?

01:24:05.888 --> 01:24:06.709
[SPEAKER_10]: A remake...

01:24:07.826 --> 01:24:11.912
[SPEAKER_10]: Press Your Luck Old School 80s Press Your Luck No Whammies I remember the guy who memorized the screens

01:24:23.948 --> 01:24:28.093
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him.

01:24:28.273 --> 01:24:29.995
[SPEAKER_10]: And sadly, I missed it, which kind of sucks.

01:24:30.075 --> 01:24:32.197
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have this whole thing.

01:24:32.638 --> 01:24:39.225
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.

01:24:39.726 --> 01:24:41.728
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.

01:24:42.008 --> 01:24:43.249
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not just for PC.

01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:45.352
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be coming for iPods,

01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:48.274
[SPEAKER_10]: iPhone, and apparently, consoles.

01:24:48.874 --> 01:25:03.805
[SPEAKER_10]: So the people that got the prices right, now unfortunately I haven't played the prices right game, so I don't know if it's any good or not, but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know, if it's a new game, it's going to have new whammy animations and all that fun stuff.

01:25:04.446 --> 01:25:06.167
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be an awesome party game.

01:25:06.187 --> 01:25:07.047
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to have the sound...

01:25:09.406 --> 01:25:10.347
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you mean.

01:25:39.889 --> 01:25:40.689
[SPEAKER_10]: GameShows are awesome!

01:26:00.854 --> 01:26:03.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.

01:26:04.757 --> 01:26:09.220
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.384
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.

01:26:15.184 --> 01:26:20.068
[SPEAKER_09]: And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.

01:26:21.008 --> 01:26:27.073
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the Digital Rights Management for Spore.

01:26:28.033 --> 01:26:28.194
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

01:26:30.253 --> 01:26:35.254
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:26:56.589 --> 01:27:04.394
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or Securom whatsoever.

01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:15.380
[SPEAKER_09]: The second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri, saying that after installing the DRM-protected Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.

01:27:20.422 --> 01:27:24.745
[SPEAKER_09]: Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.

01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:38.813
[SPEAKER_09]: She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, impressive, and unscrupulous behavior.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:43.536
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in other words, EA got sued over Secure ROM.

01:27:43.736 --> 01:27:44.516
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's surprised.

01:27:44.657 --> 01:27:45.997
[SPEAKER_10]: But is it going to hold up?

01:27:46.277 --> 01:27:46.678
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.380
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, well, I don't have...

01:27:52.085 --> 01:28:06.291
[SPEAKER_09]: If they came out and disclosed that Sekiram was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, like it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.

01:28:06.311 --> 01:28:09.932
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this.

01:28:09.972 --> 01:28:12.773
[SPEAKER_09]: If you install this, this is what's going to happen.

01:28:12.833 --> 01:28:18.736
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:20.935
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially on these demos.

01:28:21.355 --> 01:28:22.836
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the real tricky part.

01:28:22.976 --> 01:28:25.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you buy the game... Who cares?

01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:25.857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a demo.

01:28:25.877 --> 01:28:26.797
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand, you know?

01:28:27.877 --> 01:28:30.858
[SPEAKER_09]: You know... I don't get it.

01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:31.618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:28:31.898 --> 01:28:32.798
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see what happens.

01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:43.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe... DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until Part B. I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.

01:28:43.921 --> 01:28:46.482
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollywood, it's time to press your luck!

01:28:53.418 --> 01:29:00.481
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

01:29:01.862 --> 01:29:04.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off.

01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:05.644
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

01:29:05.944 --> 01:29:07.044
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a spore level now?

01:29:07.365 --> 01:29:07.945
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be funny.

01:29:08.185 --> 01:29:08.765
[SPEAKER_10]: They should do that.

01:29:10.406 --> 01:29:13.908
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.

01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:13.908
... ...

01:29:30.741 --> 01:29:35.884
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I could go on and on.

01:29:36.244 --> 01:29:38.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently tonight's... I love that sound.

01:29:38.765 --> 01:29:41.487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do.

01:29:41.507 --> 01:29:42.347
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the best sound ever.

01:29:42.607 --> 01:29:43.748
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to get that for the show.

01:29:44.388 --> 01:29:45.389
[SPEAKER_10]: We can use that a little later on.

01:29:46.209 --> 01:29:52.152
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.

01:29:52.192 --> 01:29:55.594
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.

01:29:57.534 --> 01:30:02.598
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from Rob with two Bs.

01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:04.740
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.

01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:08.544
[SPEAKER_10]: This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.

01:30:08.644 --> 01:30:10.365
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.

01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:11.847
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer your question, yes it is.

01:30:12.367 --> 01:30:16.230
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:16.991
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a...

01:30:18.432 --> 01:30:23.337
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:28.262
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously, we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show, but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email.

01:30:28.782 --> 01:30:29.603
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome.

01:30:30.364 --> 01:30:31.265
[SPEAKER_10]: The quote here at the end.

01:30:31.645 --> 01:30:38.672
[SPEAKER_10]: This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.

01:30:40.033 --> 01:30:40.414
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:46.234
[SPEAKER_10]: An email from... well, it's not signed.

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:51.381
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.

01:30:51.442 --> 01:30:52.102
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll leave it at that.

01:30:52.884 --> 01:30:55.407
[SPEAKER_10]: Sent us something like this, but I thought this was an interesting story.

01:30:56.148 --> 01:30:59.272
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.

01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:28.509
[SPEAKER_10]: and this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October so it looks like the same day as our last show but apparently it was like this giant like cosplay record type thing 342 people posed Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on part of the London Games Festival and the funny thing is they were out there to top the record of 337 set the week before in Germany who knew that World War 3 would be fought with cosplay who knew

01:31:30.339 --> 01:31:30.880
[SPEAKER_10]: But there you go.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.304
[SPEAKER_10]: A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.

01:31:35.025 --> 01:31:37.368
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?

01:31:37.884 --> 01:31:39.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, not the one that he sent.

01:31:39.384 --> 01:31:40.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I just happened to find one on YouTube.

01:31:40.965 --> 01:31:42.885
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.

01:31:42.905 --> 01:31:44.086
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fantastic.

01:31:46.346 --> 01:31:47.367
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we learned this.

01:31:47.887 --> 01:31:51.568
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you actually save levels from online to your planet and stuff?

01:31:51.828 --> 01:31:57.409
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of his show, he was telling us that there's an option you can do that.

01:31:57.429 --> 01:31:57.970
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I hope so.

01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.330
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to go save that one.

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:01.711
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow, we got another email here.

01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:02.351
[SPEAKER_10]: One last email.

01:32:02.391 --> 01:32:05.332
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit lengthy, but that's all right since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.

01:32:05.352 --> 01:32:06.272
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's from Spazinator.

01:32:07.666 --> 01:32:08.207
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:32:26.364 --> 01:32:28.245
[SPEAKER_10]: I particularly like the Justin.TV feed.

01:32:28.345 --> 01:32:33.727
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the All Games Radio feed on Shoutcast on my PSP.

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:36.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now our All Games friends wouldn't like that very much.

01:32:36.788 --> 01:32:37.428
[SPEAKER_10]: You should do both.

01:32:37.608 --> 01:32:38.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Ideally, you do both.

01:32:38.708 --> 01:32:42.190
[SPEAKER_10]: You turn on the Justin.TV and mute it and then listen on the All Games feed.

01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:45.311
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Justin.TV unfortunately has shitty audio.

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:48.312
[SPEAKER_10]: One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.

01:32:49.899 --> 01:32:52.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a PlayStation 3.

01:32:52.481 --> 01:32:53.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the dark side.

01:32:54.262 --> 01:32:57.584
[SPEAKER_10]: Just out of sheer stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?

01:32:57.944 --> 01:33:03.848
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.

01:33:04.488 --> 01:33:05.169
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're right.

01:33:05.809 --> 01:33:07.870
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.

01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:10.052
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought the 80GB, the new one.

01:33:10.672 --> 01:33:15.495
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't play PlayStation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a PlayStation 2.

01:33:16.356 --> 01:33:17.796
[SPEAKER_10]: And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.

01:33:18.357 --> 01:33:18.517
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.

01:33:19.622 --> 01:33:22.703
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, hey, no, we're not ready for one gun music yet.

01:33:22.963 --> 01:33:23.883
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our break music tonight.

01:33:24.563 --> 01:33:29.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, speaking of PlayStation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:37.686
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this, and it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.

01:33:38.487 --> 01:33:43.128
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm speculating that PlayStation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.

01:33:44.028 --> 01:33:44.268
[SPEAKER_10]: Out by then.

01:34:02.509 --> 01:34:06.114
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.659
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.

01:34:10.139 --> 01:34:11.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I may be proven wrong on this.

01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:14.145
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.

01:34:14.205 --> 01:34:14.585
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha ha.

01:34:15.728 --> 01:34:20.311
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like, you can send me your friend request on PlayStation Network.

01:34:20.731 --> 01:34:24.613
[SPEAKER_10]: As my Xbox Live Gamer Tag suggests, my PlayStation Network handle is Spazinator.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.694
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.

01:34:26.734 --> 01:34:30.256
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.

01:34:30.396 --> 01:34:32.378
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that won't get pulled or anything.

01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:34.699
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, an email from Spazinator.

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.420
[SPEAKER_04]: The grottiest level is well done.

01:34:37.821 --> 01:34:39.982
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?

01:34:41.751 --> 01:34:46.035
[SPEAKER_10]: I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.

01:34:47.716 --> 01:34:48.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

01:34:48.036 --> 01:34:50.418
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.

01:34:50.438 --> 01:34:51.299
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, it is Sunday.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.420
[SPEAKER_10]: But not in Europe.

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:53.761
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

01:34:54.601 --> 01:34:55.422
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be Monday morning.

01:34:55.442 --> 01:34:56.803
[SPEAKER_04]: I just found LittleBigMacross.

01:34:57.604 --> 01:35:01.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.

01:35:01.627 --> 01:35:03.208
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it might actually be Sony.

01:35:03.969 --> 01:35:04.409
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:35:04.509 --> 01:35:04.829
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

01:35:04.889 --> 01:35:05.570
[SPEAKER_09]: I am assuming that.

01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:06.551
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:35:08.032 --> 01:35:08.712
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:35:09.032 --> 01:35:09.333
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

01:35:10.529 --> 01:35:11.930
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a little more news to get to.

01:35:12.450 --> 01:35:17.013
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

01:35:17.673 --> 01:35:28.760
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as that previous email and the whole release date, I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.001
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.

01:35:31.141 --> 01:35:35.363
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.

01:35:35.403 --> 01:35:38.125
[SPEAKER_10]: If they can one-up Microsoft by making their thing better...

01:35:38.925 --> 01:35:49.271
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll wait, but they'll have it out by Christmas, which doesn't leave a lot of time because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before the Thanksgiving rush, but I don't work for Sony.

01:35:49.572 --> 01:35:50.672
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what they think sometimes.

01:35:51.593 --> 01:35:51.893
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

01:35:54.505 --> 01:35:54.945
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

01:35:54.965 --> 01:35:55.846
[SPEAKER_09]: I was watching a video.

01:35:55.866 --> 01:35:57.287
[SPEAKER_09]: They have Sack to the Future.

01:35:57.707 --> 01:35:59.048
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that level got pulled off.

01:35:59.488 --> 01:36:00.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is sweet.

01:36:01.269 --> 01:36:01.629
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

01:36:01.849 --> 01:36:02.470
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, Jamie.

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.971
[SPEAKER_09]: Best game I've played in years.

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:05.351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the Macross level.

01:36:05.652 --> 01:36:06.612
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an amazing game.

01:36:07.152 --> 01:36:07.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

01:36:07.393 --> 01:36:07.593
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:36:07.993 --> 01:36:17.098
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, something that's been actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.

01:36:17.599 --> 01:36:18.579
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, installs.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have an...

01:36:21.841 --> 01:36:25.203
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.

01:36:26.564 --> 01:36:40.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy Dissida, or Dissida or whatever, on the PSP, it now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.

01:36:41.011 --> 01:36:43.833
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.

01:36:43.853 --> 01:36:46.054
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.

01:36:47.471 --> 01:36:48.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that too.

01:36:48.952 --> 01:36:49.272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:36:50.052 --> 01:36:54.214
[SPEAKER_09]: It says they have different install options.

01:36:54.494 --> 01:37:00.596
[SPEAKER_09]: You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.

01:37:04.957 --> 01:37:05.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

01:37:06.338 --> 01:37:07.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed, very interesting.

01:37:07.638 --> 01:37:10.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.320
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my option.

01:37:13.399 --> 01:37:16.521
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.

01:37:18.762 --> 01:37:20.143
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Entertainment asked a good question in chat.

01:37:20.203 --> 01:37:22.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this further facilitate piracy?

01:37:22.385 --> 01:37:22.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

01:37:22.985 --> 01:37:25.426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so rampant anyways.

01:37:25.687 --> 01:37:27.688
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.

01:37:27.948 --> 01:37:32.030
[SPEAKER_09]: And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.

01:37:32.111 --> 01:37:33.091
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

01:37:33.651 --> 01:37:34.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true.

01:37:35.192 --> 01:37:39.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though.

01:37:39.795 --> 01:37:42.017
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty more to come in Part B. Um...

01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:49.425
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.

01:37:50.026 --> 01:37:51.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Not episode, at the start of the next segment.

01:37:51.847 --> 01:37:56.150
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:38:03.112 --> 01:38:07.474
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.

01:38:07.494 --> 01:38:09.775
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.

01:38:10.996 --> 01:38:15.979
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura joined us in the middle of part A. And we want to talk about something.

01:38:17.239 --> 01:38:22.542
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was...

01:38:22.682 --> 01:38:23.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

01:38:44.921 --> 01:38:56.067
[SPEAKER_10]: and also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically, you know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.

01:38:57.988 --> 01:39:10.614
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8, which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.

01:39:10.714 --> 01:39:12.955
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican or

01:39:13.688 --> 01:39:42.287
[SPEAKER_10]: just the fact that we've elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding and I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech and it's really great things are going to happen here in America I think on that front but it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on

01:39:43.007 --> 01:39:48.048
[SPEAKER_10]: and then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.

01:39:49.528 --> 01:39:59.131
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, Proposition 8 took away the right here in California of same-sex couples to marry.

01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:09.613
[SPEAKER_10]: And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California, you took something away.

01:40:10.293 --> 01:40:11.274
[SPEAKER_10]: by passing Proposition 8.

01:40:35.342 --> 01:40:36.343
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:58.183 --> 01:41:08.131
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook, from a friend, who was apologizing because it was their fault.

01:41:09.032 --> 01:41:09.372
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:41:09.713 --> 01:41:11.574
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.

01:41:12.875 --> 01:41:18.420
[SPEAKER_10]: It's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is...

01:41:19.554 --> 01:41:20.935
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you so afraid of?

01:41:22.015 --> 01:41:24.237
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the big deal?

01:41:25.277 --> 01:41:30.681
[SPEAKER_10]: If people you don't even know aren't required to associate with, get married.

01:41:31.661 --> 01:41:35.784
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage.

01:41:35.884 --> 01:41:36.844
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not true.

01:41:37.144 --> 01:41:39.506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.

01:41:40.767 --> 01:41:46.190
[SPEAKER_10]: In a civil union, if my partner... In a civil union, if I pass away...

01:41:47.378 --> 01:41:53.623
[SPEAKER_10]: My partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.

01:41:54.503 --> 01:42:09.834
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from, and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families, that could be a real issue in a lot of families.

01:42:10.815 --> 01:42:11.535
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's one.

01:42:11.715 --> 01:42:12.156
[SPEAKER_10]: One's enough.

01:42:12.396 --> 01:42:13.296
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a difference.

01:42:13.617 --> 01:42:15.178
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more than just the one, but one's enough.

01:42:16.718 --> 01:42:19.160
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's not the same thing as civil unions.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.261
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not protected.

01:42:20.841 --> 01:42:21.501
[SPEAKER_10]: All this BS.

01:42:21.822 --> 01:42:25.484
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?

01:42:25.844 --> 01:42:28.686
[SPEAKER_10]: By using children and this whole schools thing.

01:42:29.147 --> 01:42:32.389
[SPEAKER_10]: If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.

01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:38.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Logic tells you they were lying.

01:42:38.453 --> 01:42:39.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the logic.

01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:42.197
[SPEAKER_10]: Gay marriage was already legal.

01:42:42.717 --> 01:42:46.220
[SPEAKER_10]: So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.701
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's my other question.

01:42:49.654 --> 01:42:51.854
[SPEAKER_10]: So what if they teach it in schools?

01:42:52.395 --> 01:42:52.935
[SPEAKER_10]: So what?

01:42:54.435 --> 01:43:02.056
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird, but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship, do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?

01:43:02.756 --> 01:43:03.676
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, folks.

01:43:04.157 --> 01:43:05.337
[SPEAKER_10]: These kids are going to hear it.

01:43:05.897 --> 01:43:08.657
[SPEAKER_10]: I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.

01:43:09.197 --> 01:43:18.199
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time in very difficult parts of my life were right.

01:43:20.524 --> 01:43:22.926
[SPEAKER_10]: and do you think it's something I chose?

01:43:23.566 --> 01:43:28.109
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.

01:43:28.489 --> 01:43:32.312
[SPEAKER_10]: I assure you I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.

01:43:32.912 --> 01:43:34.133
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not a choice.

01:43:34.773 --> 01:43:36.435
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way I was born.

01:43:36.475 --> 01:43:41.898
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.542
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?

01:43:49.793 --> 01:43:51.099
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, where were you today?

01:43:52.037 --> 01:43:59.400
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps, and it was amazing.

01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:01.001
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of things were going on?

01:44:01.982 --> 01:44:03.302
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just a lot of speakers.

01:44:03.342 --> 01:44:08.144
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody until I got closer.

01:44:08.765 --> 01:44:15.748
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.

01:44:15.768 --> 01:44:16.548
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all very good.

01:44:16.568 --> 01:44:17.869
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a couple of speakers there.

01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:20.110
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was a school commissioner.

01:44:21.951 --> 01:44:30.298
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was there with her family, and they managed to get in right before they weren't doing any more weddings.

01:44:30.378 --> 01:44:32.200
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was there with her family.

01:44:33.962 --> 01:44:43.890
[SPEAKER_04]: And talking about how a big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.

01:44:45.252 --> 01:44:51.316
[SPEAKER_10]: If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it in schools, I don't know.

01:44:51.456 --> 01:44:52.037
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe him.

01:44:52.717 --> 01:44:54.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another one.

01:44:54.418 --> 01:45:00.763
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.

01:45:02.905 --> 01:45:05.667
[SPEAKER_04]: But she was just saying that...

01:45:08.076 --> 01:45:14.980
[SPEAKER_04]: She gave this really great speech just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.782
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pretty crazy to hear about.

01:45:19.763 --> 01:45:23.645
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just a lot of really good energy there today.

01:45:25.566 --> 01:45:27.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.

01:45:27.727 --> 01:45:32.610
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting.

01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:36.512
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.

01:45:37.272 --> 01:45:59.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, about, uh, we're saying that it was the simple, that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority when it, and this has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California and I don't see anyone really have authoring anything about it, that any amendment to our constitution, it basically only takes a simple majority when our budget takes a two thirds majority.

01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:03.052
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if civil, okay.

01:46:03.072 --> 01:46:03.753
[SPEAKER_04]: And how, okay.

01:46:04.013 --> 01:46:05.534
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, prop two passed, right?

01:46:05.848 --> 01:46:06.629
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the chicken thing.

01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:10.792
[SPEAKER_04]: If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?

01:46:11.693 --> 01:46:14.615
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.

01:46:14.955 --> 01:46:16.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 2 is a waste of money.

01:46:16.977 --> 01:46:18.799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a funny contradiction.

01:46:18.979 --> 01:46:19.559
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.

01:46:23.222 --> 01:46:25.724
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it.

01:46:25.864 --> 01:46:27.446
[SPEAKER_10]: I've put in six and a half years on this show.

01:46:27.486 --> 01:46:28.927
[SPEAKER_10]: I can take ten minutes to get political.

01:46:29.627 --> 01:46:29.707
[SPEAKER_10]: If...

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:41.582
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so angry, mostly, at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country, on one hand.

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:46.723
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.

01:46:48.483 --> 01:46:50.663
[SPEAKER_10]: You think some people would know better.

01:46:51.203 --> 01:46:52.144
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just disgusting.

01:46:53.504 --> 01:46:59.365
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you can say this whole, well, can't, you know, the majority talk is just the way it's going to be, da-da-da.

01:46:59.445 --> 01:46:59.485
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:46:59.665 --> 01:46:59.765
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:47:00.751 --> 01:47:18.349
[SPEAKER_10]: because you know what the majority isn't always right and that's what's what's happened in the past what we've seen happen in the past is that you know when that's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong

01:47:20.083 --> 01:47:33.807
[SPEAKER_10]: But what this has really done for this community, and I'm not talking just the gay community, I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community, is it's really mobilized it.

01:47:34.288 --> 01:47:40.870
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think in a way, especially kind of on the tail end of what you see kind of happening with the whole Obama, yes we can, rah, rah, rah.

01:47:41.630 --> 01:47:43.632
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.

01:47:43.752 --> 01:47:50.639
[SPEAKER_10]: But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say, I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.

01:47:51.119 --> 01:47:52.280
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope they're on the right side.

01:47:55.343 --> 01:47:58.126
[SPEAKER_10]: History says they will be, but I don't know.

01:47:58.226 --> 01:47:59.907
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.

01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:01.309
[SPEAKER_10]: But what can we do?

01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:02.830
[SPEAKER_10]: What do I bring it up?

01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:06.093
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?

01:48:06.934 --> 01:48:09.116
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, folks, you've been on Xbox Live.

01:48:09.176 --> 01:48:10.597
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been on these things.

01:48:10.857 --> 01:48:13.339
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.

01:48:13.739 --> 01:48:17.522
[SPEAKER_10]: This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up.

01:48:17.662 --> 01:48:23.987
[SPEAKER_10]: On World of Warcraft, I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar.

01:48:24.147 --> 01:48:28.490
[SPEAKER_10]: Why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.

01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:31.092
[SPEAKER_10]: I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar.

01:48:31.772 --> 01:48:35.195
[SPEAKER_10]: He signed on to his horde character and said, what's your problem, fag?

01:48:37.614 --> 01:48:40.715
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games because you know what?

01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:50.876
[SPEAKER_10]: When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian, I don't give a shit who you are.

01:48:51.697 --> 01:48:52.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

01:48:52.997 --> 01:48:54.897
[SPEAKER_10]: There is nothing to be afraid of.

01:48:54.917 --> 01:49:01.798
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you say that stuff, you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it.

01:49:01.918 --> 01:49:02.698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different.

01:49:04.039 --> 01:49:05.519
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is where this all stems from.

01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:10.592
[SPEAKER_10]: You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.

01:49:12.613 --> 01:49:13.633
[SPEAKER_10]: So just knock it off.

01:49:18.416 --> 01:49:19.477
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess that's all I have to say.

01:49:20.177 --> 01:49:21.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's ridiculous anyway.

01:49:22.898 --> 01:49:23.179
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:49:23.539 --> 01:49:31.843
[SPEAKER_10]: But when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape and go to a happier place where I rule things like in populace.

01:49:31.983 --> 01:49:32.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:49:32.864 --> 01:49:33.964
[SPEAKER_04]: One more politically.

01:49:33.984 --> 01:49:34.745
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, sure, sure.

01:49:35.526 --> 01:49:37.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you majority voters of Arkansas.

01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:42.335
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole nother issue that, oh my god.

01:49:43.376 --> 01:49:44.738
[SPEAKER_10]: I could spend another episode on that.

01:49:45.058 --> 01:49:47.561
[SPEAKER_04]: That earned its own FU too.

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:48.122
[SPEAKER_10]: Say what?

01:49:49.604 --> 01:49:51.747
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what happened in Arkansas?

01:49:51.827 --> 01:49:53.168
[SPEAKER_10]: Only married couples can adopt.

01:49:54.031 --> 01:49:56.874
[SPEAKER_10]: and because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.

01:49:57.195 --> 01:50:01.399
[SPEAKER_10]: But what about, I don't know, what about... How many more children does that put into the system?

01:50:01.679 --> 01:50:03.101
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't even foster children.

01:50:03.281 --> 01:50:04.262
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just adoption.

01:50:04.282 --> 01:50:10.089
[SPEAKER_10]: What if grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died and grandma's husband died?

01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:11.891
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes no sense.

01:50:12.011 --> 01:50:13.072
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so flawed.

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:15.775
[SPEAKER_10]: This all spurns from people's...

01:50:17.148 --> 01:50:22.232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.

01:50:22.433 --> 01:50:26.076
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.

01:50:28.358 --> 01:50:28.798
[SPEAKER_03]: One would hope.

01:50:28.818 --> 01:50:31.801
[SPEAKER_10]: But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.

01:50:32.922 --> 01:50:35.004
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.

01:50:35.844 --> 01:50:42.010
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.

01:50:44.889 --> 01:50:45.892
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's what you did this week.

01:50:46.514 --> 01:50:47.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to video games.

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:53.112
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Activision has taken away some...

01:50:54.372 --> 01:50:58.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour servers.

01:50:59.013 --> 01:51:02.254
[SPEAKER_09]: The GH Tunes service that they have available.

01:51:03.495 --> 01:51:06.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, of course, it's not a big surprise.

01:51:06.536 --> 01:51:09.236
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted.

01:51:09.837 --> 01:51:14.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.

01:51:14.958 --> 01:51:21.160
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like

01:51:22.478 --> 01:51:27.080
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use too.

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.642
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of...

01:51:49.159 --> 01:51:57.582
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess, to emulate it or what have you, only to end up having it deleted.

01:51:58.302 --> 01:52:00.103
[SPEAKER_10]: So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?

01:52:00.663 --> 01:52:02.164
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.

01:52:02.404 --> 01:52:09.266
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things, though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.

01:52:09.746 --> 01:52:15.188
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again unless someone else throws it up there.

01:52:15.668 --> 01:52:17.409
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe, I don't know, you should...

01:52:18.089 --> 01:52:21.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw it up there and not name it like Zelda theme or something like that.

01:52:21.893 --> 01:52:23.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a good idea.

01:52:24.375 --> 01:52:25.997
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:33.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty soon, if it expands like they say there, it'll be really hard to monitor it.

01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:44.993
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last 10 minutes of the show in chat room right now, so sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.

01:52:45.053 --> 01:52:50.414
[SPEAKER_10]: But has there been any really good original works to kind of come out of this too?

01:52:51.615 --> 01:52:58.096
[SPEAKER_10]: All I hear about are, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels too, but I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.

01:52:58.416 --> 01:52:58.877
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

01:52:58.957 --> 01:53:01.237
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.

01:53:01.657 --> 01:53:03.658
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...

01:53:04.698 --> 01:53:05.359
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:53:26.707 --> 01:53:33.633
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.

01:53:34.934 --> 01:53:40.098
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bobby's in chat right now and says most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid music creator mode like me.

01:53:41.278 --> 01:53:42.600
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band Rock Band Rock Band

01:54:00.798 --> 01:54:21.335
[SPEAKER_10]: and there is a download pack coming out very soon it's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album and you know the song Everlong is from that album it's already in the game and it's a lot of fun to play even if it's a bitch but there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this Monkey Wrench I believe was one of the singles there My Hero of course is another big song from that album so the Color and the Shape album

01:54:21.795 --> 01:54:24.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters is the next release.

01:54:25.177 --> 01:54:31.120
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free rock band songs have started to hit as well.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I downloaded those finally.

01:54:33.641 --> 01:54:35.382
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played any of them, but I downloaded them.

01:54:35.962 --> 01:54:38.223
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.

01:54:38.243 --> 01:54:39.824
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's awesome?

01:54:39.884 --> 01:54:42.085
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2.

01:54:42.425 --> 01:54:43.406
[SPEAKER_09]: Our band now is in the top 500.

01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.770
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:46.270
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:54:46.810 --> 01:54:48.451
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.

01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:49.791
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang, he must be really good.

01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:50.871
[SPEAKER_09]: He is really good.

01:54:51.011 --> 01:54:51.492
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

01:54:51.852 --> 01:54:52.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for him.

01:54:53.632 --> 01:54:54.492
[SPEAKER_09]: I distracted him, though.

01:54:54.532 --> 01:54:57.153
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.

01:54:57.273 --> 01:55:01.754
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason, and it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.

01:55:01.854 --> 01:55:05.415
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't gotten my Suzy and the Banshees songs, and I really need to do that.

01:55:05.635 --> 01:55:07.616
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a new drum set I bought.

01:55:07.796 --> 01:55:11.997
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.

01:55:12.717 --> 01:55:32.023
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm not playing it until I get my rock band cymbals for it which supposedly are coming in tomorrow cross our fingers so hopefully once I get the cymbals then I'll start playing my new drum set but until then I'm not touching it alright we'll see what happens but there's other rock band news yes?

01:55:32.827 --> 01:55:33.228
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.

01:55:33.348 --> 01:55:38.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.

01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:44.583
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points, but...

01:55:49.481 --> 01:55:53.402
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.

01:55:54.223 --> 01:55:55.403
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's what's going up.

01:55:56.203 --> 01:56:02.866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.

01:56:03.166 --> 01:56:03.766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cool song.

01:56:04.626 --> 01:56:13.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts, Angels and Airwaves, Just What I Needed, The Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes, Finally!

01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:17.431
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.

01:56:17.451 --> 01:56:18.011
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's...

01:56:19.465 --> 01:56:30.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Monkey Gone to Heaven by the Pixies Rio Duran Duran Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue Simple Man, Leonard Skinner, Snow, Heyo by Red Hot Chili Peppers The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails The Saint of Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy which I like that song too

01:56:47.123 --> 01:56:53.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Time is Running Out, Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me, Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Comin', Judas Priest, and Zero, Smashing Pumpkins.

01:56:53.248 --> 01:56:53.969
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a bad track list.

01:56:54.249 --> 01:56:54.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

01:56:55.731 --> 01:57:03.437
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of neat about that, though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.

01:57:03.517 --> 01:57:05.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, the Pixies track was from the album release.

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:08.942
[SPEAKER_10]: The Heyo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.

01:57:09.262 --> 01:57:09.943
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of interesting.

01:57:10.703 --> 01:57:13.746
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just single track releases they picked from.

01:57:13.786 --> 01:57:14.606
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really a...

01:57:15.407 --> 01:57:36.398
[SPEAKER_09]: Smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band which I think is interesting yeah and what's also cool about that too is once again with this you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1 or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want oh that's kind of neat how would that work on the Wii though?

01:57:37.702 --> 01:57:38.162
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Wii.

01:57:38.803 --> 01:57:41.125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how they're going to... I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.

01:57:42.005 --> 01:57:49.111
[SPEAKER_09]: It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on, because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.

01:57:49.791 --> 01:57:51.213
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

01:57:51.433 --> 01:57:52.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Soon, I guess.

01:57:52.934 --> 01:57:58.498
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just like printing money, though, for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game, though.

01:57:58.839 --> 01:58:03.662
[SPEAKER_10]: You're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

01:58:03.842 --> 01:58:06.985
[SPEAKER_10]: This thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.

01:58:07.485 --> 01:58:35.110
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's just you know and if you think about it if you're like looking for a really cheap guitar game like you just want something to play I mean you literally can go out there and buy used I saw used rock band guitars for like 12 bucks and then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks there you go you know for less than 50 bucks you can have like a guitar hero type of thing that's a nice way of getting around it I like the way you think

01:58:36.398 --> 01:58:39.000
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller.

01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:39.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

01:59:00.157 --> 01:59:02.839
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know that Top 500 Bands?

01:59:02.919 --> 01:59:05.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.

01:59:05.342 --> 01:59:12.529
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar and game bundle, but now I'm not so sure.

01:59:12.609 --> 01:59:16.132
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.

01:59:16.473 --> 01:59:17.514
[SPEAKER_10]: I might just go back and pick that up.

01:59:17.734 --> 01:59:18.555
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Freaks Drum Mania

01:59:36.371 --> 01:59:38.993
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing!

01:59:39.273 --> 01:59:40.954
[SPEAKER_09]: With four exclamation points.

01:59:40.994 --> 01:59:42.055
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so awesome.

01:59:42.735 --> 01:59:46.197
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems to be fire themed, so that's kind of cool.

01:59:47.158 --> 01:59:57.985
[SPEAKER_09]: And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you can believe it or not, 570 plus songs.

02:00:02.150 --> 02:00:03.531
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess in all.

02:00:04.531 --> 02:00:06.313
[SPEAKER_09]: That's freaking crazy.

02:00:07.994 --> 02:00:09.655
[SPEAKER_09]: Over 570 songs.

02:00:10.275 --> 02:00:12.476
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.

02:00:12.776 --> 02:00:13.357
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be.

02:00:13.457 --> 02:00:14.638
[SPEAKER_09]: My god, that's huge.

02:00:14.658 --> 02:00:17.219
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you scroll through that damn list?

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:18.440
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Location testing soon, I guess.

02:00:22.022 --> 02:00:30.147
[SPEAKER_09]: And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drum Mania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.

02:00:32.094 --> 02:00:32.854
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nuts.

02:00:33.134 --> 02:00:33.554
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a lot.

02:00:33.855 --> 02:00:34.495
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

02:00:35.055 --> 02:00:42.217
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.

02:00:42.897 --> 02:00:56.321
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which by the way, I just wanted to say quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it, but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.

02:00:56.621 --> 02:01:00.382
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, to go back to what I said, I blame

02:01:01.681 --> 02:01:08.028
[SPEAKER_10]: and society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.

02:01:08.649 --> 02:01:18.420
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:23.902
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat.

02:01:23.922 --> 02:01:25.062
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just kind of what I wanted to say.

02:01:26.023 --> 02:01:30.985
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I want to say regarding games, SSJ100Matt says, the Microsoft Employee Store has Gears of War 2 for $25.

02:01:32.386 --> 02:01:34.687
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, but employee stores always have games dirt cheap.

02:01:34.727 --> 02:01:34.987
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact...

02:01:36.574 --> 02:01:38.395
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.

02:01:38.955 --> 02:01:42.376
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have a copy of Boom Blox I barely touched.

02:01:42.536 --> 02:01:43.996
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a little different than the employee store.

02:01:44.016 --> 02:01:48.978
[SPEAKER_09]: This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.

02:01:49.338 --> 02:01:51.999
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get games for the $3.60 on the first party except for $9.

02:01:52.839 --> 02:01:55.880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.961
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're revamping it.

02:01:58.981 --> 02:02:01.422
[SPEAKER_09]: They're redoing it because I don't know.

02:02:01.442 --> 02:02:02.282
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it needs it.

02:02:03.166 --> 02:02:06.609
[SPEAKER_10]: and SonicM88 says the Explorer is still the best, Rob.

02:02:06.989 --> 02:02:10.412
[SPEAKER_10]: And Actdeft says Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.

02:02:10.712 --> 02:02:16.437
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking, which sucks.

02:02:17.818 --> 02:02:18.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Controller surgery!

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.763
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously, $8 will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

02:02:22.783 --> 02:02:23.123
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

02:02:23.203 --> 02:02:25.405
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

02:02:26.245 --> 02:02:30.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:31.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

02:02:32.342 --> 02:02:38.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I forgot to, you know, this is like totally skipped this, but I forgot to mention that... We're all over the place today.

02:02:38.508 --> 02:02:39.008
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's cool.

02:02:39.349 --> 02:02:41.370
[SPEAKER_09]: In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.

02:02:41.871 --> 02:02:42.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

02:02:42.612 --> 02:02:46.996
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Supernova at that one game store I was telling you about.

02:02:47.116 --> 02:02:48.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out.

02:02:48.537 --> 02:02:50.698
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't exercise still for another week and a half.

02:02:50.738 --> 02:02:54.481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another reason I didn't go out today, just because of the timing of what was going on today.

02:02:54.521 --> 02:02:59.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.

02:03:00.225 --> 02:03:03.927
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.

02:03:04.188 --> 02:03:07.670
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun, but I'm totally out of shape.

02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:08.891
[SPEAKER_09]: Supernova is fun.

02:03:37.569 --> 02:03:38.830
[SPEAKER_10]: Jonathan Lee Riches

02:04:00.902 --> 02:04:04.543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.

02:04:05.223 --> 02:04:07.004
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?

02:04:07.444 --> 02:04:17.307
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft and fought cyber monster gangs.

02:04:19.327 --> 02:04:23.708
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.

02:04:24.429 --> 02:04:29.390
[SPEAKER_10]: So in other words, here's somebody saying, it's Blizzard's fault...

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.882
[SPEAKER_10]: That I can't separate game from reality.

02:04:33.663 --> 02:04:33.983
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:04:35.765 --> 02:04:38.268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's called, um, he's stupid.

02:04:39.449 --> 02:04:43.193
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no such thing as video game addiction.

02:04:44.113 --> 02:04:49.098
[SPEAKER_04]: There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.

02:04:49.459 --> 02:04:51.200
[SPEAKER_04]: There are OCD people out there.

02:04:52.001 --> 02:04:53.643
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is just stupid.

02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:59.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know, dumbs down the whole thing.

02:05:00.053 --> 02:05:06.316
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's crazy to think that there are people out there that rationalize this like his lawyer.

02:05:06.776 --> 02:05:10.898
[SPEAKER_09]: Or better yet, why are we letting, yeah, exactly, why are we letting inmates sue?

02:05:10.958 --> 02:05:14.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we letting these inmates, like, sue everybody?

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:15.760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just retarded.

02:05:17.121 --> 02:05:18.622
[SPEAKER_09]: What else are you going to do when you're in prison?

02:05:18.922 --> 02:05:21.503
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.

02:05:23.027 --> 02:05:25.408
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, you know, we don't have the shit.

02:05:27.048 --> 02:05:28.049
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get three.

02:05:28.689 --> 02:05:31.370
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.

02:05:31.930 --> 02:05:32.250
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sure.

02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:33.391
[SPEAKER_10]: Tyra will solve everything.

02:05:34.371 --> 02:05:35.812
[SPEAKER_04]: We should give him a stern talking to.

02:05:36.152 --> 02:05:37.452
[SPEAKER_04]: We should let Oprah deal with him.

02:05:37.492 --> 02:05:40.853
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to point out, it's a handwritten... Oh my god!

02:05:40.874 --> 02:05:43.334
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually looking at the text.

02:05:43.354 --> 02:05:47.616
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a handwritten testimony there.

02:05:50.734 --> 02:05:56.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment asks can I sue Fanta for being awesome?

02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:59.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, that's retarded.

02:06:01.442 --> 02:06:04.024
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that it's handwritten, that's also retarded.

02:06:04.124 --> 02:06:05.905
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, dude, get a typewriter.

02:06:06.386 --> 02:06:06.606
[SPEAKER_09]: At least.

02:06:06.626 --> 02:06:08.347
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't let you have typewriters in prison.

02:06:08.467 --> 02:06:12.210
[SPEAKER_10]: This caused Rich's to commit fraud to buy Defendants video games.

02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:15.252
[SPEAKER_10]: Rich's chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.

02:06:15.672 --> 02:06:18.174
[SPEAKER_10]: Rich's mind became a living video game.

02:06:18.294 --> 02:06:20.796
[SPEAKER_10]: I hold Defendants liable and support plaintiffs.

02:06:21.476 --> 02:06:23.578
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is he referring to himself in the third person?

02:06:24.258 --> 02:06:25.899
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's like a lawyer or something.

02:06:25.979 --> 02:06:26.260
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:26.740
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway.

02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:28.621
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did the lawyer then handwrite all that?

02:06:28.721 --> 02:06:29.362
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

02:06:30.879 --> 02:06:34.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, they gave Jack Thompson a license, so, you know.

02:06:34.563 --> 02:06:40.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but eventually people got, you know, their brains straightened, you know, took away his license.

02:06:41.130 --> 02:06:48.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300 some odd episodes, you know what segment's coming next.

02:07:03.902 --> 02:07:05.883
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.

02:07:05.963 --> 02:07:08.123
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a comment from Marissa in chat.

02:07:08.183 --> 02:07:09.884
[SPEAKER_10]: The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here for forever.

02:07:10.704 --> 02:07:11.584
[SPEAKER_10]: Who needs to come back, by the way.

02:07:12.245 --> 02:07:14.245
[SPEAKER_10]: You learn something new every day on Orange Launch Radio.

02:07:14.525 --> 02:07:15.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa says, I work in law.

02:07:15.946 --> 02:07:17.266
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen handwritten pleadings.

02:07:17.306 --> 02:07:18.086
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so funny.

02:07:18.246 --> 02:07:19.887
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently this is not uncommon.

02:07:20.847 --> 02:07:21.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

02:07:21.587 --> 02:07:21.767
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

02:07:21.908 --> 02:07:22.548
[SPEAKER_10]: FU's of the week time.

02:07:23.488 --> 02:07:26.329
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.

02:07:27.689 --> 02:07:28.329
[SPEAKER_04]: And Prop 2.

02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:32.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.

02:07:33.945 --> 02:07:35.786
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I understand we love the animals!

02:07:36.947 --> 02:07:51.638
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop... And, sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens, and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8, it's just stupid.

02:07:51.978 --> 02:07:58.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass!

02:08:00.994 --> 02:08:03.736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you've got your nose turned up, because all you can smell is your own shit.

02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.598
[SPEAKER_04]: And it don't smell good.

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:11.362
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted yes on prop 2 because I thought chickens that got the stand-up would taste better.

02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:17.026
[SPEAKER_10]: Which actually is partially true, in a way.

02:08:17.386 --> 02:08:17.947
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

02:08:18.947 --> 02:08:21.469
[SPEAKER_10]: Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.

02:08:21.609 --> 02:08:23.311
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what people are ignoring with this.

02:08:23.391 --> 02:08:24.752
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, chickens are stupid.

02:08:26.173 --> 02:08:27.614
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me finish by what I'm saying.

02:08:28.134 --> 02:08:28.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Second of all...

02:08:29.495 --> 02:08:41.086
[SPEAKER_04]: For however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into getting up to these new standards, it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.

02:08:41.887 --> 02:08:47.653
[SPEAKER_04]: And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is, for people losing their homes left and right,

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:51.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?

02:08:52.097 --> 02:09:06.431
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple financial impact this is going to have on everybody just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.

02:09:06.691 --> 02:09:09.674
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.

02:09:11.525 --> 02:09:12.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

02:09:12.526 --> 02:09:13.606
[SPEAKER_09]: Get those Nevada chickens.

02:09:13.727 --> 02:09:18.930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a frivolous waste of money because people... Ugh.

02:09:19.230 --> 02:09:20.031
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame liberals.

02:09:22.332 --> 02:09:24.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

02:09:25.294 --> 02:09:39.744
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to say a few of the people that voted yes on 8, but not necessarily... They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything and they were showing... They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on 8 party or whatever.

02:09:40.365 --> 02:09:40.465
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

02:09:40.965 --> 02:09:43.646
[SPEAKER_09]: It just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.

02:09:44.027 --> 02:09:45.587
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to actually add another F you then.

02:09:46.588 --> 02:09:49.689
[SPEAKER_04]: To the Mormon Church, F you, I'm boycotting all your businesses.

02:09:49.709 --> 02:09:55.352
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's alright, you know, so.

02:09:56.477 --> 02:09:57.058
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to that, I guess.

02:09:57.258 --> 02:10:05.285
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to the fact that there was another proposition that was passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing.

02:10:05.746 --> 02:10:15.595
[SPEAKER_09]: When, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people... It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like...

02:10:16.889 --> 02:10:21.513
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.

02:10:21.553 --> 02:10:24.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same FU.

02:10:24.315 --> 02:10:28.118
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to say FU to intolerance.

02:10:28.238 --> 02:10:29.719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really surprised to learn this week

02:10:46.081 --> 02:10:53.144
[SPEAKER_10]: and all walks of life in all places in my life where there is still intolerance and we have a lot of work to do.

02:10:55.224 --> 02:10:55.624
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:10:57.005 --> 02:10:57.385
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:10:57.905 --> 02:10:58.426
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

02:10:58.546 --> 02:10:59.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming news.

02:10:59.526 --> 02:11:00.306
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming deals.

02:11:01.247 --> 02:11:02.247
[SPEAKER_10]: Games that are steel.

02:11:03.547 --> 02:11:07.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?

02:11:08.766 --> 02:11:09.126
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean?

02:11:09.286 --> 02:11:09.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Tabula Rasa.

02:11:10.347 --> 02:11:12.227
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm bum.

02:11:12.827 --> 02:11:13.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:11:13.928 --> 02:11:15.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.

02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

02:11:17.689 --> 02:11:17.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:11:18.209 --> 02:11:20.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents.

02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:21.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I checked.

02:11:21.671 --> 02:11:26.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to translate that into... Is that with free shipping?

02:11:26.472 --> 02:11:26.672
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:11:27.373 --> 02:11:27.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

02:11:28.193 --> 02:11:30.934
[SPEAKER_04]: It would translate to 61 pence, by the way.

02:11:32.387 --> 02:11:34.748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.

02:11:34.929 --> 02:11:56.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people, but they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of Hammer Space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!

02:11:56.818 --> 02:12:00.180
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.182
[SPEAKER_04]: But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.

02:12:05.542 --> 02:12:07.463
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.

02:12:08.103 --> 02:12:11.544
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.

02:12:11.764 --> 02:12:13.305
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually half-tempted.

02:12:13.365 --> 02:12:15.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Tabula Rasa was not terrible.

02:12:15.546 --> 02:12:18.687
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking about it, too.

02:12:18.727 --> 02:12:21.248
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a month of play for five bucks.

02:12:22.388 --> 02:12:22.869
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:24.169
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be worth a look.

02:12:24.989 --> 02:12:25.950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of curious.

02:12:26.010 --> 02:12:27.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly do think this is the tactic.

02:12:28.331 --> 02:12:28.571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

02:12:29.894 --> 02:12:32.456
[SPEAKER_10]: is a very interesting way to get people on board because that's what they'll make their money.

02:12:32.476 --> 02:12:36.218
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game because the retailer gets screwed there.

02:12:36.238 --> 02:12:40.960
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something, which I won't do.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.081
[SPEAKER_10]: If the game sucks, it sucks.

02:12:42.901 --> 02:12:45.043
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.

02:12:45.083 --> 02:12:46.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about buying it.

02:12:46.683 --> 02:12:47.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to have.

02:12:47.664 --> 02:12:49.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to go in the collection.

02:12:49.085 --> 02:12:50.285
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a Lord British game.

02:12:50.546 --> 02:12:52.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?

02:12:52.407 --> 02:12:53.947
[SPEAKER_10]: Commander British or whatever his name is.

02:12:54.067 --> 02:12:54.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:56.481
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:13:13.050 --> 02:13:13.510
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:13.791
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

02:13:13.811 --> 02:13:14.851
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two words to say.

02:13:14.951 --> 02:13:15.151
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:13:15.572 --> 02:13:16.032
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no!

02:13:17.333 --> 02:13:19.013
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of sadly what I had to say.

02:13:19.033 --> 02:13:21.215
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.

02:13:21.975 --> 02:13:22.195
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

02:13:22.415 --> 02:13:22.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, life.

02:13:23.016 --> 02:13:23.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

02:13:23.416 --> 02:13:23.596
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:13:23.756 --> 02:13:23.976
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

02:13:24.116 --> 02:13:25.357
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:13:25.557 --> 02:13:25.657
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:13:25.677 --> 02:13:27.598
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to come out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?

02:13:28.859 --> 02:13:29.119
[SPEAKER_10]: When?

02:13:29.859 --> 02:13:30.320
[SPEAKER_10]: Thursday?

02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:31.160
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.401
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably won't go by it at midnight.

02:13:32.641 --> 02:13:35.843
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?

02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:39.953
[SPEAKER_10]: I... Everybody's EPing is going to make them go on there first.

02:13:40.274 --> 02:13:41.195
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Ragnarok.

02:13:41.815 --> 02:13:42.276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

02:13:42.456 --> 02:13:43.057
[SPEAKER_10]: You go, girl.

02:13:43.237 --> 02:13:43.557
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:13:44.218 --> 02:13:44.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

02:13:44.919 --> 02:13:45.360
[SPEAKER_02]: You go.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.844
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep going.

02:13:49.344 --> 02:13:49.745
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

02:13:51.787 --> 02:13:57.294
[SPEAKER_09]: So there... You know, the DSi just was released and it's apparently, you know...

02:13:59.252 --> 02:14:06.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Allowed now the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew slash hacking carts.

02:14:06.934 --> 02:14:08.094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's prevented them from working.

02:14:09.815 --> 02:14:14.556
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSi has already been hacked.

02:14:14.696 --> 02:14:27.579
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've already got... Yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess, developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World...

02:14:28.779 --> 02:14:42.283
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently it was done also with something that has been exploited on... I'd like to, for once, on this Hello World program, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is to simply print Hello World on the screen.

02:14:42.824 --> 02:14:47.025
[SPEAKER_10]: In Commodore Basic, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.

02:14:48.264 --> 02:14:48.925
[SPEAKER_10]: 20, GoTo10.

02:14:50.706 --> 02:14:53.148
[SPEAKER_10]: If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.

02:14:53.729 --> 02:14:54.790
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello Piracy!

02:14:55.190 --> 02:15:10.062
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing, which for people that know, the PSP was done the same way and seems to be something that's pretty typical.

02:15:11.103 --> 02:15:11.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprise!

02:15:12.764 --> 02:15:16.808
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.

02:15:18.905 --> 02:15:22.667
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.

02:15:22.687 --> 02:15:25.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially now with SD card support, man.

02:15:26.090 --> 02:15:27.871
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to make things even easier, because you know what that means?

02:15:28.651 --> 02:15:31.753
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of knew this was going to happen when they announced that SD card slot was going to be on there, right?

02:15:31.773 --> 02:15:32.414
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine that, though?

02:15:32.474 --> 02:15:38.057
[SPEAKER_09]: With SD card support, all you're really going to need to do is load a program, and then you're going to be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.

02:15:38.097 --> 02:15:39.198
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't even need a cart.

02:15:39.578 --> 02:15:41.079
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be even easier to hack open.

02:15:41.219 --> 02:15:41.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo-hoo.

02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:44.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

02:15:44.882 --> 02:15:45.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

02:15:46.877 --> 02:15:48.178
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:16:09.389 --> 02:16:14.675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yaris is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:16:14.835 --> 02:16:17.618
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.

02:16:21.073 --> 02:16:31.041
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?

02:16:31.722 --> 02:16:35.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Or this game did come out about one year ago exactly.

02:16:36.426 --> 02:16:41.289
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it some type of contractual thing going on where it was a Toyota promotion?

02:16:42.350 --> 02:16:44.292
[SPEAKER_10]: It was basically a game advertisement.

02:16:44.692 --> 02:16:45.673
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the ad run out?

02:16:46.313 --> 02:16:46.794
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably did.

02:16:49.111 --> 02:16:53.058
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bobby Blackwolf swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.

02:16:55.582 --> 02:16:56.925
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wouldn't be surprised at all.

02:16:58.888 --> 02:17:03.871
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's coming for you.

02:17:05.072 --> 02:17:07.554
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was a big advertisement game.

02:17:07.574 --> 02:17:09.455
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it probably sucked in the first place.

02:17:10.536 --> 02:17:12.417
[SPEAKER_10]: Who puts that much effort into an ad game?

02:17:12.977 --> 02:17:14.438
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.

02:17:14.658 --> 02:17:16.540
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Hero was cool.

02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:17.560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Star Hero was kind of cool.

02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.921
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope I don't lose those achievements.

02:17:19.141 --> 02:17:19.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

02:17:20.082 --> 02:17:20.402
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

02:17:20.902 --> 02:17:23.204
[SPEAKER_09]: It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.

02:17:23.953 --> 02:17:25.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about something cool?

02:17:25.473 --> 02:17:26.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, how about it?

02:17:26.794 --> 02:17:30.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.

02:17:31.995 --> 02:17:32.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising 2?

02:17:33.336 --> 02:17:33.796
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hey!

02:17:34.216 --> 02:17:34.496
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

02:17:35.036 --> 02:17:35.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

02:17:36.256 --> 02:17:45.699
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to be... Well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.

02:17:45.859 --> 02:17:47.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Insider info.

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:47.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.601
[SPEAKER_04]: No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything.

02:17:51.641 --> 02:17:51.961
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey!

02:17:53.856 --> 02:17:58.400
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?

02:17:58.880 --> 02:17:59.341
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no.

02:17:59.361 --> 02:18:00.102
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombies!

02:18:00.682 --> 02:18:01.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

02:18:01.243 --> 02:18:01.803
[SPEAKER_10]: And malls.

02:18:03.004 --> 02:18:05.006
[SPEAKER_12]: What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?

02:18:06.588 --> 02:18:07.108
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's true.

02:18:07.148 --> 02:18:07.909
[SPEAKER_10]: It might not be a mall.

02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:09.570
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how about an airport?

02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:12.513
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you think the zombie outbreak's going to happen next?

02:18:12.553 --> 02:18:13.494
[SPEAKER_04]: An office building.

02:18:14.595 --> 02:18:14.875
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

02:18:15.836 --> 02:18:16.657
[SPEAKER_10]: During the lunch hour.

02:18:17.529 --> 02:18:18.690
[SPEAKER_10]: and Brains.

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:20.851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what's for lunch.

02:18:22.092 --> 02:18:25.054
[SPEAKER_10]: Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.

02:18:25.174 --> 02:18:26.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you need to play the song.

02:18:27.115 --> 02:18:27.335
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:18:27.515 --> 02:18:28.916
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Jonathan Colton song.

02:18:29.276 --> 02:18:29.756
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, later.

02:18:29.856 --> 02:18:30.637
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have it right now.

02:18:32.178 --> 02:18:35.039
[SPEAKER_10]: But Dead Rising 2 is... Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.961
[SPEAKER_10]: What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?

02:18:38.041 --> 02:18:39.202
[SPEAKER_10]: Fix the saving.

02:18:40.102 --> 02:18:41.263
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix the saving.

02:18:41.743 --> 02:18:42.784
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix the saving.

02:18:43.665 --> 02:18:44.185
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:18:46.112 --> 02:18:47.294
[SPEAKER_09]: and Rocket Launchers.

02:18:47.976 --> 02:18:48.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Rocket Launchers.

02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:51.143
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Rocket Launchers Save Guns?

02:18:52.714 --> 02:19:16.939
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocket Launcher Save Guns could be awesome another thing that could be awesome is some more more stuff that could be coming out and Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games some sound ordinary one sounds really weird of course they just put out Alien Crush Returns which is really awesome um

02:19:18.246 --> 02:19:24.785
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii Shop and are probably coming over here at some point as well.

02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:33.166
[SPEAKER_09]: First, they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.

02:19:33.186 --> 02:19:35.988
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not QQ Sports when you lose.

02:19:36.008 --> 02:19:36.528
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not QQ.

02:19:37.089 --> 02:19:44.314
[SPEAKER_09]: It features online play for one of the four players and allows you to either do motion controller or button-based play.

02:19:45.335 --> 02:19:53.322
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat, sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.

02:19:53.522 --> 02:19:54.262
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of cool.

02:19:55.191 --> 02:19:57.852
[SPEAKER_09]: The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.

02:20:01.933 --> 02:20:02.373
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

02:20:02.433 --> 02:20:13.516
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of like a racing game, but you play Pit Crew that fixes different things from fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.

02:20:16.837 --> 02:20:18.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how exciting.

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:21.379
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you do on your Wii today?

02:20:21.419 --> 02:20:22.339
[SPEAKER_10]: I fixed a toilet.

02:20:23.547 --> 02:20:24.068
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome!

02:20:24.248 --> 02:20:26.009
[SPEAKER_04]: You did what Wii with your toilet?

02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:32.895
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides the toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game, and boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.

02:20:34.636 --> 02:20:35.177
[SPEAKER_10]: Beer Pong?

02:20:36.198 --> 02:20:36.938
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what is it?

02:20:37.019 --> 02:20:38.200
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not Beer Pong.

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:39.340
[SPEAKER_10]: They changed the name, remember?

02:20:40.181 --> 02:20:42.303
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Pong Toss or something like that.

02:20:42.343 --> 02:20:43.124
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't that what they called it?

02:20:44.825 --> 02:20:47.387
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that, yeah.

02:20:47.447 --> 02:20:47.728
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow...

02:20:48.956 --> 02:20:49.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Burnout Paradise

02:21:20.445 --> 02:21:22.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the creator of the DeLorean?

02:21:22.306 --> 02:21:24.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, so that's what it is there.

02:21:25.368 --> 02:21:26.088
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

02:21:26.268 --> 02:21:28.049
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.

02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:29.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a McLaren clone in there?

02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:36.854
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have cars called the Calvary Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.

02:21:36.934 --> 02:21:49.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not-so-DeLorean, is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it, and if you push the L3 button, it will hover.

02:21:51.264 --> 02:21:52.865
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at that in the screenshot.

02:21:52.905 --> 02:21:54.466
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.

02:21:54.526 --> 02:21:55.346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bump and jump all of a sudden.

02:21:55.366 --> 02:21:55.746
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hovering.

02:21:55.766 --> 02:21:56.627
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

02:21:56.647 --> 02:21:57.587
[SPEAKER_09]: It will go in the hover mode.

02:21:57.807 --> 02:21:59.248
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what those other ones are?

02:21:59.268 --> 02:22:02.029
[SPEAKER_09]: The bootlegger, that of course is the General Lee.

02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:09.633
[SPEAKER_09]: The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1, and the other one, Kit.

02:22:10.493 --> 02:22:11.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

02:22:11.694 --> 02:22:12.454
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they call it, Car?

02:22:14.796 --> 02:22:17.017
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's what these other little names are.

02:22:17.217 --> 02:22:18.197
[SPEAKER_10]: GT Nighthawk.

02:22:18.557 --> 02:22:19.678
[SPEAKER_10]: GT Nighthawk, yeah.

02:22:19.838 --> 02:22:20.218
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

02:22:20.998 --> 02:22:22.019
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's pretty awesome.

02:22:22.879 --> 02:22:27.360
[SPEAKER_10]: And bless those folks at Criterion Games, because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Burnout Paradise.

02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:29.961
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.

02:22:29.981 --> 02:22:35.403
[SPEAKER_10]: They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game, so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.

02:22:35.923 --> 02:22:37.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, they didn't make the show roll.

02:22:37.143 --> 02:22:39.604
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a new party thing.

02:22:39.644 --> 02:22:42.565
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Burnout Party or something like that that's coming out in February.

02:22:42.906 --> 02:22:44.576
[SPEAKER_09]: February, I think.

02:22:44.657 --> 02:22:45.522
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically...

02:22:47.299 --> 02:22:50.201
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.

02:22:50.241 --> 02:22:53.423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.

02:22:53.463 --> 02:22:54.204
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I kept it.

02:22:54.244 --> 02:22:55.044
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I still kept mine.

02:22:55.064 --> 02:22:56.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure, but either way,

02:23:17.919 --> 02:23:31.362
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebuy it if I have it And also if you're on the Playstation 3 You can just download it That's true, you can't always just download it On the Playstation 3, it's in their little store That's pretty cool Good for them, giving us our money's worth

02:23:32.588 --> 02:23:48.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money, more actually referring to economy, is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.

02:23:49.638 --> 02:24:10.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you basically will be able to, um, take empty space station areas and put in stores, put in shops, um, customize them however you want to, make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue, um, you can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency, you know, that type of thing, so it sounds pretty cool.

02:24:10.663 --> 02:24:11.743
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this, Quark the Game?

02:24:15.795 --> 02:24:22.217
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on where you can take command of a ship.

02:24:23.297 --> 02:24:24.097
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

02:24:25.917 --> 02:24:29.418
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.

02:24:29.558 --> 02:24:30.938
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

02:24:31.959 --> 02:24:33.779
[SPEAKER_10]: Eve definitely has its following though.

02:24:33.879 --> 02:24:38.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh come on, they're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.

02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:42.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer the chess game.

02:24:43.482 --> 02:24:45.044
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's kind of neat.

02:24:45.064 --> 02:24:51.670
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, EVE's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO, but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.

02:24:51.810 --> 02:24:52.871
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never played it myself.

02:24:53.131 --> 02:24:56.515
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.

02:25:00.479 --> 02:25:01.800
[SPEAKER_09]: So, speaking of...

02:25:03.066 --> 02:25:04.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

02:25:21.338 --> 02:25:22.519
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

02:25:50.438 --> 02:25:51.378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awesome idea.

02:25:51.418 --> 02:25:55.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game and decide, oh, guess what?

02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.920
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to pay for it now.

02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:57.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

02:25:57.780 --> 02:26:01.521
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not going to have any songs that are actually, you know, based on other things.

02:26:01.581 --> 02:26:02.822
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just all original stuff.

02:26:04.502 --> 02:26:05.202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that'll fly.

02:26:07.659 --> 02:26:13.543
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that you should know too is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.

02:26:13.923 --> 02:26:18.006
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they said that Activision 09 lineup is 40% larger.

02:26:18.386 --> 02:26:23.969
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty and multiple Guitar Hero releases.

02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:28.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:31.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

02:26:32.329 --> 02:26:34.370
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear something else that's also interesting?

02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:40.831
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember NVIDIA when they purchased them and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?

02:26:41.351 --> 02:26:42.591
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why they got rid of them?

02:26:43.432 --> 02:26:45.712
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they can't keep making sequels for them.

02:26:45.812 --> 02:26:46.432
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.

02:26:46.712 --> 02:26:50.073
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.

02:26:50.573 --> 02:26:52.053
[SPEAKER_09]: They even came out and said that.

02:26:52.414 --> 02:26:57.115
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they didn't pick up those original games because they only want games that they can make sequels for.

02:26:57.255 --> 02:26:58.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?

02:26:59.515 --> 02:27:01.857
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been many Ghostbusters games.

02:27:02.558 --> 02:27:03.438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.

02:27:04.699 --> 02:27:07.822
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.

02:27:08.322 --> 02:27:10.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters 2.

02:27:11.245 --> 02:27:13.106
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.

02:27:13.266 --> 02:27:14.087
[SPEAKER_10]: That was one of those 386SX games.

02:27:14.107 --> 02:27:15.448
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't need them if they have the IP.

02:27:25.421 --> 02:27:25.801
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

02:27:25.962 --> 02:27:26.963
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:27:27.223 --> 02:27:28.104
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that would work.

02:27:28.464 --> 02:27:30.046
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's why.

02:27:30.347 --> 02:27:34.031
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.

02:27:34.451 --> 02:27:38.816
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, there's that, you know, maybe a World War II and a modern and future one.

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:40.057
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this guitar...

02:27:40.678 --> 02:27:41.198
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

02:28:06.107 --> 02:28:13.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Downscale the videos or something like that for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something I think they should do that I think Universe 3, that's out there in the wild now, isn't it?

02:28:13.312 --> 02:28:30.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360 So many games It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think They basically give away the full song list They don't leave anything secret, so there's no, like, joy in unlocking stuff And it's just, you know, each title's kind of hokey in its own way

02:28:33.128 --> 02:28:53.119
[SPEAKER_09]: but Guitar Hero is going to get the same way they're going to have each one for a different band I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into say Guitar Hero World Tour I don't think they're going to do that I think Rock Band will because they've been doing that so far but I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time

02:28:54.400 --> 02:29:03.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new, I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards DJ Max on the PSP.

02:29:04.144 --> 02:29:11.146
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this, because until now you've had to import this game, but there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.

02:29:11.206 --> 02:29:12.687
[SPEAKER_10]: It's DJ Max Fever.

02:29:13.387 --> 02:29:18.169
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Max Fever, now, it was going to come out in November, but sadly, the game got delayed.

02:29:18.729 --> 02:29:19.730
[SPEAKER_10]: It is delayed a couple months.

02:29:19.870 --> 02:29:22.871
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now going to come out probably January-ish is what they're looking at, but...

02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:23.811
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

02:29:48.226 --> 02:29:49.487
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Maxx Fever DJ Maxx Technica

02:30:08.445 --> 02:30:11.086
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the interesting thing about the game, though, and how it's different from Beatmania.

02:30:11.466 --> 02:30:12.866
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses a touch screen.

02:30:13.206 --> 02:30:18.948
[SPEAKER_10]: You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line, which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.

02:30:19.488 --> 02:30:23.149
[SPEAKER_10]: But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Max.

02:30:23.209 --> 02:30:25.270
[SPEAKER_10]: After all, half of the charm of these games is the music.

02:30:25.410 --> 02:30:30.071
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this game almost reminds me that it's almost like they're trying to compete with Juby on this.

02:30:30.851 --> 02:30:32.012
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of interesting.

02:30:32.293 --> 02:30:32.913
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very interesting.

02:30:33.193 --> 02:30:36.236
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the U.S.

02:30:36.617 --> 02:30:44.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting because between this, Street Fighter 4, Tekken 6, arcades are slowly getting a little love again.

02:30:44.625 --> 02:30:47.127
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.

02:30:47.487 --> 02:30:49.950
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.

02:30:50.450 --> 02:30:53.273
[SPEAKER_10]: Technica is going to plug into the internet for global lead

02:30:53.513 --> 02:31:01.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Leaderboards, internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool, because that means you can get new songs right on the internet, and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.

02:31:02.381 --> 02:31:08.005
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe there's some type of DJ Max soundtrack that you can get that comes with one of these cards, so you can get started.

02:31:09.427 --> 02:31:09.587
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

02:31:09.607 --> 02:31:09.967
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

02:31:10.247 --> 02:31:14.431
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you, it's Ubeat, not Ubeat.

02:31:14.451 --> 02:31:15.031
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I said.

02:31:15.051 --> 02:31:15.432
[SPEAKER_10]: I said Ubeat.

02:31:15.452 --> 02:31:16.172
[SPEAKER_10]: I corrected myself.

02:31:16.312 --> 02:31:16.773
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there you go.

02:31:18.775 --> 02:31:19.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I remembered.

02:31:21.018 --> 02:31:21.438
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

02:31:21.578 --> 02:31:25.522
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently some test locations for DJ Max Technica are going to be released soon.

02:31:25.582 --> 02:31:35.129
[SPEAKER_10]: So some folks that have kind of been playing this game on a more like cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year, in 2009.

02:31:35.410 --> 02:31:36.070
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it might not.

02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:36.550
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

02:31:37.111 --> 02:31:38.172
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

02:31:38.432 --> 02:31:40.814
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.

02:31:40.994 --> 02:31:48.160
[SPEAKER_10]: I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golfland, that that touchscreen's going to turn to shit.

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:48.800
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

02:31:50.605 --> 02:31:51.566
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds cool.

02:31:52.887 --> 02:31:54.047
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like it might work.

02:31:55.368 --> 02:31:55.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:31:56.088 --> 02:32:02.952
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight were probably thinking towards the end of Part A, hey, where's DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week?

02:32:03.393 --> 02:32:05.974
[SPEAKER_10]: We tune in every week to hear DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.

02:32:05.994 --> 02:32:10.617
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't hear it tonight during Part A. Well, that's because DarkSakura got here a little earlier than anticipated.

02:32:10.677 --> 02:32:13.719
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.

02:32:16.297 --> 02:32:25.065
[SPEAKER_10]: So get ready to experience a game from gaming history as DarkSakura goes through her archives and picks a game that you all should be playing right now.

02:32:26.085 --> 02:32:26.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

02:32:27.447 --> 02:32:34.092
[SPEAKER_04]: The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

02:32:35.674 --> 02:32:37.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, um... What a choice.

02:32:38.036 --> 02:32:40.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.

02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:43.901
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the intro to it, okay?

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:52.315
[SPEAKER_04]: But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.

02:32:52.975 --> 02:33:00.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X, which is my favorite Castlevania game.

02:33:01.722 --> 02:33:11.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X, you're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.

02:33:13.972 --> 02:33:24.782
[SPEAKER_04]: The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it where you have different areas that you're exploring and you have to move through the different areas.

02:33:24.802 --> 02:33:26.764
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear different weapons on the way.

02:33:29.367 --> 02:33:40.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it's just a lot of... This game is just completely unique as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.

02:33:41.682 --> 02:33:44.145
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also had various other releases.

02:33:44.605 --> 02:33:46.668
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the Saturn version, which is actually...

02:33:47.856 --> 02:33:52.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Graphically, not my favorite because the Saturn didn't have a 3D as well.

02:33:52.699 --> 02:33:55.540
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.

02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:01.343
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game, you can play as Richter, which is really cool.

02:34:01.363 --> 02:34:02.123
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own...

02:34:03.844 --> 02:34:05.526
[SPEAKER_04]: His own attacks and everything.

02:34:08.648 --> 02:34:24.581
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, through the game you have sort of an RPG element to the game where you've got your familiars with you, you have... I love the sword familiars, sword familiars are my favorite.

02:34:25.261 --> 02:34:30.242
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've also got, you know, interactions between characters that go in.

02:34:30.582 --> 02:34:35.243
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even choose your path through the game, and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive.

02:34:35.923 --> 02:34:38.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.

02:34:38.184 --> 02:34:41.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.

02:34:41.225 --> 02:34:43.805
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done by... Wait, wait, here comes the best part.

02:34:44.005 --> 02:34:44.225
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:34:44.685 --> 02:34:45.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Die, monster.

02:34:46.306 --> 02:34:47.866
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't belong in this world.

02:34:49.192 --> 02:34:53.094
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.

02:34:53.994 --> 02:34:59.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I was called here by humans who wished to pay me tribute.

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:00.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Tribute?

02:35:01.678 --> 02:35:05.299
[SPEAKER_05]: You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

02:35:10.822 --> 02:35:13.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Your words are as empty as your soul.

02:35:14.183 --> 02:35:17.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

02:35:18.669 --> 02:35:19.871
[SPEAKER_06]: What is a man?

02:35:20.733 --> 02:35:23.037
[SPEAKER_06]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

02:35:23.137 --> 02:35:24.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.

02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:25.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Have at you!

02:35:28.928 --> 02:35:31.589
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just as cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.

02:35:31.769 --> 02:35:33.509
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the best gaming moments ever.

02:35:34.149 --> 02:35:36.970
[SPEAKER_04]: This person, though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing because they wait.

02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:40.691
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're fighting Dracula, the first time around is Richter.

02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:49.132
[SPEAKER_04]: If you let yourself, like, die, then Maria comes out and says, All my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!

02:35:49.753 --> 02:35:50.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.

02:35:51.753 --> 02:35:53.433
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never needed her help.

02:35:53.753 --> 02:35:55.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

02:35:57.661 --> 02:36:04.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there, um, with the development of this game, actually, there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.

02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:16.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it actually, there's a thing that, uh, was called, um, Castlevania the Bloodletting, um, which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in, um, um, in development.

02:36:17.203 --> 02:36:17.844
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

02:36:19.265 --> 02:36:26.929
[SPEAKER_04]: The art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima, doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.

02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:29.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.

02:36:31.752 --> 02:36:37.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.

02:36:38.016 --> 02:36:38.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

02:36:43.109 --> 02:36:45.050
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.

02:36:45.691 --> 02:36:54.157
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D, like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.

02:36:55.738 --> 02:37:00.721
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.

02:37:00.821 --> 02:37:01.662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cool.

02:37:02.582 --> 02:37:15.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, however, actually, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version, which, you know, we've covered this, it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade, and if you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.

02:37:18.957 --> 02:37:21.479
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.

02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:25.182
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.

02:37:26.764 --> 02:37:32.989
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions that have come out, and also there was the PSP version.

02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:36.472
[SPEAKER_04]: This also has the Dart Priest Shaft.

02:37:39.176 --> 02:37:40.817
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is right up on the screen right now.

02:37:41.337 --> 02:37:42.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I just think is the greatest thing.

02:37:42.818 --> 02:37:45.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I know we're not a TV show.

02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:48.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the same Shaft who is in Rondo of Blood.

02:37:58.028 --> 02:38:00.289
[SPEAKER_10]: This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.

02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:06.393
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.

02:38:07.526 --> 02:38:08.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Metroidvania.

02:38:08.427 --> 02:38:09.107
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroidvania.

02:38:26.444 --> 02:38:29.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there are some particular differences.

02:38:29.268 --> 02:38:39.963
[SPEAKER_04]: The original, the name for this, actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him, he imported this game when it first came out.

02:38:40.464 --> 02:38:41.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:00.838
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several differences.

02:39:00.918 --> 02:39:04.582
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, in the Japanese version, it has two extra familiars.

02:39:05.042 --> 02:39:07.485
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the sprite familiar and the nose devil familiar.

02:39:08.466 --> 02:39:10.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the sprite is a palette swap.

02:39:10.148 --> 02:39:13.912
[SPEAKER_04]: The nose devil basically is the demon one with the Tengu mask.

02:39:14.753 --> 02:39:15.534
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not.

02:39:17.659 --> 02:39:21.762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.

02:39:22.663 --> 02:39:30.188
[SPEAKER_04]: The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga that came with the Japanese version.

02:39:31.048 --> 02:39:33.510
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you it's pretty sweet.

02:39:33.550 --> 02:39:34.871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually really, really cool.

02:39:36.432 --> 02:39:42.256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like just a little behind-the-scenes thing of Alucard waking up and going off and kicking ass.

02:39:43.957 --> 02:39:44.937
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also...

02:39:47.572 --> 02:39:51.033
[SPEAKER_04]: Different version of the last stage.

02:39:51.813 --> 02:39:59.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, in the US version, you saw it was called Bloodlines when Richter's chapter started up.

02:40:00.156 --> 02:40:04.238
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Japanese one, it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.

02:40:05.698 --> 02:40:11.420
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows towards the end of the game, boss fight.

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:16.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.

02:40:17.144 --> 02:40:18.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I love playing as Maria.

02:40:19.025 --> 02:40:23.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.

02:40:24.427 --> 02:40:26.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of her attacks are really hard to do.

02:40:27.368 --> 02:40:29.348
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's different remixes that play.

02:40:32.129 --> 02:40:38.114
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, of, uh, old Castlevania music, depending on if you play as Richter or Maria, and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.

02:40:38.455 --> 02:40:40.236
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are actually really good mixes of them, too.

02:40:41.117 --> 02:40:45.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.

02:40:46.161 --> 02:40:47.302
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's not the game, sorry.

02:40:47.422 --> 02:40:49.624
[SPEAKER_10]: This is somebody's speedrun I'm looking at.

02:40:49.744 --> 02:40:50.044
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, sorry.

02:40:50.505 --> 02:40:50.585
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

02:40:54.728 --> 02:40:56.569
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has distorted sprites.

02:40:58.190 --> 02:41:03.873
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better, and they just didn't take advantage of it.

02:41:03.893 --> 02:41:06.355
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very rushed.

02:41:06.755 --> 02:41:12.638
[SPEAKER_04]: But it did have two extra levels in the game, one of them... And this is me being a nerd, okay?

02:41:14.659 --> 02:41:24.844
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who has ever done this, when you're in the first level, you'll find a trap door that closes when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?

02:41:25.644 --> 02:41:29.606
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trap door.

02:41:30.246 --> 02:41:35.689
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave, and then you go into another room down there.

02:41:36.709 --> 02:41:38.890
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room.

02:41:38.930 --> 02:41:39.511
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

02:41:40.251 --> 02:41:41.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

02:41:41.873 --> 02:41:42.493
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

02:41:55.946 --> 02:42:06.101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is true or not, but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put in the original release and didn't.

02:42:06.642 --> 02:42:11.830
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.

02:42:12.250 --> 02:42:17.332
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there if there was that little, you know, area.

02:42:17.352 --> 02:42:19.152
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also another trick, though.

02:42:19.632 --> 02:42:21.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.

02:42:21.693 --> 02:42:36.978
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it works in the PlayStation version where you can do, like, some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area, which is really useful if you have the walk armor because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle, the better defense you have.

02:42:37.498 --> 02:42:38.779
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot about this game.

02:42:38.839 --> 02:42:44.004
[SPEAKER_04]: I also know that it's a pain in the ass trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game, in my opinion.

02:42:46.206 --> 02:42:48.549
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a freaking awesome game and everyone should be playing it.

02:42:48.869 --> 02:42:56.496
[SPEAKER_04]: It was voted, in 1998, it was the game of the year by EGM and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.

02:42:56.696 --> 02:42:59.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Which was a bit controversial that year because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:01.862
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is better than Final Fantasy 7.

02:43:03.424 --> 02:43:07.289
[SPEAKER_04]: This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy 7 did.

02:43:08.751 --> 02:43:09.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:43:09.712 --> 02:43:13.137
[SPEAKER_04]: I played this game for hours of time.

02:43:13.197 --> 02:43:14.278
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too, I love this game.

02:43:14.859 --> 02:43:15.300
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:16.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bother getting your walk armor?

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:18.882
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't.

02:43:19.182 --> 02:43:23.905
[SPEAKER_10]: This came out during that period where I wasn't hardcore into games because I was in school.

02:43:24.966 --> 02:43:26.988
[SPEAKER_10]: But I still played a lot of this game.

02:43:27.288 --> 02:43:28.689
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to just sit down and play through it.

02:43:29.109 --> 02:43:30.870
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be fun.

02:43:30.890 --> 02:43:33.853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.

02:43:33.873 --> 02:43:35.294
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.

02:43:36.363 --> 02:43:43.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Speedruns for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.

02:43:43.911 --> 02:43:46.513
[SPEAKER_04]: They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

02:43:46.874 --> 02:43:51.859
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you really want to beat the game quickly, you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.

02:43:52.682 --> 02:44:01.245
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft, call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.

02:44:01.925 --> 02:44:02.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

02:44:02.645 --> 02:44:04.966
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that earns the whatever reward.

02:44:05.066 --> 02:44:19.970
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I just want to say also, the great thing about this game, speaking of the alternate ways you can do things, what a surprise when you kind of might think you're done with the game, but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.

02:44:20.382 --> 02:44:22.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it really was such a surprise.

02:44:22.323 --> 02:44:23.023
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

02:44:23.224 --> 02:44:23.844
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

02:44:24.184 --> 02:44:32.188
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it, which I would hope is not that many people at this point, but if you've never seen it, it's like one of those moments where you're like, ah, god damn.

02:44:32.849 --> 02:44:37.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.

02:44:37.791 --> 02:44:39.612
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really is fantastic.

02:44:44.115 --> 02:44:48.177
[SPEAKER_04]: There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.

02:44:50.273 --> 02:44:53.575
[SPEAKER_04]: I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.

02:44:53.795 --> 02:45:03.058
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library and you do your double jump in one particular place, you can actually pop up under the librarian and knock him into the ceiling.

02:45:03.739 --> 02:45:03.959
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

02:45:04.099 --> 02:45:06.440
[SPEAKER_04]: And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, Whee!

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:09.161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, you can!

02:45:09.501 --> 02:45:10.161
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

02:45:10.601 --> 02:45:12.183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see that.

02:45:12.263 --> 02:45:14.466
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the little chats with Maria.

02:45:14.566 --> 02:45:19.011
[SPEAKER_04]: And Maria's kind of... And she says Richter.

02:45:20.012 --> 02:45:22.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Like she's going to spit acid in your eye.

02:45:22.895 --> 02:45:23.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:45:23.476 --> 02:45:23.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

02:45:25.278 --> 02:45:26.639
[SPEAKER_10]: What a wonderful game for the week.

02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:28.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

02:45:28.241 --> 02:45:31.184
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't checked it out, it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

02:45:32.165 --> 02:45:42.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games that DarkSakura brings up once in a while, like games that were never released here or never will be, Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.

02:45:42.451 --> 02:45:43.431
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got to go play it.

02:45:44.872 --> 02:45:49.014
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's do a couple more stories, then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.

02:45:49.034 --> 02:45:52.216
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been running a little long because of everything else we've been talking about, but we will get to Skypline.

02:45:52.256 --> 02:45:57.979
[SPEAKER_10]: We do want to take at least two calls and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.

02:45:58.019 --> 02:46:00.060
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.

02:46:00.701 --> 02:46:00.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

02:46:02.250 --> 02:46:02.593
[SPEAKER_09]: More news.

02:46:05.069 --> 02:46:07.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.

02:46:08.051 --> 02:46:11.713
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you know, I just made my costume, and yeah, that's cool.

02:46:12.113 --> 02:46:21.900
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want to make some other costumes, Indie Mogul, they have a, I guess it's like a podcast or videocast that they do, that's Backyard FX.

02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:31.145
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the segments that they just did was how to build your own Halo 3 armor, or your own Halo armor, I guess, for under $100.

02:46:31.185 --> 02:46:31.265
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:46:32.786 --> 02:46:35.448
[SPEAKER_09]: and they actually have instructions on how to do it.

02:46:35.548 --> 02:46:37.128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done with paper.

02:46:37.649 --> 02:46:46.993
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.

02:46:48.214 --> 02:46:51.217
[SPEAKER_09]: But it can come out looking really cool if you put the time and effort into it.

02:46:51.717 --> 02:46:54.640
[SPEAKER_09]: And the videos are available online.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.261
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's pretty awesome.

02:46:56.882 --> 02:47:00.525
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to check it out, visit IndyMogul.com.

02:47:00.665 --> 02:47:04.488
[SPEAKER_09]: I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L Alright.

02:47:07.471 --> 02:47:14.156
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting because Halloween we had all the official Master Chief costumes, which granted were a lot cheaper because they were...

02:47:15.544 --> 02:47:16.305
[SPEAKER_10]: They look like crap.

02:47:16.365 --> 02:47:18.188
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like a hefty bag and helmet.

02:47:18.769 --> 02:47:23.115
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, kind of interesting that you can do this whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.

02:47:23.155 --> 02:47:26.179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.

02:47:26.219 --> 02:47:31.066
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor or whatever cosplay stuff you want to...

02:47:32.247 --> 02:47:32.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Use it for.

02:47:55.595 --> 02:47:56.096
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:48:14.458 --> 02:48:21.346
[SPEAKER_10]: which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern for, you know, kind of money under the table, laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.

02:48:22.287 --> 02:48:23.508
[SPEAKER_10]: They have just taxed it.

02:48:23.528 --> 02:48:24.269
[SPEAKER_10]: 20% is the tax.

02:48:26.952 --> 02:48:28.333
[SPEAKER_10]: and this announcement just came out.

02:48:28.393 --> 02:48:38.019
[SPEAKER_10]: It was distributed to local tax bureaus and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.

02:48:38.379 --> 02:48:47.025
[SPEAKER_10]: Taxation officials are granted the right to determine the original price of the online virtual currency if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.

02:48:48.466 --> 02:48:49.046
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

02:48:51.158 --> 02:48:56.279
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think we might be next here in America to tax this kind of stuff?

02:48:56.439 --> 02:49:01.160
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try, but I don't know if there's much that they'll want to admit real money transfer.

02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:04.281
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes through these Chinese companies and foreign companies anyway.

02:49:04.341 --> 02:49:09.802
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax, but I don't know.

02:49:10.622 --> 02:49:12.683
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be very hard to police everything.

02:49:13.583 --> 02:49:16.444
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law, if you ask me.

02:49:17.264 --> 02:49:17.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:49:18.106 --> 02:49:21.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:49:21.888 --> 02:49:23.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:25.871
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.

02:49:28.032 --> 02:49:30.374
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute stories for us?

02:49:31.701 --> 02:49:33.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.

02:49:34.342 --> 02:49:37.023
[SPEAKER_09]: One I was going to mention, I don't know if this is out here anywhere.

02:49:37.924 --> 02:49:44.066
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a game that they showed off, I want to say it was at Tokyo Game Show, and it was teased in Famitsu Magazine.

02:49:44.806 --> 02:49:49.548
[SPEAKER_09]: A Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross-Edge.

02:49:49.888 --> 02:49:55.950
[SPEAKER_09]: You may remember such similar games as Namco X-Capcom or Namco Cross-Capcom.

02:49:56.170 --> 02:49:56.290
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

02:49:56.650 --> 02:49:56.891
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

02:49:58.251 --> 02:49:59.332
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:50:21.996 --> 02:50:35.804
[SPEAKER_09]: Morgan, Felicia, Dimitri, R. Tonalico, Orica, Misha, Shirelia, Disgaea, Atona, Prina, Spectral Souls, Mew, Mana, Kimia, Lilia, Rose, Marie

02:50:40.526 --> 02:50:41.506
[SPEAKER_09]: They have kitchen sink.

02:50:41.806 --> 02:50:42.627
[SPEAKER_09]: They have everything.

02:50:43.447 --> 02:50:45.567
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to know what the best part about this is?

02:50:45.587 --> 02:50:47.108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out to the U.S.

02:50:47.768 --> 02:50:48.768
[SPEAKER_09]: spring of next year.

02:50:49.728 --> 02:50:50.048
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

02:50:50.248 --> 02:50:51.189
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I got a caller on hold.

02:50:51.209 --> 02:50:51.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

02:50:51.989 --> 02:50:53.149
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:53.169 --> 02:50:53.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:50:54.369 --> 02:50:55.009
[SPEAKER_10]: Solid Goomba.

02:50:55.290 --> 02:50:56.010
[SPEAKER_10]: Solid Goomba.

02:50:56.030 --> 02:50:56.890
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, my friend?

02:50:57.750 --> 02:51:03.331
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright banhammer on LittleBigPlanet.

02:51:03.552 --> 02:51:04.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

02:51:04.432 --> 02:51:04.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Speak away.

02:51:06.692 --> 02:51:08.713
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played the game yet.

02:51:09.333 --> 02:51:11.994
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bought a PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.

02:51:12.755 --> 02:51:15.576
[SPEAKER_07]: But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.

02:51:16.617 --> 02:51:24.281
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it as a homage to the original IP, like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.

02:51:24.321 --> 02:51:25.702
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's perfectly acceptable.

02:51:26.362 --> 02:51:34.267
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such, then they should also be going after deviant art users for making fan images.

02:51:36.744 --> 02:51:42.030
[SPEAKER_07]: I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of... You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.

02:51:42.090 --> 02:51:51.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the... Oh, crap.

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.361
[SPEAKER_07]: The confines of the game, yeah?

02:51:53.381 --> 02:51:53.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:51:53.781 --> 02:51:53.961
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:51:55.197 --> 02:51:57.858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off

02:52:16.411 --> 02:52:28.543
[SPEAKER_10]: at the same time no one's making money off of it I guess that's true but it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels but then again as I understand it Sony has been pulling levels about the Playstation 3

02:52:30.066 --> 02:52:42.949
[SPEAKER_10]: But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that some would say overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.

02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:45.289
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this?

02:52:45.689 --> 02:52:46.529
[SPEAKER_10]: A Galaga level.

02:52:46.689 --> 02:52:46.909
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:52:47.250 --> 02:52:48.030
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who made this one?

02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:49.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Same guy who did the Gradius level.

02:52:49.350 --> 02:52:50.330
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it just come out or something?

02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:51.870
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's got a bunch of videos.

02:52:51.891 --> 02:52:54.491
[SPEAKER_09]: He also did a Tetris level that's even better than the other one that they showed off.

02:52:54.511 --> 02:52:55.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

02:52:56.031 --> 02:52:56.731
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

02:52:57.332 --> 02:52:58.992
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.

02:53:00.441 --> 02:53:01.441
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're in Japanese.

02:53:01.902 --> 02:53:03.522
[SPEAKER_09]: And the company is a European company.

02:53:03.562 --> 02:53:05.103
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably can't read what his level says.

02:53:05.783 --> 02:53:09.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, a comment from chat room, and I apologize if I mispronounce this name.

02:53:09.685 --> 02:53:10.785
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new name I haven't seen before.

02:53:10.885 --> 02:53:11.526
[SPEAKER_10]: Sanchez?

02:53:11.806 --> 02:53:12.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunchees?

02:53:12.626 --> 02:53:13.046
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunchees?

02:53:13.506 --> 02:53:14.627
[SPEAKER_10]: I like cheese, so Sunchees.

02:53:15.027 --> 02:53:17.128
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's two Zs.

02:53:17.768 --> 02:53:20.029
[SPEAKER_10]: Two Zs, not two Es, so Sanchez, maybe.

02:53:20.329 --> 02:53:22.110
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tired of playing Super Mario Bros.

02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:23.270
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-1 again and again.

02:53:25.151 --> 02:53:28.593
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Bros.

02:53:28.633 --> 02:53:28.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 1-1.

02:53:30.216 --> 02:53:38.179
[SPEAKER_10]: but there is even though yeah I'm sick of playing it too there is that moment of hey cool when you first see it right?

02:53:38.719 --> 02:53:39.079
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:53:40.319 --> 02:53:46.441
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you had this game or you're going to be getting this game soon enough Solid Goomba what kind of level are you going to make?

02:53:46.501 --> 02:53:52.443
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to go and just make something original or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?

02:53:53.144 --> 02:53:54.184
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh I'm going to infringe.

02:53:54.224 --> 02:53:56.245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.

02:53:57.125 --> 02:53:57.925
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

02:53:59.486 --> 02:53:59.786
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

02:54:00.323 --> 02:54:02.225
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3?

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:04.767
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're just now picking one up.

02:54:04.827 --> 02:54:06.488
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?

02:54:07.209 --> 02:54:09.671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.

02:54:10.852 --> 02:54:13.334
[SPEAKER_07]: One more thought on the whole user-created content.

02:54:14.155 --> 02:54:18.258
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the PC.

02:54:18.318 --> 02:54:23.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.

02:54:23.443 --> 02:54:25.745
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?

02:54:25.965 --> 02:54:27.186
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we'll see it anytime soon?

02:54:30.456 --> 02:54:33.758
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.

02:54:34.018 --> 02:54:36.780
[SPEAKER_10]: So who knows?

02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:39.501
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, yes, I think so.

02:54:40.482 --> 02:54:49.347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember 10 years ago, the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point.

02:54:49.387 --> 02:54:54.049
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems, you didn't have to have a monitor.

02:54:54.069 --> 02:54:54.970
[SPEAKER_10]: You could hook it up to your TV.

02:54:56.650 --> 02:55:02.852
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.

02:55:05.232 --> 02:55:07.313
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.

02:55:08.453 --> 02:55:10.694
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.

02:55:10.734 --> 02:55:12.214
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks, man.

02:55:12.234 --> 02:55:12.695
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

02:55:12.755 --> 02:55:13.335
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, buddy.

02:55:13.775 --> 02:55:14.055
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

02:55:16.661 --> 02:55:27.128
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting, you know, so much joking and funny things at Sony's expense, but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.

02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:29.750
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:55:31.151 --> 02:55:32.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

02:55:32.192 --> 02:55:33.273
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?

02:55:36.355 --> 02:55:40.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.

02:55:41.238 --> 02:55:43.140
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard you, lucky bastard.

02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:43.740
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it?

02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:44.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you enjoying it?

02:55:45.859 --> 02:55:46.839
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:58.003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.

02:55:58.164 --> 02:56:01.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.

02:56:04.346 --> 02:56:34.030
[SPEAKER_08]: basically the parties the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome I haven't tried it yet but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good the interface it's totally revamped it's easier to use than the old one I have still to get accustomed to it but like I said it's pretty easy to use the whole interface huh

02:56:35.168 --> 02:56:35.688
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

02:56:37.489 --> 02:56:42.292
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been able to try, I don't know if you do Netflix, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh?

02:56:42.712 --> 02:56:43.673
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have the Netflix thing?

02:56:44.333 --> 02:56:45.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we don't have Netflix.

02:56:45.754 --> 02:56:50.837
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.

02:56:50.897 --> 02:56:52.978
[SPEAKER_08]: But I heard it's pretty cool.

02:56:54.159 --> 02:56:56.661
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine you spent a little time building an avatar.

02:56:56.741 --> 02:56:58.642
[SPEAKER_10]: How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?

02:56:59.528 --> 02:57:00.928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty easy to use.

02:57:01.008 --> 02:57:02.869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty easy to create an avatar.

02:57:02.929 --> 02:57:09.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Though, what I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.

02:57:11.371 --> 02:57:18.573
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.

02:57:19.113 --> 02:57:19.473
[SPEAKER_08]: You have

02:57:23.615 --> 02:57:33.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.

02:57:35.482 --> 02:57:49.411
[SPEAKER_10]: So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Mii, and you could really customize that, but because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited, is kind of the impression I'm getting.

02:57:50.236 --> 02:57:51.337
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's kind of limited.

02:57:51.397 --> 02:58:12.615
[SPEAKER_08]: You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff, but not like in the Wii, that you have more choices to...

02:58:13.902 --> 02:58:20.463
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, quick question from SSJ100 Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friend list limit in it?

02:58:21.643 --> 02:58:22.263
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they did.

02:58:23.424 --> 02:58:24.524
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know.

02:58:25.364 --> 02:58:29.325
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to search that, but I think they haven't.

02:58:29.845 --> 02:58:31.545
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they have either, based on what I heard.

02:58:31.825 --> 02:58:32.565
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was just curious.

02:58:32.725 --> 02:58:35.706
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut.

02:58:35.846 --> 02:58:36.186
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:58:37.206 --> 02:58:42.047
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, ActDeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?

02:58:43.376 --> 02:58:45.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's pretty good, like I said.

02:58:45.899 --> 02:58:54.850
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we Mexicans, we could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.

02:58:54.890 --> 02:58:58.234
[SPEAKER_08]: But from what I have seen and what I have...

02:59:01.064 --> 02:59:18.583
[SPEAKER_10]: well, play with it's pretty good it's a whole new experience for the Xbox alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent I don't know, so be nice I hope so alright, well Actdeft, have a good one buddy

02:59:19.821 --> 02:59:28.544
[SPEAKER_10]: and have fun playing that experience I can't have right now because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off because I have surgery.

02:59:28.965 --> 02:59:30.505
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo hoo, QQ, cry cry.

02:59:31.145 --> 02:59:32.686
[SPEAKER_10]: One more call.

02:59:32.746 --> 02:59:34.927
[SPEAKER_10]: I said two, but I'm feeling nice.

02:59:35.687 --> 02:59:39.589
[SPEAKER_10]: Do one more call.

02:59:39.609 --> 02:59:43.070
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:45.391
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?

02:59:46.482 --> 02:59:47.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me.

02:59:48.544 --> 02:59:59.151
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the Melgar Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.

03:00:01.473 --> 03:00:01.873
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

03:00:01.893 --> 03:00:03.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

03:00:03.274 --> 03:00:04.215
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:00:04.235 --> 03:00:04.575
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

03:00:06.017 --> 03:00:07.338
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's Spazinator.

03:00:07.738 --> 03:00:09.139
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:15.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment.

03:00:15.784 --> 03:00:15.904
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:27.338
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell video game soundtracks?

03:00:27.858 --> 03:00:38.346
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely have soundtracks, and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd, so...

03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:41.760
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game soundtracks.

03:00:43.181 --> 03:00:44.701
[SPEAKER_10]: CD Japan still in business?

03:00:45.081 --> 03:00:46.202
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been years since I bought one.

03:00:46.222 --> 03:00:46.942
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure they are.

03:00:47.082 --> 03:00:48.702
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would be one.

03:00:50.423 --> 03:00:53.164
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other Japanese-based sites, too.

03:00:53.444 --> 03:00:57.185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.

03:00:57.245 --> 03:00:58.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon Japan.

03:00:58.165 --> 03:01:00.165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ordered CDs from them before.

03:01:00.426 --> 03:01:00.986
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayAsia.

03:01:01.026 --> 03:01:01.326
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

03:01:01.366 --> 03:01:02.986
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayAsia soundtracks.

03:01:03.006 --> 03:01:03.766
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely PlayAsia.

03:01:03.826 --> 03:01:04.327
[SPEAKER_10]: Check them out.

03:01:04.527 --> 03:01:07.367
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they sell games, too, if you want to import games and all that stuff.

03:01:07.467 --> 03:01:08.868
[SPEAKER_10]: So they specialize in that stuff.

03:01:08.968 --> 03:01:09.128
[SPEAKER_04]: And toys.

03:01:10.947 --> 03:01:11.367
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:13.288
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some sites to check out.

03:01:13.388 --> 03:01:15.729
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.

03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:18.911
[SPEAKER_01]: Toys and Joys.

03:01:20.592 --> 03:01:38.742
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as far as the Guitar Hero World Tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not, or at least tried it, but if you had any issues with the main menu at all where

03:01:39.437 --> 03:01:41.138
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphics in the menu would essentially glitch out?

03:01:41.258 --> 03:01:43.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?

03:02:10.250 --> 03:02:11.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so far, just myself.

03:02:13.913 --> 03:02:35.429
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I noticed is that, you know, the initial, like, logos and the loading screen and whatnot, you know, will appear normal, but as soon as you get to the actual menu where it says, you know, solo play options, so on and so forth, that's when, you know, the background gets all wacky.

03:02:35.449 --> 03:02:39.112
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even see what you're selecting, stuff like that, you know.

03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:41.541
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard of anything.

03:02:41.741 --> 03:02:49.284
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you.

03:02:50.165 --> 03:02:53.606
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched.

03:02:53.686 --> 03:02:59.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.

03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:03.671
[SPEAKER_10]: And you said you had a comment or another question?

03:03:06.161 --> 03:03:18.817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar.

03:03:19.498 --> 03:03:20.539
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what that's for?

03:03:23.503 --> 03:03:26.487
[SPEAKER_10]: I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal.

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we talk about this on a show a long time ago?

03:03:29.491 --> 03:03:30.553
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I don't know if you remember.

03:03:30.573 --> 03:03:32.936
[SPEAKER_10]: You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller?

03:03:33.136 --> 03:03:33.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

03:03:33.417 --> 03:03:34.138
[SPEAKER_10]: They never used it.

03:03:34.238 --> 03:03:36.541
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't it going to be for an effector pedal or something at one point?

03:03:36.561 --> 03:03:38.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and they even said it in the Guitar Hero...

03:03:39.905 --> 03:03:40.306
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

03:03:40.326 --> 03:03:41.587
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero 2 Manual.

03:03:41.767 --> 03:03:42.707
[SPEAKER_09]: But they just never happened.

03:03:42.847 --> 03:03:43.588
[SPEAKER_09]: Never materialized.

03:03:44.048 --> 03:03:45.830
[SPEAKER_10]: They opted for the fog machines instead.

03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:48.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?

03:03:48.812 --> 03:03:49.833
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out, I think.

03:03:49.893 --> 03:03:50.393
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it really?

03:03:50.513 --> 03:03:51.294
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it did.

03:03:51.334 --> 03:03:52.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are we not in possession of one?

03:03:52.735 --> 03:03:53.255
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're $100.

03:03:54.216 --> 03:03:54.556
[SPEAKER_10]: So?

03:03:54.836 --> 03:03:56.638
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't thought about buying it yet.

03:03:56.718 --> 03:04:01.742
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog.

03:04:02.802 --> 03:04:05.204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want.

03:04:05.845 --> 03:04:06.185
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not.

03:04:06.434 --> 03:04:17.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I've seen it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Reformer or Official Xbox Magazine, I forget which.

03:04:18.201 --> 03:04:21.524
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago.

03:04:22.324 --> 03:04:27.587
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they may list a website where you can buy it.

03:04:29.188 --> 03:04:32.471
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look it up and email you...

03:04:33.957 --> 03:04:39.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Link or something It got really good reviews too because they actually made it It's not just like something that randomly does it with

03:04:41.348 --> 03:04:42.789
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:05:11.184 --> 03:05:12.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

03:05:12.585 --> 03:05:16.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we need this?

03:05:16.169 --> 03:05:16.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Because!

03:05:16.729 --> 03:05:17.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke and lights!

03:05:20.893 --> 03:05:22.715
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want me to gag, then get one.

03:05:22.735 --> 03:05:24.757
[SPEAKER_04]: I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.

03:05:25.462 --> 03:05:26.522
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want one in my house.

03:05:26.982 --> 03:05:28.223
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

03:05:28.263 --> 03:05:29.483
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to waste the money on this.

03:05:29.563 --> 03:05:30.943
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do not waste money on this.

03:05:31.304 --> 03:05:31.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

03:05:31.884 --> 03:05:32.124
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

03:05:32.664 --> 03:05:33.644
[SPEAKER_10]: Symbols have come in.

03:05:33.664 --> 03:05:34.144
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to do it.

03:05:34.544 --> 03:05:34.804
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

03:05:35.005 --> 03:05:38.205
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Spazinator, we've got to go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.

03:05:38.665 --> 03:05:39.206
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

03:05:40.226 --> 03:05:43.187
[SPEAKER_09]: See if they have this over at the one near me.

03:05:43.727 --> 03:05:46.868
[SPEAKER_09]: Roseville, in Gallery at Roseville, they have it.

03:05:47.088 --> 03:05:47.428
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

03:05:47.548 --> 03:05:48.808
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

03:05:48.848 --> 03:05:50.889
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there are a lot of people still trying to get through.

03:05:51.449 --> 03:05:51.929
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens.

03:05:53.362 --> 03:05:53.602
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

03:05:53.622 --> 03:05:54.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're right.

03:05:54.043 --> 03:05:54.463
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need it.

03:05:54.683 --> 03:05:54.964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

03:05:55.304 --> 03:05:56.345
[SPEAKER_10]: Any more last-minute stories?

03:05:56.385 --> 03:05:56.945
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Loki.

03:05:57.886 --> 03:05:58.507
[SPEAKER_10]: Or DarkSakura.

03:05:58.527 --> 03:05:59.988
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you have any that you found.

03:06:00.068 --> 03:06:00.369
[SPEAKER_12]: Five.

03:06:01.690 --> 03:06:02.551
[SPEAKER_10]: Is your last-minute story?

03:06:02.631 --> 03:06:02.851
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

03:06:03.231 --> 03:06:03.511
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

03:06:04.460 --> 03:06:07.941
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a glitch in LittleBigPlanet that will ruin your game.

03:06:09.421 --> 03:06:19.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying.

03:06:20.164 --> 03:06:26.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.

03:06:26.966 --> 03:06:28.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh man, that sucks.

03:06:28.166 --> 03:06:32.348
[SPEAKER_09]: So remember, once again, because... Oh god, and people are going to put that shit on the internet.

03:06:32.689 --> 03:06:33.969
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be those custom levels.

03:06:33.989 --> 03:06:34.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on.

03:06:34.770 --> 03:06:40.273
[SPEAKER_09]: Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that.

03:06:40.913 --> 03:06:42.054
[SPEAKER_09]: Just back up your save.

03:06:42.094 --> 03:06:43.154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all you gotta do.

03:06:43.174 --> 03:06:44.995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good warning.

03:06:45.236 --> 03:06:46.136
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

03:06:46.576 --> 03:06:50.438
[SPEAKER_09]: If you spawn in the level all of a sudden you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it.

03:06:50.478 --> 03:06:52.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Just quit the game and say, fuck this.

03:06:53.706 --> 03:06:55.647
[SPEAKER_09]: So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing.

03:06:55.707 --> 03:06:56.807
[SPEAKER_09]: A giant death wheel.

03:06:57.088 --> 03:06:58.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make a towering death wheel.

03:06:58.528 --> 03:07:01.329
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet.

03:07:01.509 --> 03:07:06.312
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest.

03:07:06.452 --> 03:07:13.835
[SPEAKER_10]: It was as hard as those crazy games online like I Want to Be the Guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.

03:07:14.015 --> 03:07:16.736
[SPEAKER_09]: I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here.

03:07:16.756 --> 03:07:18.137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of going through some of them.

03:07:19.117 --> 03:07:25.421
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're going to do it.

03:07:26.001 --> 03:07:29.163
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a 9-11 level where the guy... Oh, God, no.

03:07:29.183 --> 03:07:34.506
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy flings a thing through buildings, and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.

03:07:36.167 --> 03:07:41.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome.

03:07:42.951 --> 03:07:45.112
[SPEAKER_09]: He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.

03:07:46.293 --> 03:07:47.674
[SPEAKER_09]: And a Beatmania level.

03:07:48.374 --> 03:07:49.275
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no Beatmania level.

03:07:49.295 --> 03:07:51.516
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Bobby said on his show he did a Beatmania level as well.

03:07:51.957 --> 03:07:52.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

03:07:52.417 --> 03:07:52.597
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

03:07:53.078 --> 03:07:53.738
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool.

03:07:54.579 --> 03:07:58.161
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of crap, but it's supposedly Beatmania.

03:07:58.222 --> 03:07:59.863
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Beatmania inspired.

03:08:00.643 --> 03:08:00.904
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

03:08:00.924 --> 03:08:01.664
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a good way to put it.

03:08:02.044 --> 03:08:03.345
[SPEAKER_10]: But he says you won't find it on YouTube.

03:08:03.365 --> 03:08:03.726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the game.

03:08:04.417 --> 03:08:06.299
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to show you this one real quick here, Rob.

03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:08.340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got poops in it.

03:08:08.501 --> 03:08:10.642
[SPEAKER_09]: In a butt that poops out.

03:08:11.143 --> 03:08:15.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Those little Japanese cute little doody things.

03:08:16.327 --> 03:08:16.988
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please.

03:08:17.208 --> 03:08:17.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

03:08:17.869 --> 03:08:18.929
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to see this.

03:08:19.410 --> 03:08:19.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

03:08:19.810 --> 03:08:25.475
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to find the part where it's at here.

03:08:26.456 --> 03:08:31.120
[SPEAKER_10]: Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.

03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:33.482
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, as you can see, the butt right there.

03:08:33.582 --> 03:08:34.243
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just start it?

03:08:34.263 --> 03:08:34.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just start it.

03:08:34.944 --> 03:08:35.224
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

03:08:36.726 --> 03:08:37.166
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I hit it?

03:08:37.807 --> 03:08:38.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Start.

03:08:38.227 --> 03:08:38.347
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

03:08:40.370 --> 03:08:41.451
[SPEAKER_10]: Little turds fall out.

03:08:41.731 --> 03:08:45.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster!

03:08:45.795 --> 03:08:46.556
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

03:08:47.157 --> 03:08:47.517
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

03:08:49.219 --> 03:08:50.160
[SPEAKER_10]: What will they think of next?

03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:52.202
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...

03:08:53.533 --> 03:08:55.614
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have this other one that some guy made.

03:08:55.734 --> 03:08:58.695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome.

03:08:58.715 --> 03:09:02.177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race.

03:09:02.237 --> 03:09:03.998
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Excite Truck, but not.

03:09:05.438 --> 03:09:07.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to get out of here.

03:09:08.240 --> 03:09:11.121
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here.

03:09:11.261 --> 03:09:12.902
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought is poop.

03:09:13.502 --> 03:09:14.563
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought.

03:09:14.863 --> 03:09:17.544
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I've actually got to start messing with this editor now.

03:09:18.344 --> 03:09:18.985
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks awesome.

03:09:19.105 --> 03:09:21.486
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is pie.

03:09:23.304 --> 03:09:32.308
[SPEAKER_10]: and for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.

03:09:33.149 --> 03:09:37.430
[SPEAKER_10]: All we ask, just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth.

03:09:37.771 --> 03:09:43.533
[SPEAKER_10]: And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, Boko Fett wrote a really nice one this week.

03:09:44.134 --> 03:09:46.795
[SPEAKER_10]: The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world.

03:09:47.095 --> 03:09:50.296
[SPEAKER_10]: The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues.

03:09:52.277 --> 03:09:57.341
[SPEAKER_10]: and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.

03:09:57.801 --> 03:10:01.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met, but you know well.

03:10:02.444 --> 03:10:02.604
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

03:10:03.785 --> 03:10:04.706
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost makes you want to barf.

03:10:04.746 --> 03:10:05.286
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so nice.

03:10:05.546 --> 03:10:06.967
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but thank you very much for that nice review.

03:10:07.167 --> 03:10:07.788
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope to see some more.

03:10:07.928 --> 03:10:09.369
