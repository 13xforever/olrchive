Coming up next, Orange Lounge Radio Live.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Tonight, November 9th, 2008.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
EA gets hit with more lawsuits over their controversial DRM.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Copyright concerns hit Guitar Hero and LittleBigPlanet.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And has Yaris become the first casualty of Xbox listing?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We are back, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And here with you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Jamie Summers, not here yet.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She's running a little late tonight.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we'll talk a little bit about why.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's very interesting, but she will be joining us for Part B tonight.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She'll get here about 7 o'clock Pacific for those listening live.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For those on the podcast, she'll be here for Part B to kind of talk about where she's been.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it is a little bit related to some things we've talked about previously on the show, but not gaming.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Very interesting. I'll leave you with that.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the meantime, we'll talk to Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm doing okay.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Awesome.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, obviously everyone knows why I was off, but how was your time off?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because you just kind of ended up getting a show off and had some time to yourself, even though you didn't have to get operated on.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But how did you enjoy the time off?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I remember I did last Sunday, to be honest.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think I played games.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know I didn't play Fable 2 because I had left it at work and Nellie was disappointed because she was playing that.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I offered to go get it for her because I actually have a key to the building, but she said no.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, probably was either playing LittleBigPlanet or Saints Row 2.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I actually had something similar happen where I left my cell phone at work once and I had to use my key to get in the building to get it.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, it was very late at night.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But, you know, I can't live without my cell phone.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright, well you started talking about games like Fable 2, so we'll ask you, how was your gaming week, Loki?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of that.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My gaming week was alright.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I didn't play that many games because I do have plenty on the plate to play.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm just trying to finish some before I move on to others.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I did play Fable 2 a bit mainly to cheat and how I cheated.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let me count the ways.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
First, I cheated to get lots of money.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And the easiest way to do that is buy lots of property and then time travel and rinse and repeat and do it again and again and again.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, I have lots of money now.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And then I decided to get lots of experience.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the way you do that is you get a second controller and you turn it on and you create a henchman with the same stats as your own.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And you sell off their stats and it goes into an experience pool and you buy more stats and rinse and repeat until you've maxed out everything.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, that's what I did.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I did all that.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And then I played a few missions and I got bored with it because Fable 2 is very monotonous and boring.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So, I decided, I'm going back to Saints Row 2.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And Saints Row 2, I basically played the hell out of that.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In fact, now I am almost done with the game.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have two missions left, I think.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And that game is awesome.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's just a lot of fun.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Multiplayer, I've been kicking ass at work.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In fact, they're kind of hating me.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They don't like playing with me anymore because I keep winning.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I've been winning with over 20 points.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I tried playing some of the online multiplayer, but the matchmaking takes a long time.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it's not really fun.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The ranked games, just the weapons that they give you, the different play options, it's not varied enough.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it's alright.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then I've been playing a lot of the side missions and stuff in the game as well.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just a lot of activities.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I really appreciate Saints Row 2.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think this is the game I'll be playing long after I'm done with the story mode in it.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I haven't really touched Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since I got Saints Row 2 and I don't plan on it.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Although, we'll have to see what the expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 is.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But it's just not over the top enough, I guess, for me.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Which is too bad.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then Little Big Planet, I've been playing a lot of that.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Just trying to go back and collect 100% of everything in each level.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And now I've kind of gotten a little bit bored with doing that.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've been continuing through the game and now I think I've got one more world left and then I'm done.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But it's really cool.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slightly offensive still.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And there's lots of stuff that I just laugh.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Like my friend's character after we got the Arab parts in the India level.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
His character's interesting, to say the least.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll just leave it at that. Interesting.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But it's a fun game.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And it's very amazing to see all the stuff that you can do in it.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But that's the thing.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now if I want to make my own levels, I don't really know what I want to do because there's so much you can do.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's like there's no direction for me yet, I guess. I don't know.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then, let's see, what else did I play?

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, I played the Mirror's Edge demo. Holy crap, is that awesome.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, I downloaded that and haven't played it yet.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's pretty awesome.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now this is going to be a game that I'll probably wait to get a little bit until I finish a few more things because I've still got Lost Odyssey.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Still got to go back to Mercenaries 2 and finish that game.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mercenaries 2, oh my god, they're doing some crazy shit with that.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They added a new update, which I haven't downloaded yet, but it adds a bunch of cheat codes and stuff in there.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Which is cool because that game is really cheesy anyways and to be able to just blow up everything at a whim I guess would be really fun.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But they're going to have downloadable characters.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They're going to have Obama and Sarah Palin.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh lord.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So that would be funny.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But yeah, basically Mirror's Edge, very intense.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The game reminds me kind of like playing out a scene in Bourne Identity, which is pretty cool.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And the music kind of fits with it as well.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But that's about it.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a lot of trial and error because when I was trying to jump from building to building, I'd miss the other building a lot.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's get some comments from the ever-present fourth panelist on our show, the Chat Room at chat.orangelandradio.com, live on this Sunday night.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tigerclaw starts off, he's also played the Mirror's Edge demo.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He says the Mirror's Edge demo has some pretty cool music, a combination of ambient and trance music.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So that's basically been what I've been playing this week.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have Fallout 3.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I got a free copy from Bethesda, but I haven't got a chance to play it yet.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I didn't want to start that game when I have two other games I'm working on right now.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's just too much.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I probably won't play it until I'm done with maybe Mercenaries 2.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I really want to finish Lost Odyssey so I can be done with that as well.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Just a lot of stuff.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, and I got Resistance 2.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That was the other game I played.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Resistance 2.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know, I really liked Resistance 1, but I haven't gotten too far in Resistance 2 yet.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not liking it as much as the first one.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think what it is is there's not a lot of setup.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's just a lot of just, oh my god, action, action, action, action.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Which is not a bad thing, but it's not...

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Resistance 2 was one of those games where I was actually, when I finished killing everything,

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I got a moment to kind of catch my breath and like, oh my god, this is a beautiful looking game.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But this is just, it's too much.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Just too quick.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So I'll have to see if that paces itself a little bit better later on in the game.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But it's been good.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's a fun game and I look forward to playing that when I get done with some other stuff too.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know, the chat room is on this kick with Mirror's Edge now that you've mentioned it.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you think this is going to be like the next big gaming IP?

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It'll be big, but I don't think it's going to be really huge.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think it's going to be about as big as like, say, maybe Assassin's Creed.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I don't think it'll be as big as Assassin's Creed.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Interesting.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But it'll be fun.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I mean, it's one of those games that they could add like, you know, kind of the Melgir Solid challenge levels and stuff later on and stuff to it.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because it's a lot of, a lot of it feels just kind of like the VR missions or something like that.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a lot of just linear running and, you know, having to figure out how to do tricks and stuff.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And there's very few buttons that you use in the game.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the way you do stuff is pretty cool.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll have to check it out.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not usually a big fan on the first person games, although I do love Oblivion, so you never know.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just because it's not really a shooter.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like, you can't really call it a first person shooter, right?

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's more of a first person free running sim.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, and I do love, see, and then like Portal, I freaking love Portal, and that's kind of a first person, you shoot portals, so who knows.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hitstun in chat says, Mirror's Edge looks great, but I think the controls just aren't natural.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And CaptainYesterday follows up and says, you know, I thought the controls felt right.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They're okay, it just takes a lot of getting used to.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because, like I said, I kept falling off the building. A lot.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Alright, if you want to join in the chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's it.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Alright, let me answer the questions in the chat room, because some folks have been asking about the gallbladder.

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Obviously I'm here, so I'm doing fine.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And to answer what Marin in chat said, no the doctor did not have my gallbladder with some fava beans and an ice canteen.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, yeah, I had the operation on Wednesday, and I was pretty much out for the next few days recuperating.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I did try to get some gaming in. I took my DS over to my parents' house where I was recuperating.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And, by the way, speaking of the gallbladder, they did not do video, so I'm sorry we don't get to do the YouTube.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And, you know, I don't get to do the whole Katie Couric thing.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And they didn't put it in a jar for me.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And I didn't really get to, I got knocked out so fast I didn't get to ask to keep it.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But I did get pictures of it, which you can't really see on Justin TV, but I'll walk it up to the camera later.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But see, Loki? That was my gallbladder there on the left.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, yay. Yeah, exactly.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I'll be showing those to Jamie when she arrives, too, because I know she was really excited to see.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But there you go. So I do at least have pictures.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And to answer Redertainment's question in chat, Skye, did you vote?

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, I went and voted. That's a very important thing.

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So hope you all did, too, no matter what you did. I hope you did go vote.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I voted on the monorail. I mean, bullet train.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
As pro-monorail.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, I did vote. I was well enough on Tuesday where I went out to vote.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If I was a little worried that, you know, because it was a week between my surgery and the voting time,

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was still in a little bit of pain, but I was able to get in the cargo vote.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If I didn't think I would have been able to do that, I would have just voted absentee.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So there you go.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I'm doing great. I feel a lot better. I'm ready to go back to work tomorrow, believe it or not.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I've just had a nice time away from all things my usual life, including ORR.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Be sure to download it, in case you haven't done it yet, the free LittleBigPlanet skins that they have, the costumes.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh yeah, I already did.

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, those are funny.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I got my GameStop ones, too, because they gave me a card even though I didn't pre-order it.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yep.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I wanted a card.

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, not that I really care.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sorry.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Anyhow, let me talk about some other stuff as far as games go.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So I was playing DS while I was recuperating.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I went back and revisited an old classic DS game, Clubhouse Games.

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was playing for a little while, which is, you know, it's a good way to pass the time when you're doped up.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then the other DS game I actually checked out, my dad was nice enough to go out,

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and I asked him to pick me up a game, and he did it, and that is Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I did play for a little bit, but I'm going to be honest.

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
As far as my thoughts on the game, I don't remember a lot of it.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because I was kind of on Vicodin most of the time I played it, so I don't really remember it at all.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like, I do.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I remember thinking it was very much, like, here's my thing with Castlevania games.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To me, they're starting to feel very similar to each other.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There's not a lot of innovation going on with the games, in my opinion.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They've all been very Symphony of the Night-ish.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, if you're waiting for some innovation, wait till Castlevania Judgment comes out.

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That'll innovate you up the ass.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Not to say I didn't like it, because don't get me wrong, Symphony of the Night is one hella good game,

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but every time I play one of these games on the DS, you know what?

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It makes me miss them on the console.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And actually, I found it to be rather difficult.

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was having a real hard time getting past, like, I think the second boss.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't think I'm that far into the game at all, because I can't get past some boss that should be really easy.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like right in the beginning of the game, it's like a crab that's climbing up the wall or something.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But keep in mind, Vicodin.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So I'm not really at my peak.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I'll probably go back and revisit that game and have some better, more collective thoughts on that.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Did you try to hit it for massive damage?

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, I did try to hit it for massive damage, and it wasn't working, apparently.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's because it only applies to...

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I didn't have 6-axis on the DS, that's why.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It didn't work.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I do have 6-axis on the PlayStation 3, and that's where I spent the majority of my time.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait, I gotta read this.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I gotta read this comment in chat.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Marin in chat says,

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Castlevania Vicodin of the Night is the best game ever.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Actually, any game on Vicodin is super great, especially Mario Kart.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Anyhow.

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The other game I spent far more time playing when I was much more sober was a game called Little Big Planet.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And as far as my thoughts on Little Big Planet, I love it.

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It is one of the best games I've played in a long, long, long time.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I love the sense of humor in the game.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think the graphics look great.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think it's great that we have a 2D platformer on the PlayStation 3 with 3D elements.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think, even as a standalone game, the story mode, albeit a little short, is pretty darn good.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Just even as a standalone game, I would have paid 20 bucks as an arcade title for just the story, which was a lot of fun.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But then you add this whole online component to it, and wow.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think my thoughts on this were kind of best summed up by a Twitter post I made earlier this week where I was like,

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know what? I think this game is the new ZZT for me.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Little Big Planet is kind of the new ZZT.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No, no, no. Nothing will ever replace ZZT.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It won't. It won't.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
ZZT always has a fond place in my heart, but I think that's because...

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sony's not trying to rip ZZT levels off the internet for you.

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
ZZT also had a more comprehensive programming language that Little Big Planet doesn't have.

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Even though you can do some pretty fancy things in Little Big Planet, you could do a little more in ZZT.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that the whole creation and the potential for really doing anything

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is really out there in Little Big Planet.

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And you really see that out there on some of these community levels.

252
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now granted, there's a lot of shit out there.

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's a lot of these levels that are like, Get 9 Trophies in 30 Seconds, which I'm sure we all played once.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I never played that one.

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You better believe it was the first level I played.

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But because we're all playing it as the first level, it's never going to go away.

257
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And all the clones are never going to go away from the top page.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But there's some really interesting stuff too.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And we're going to talk a little later in the show about the copyright infringement and all that stuff.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I've seen some pretty interesting stuff that's really blurred the lines of copyright infringement.

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Like I played a Batman level that was kind of funny. It was a little stupid.

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean, the level itself was very short, but it was really neat how the guy really worked in all these little Batman logos

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and little Joker faces and things into the game, even though it's a huge copyright problem.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But whatever, he hasn't been shut down yet.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And then it was interesting. Some levels I played, you actually could unlock little stickers.

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Like I think I got a sticker that has a picture of Dirty Harry on it because somebody held it up to the camera.

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Awesome.

268
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that was a sticker I unlocked because people are holding things up to the camera.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Like in Bobby's level, you know our buddy Bobby who does the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf on AllGames.com,

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
he has a level he did during the beta.

271
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And as a part of that, you can unlock the AllGames logo and a little logo from his show that is very similar to the gamer picture he has on Xbox.

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But that's not a copyright issue because he put it on there himself.

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But that's kind of neat that you can unlock those kinds of things when playing the community levels.

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And to be honest, even if you go in the non-copyright stuff, there's a lot of really kind of neat things out there that people are doing with their levels.

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I actually kind of like just going in and playing people's first levels and seeing the kind of things that people come up with.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a lot of fun.

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And then he had multiplayer into it.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And that's also a lot of fun. It's hard as hell to do without a headset.

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But because LittleBigPlanet is international, you might be playing with somebody from Japan or playing with Europe,

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you could all have headsets and you might still not be able to communicate very well.

281
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But people have come up with really efficient ways of communicating.

282
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Like people use the arrow stickers to point at things.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like one friend I've been playing with online a lot recently used the arrow sticker to kind of point me in directions of bubbles I'm missing

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
because in story mode they really hide some of the score bubbles really well.

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He'll use the arrow sticker to point so he doesn't have to type to me.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Also if you're doing something really well or good, people will use the little heart icon in the poppet and just hover on it in a minute to show heart.

287
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Good thing. Heart.

288
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Plus you can also hit people with your character.

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Exactly. My friend has a chicken suit with a frying pan and he's been hitting me over the head with a frying pan.

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I wouldn't need you with a frying pan.

291
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I have a pirate now with a frying pan and a little pirate hook.

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
A little tip from me to you.

293
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ace the first area, the little England area. If you ace those levels, beat them without dying.

294
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's really hard to do it in one of the levels because it has a collapsing bridge.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But if you go back through it with a sticker, you can get past the collapsing bridge with a swing thing.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you can get through all those levels without dying, that's how you get the pirate costume.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So it's pretty awesome.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
As you can see, I'm giddy when I talk about this game.

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's a lot of fun and just exploring it and there's so much more potential this game has.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Does the game have minor flaws?

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah. Sometimes the camera gets a little wonky, especially if people don't use it right.

302
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are some frame rate issues sometimes.

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When you play online, there's a lot of skipping that goes on.

304
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I don't know. I look past all that because I still see laid out in front of me an amazing game that I think is going to still be a big deal a year from now.

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I just hope Sony keeps it under control with how much they hoard this because there's really the potential to microtransaction the shit out of this game and just make it old real fast.

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But so far, they released a Halloween costume, albeit a week late.

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But there's been a lot of neat things in LittleBigPlanet.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So if you have a PlayStation 3, get it. You're going to love it.

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you don't have a PlayStation 3, is it worth plunking down the money for a system just for LittleBigPlanet?

310
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's a big investment. Especially, I know we have a lot of poor college kids and students that listen to this program.

311
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Maybe not. You really have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But hey, Christmas is coming around. You're going to be getting gift certificates. It might not be a bad investment, especially if you want a Blu-ray player and all that fancy stuff.

313
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Or if you buy, say for example, this weekend they had a deal at Walmart where you purchase a 80-gig system and you get a $100 gift card.

314
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Which is not a bad deal.

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It is not a bad deal.

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Solid Goomba in chat says, too late Rob, I already did.

317
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You know what? To be honest, remember the golden rule of gaming we always talk about on Orange Laundry.

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I had my foot down. I was not going to buy a PlayStation 3 until the games were out that I wanted to finally start playing.

320
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And LittleBigPlanet was the first must-have for me.

321
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then I was finally like, you know, I really want to have a Blu-ray player. They're not making the HD DVDs anymore.

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to have a better player hooked up to my HDTV.

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And between that and knowing that home is on the horizon and so on and so on, I finally decided to take the plunge.

324
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Honestly, I've been liking the system.

325
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We did give the system a hell of a time when it first came out.

326
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But through the magic of patches and all this stuff, they've been making the system quite a bit better.

327
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And now the games are really starting to come out.

328
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I use it a lot for streaming video files.

329
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Like, for example, we had the Halloween party we went to.

330
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We downloaded a copy of a synced version of the Rift Tracks for Harry Potter and the Goblet of...

331
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or not Goblet of Fire, the...

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Sorcerer's Stone? The second one.

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Chamber of Secrets.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Wow.

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We're bad muggles.

336
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It was hilarious.

337
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Nice.

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What did you do to my cat?

339
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You will now become a new cat.

340
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I always thought it was interesting. Honestly, honestly, you know I still love my Xbox 360, don't get me wrong.

341
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But it's so odd to me that the freaking, like, Microsoft Vista...

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What do they call that? The whole media sharing media center?

343
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That whole thing on the 360? What a pain in the big fat ass that thing is.

344
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's slow and it doesn't work.

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If you use that. Never use that though.

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I actually set it up. I set it up on Vista to be able to use it on the 360.

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It is slow as hell. It doesn't work right at all.

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
PlayStation 3? I was streaming video off my computer in a minute.

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
In one minute.

351
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What you need to do, what I normally use...

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I just could not believe that Microsoft's own system made it such a pain in the ass.

353
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm hoping the NXC makes that all go away.

354
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Media center is really old though.

355
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What you need to use, I use Teversity, which is awesome.

356
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And, you know, I can stream shit to my 360, my PS3.

357
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I prefer my PS3. I don't know why, but it seems to work really well.

358
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And I see folks in chat saying all these third-party programs as well.

359
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And don't get me wrong, but you would think their own freaking product

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
would interface better with Windows than Sony.

361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Five minutes.

362
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You see, I don't really use the Zune stuff for their new media center.

363
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Or, not media center, Windows Media.

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Because, you see, my copy of Windows isn't exactly on the up and up.

365
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So, Teversity works really well with those not so legitimate copies of Windows.

366
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well, mine's the real deal because it came with my computer and everything.

367
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And it's still garbage when trying to stream over the network.

368
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But, don't get me wrong, the Sony is not perfect because I've had problems.

369
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You can't run that and your internet thing at the same time,

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
or you'll keep getting booted off the internet.

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So, you do kind of, it has its own faults.

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But, as far as streaming video for a party or whatever, it works far better.

373
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
By the way, one other game I want to quickly mention, I played the demo for.

374
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't think the full game is out yet.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think it comes out next week.

376
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It is out? I might have to pick it up.

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Valkyria Chronicles from Sega.

378
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Also, I think it's known as Battlefield Valkyria in Japan.

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's kind of like an RTS type game, but the graphics are kind of neat.

380
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Like, it's first person, like you go from the top,

381
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
like the way it zooms in from this top down view into a first person view,

382
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and then you move your pieces around like live and attack things.

383
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's actually kind of neat.

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And, from what I understand, it's a PS3 exclusive.

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I might pick that one up. I actually had quite a good time with that.

386
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So, check out the demo if you haven't, Valkyria Chronicles.

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Alright, let's move on to some housekeeping.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Dark Soccer, of course, is not here to tell us about her gaming week,

389
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but she'll fill us in a little later when she gets here.

390
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I want to say something about the podcast delays,

391
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
because I've been getting some emails about it,

392
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and I've seen posts on the forums about it,

393
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and that the podcast was extremely delayed, especially episode 300.

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It took a couple weeks to get on the feed,

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and I'm really sorry about that, you guys.

396
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's never our intent to, like,

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and I know it's kind of been like a recurring thing that's been going on lately,

398
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
is that the shows have been extremely delayed,

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and I apologize.

400
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This whole two computer setup I have going on in the garage

401
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
has not been very helpful with that.

402
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
However, I did finally get an audio editing program on my main machine,

403
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
so I'm hoping that's going to make the production of the show

404
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
a hell of a lot faster in the future.

405
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I'm really sorry about that.

406
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And as far as episode 300 goes, I know that was a big episode,

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and if you haven't heard it yet, it's funny,

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
because we had so many people here in house,

409
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
so check out episode 300.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And, you know, again, I'm really sorry, but please understand,

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you know, I usually am the one that puts all those shows together

412
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
just because I just have traditionally,

413
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and I got so busy before the surgery trying to take care of everything else

414
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I was trying to take care of,

415
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and then, like, after the surgery, like, literally for a week and a half,

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I could not bend over to switch the computers to change the cords.

417
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Like, I would not, it was too much pain to do that.

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So, you know, I'm okay now.

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's why I was able to get it done now.

420
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But, you know, and just with everything else going on in the world,

421
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
there was just a lot more on my mind than just, you know,

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Orange Lawn's radio, and honestly, for me,

423
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I can't speak for Loki or Dark Soccer,

424
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but for me personally, being able to take a break from everything

425
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and using the surgery as a way to do it was really helpful for me.

426
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, I hope you all understand, you know, in the real TV shows,

427
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
they do, what, like 26 episodes a year?

428
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If that, 23, what's a season order?

429
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Like, how many episodes of Heroes in a year?

430
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Shit, last season we only had 11 episodes all year?

431
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's usually 26, I think.

432
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So, please bear with us.

433
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We do our best.

434
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's not an anti-podcast thing.

435
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Unless you want to look at, like, some show, like, say, for example,

436
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Little Britain, that's six a season.

437
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah, so, there you go.

438
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah, and I know, you know, I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad,

439
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
like, oh, look at me, cry for me.

440
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We're on season 50.

441
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm just trying to say, guys, please understand,

442
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
sometimes it goes much more than just the podcast.

443
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But we're here.

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We're back, episode 301, and hopefully back on a more regular schedule

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
of Monday, Tuesday-ish show releases.

446
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Probably this week's episode, not till Tuesday,

447
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
to give a little time for episode 300 to get caught by everybody,

448
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
because, again, it's a great show.

449
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I had a lot of fun.

450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Loki came in costume, if you haven't heard it yet.

451
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
He did finally wear a costume for all you people.

452
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's not the one you'd expect.

453
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He dressed up as Sackboy from Little Big Planet,

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but I want to ask a quick follow-up before we get into

455
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
tonight's gaming news.

456
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
How did the Sackboy costume go over at the Halloween party?

457
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It went over well.

458
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, at the Halloween party, I won second place.

459
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What did you lose to?

460
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
My sister.

461
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
She won with grr.

462
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, like, was she, like, a full-blown grr?

463
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah.

464
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, that's pretty awesome.

465
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you're going to lose to anything, lose to her.

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Well, it's all good, you know.

467
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it was just for fun.

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You have, like, this family to be reckoned with

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
in Halloween costume contests.

470
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, I normally don't make costumes.

471
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean, this is, like, the first costume I've made, period.

472
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So she makes stuff all the time.

473
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Like, she did, like, a fawn one year,

474
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
where she actually made, like, the fawn legs and everything,

475
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
because she was really, she's real into, like, the fantasy,

476
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Kralka-Linardia crap, you know,

477
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
just, like, the whole fantasy world

478
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and the mythological creatures and that kind of crap.

479
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So, yeah, so that's, I won second there.

480
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I mean, it was just for fun.

481
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It was just whatever.

482
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And then at my work, I won most original costume,

483
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
which is cool.

484
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's awesome.

485
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And you haven't mentioned this yet,

486
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but I don't even know if you know,

487
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
but there's some blog out there.

488
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think the dude who actually made the costume.

489
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, I sent him the email.

490
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He put your picture on it.

491
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, because I sent him an email.

492
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Nice.

493
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So you're actually, if you want to,

494
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
if you haven't seen Loki in the costume yet,

495
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
what's the blog?

496
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
MakeAsackBoy.com.

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
MakeAsackBoy.com.

498
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Loki's right there in the OLR shirt.

499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What a great plug for the show.

500
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Good job, Loki.

501
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Mm-hmm.

502
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Good job.

503
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

504
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
All right, let's start things off.

506
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We'll talk about a program called Boku.

507
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And Boku is supposedly Microsoft's answer

508
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to the little big planet.

509
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's a programming language meant, well,

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it looks like it's meant for little kids.

511
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And basically, you can use this to create your own games.

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And, you know, it's sort of like XNA to a certain extent.

513
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And we've talked about this before.

514
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Many episodes ago, actually on episode 282,

515
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
back in June, we had mentioned this one that I actually got a...

516
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Damn, episode number and everything.

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Nice, Loki.

518
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Very nice.

519
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Basically, there was a survey that was sent out at the time.

520
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They were talking about some of the in-game objects and characters

521
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and whether I liked them or not.

522
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So I hated them all.

523
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No, they were all right.

524
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But the programming language itself, it looks very basic.

525
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
But, you know, much like little big planet,

526
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
you can actually do some pretty cool stuff with it.

527
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And they showed some examples of different games.

528
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And there's basic AI that you can assign to objects

529
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and tell them how they behave and that kind of thing.

530
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And the games itself look like they're...

531
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The levels almost look like they're made out of Legos,

532
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
which is kind of cool.

533
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So, no word on when exactly this is going to be available.

534
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I mean, this thing's been going on for a long time.

535
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They originally announced the project, I'd say, in 2007.

536
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I guess it's been officially unveiled this week,

537
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
although it's been at a few different conventions.

538
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's just been so much...

539
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Didn't they have a tiny, tiny little booth at Penny Arcade Expo,

540
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
if I remember right?

541
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
There was something about it.

542
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It was almost like an informational thing only,

543
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
if I remember right.

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
No, no, the thing at...

545
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I thought I saw it somewhere.

546
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No, the thing at Penny Arcade was something different.

547
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That was not Boku.

548
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That was...

549
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, it was similar to Boku.

550
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It wasn't quite the same thing.

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It was...

552
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't remember what they called it at the time,

553
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but this is totally different than that.

554
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
No, that's alright.

555
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The program that they were showing off was...

556
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That was really basic.

557
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It was for Flash games, I think.

558
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And, I mean, you're talking like stuff...

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know if anyone remembers Maxis's...

560
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Click and Play.

561
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
God, I love that game.

562
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But it's that basic.

563
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Actually, it was even more basic than that.

564
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The one that they were showing off at Penny Arcade Expo,

565
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and I can't remember for the life of me what it was called,

566
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but it wasn't Boku, because I would have remembered that.

567
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
No worries.

568
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But this, though, is supposed to be available,

569
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I guess it looks like now.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
They're saying early next year.

571
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, it's pretty cool.

572
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And they have a video.

573
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If you can check it out, it's on Gamasutra,

574
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and they have it mirrored on joystick.

575
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So, you know, definitely check it out.

576
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's pretty cool looking.

577
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It'll be interesting to see what you can do with it.

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And you know what's funny is the entire time

579
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that I was playing LittleBigPlanet,

580
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I was thinking,

581
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
how long is it going to be before Microsoft tries to one-up this?

582
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Honestly.

583
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because you know Microsoft can't watch these things go by.

584
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You know what I mean?

585
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
They're always trying to one-up, especially Sony.

586
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So, it's just funny that this is coming to light.

587
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Hey, don't forget about us.

588
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We got a game coming.

589
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Well, yeah.

590
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean, this has been around for a while now.

591
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's been in development for at least a few years.

592
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So, I don't know.

593
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They definitely won't be the last people to do something similar to LittleBigPlanet.

594
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I mean, this is, I think, going to be a trend going forward.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You're going to have a lot more games where it's all about creating stuff

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and sharing it with the community and that kind of stuff.

597
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because that's what people like.

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
They like being creative and having the tools to be creative.

599
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
All right.

600
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, I'm very curious to see what Xbox's kind of response is to this.

601
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So, we'll see.

602
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You know, it's something I would definitely give it a try.

603
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I mean, I like making games and I think it'd be fun.

604
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SonicM88 in chat, chat.ornisontraday.com says,

605
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't have time to care about Boku with all the great games out already.

606
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I just keep getting a larger pile of games to play.

607
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That's kind of how I'm starting to feel, man.

608
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There's so many games out there to catch up on.

609
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's insanity.

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Well, the thing is-

611
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But, of course, this is the holidays every year.

612
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah.

613
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And also, you have to remember, I mean, you don't have to buy everything day one.

614
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I mean, especially during the holiday, it feels like you're pressured to be buying a bunch of stuff.

615
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You know, like, Fallout 3, I felt like, oh, I gotta get this game, you know, because everyone's hyping it up and stuff.

616
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But, I'm like, I got too much shit I gotta play.

617
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm not gonna go buy another game.

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That's how I feel.

619
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Because I've heard, like, Fallout 3 is Oblivion with guns and nothing could, like, sell a game better for me.

620
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But, I just, I don't have fucking time between all the other games I'm trying to play.

621
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then, add on top of that Wrath of the Lich King coming out this week.

622
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And you know I'm the resident WoW addict.

623
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Addict.

624
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, it sounds like Dark Sakura's here with us.

625
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
How are you doing, Jamie?

626
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I was looking for the right moment to pipe in.

627
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There you go.

628
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh, you sound a little raspy.

629
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Have you been yelling a lot today?

630
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I've been yelling for quite a bit this afternoon.

631
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Alright.

632
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Did you notice at the top of Part B, a little bit where Dark Sakura's been screaming her head off at?

633
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Did you notice I have a giant sandwich?

634
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was a lot more giant earlier.

635
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Holy fucking shit.

636
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's a 24-inch family-sized sandwich.

637
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You didn't talk about this on the show.

638
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You just talked about it on JustinTV before we went live.

639
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I have only one word to ask in regards to that sandwich.

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

641
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Why?

642
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Because I'm hungry.

643
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Now, the story goes is that I went over to Togo's, which is a sandwich chain over here.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm not sure if it's nationwide, but at least on the West Coast.

645
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's the same people that own Baskin-Robbins, so I would think so.

646
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes.

647
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And Dunkin' Donuts, even, I think.

648
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I have never seen Togo's outside of Sacramento, though.

649
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Togo's was originally founded in California, so I'm not sure if it's outside that far.

650
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Anyways, so they have a large sandwich, which is 8 inches.

651
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But the other day, or actually yesterday, we went in there to get sandwiches, and we're going to go watch a movie.

652
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And this woman next to me, she's ordering a family-sized sandwich.

653
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm like, family-sized sandwich?

654
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They're like, yeah, it's like 24 inches long.

655
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm like, really, you say?

656
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That is a size that I was unaware of.

657
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And so, because I always thought it'd be funny to order a giant sandwich.

658
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
24 inches for you, not them?

659
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And so, basically, what I'm going to do with this is, it's not I'm done with the sandwich for today, but I'm going to eat it, like, throughout the week.

660
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So, it's lunch for all week.

661
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
How much did it run you, if you don't mind me asking?

662
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
20 bucks.

663
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You know, if that's a week worth of food, a week worth of lunches, for $20?

664
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's not bad.

665
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That isn't bad.

666
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's not bad at all.

667
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I wish I had known of such a thing while I was in college.

668
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It was $21 with a large drink, so you figure the drink's about 2 bucks, and then, so it's, like, 90 bucks.

669
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Doesn't Subway do something?

670
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
These drinks are ridiculous anyway, because you know how much soda actually costs without profit?

671
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Like, 5 cents.

673
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Doesn't Subway have a similar thing?

674
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I mean, most sub-shops do. I'm pretty sure Quiznos does the huge subs, too, if you ask.

675
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Quiznos, yeah.

676
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah, but this is something that they actually have available, like, anytime.

677
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Normally, if you order a sandwich that's larger than, like, Subway, they don't make anything larger than a foot.

678
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, yeah.

679
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because that's their thing, their foot long.

680
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But, you know, you can go in there, in fact, I don't think Togo's makes anything larger than 2 feet.

681
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I can't believe how long we've been talking about a fucking sandwich.

682
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But, no, you have to order it in advance if you're ordering anything bigger,

683
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
because I always wanted for my birthday just to order a 3-foot-long sandwich to come in to work with that,

684
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
because it'd be funny, because people are like, what the hell are you doing?

685
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
They've done that for work events where I worked before.

686
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I usually save these things till the end of the show, but it just, it works too much now.

687
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You know, at the end of the show, I always love to whore ourselves out for more positive iTunes reviews,

688
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
because, you know, it makes us feel really good about what we're doing, it helps us spread the word out about our show,

689
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and increases our rankings in iTunes.

690
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And we need our E-peen stroked.

691
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We do, we need our E-peen stroked once in a while.

692
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And a couple of you have stroked in the past couple weeks, including this review from Biohaze20,

693
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
who says, one of the best podcasts out there.

694
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And, yes, this is related.

695
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Orange Lawns Radio, keeping you informed about video games, the lifestyle, and most importantly, food.

696
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And then goes on to say some very nice things about the show and about AllGames.com, our network that we broadcast on.

697
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Dear Orange Lawns Radio, thank you for letting Jamie not have to be on the camera.

698
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
All right.

699
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Signed, Jamie.

700
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I was just hoping they'd have some really cool, like, long box that you could put it in or something,

701
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
because they didn't, they just gave me the sandwich and expected me to, like, take it home and, I don't know.

702
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And I didn't have them cut it either, because I figured that would-

703
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
All right, enough sandwich! Jesus.

704
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Rob, I will inform you right now, I did not have a sandwich for my extended dinner.

705
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
All right. How was your gaming week, of all things?

706
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I played Fable 2 a little bit.

707
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And what'd you think?

708
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I smashed beetles, and I tried to be a good little girl.

709
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Dan had an interesting experience.

710
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He is a big beefy man, got turned into a big beefy woman.

711
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
He drank the gender potion.

712
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And so he decided just to be evil.

713
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And went around killing everybody, and his dog turned black, and he lost his halo and grew horns.

714
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Awesome.

715
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The end.

716
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I still haven't played Fable 2, I'm having to live another one of those games on the back burner.

717
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Also, one of our listeners, who is in the UK, I really don't know what name he goes by for purposes of chat,

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
so I'm just gonna say Rob.

719
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And it's a good name.

720
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, it's a very good name.

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm getting a present in the form of a Doctor Who game.

722
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Nice.

723
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So, I am going to be reciprocating eventually with Silent Hill Homecoming.

724
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Now, since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks, are you sad about David Tennant?

725
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I don't live in this reality where David Tennant is not going to be the Doctor.

726
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Alright, fair enough.

727
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I disavow all knowledge of that edition of reality, and instead move to an alternate reality where David Tennant is the Doctor forever.

728
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Fair enough.

729
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And in your DS game, he will be.

730
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes.

731
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So there you, you just have to never watch the show again.

732
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's just it's got Martha in it, and Martha's not fun.

733
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I like Donna.

734
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Dr. Donna.

735
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What else was I gonna ask you?

736
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, you!

737
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You!

738
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What?

739
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You need to play LittleBigPlanet.

740
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm gonna!

741
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It is, when it arrives.

742
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Rocking amazing.

743
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We're supposed to get a free copy.

744
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And every time I hear the British narrator saying something really fucking cute in the traditional English style, making those little puns,

745
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I think of you.

746
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Because I know you live for that stuff.

747
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I want to move there.

748
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The narrator is some famous guy too.

749
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
He's the guy that narrates.

750
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He's the witch hanker's guy from the galaxy.

751
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, he's.

752
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, sweet.

753
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, he's pretty famous.

754
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I want to move there, okay?

755
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You want to move to LittleBigPlanet?

756
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
No.

757
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's pretty rad.

758
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You can decorate your pod and fire.

759
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I want to, sweet.

760
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You know.

761
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There's levels on there that are just, fire!

762
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You know I'm gonna have HellPod.

763
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You should.

764
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Anyhow.

765
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but I am proud to say.

766
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes.

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I finished the entirety of season two of Supernatural, and I'm moving on to season three.

768
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Quel Tipo, Stephen Fry is the gentleman's name.

769
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Thank you.

770
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It was on the tip of my tongue.

771
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I didn't want to have to go look it up because I'm lazy.

772
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I am going to be watching more Supernatural.

773
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I vow by the end of the semester, I will be caught up to date with Supernatural.

774
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Because that is now my favorite TV show.

775
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Is that on the CW?

776
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes.

777
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes.

778
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You know what else they show on the CW?

779
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What?

780
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
90210.

781
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Just saying.

782
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's alternate reality, Rob.

783
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You shut your mouth.

784
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Apparently post episode 300, we now live in Jamie's alternate reality.

785
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

786
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know what?

787
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Excuse me.

788
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Masters of the Wiki.

789
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Can we get a list of things that exist in Jamie's alternate reality?

790
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Also, I ate at a very good restaurant speaking of food.

791
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Not today.

792
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Am I ever going to get to talk about Xbox Live?

793
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I have to talk about it, Rob.

794
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Alright.

795
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's called Something Bohem.

796
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Lost Something Bohem.

797
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Lovey Bohem?

798
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Like the Rent song?

799
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
No, but it's kind of.

800
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Okay, it's an Italian song.

801
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's an Italian Czech restaurant.

802
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Nice.

803
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
They're very delicious, except the one thing I did not ever expect to hear played in an

804
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Italian Czech restaurant was the theme from Shaft.

805
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm sitting there eating my gnocchi, and I'm like, mmm, this is creamy.

806
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What?

807
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Shut your mouth.

808
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Just talk about Shaft.

809
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Shut your mouth and chew.

810
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So, I had to share that antidote.

811
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So, in your alternate universe, are all Italian Czech restaurants required to play the theme

812
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
from Shaft?

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
At least once per meal.

814
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Alright.

815
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Well, back to gaming news.

816
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't know what to say, but hey, if you like to blow things up.

817
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That would be us.

818
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Who doesn't like to blow things up?

819
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You can do that on Xbox Live this week with a little game called Vigilante 8, and Dark

820
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Sakura's a bit of a vigilante herself.

821
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's actually, speaking of Shaft, this game kind of has a bit of a 70s kind of retro feel

822
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
to it, so maybe this is the perfect game to compliment your Italian Czech dining experience.

823
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's kind of the sequel.

824
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You know what?

825
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It was really good food, okay?

826
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's kind of the sequel to Interstate 76.

827
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It had really, really good beer on tap.

828
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Nice.

829
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And it's awesome, and it was originally on the PlayStation.

830
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Does it have good beer?

831
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Actually, this is an old game.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's being remade.

833
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Vigilante 8 was out a while ago.

834
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Wasn't it an arcade game years ago?

835
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No, original PlayStation.

836
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Alright, well there you go.

837
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But now you can play it online with eight people.

838
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's why it's Vigilante 8.

839
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I downloaded the demo, but I plan on buying it.

840
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
800 Microsoft points for the game.

841
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Does it have good beer?

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know.

843
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You can drive a bus.

844
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A school bus with barbed wire and crap on it.

845
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
School bus.

846
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Was that last week's release?

847
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, this week.

848
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You could also drive a bus in Twisted Metal.

849
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, we were off for a week.

850
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What's coming out this week on this Wednesday?

851
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I know it's coming out next week.

852
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't know about this week.

853
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's next week's...

854
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Well, I'm not going to mention it because I think it's another story.

855
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
This week...

856
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know what's coming out this week.

857
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm sure we'll learn soon enough.

858
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Alright, well let's move on.

859
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Yes, so one thing that...

860
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Well, it's already out right now, but Call of Duty World at War.

861
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
They have an open beta that's available on Xbox Live.

862
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Although I imagine this is probably going to be ending pretty soon since the game comes out in a couple days anyways.

863
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So, yeah.

864
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But at least it's kind of cool.

865
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
What was available originally to a few select people is now available to everybody.

866
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And apparently it weighs in at just under 890 megs.

867
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And it's all sorts of fun.

868
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But for the full game, you'll have to play it.

869
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I think it comes out on the 12th.

870
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
How much does 890 megs actually weigh?

871
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Not much.

872
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Those 20 gig hard drives are fairly light.

873
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They're not light if one falls on your head.

874
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
My first hard drive in my first computer...

875
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
They hurt.

876
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
My first hard drive in my first computer, PC...

877
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Back when they were calling computers PS2 compatible computers.

878
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay, my first hard drive...

879
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
486!

880
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It was a 3... no, I remember.

881
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
286.

882
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I remember clearly.

883
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
A 386 SX16.

884
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because it's cool to say a lot of numbers in random letters.

885
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
SX for sexy.

886
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yes, exactly.

887
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SX for sex.

888
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's all I could think about when I was in seventh grade.

889
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Was it Scuzzy?

890
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But here's the thing.

891
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It had a 40 megabyte hard drive in that thing.

892
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh my god, Rob!

893
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And that's how I got on Prodigy to post my intentions.

894
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know what we used to call Prodigy?

895
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Huh?

896
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Buttigy.

897
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I always heard Prodigy.

898
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I remember we had a 386 FX 20.

899
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And the 20, that was when it was running in turbo mode.

900
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That's right!

901
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Computers with turbo buttons.

902
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Because who didn't use the fucking turbo button?

903
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I mean, really.

904
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Unless you were trying to play an old ass game.

905
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay, and who had the accelerators to go with their processors?

906
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I know, and seriously now.

907
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So I remember, and that thing was a brick.

908
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Because we took it out to upgrade it to a 500 megabyte drive years later.

909
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And now I can carry, even that 500 megabyte drive was a brick too.

910
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Now I carry around a gigabyte in my pocket.

911
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Amazing memory is so damn cheap.

912
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Technology.

913
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I have two gigs in my pocket right now, and it's happy to see you.

914
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You're quite feisty today.

915
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I think I rather like it.

916
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Jamie had some really delicious wine at dinner.

917
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You need to have wine, you need to get loaded more often before coming to the show.

918
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm not loaded!

919
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I know, otherwise you wouldn't have driven here.

920
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Exactly.

921
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But you need to loosen up a little bit.

922
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I've just had a busy day and I'm coming off of the adrenaline.

923
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's cool, that's cool.

924
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
All right, well hey, if you like old things to be all new again since we're talking a little bit retro.

925
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I bet you guys are really excited to hear that Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is apparently all done, ready to go.

926
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's been submitted to Microsoft for certification.

927
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
They are saying the game will come out in November.

928
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And hmm, I'm thinking, what a nice Thanksgiving treat this might be for Microsoft fans everywhere.

929
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Don't you think?

930
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yes.

931
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Even though, isn't this also coming out on PlayStation Network as well?

932
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yes it is.

933
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So it's got to get by both of those hurdles before the game will come out.

934
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But even for Sony fans, it's a nice way to sit on the couch and relax after eating all that turkey.

935
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So there you go.

936
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So they are targeting November, but just because they target it, folks, remember that doesn't always mean they're going to make it.

937
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You never know, if the damn thing failed certification for whatever reason, they're going to have to go back to the drawing board.

938
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But they have submitted it.

939
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It is very soon to go.

940
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yes, and if you can't wait that long, well this Wednesday you can download a brand new level for Pinball FX.

941
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It's a Street Fighter themed level and it will, of course, cost you 200 Microsoft Points.

942
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And hmm, looks pretty cool.

943
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's not bad though. 200 Microsoft Points is what? 250?

944
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Now Jamie, you would probably know this.

945
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Any Street Fighter themed actual pinball tables?

946
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There was one. There was, oh god, and I've played one before. It wasn't very good.

947
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's too bad.

948
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I seem to recall that too. I remember playing it and it wasn't that good.

949
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If I'm right, I know it wasn't a wide body. I think it was just a standard pinball that some ran.

950
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You know, I'm going to find out actually. I'm going to get the company because I want to say it was a Data East, but don't quote me yet.

951
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But this is not a remake of that table.

952
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is to celebrate the HD remix coming out, so it's not that.

953
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But not all tables based on video games are bad.

954
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
One of my favorite, favorite tables they ever did was the Mario Brothers table.

955
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Not the little one, because there were two versions of it.

956
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
There was a tiny one that was for kids and there was a big one.

957
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It was a Gottlob.

958
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And so was the Mario game, I believe was a Gottlob game.

959
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And that was a lot of fun speaking of pinball.

960
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The Mario, there was a Super Mario World one, actually.

961
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I think that's the one I'm thinking of. I think that's it.

962
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I wonder if that was in Mario World.

963
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
No, and that would suck too if it wasn't in there, but remember how they had the Gottlob collection for Wii?

964
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It'd be cool if the Super Mario table was in there since it came out on the Wii, but I doubt it.

965
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The collection I have on the Wii is Williams, not Gottlob.

966
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Gottlob was in the UK.

967
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It was a Street Fighter II pinball that was developed by Gottlob in 1993.

968
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And I don't remember it being very good, but I know some people like it, so I am personally not...

969
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Pinball is kind of one of those things where I notice, I mean, pinball is pinball.

970
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And there are really good tables and really bad tables, but generally, the tables that people do really well on, they tend to like more, I notice.

971
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Actually, we picked up a new pinball table. Did I tell you?

972
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, what'd you get?

973
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We have a Revenge from Mars.

974
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
No, take that back.

975
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Oh, wow.

976
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I take that back. We have an Episode 1.

977
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Wow, that's cool.

978
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, we picked up...

979
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's a hologram one. Those are rad.

980
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What do they call it? The pin 2000 or whatever?

981
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Pinball 2000, exactly. We're working on restoring it right now, but it plays really well.

982
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Nice.

983
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I just thought I'd mention because I'd forgotten about it.

984
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Are there some good... Hey, listeners, are there some good pinball podcasts out there?

985
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
We should do a pincast.

986
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There ought to be a couple others that are already up and running out there. I'm kind of curious.

987
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
There's only so much pinball news, to be honest.

988
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I guess not.

989
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Pinball's still got a massive following.

990
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, I mean, they do these conventions and stuff. I mean, I'm sure there's plenty to talk about.

991
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I know, but I can't imagine that there's that much. I mean, maybe our podcast is still talking about...

992
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Thank you, Frisbee. He says ballcast. I don't know if he's making that up. That could be just a joke, but I don't know.

993
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know.

994
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
All right, well, moving on to other news. You know, the new ExitBox experience is coming out pretty soon,

995
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and I know some of our listeners have been lucky enough to get into the whole beta test,

996
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
which, by the way, I'm kind of pissed about missing the whole beta test thing.

997
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I didn't even sign up because it was like the... I think it was like the day before my surgery or something.

998
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, it was such a small window.

999
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yeah, I just wasn't able to get in on it, which sucks because I could have really used the streaming Netflix part right about now,

1000
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but that's all right. I had to make do with regular Netflix.

1001
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But apparently, a lot of the features that were originally supposed to be in the new XBox experience were cut,

1002
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and I'm not talking about like things that they've already shown that have been cut, such as the whole game show thing that they first showed.

1003
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about they have this big list of things they wanted to accomplish,

1004
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and according to the head of XBox Live in Europe, Jerry Johnson, he actually said,

1005
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
of this list, they cut out half of it and only put in half of it into the new XBox experience,

1006
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
but, assumably, that other half will continue to kind of grow.

1007
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And one thing they talked about, there's actually a quote here from Johnson.

1008
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
He says, quote, still a lot of stuff we want to do. Half of the things we wanted to do, we cut out of the service.

1009
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
One of these things was a photo party app that will be part of the platform.

1010
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The way it will be distributed is all of a sudden you'll see a slot on the dashboard,

1011
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and if you don't have it, you click on it, and it's going to download from the service onto your application part of the dashboard.

1012
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
These are the type of things we're going to start doing.

1013
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So a photo party, that sounds kind of neat.

1014
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, that's fine. I mean, I can't say that there's...

1015
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's not like there's...

1016
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Aren't they worried, though, about the photo party being all porno pictures and bukkake photo Asian girl XXX parties?

1017
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What other kind of photo parties would you possibly have?

1018
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe showing pictures of the kids to relatives or cousins who also happen to be on Xbox Live.

1019
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's lame. That's what email's for.

1020
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What the hell is up with your live journal icon?

1021
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What is up with my live journal icon?

1022
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It looks like pasta.

1023
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I don't... Oh.

1024
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's shrimp chow.

1025
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Ask me later. We're trying to do a show here.

1026
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
All right. Anyhow, let's talk about some release dates.

1027
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yes. This week there's a ton of stuff coming out. Absolute myriad of things.

1028
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
To start things off, of course, we have Call of Duty World at War coming out on pretty much everything out there.

1029
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Also this week, we've got Mirror's Edge on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1030
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000

1032
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:22,000

Pony Friends Mini Breeds Edition on the DS.

1034
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Populous on the DS. That's kind of neat.

1035
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
They were putting out a... Dude, I remember Populous. That game was awesome.

1036
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
They're putting out a Three Stooges game on PC. I'm sure that'll be awesome.

1037
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Supposedly they're doing a new Three Stooges movie that's fast tracking for next year.

1038
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And I think I want to say the Farley Brothers were attached or something?

1039
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I thought I heard something like that at one time.

1040
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000

1042
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Alright. We may be giving some of those away.

1043
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Ooh! Possibly. I'll look into that.

1063
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
But that's pretty much it for the US.

1095
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Lots of good stuff.

1096
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then Rob has disappeared.

1097
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000

00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
What? No, that game doesn't come out until December.

1137
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It says November.

1138
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That's for the UK.

1139
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That's UK.

1140
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
What? You bastards get it earlier there?

1141
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Import the Bitch.

1142
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
You bet I'm gonna Import the Bitch.

1143
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Sing Star Volume 3.

1144
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm gonna Import both those bitches.

1145
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Star Wars The Clone Wars Jedi Alliance, Star Wars The Clone Wars Lightsaber Duels, Wii Music,

1146
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
WSC Reel 08, my Wii Music arrived by the way,

1147
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
World Championship Snooker is what it says,

1148
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
EverQuest 2 The Shadow Odyssey Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack.

1149
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. Those are actually the 18th.

1150
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, I'm done.

1151
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's alright, alright.

1152
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know, and this is the part of the show where usually the chat room listeners start to parody the different releases that are coming out.

1153
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
GS68 says Sing Star Loki.

1154
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Redertainment says My Horse in Me 2 Adventures in Tijuana.

1155
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Now that would be a game worth playing.

1156
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That one should actually be called Me and the Horse I Rode In On.

1157
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
SSG100 Matt says No Sing Star Matters Unless it's Abba Sing Star, you damn right.

1158
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Redertainment says My Secret Diary, finally a place to go on and on about the things that people could honestly give a rat's ass about.

1159
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Don't we have that? Isn't it called Live Journal?

1160
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
No, it's called Zonga.

1161
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I don't use Zonga.

1162
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Hey Rob, you missed it. They have Hello Kitty Daily, which is a diary.

1163
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
My God.

1164
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Act Def says Is Top Model Smarter than a 5th Grader?

1165
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Which reminded me, one game I did play this week, I actually played the demo of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader.

1166
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You might be surprised at my thoughts on this game.

1167
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
For what it is, it's not bad.

1168
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
The game itself.

1169
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But I think the thrill of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader could only really last so long.

1170
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's kind of one of those haha for about 15 minutes.

1171
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I noticed that they changed the name to 10-year-old for the UK because there's not a 5th grade.

1172
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Ah, there you go.

1173
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think, yeah.

1174
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But they released the US version here on Xbox Live.

1175
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Or they could just forego release it in the UK because it sucks and why are we torturing them anyway?

1176
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:53,000
For what I'm trying to say, for what it is, it actually doesn't suck, but the fact is it is a game based off a TV show that can kind of just go away.

1177
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They should have just called it Are You Smarter than an American and it would have probably sold like hotcakes because everyone was like,

1178
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh my God, I am so much smarter than that stupid America.

1179
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Alright.

1180
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
As a collective?

1181
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
As a collective.

1182
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm not, even, forget it.

1183
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Alright, moving on.

1184
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Let's talk about Japanese release dates.

1185
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Speaking of people smarter than Americans.

1186
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on November 13th on the Xbox 360.

1187
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
A brand new Xbox 360 pack.

1188
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's the 60 gigabyte live pack.

1189
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Also comes out in Japan on the 13th.

1190
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Could that be because The Last Remnant is coming out next week?

1191
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I don't know.

1192
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
But I'm thinking yes.

1193
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you get FIFA Soccer 09 as well.

1194
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
A Mahjong game gets a price reduction in Koei's best series.

1195
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Major League Beast...

1196
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Beastball?

1197
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Baseball!

1198
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Beastball!

1199
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'd like to see that.

1200
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Major League Beastball!

1201
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
No, Major League Baseball 2008 comes out in Japan.

1202
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Because you know baseball is huge in Japan.

1203
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Also Derby Time Online comes out on PlayStation 3, so if you like your horsey race then there you go.

1204
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week.

1205
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Quite a bit of stuff.

1206
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
New Ono Kids Wii.

1207
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Jinsei Game Wii.

1208
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
FIFA Soccer 09 Allplay.

1209
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Because you know EA likes to do the Allplay thing.

1210
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Family Ski.

1211
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
World Ski and Snowboard if I'm not mistaken.

1212
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
That's the Wii mat game.

1213
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Wii Fit that uses that, right?

1214
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
No, Family Athletics would be the one.

1215
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Family Ski was Wii Ski.

1216
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh, okay.

1217
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Is that a price reduction?

1218
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
No, it's coming out from Namco and it's not a price reduction.

1219
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That already came out over there unless it's a sequel.

1220
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Maybe it's a sequel.

1221
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It could be because this has snowboarding in it too.

1222
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh, I see. There you go.

1223
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Also a game coming out from THQ on the Wii called Blob Colorful Na Kibu, which I'm guessing is their localized version of.

1224
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
The Blob.

1225
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 2 if you're still rocking it old school on the PlayStation 2, you are going to have the release of Major League Baseball 2008.

1226
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
As well as Nobunaga gets a price reduction that's specifically Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin.

1227
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And if you've never played a Nobunaga game, go back to the NES and play the very first one.

1228
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And then take a nap.

1229
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And grow your rice and make your citizens happy.

1230
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Also coming out on the portable systems if you are so inclined to check out on the Nintendo DS, you can check out...

1231
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Sorry, I'm losing my release dates here.

1232
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Ah, Nintendo DS.

1233
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Some new casings and so on.

1234
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
A game called Juggler.

1235
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
A Nobunaga game gets a price reduction there too.

1236
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Rhythm to Cooking.

1237
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That's what they're calling it.

1238
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ryusen no Rockman 3, Black Ace, and Red Joker.

1239
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'm assuming that's their tactical Mega Man series over there.

1240
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
ZX, er, not the ZX.

1241
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Mega Man Star Force games.

1242
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Taisen ka 2chan no Koronope.

1243
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Zero kara Hajimiru.

1244
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Otona no 5 Kokugo Numion.

1245
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But, you know what?

1246
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
All this stuff just kind of sucks when you consider the next week is Chrono Trigger.

1247
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I forgot Pokemon Ranger was coming out this week. The shells of Almia on DS.

1248
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Oh really?

1249
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yes, I think that's...

1250
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
What makes this Pokemon game special?

1251
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Nothing.

1252
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Alright then.

1253
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
On the Sony PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment gets a price reduction.

1254
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And FIFA Soccer 09 also gets a version there on the PSP.

1255
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Otherwise, as far as new stuff goes, not a whole lot.

1256
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But you do have a game called Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hoto Gisuran and Zero Pilot Daisanji Sekai Taisen 1946 are your two new PSP games this week.

1257
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Oh, also this one. I'm sorry, I missed this one.

1258
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
This is a pretty big one, I think, over in Japan.

1259
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's bolded on my list, which usually means it's a pretty big deal.

1260
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
It's a game called Chuman Shiozi Oretachi no Sekai.

1261
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And I'm trying to figure out what it's a version of.

1262
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I don't know, it might be something unique over there based off one of their TV shows or something.

1263
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But it looks like it is an action game coming out over there.

1264
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
There you go. That's it for Japanese release dates.

1265
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Alright, cool.

1266
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
What about Zimbabwe?

1267
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
What about it?

1268
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
What about their release dates?

1269
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Well, you might have to listen to another podcast because it's only a three hour show.

1270
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm sorry, we can't do every country in the world.

1271
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I know Australia, cry cry, we don't do your dates or some of the other places that listen to us.

1272
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But we only have so many hours.

1273
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Alright, well, as I said earlier, if you're confused on what you should make in LittleBigPlanet,

1274
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
well, there's something that might be able to help you out.

1275
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Actually, LittleBigWorkshop is a website that's been released.

1276
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
They have tools that will allow you to design your levels, basically,

1277
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and can help you plan out things and that kind of stuff.

1278
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So go to www.LittleBigWorkshop.com and check it out,

1279
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and you might be able to create the next big level,

1280
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
hopefully not based off of licensed materials, otherwise they'll get yanked offline.

1281
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I just want to say I did visit that website,

1282
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and you can link it to your own PlayStation Network account, which is pretty cool.

1283
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You have to use your email address, though, instead of your sign-in name, which I thought was weird.

1284
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But if you sign in with your email address and password, you can actually have your own little page on there.

1285
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It doesn't quite interact with it as much as you'd like.

1286
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You're not going to see your creations pop up on there, but it's kind of interesting.

1287
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It tries to do the whole social network thing where you have your own Facebook-y update your current status thing.

1288
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But I don't think it's really something I would practically use.

1289
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But it's neat that it's there, and there's the potential that they might expand that, if you know what I mean.

1290
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So, pretty cool.

1291
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And the copyright levels, right?

1292
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yes, but that's the thing.

1293
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:04,000
There's been a lot of copyrighted levels, or levels with copyrighted materials in them, that are being yanked offline.

1294
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Included in that, of course, levels based off Pac-Man, Batman.

1295
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
There was even a Scrubs level, I guess, that was taken offline.

1296
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
One weird one, though, was there was a level called Failure to Launch that someone took offline.

1297
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Because, I guess, there's that movie Failure to Launch.

1298
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's a little much.

1299
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Which, to be honest, if you heard Failure to Launch, I don't think you would think of the romantic comedy.

1300
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
No, I wouldn't.

1301
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Did anyone actually see that movie that plays Little Big Planet? Probably not.

1302
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Unfortunately, I did. And I can't take that away.

1303
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But, good comment from GS68 in chat.

1304
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Blastworks. Remember the Wii game Blastworks that a lot of us unfortunately overlooked?

1305
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I mean, not here on OLR. Loki's been hyping this game up forever.

1306
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah, and unfortunately I never really played it much, either.

1307
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well, here's the interesting thing. GS68 says Blastworks has copyrighted user-created stuff, and nobody gives a shit.

1308
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah, it's so far under the radar.

1309
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah, sometimes having your game under the radar isn't necessarily a bad thing, I suppose.

1310
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But it is so weird, though, Loki, how much copyrighted stuff still gets through.

1311
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Like, that grottiest level is still there. It was there just before we went live tonight.

1312
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Because I think it's really awesome, and it's getting people, you know, I think people will throw a fit if I want to just know how the level works,

1313
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and then maybe make something that's original that kind of plays the same, you know what I mean?

1314
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah, but it's very interesting. I mean, I played a Batman level, and I don't remember if I talked about it earlier on this show,

1315
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
or at the tail end of Bobby's show when we're usually on.

1316
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But there's a Batman level out there, too, that just, you know, infringes on that IP left and right.

1317
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Obviously not in the level design, but, you know, it uses the little Batman logo or someone's little creation of it,

1318
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and that you even unlock that as a reward.

1319
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So, there's lots of IP infringement going on out there.

1320
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Some of the other things that probably make people pissed off, too.

1321
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Unpublished levels are actually being moderated.

1322
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Weird. How's that possible?

1323
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I don't know, but it says, for example, one user posted a strategy, I guess, for keeping a copy of the level offline,

1324
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and republish it in case it gets deleted.

1325
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It says, but Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting moderated, too.

1326
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I've never been so infuriated over a game, he says.

1327
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Weird. Maybe when you break, maybe it's kind of one of those things where, you know, once a crook always a crook,

1328
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
so if you do it once, they go through and look at your files somehow, and see if you're infringing in the other places.

1329
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't know. That's weird.

1330
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
That is weird.

1331
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
This reader, I guess, on Kotaku, Robbie M, or whatever, he said,

1332
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
so many cases have no questionable content in sight, even ones with humorous, light-hearted violence have been taken down,

1333
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
like the popular Gears of War demon skull level.

1334
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah, but it's Gears of War.

1335
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
It didn't get taken down because of the violence.

1336
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So what's the point of having a community-driven game if you're not going to let your community do anything with it,

1337
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
and act to try to please everybody?

1338
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
The game itself has some pretty controversial, should we say, things in it.

1339
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Like, there's a whole level where you're in the strip club, practically.

1340
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I think we showed it on our little preview show we did a few weeks ago, but I've played it in the real game,

1341
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,000
and, you know, you've got little things dancing on poles, it's no mistaking what it is.

1342
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's interesting.

1343
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Redertainment in Chat says, so I can't keep my penis level safe by keeping it offline.

1344
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I think yes, you can, because I think it's when you go online and then you get caught that these people start to have issues,

1345
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I think is what it is.

1346
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I don't think they can moderate your level if you have a public- that's stupid.

1347
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I don't think so.

1348
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But, you know, and as far as these people bitching and stuff, though, here's the complication.

1349
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
This is what we all subjected to by accepting the end-user license agreement.

1350
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And if you want to be, you know, extra safe, just make backups of your saves.

1351
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I mean, that's really the only thing you can do, and thankfully, the PlayStation 3, it's really easy to do that.

1352
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
In fact, the other thing is you can, you know, download saves online with the PS3,

1353
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
because none of those are linked to your user account.

1354
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You can just go, like, on Game Facts, for example, and download stuff, so maybe you could swap levels that way.

1355
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I don't know.

1356
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I wish you could, because that would be nice, you know, to be able to download levels that are awesome to play.

1357
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Really interesting comment from Chat, from Shahram, saying, but that's not as offensive as Two Men Kissing,

1358
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
going back to that whole- what was that?

1359
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
WhatTheyPlay.com poll we talked about months ago.

1360
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Remember that whole thing where, like, Two Men Kissing was one of the most offensive things?

1361
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
But that had me thinking, boy, if you want to try pushing the envelope in one of your levels,

1362
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:46,000
see if something gets taken down for that, and then that would be interesting, to say the least.

1363
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Interesting, to say the least.

1364
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And make the level called What They Play.

1365
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I would be very curious to see what Sony might have to do when faced with that situation,

1366
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
or, you know, because this has been a topic of controversy lately,

1367
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and I'm sure we'll have to talk about it at some point during tonight's show,

1368
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but there is a level in the actual game that goes around a wedding.

1369
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
You go through three levels that all center around a wedding,

1370
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and a crazy bride going after her drunken groom, which, by the way,

1371
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
is my favorite level in the game so far, is the Skulldozer level, if you've played that.

1372
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It would be very interesting to see what might happen if somebody publishes a level with two grooms.

1373
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'd be very curious to see what happens.

1374
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Anyhow, now I'm getting ideas for my first level.

1375
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There you go.

1376
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Rob Robert's Big Gay Adventure.

1377
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Oh, now I'm feeling inspiration here.

1378
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
We'll see what happens.

1379
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Nothing more inspiring than offending people.

1380
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's not offensive!

1381
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
What's offensive about gayety? Nothing!

1382
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Am I pushing the envelope?

1383
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
No, to other people maybe.

1384
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Maybe.

1385
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Is it offensive? It shouldn't be.

1386
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Anyhow, let's totally forget that that whole level had so many zombies and voodoo crap in it.

1387
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yep, that's South America for you.

1388
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's like, God, man, seriously.

1389
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I've got some ideas, Bruin. We'll see what happens.

1390
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Let's move on, though, to more stories about LittleBigPlanet.

1391
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
You have to be careful with it, because while I can poke fun at myself and all that stuff,

1392
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
there are people out there that would play it and think it's real,

1393
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
so there's a very fine line here you'd have to walk to make it.

1394
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And to anybody who's thinking about stealing my idea,

1395
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
one, I'll cut you.

1396
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Two, be very careful, because you can push the envelope,

1397
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
but just be careful, because there are some people out there who don't know any better, if you know what I mean.

1398
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Now, Rob, how far have you gotten into LittleBigPlanet?

1399
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Well, I've been playing so many custom levels that in story I've only gotten as far as the,

1400
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I just beat the boss, well, I don't want to spoil it, but I just got past Mexico.

1401
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Just past Mexico? Okay, so you haven't gotten to the flamethrowing cat?

1402
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
No.

1403
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Oh, I want a flamethrowing cat.

1404
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Alright, anyhow.

1405
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Speaking of LittleBigPlanet and copyright infringement and all this crazy stuff,

1406
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Media Molecule on their developer site, they're actually showing screenshots of an image import tool,

1407
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
so pretty soon you're going to be able to import images from your hard drive on the PlayStation 3 into LittleBigPlanet.

1408
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Making it even easier to...

1409
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Even easier to infringe on copyrights galore, but you could also put in pictures of yourself,

1410
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
or if one commercial that they're actually airing over in the UK, which I saw on the 3Speech blog,

1411
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
you can actually put pictures of your family in the game.

1412
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
You can actually see this in one of the commercials.

1413
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But, who do you believe, because the developer also has come out this week and said,

1414
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
even though it's on their blog, a representative for Media Molecule said on the forums,

1415
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:57,000
image importing is technically viable, but there are no plans to introduce it for a variety of reasons.

1416
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But here's the thing.

1417
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
If people want to get their images in the game, they're already doing it.

1418
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
How? By printing it out and holding it in front of the camera.

1419
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
That's what Bobby did in his level, and also in some other levels I've seen out there.

1420
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
There's one level I played.

1421
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I unlocked stickers with pictures of Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood things from the 60s and 70s

1422
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that somebody obviously just held the video box in front of the camera and took a picture of it,

1423
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
which is copyright infringement, but it's how people are getting their pictures in anyway.

1424
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So, why not make it easier?

1425
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And as Retertainment says, of course, somebody in chat had to say it, importing porn.

1426
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Little big porn, says Zach Deft.

1427
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I don't know if Sony knew the can of worms they were ready to open here,

1428
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
but very interesting to see what happens.

1429
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You know, I think though, what they ought to do, in my opinion, what they ought to do is they ought to set a threshold.

1430
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And if so many people report the game, the game should disappear from the globe and probably search results as well.

1431
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Like, it goes to the bottom of the list, so that people just don't find it.

1432
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
But I don't know about this whole crazy going onto your hard drive and deleting everything and slapping you on the list.

1433
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I have a problem with them moderating stuff that's on your system, because that's your stuff.

1434
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
If I want to make a Batman level, I should be able to make a Batman level for myself or to show it to my friends.

1435
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Now, I do have a problem with them taking it offline, because if it's obviously violating copyrights or whatever,

1436
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
they don't want to get in trouble with anybody else. That's fine. They should be able to do that.

1437
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:41,000
But, at the same time, I feel that I should be able to send the level to a friend over their online service.

1438
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I don't see any harm in that, but I'm sure they'll find reasons not to.

1439
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Or a way to be able to swap them offline or something like that.

1440
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
So, you guys can share that, but we don't want to hear about it type of thing.

1441
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I just think they're going to have a problem policing it all.

1442
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
This game has the potential to get so big, if it isn't already.

1443
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And it's not like building these levels is that easy.

1444
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I mean, the creator can get pretty involved.

1445
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I don't want to make it sound like you can't do it, but it takes a little time and thinking to build the level.

1446
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I mean, it's as easy as it can get, considering how intricate your levels can get.

1447
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
But, you know, if they just delete your level, that's a lot of time.

1448
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I think Bobby said on his show tonight when I was listening, it took him like eight hours to build that level.

1449
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Which, with all due respect to the level and the fun I had playing it,

1450
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
was not nearly as complex as some of the things I've seen on LittleBigPlanet so far.

1451
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Yeah.

1452
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Because he used the basic artwork.

1453
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I mean, he built his own little unique car thing, and used the iToy to get some of the all-game stuff in there, which is pretty awesome.

1454
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Wait until you get to some of the later levels there, Rob.

1455
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I mean, you're going to see some pretty cool stuff that they've done with it.

1456
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Like there's one where you have a hot air balloon that you can control.

1457
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It's like nuts.

1458
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Interesting.

1459
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

1460
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
We've got so much more news to get to.

1461
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Speaking of innovative things, Sony has actually patented a brand new controller system.

1462
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's basically using a hybrid video capture and ultrasonic tracking system.

1463
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
What they're kind of doing is creating these things that look almost like they could be like Wii remotes.

1464
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And the way it's done, it's all done with the PlayStation Eye.

1465
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Because the PlayStation Eye has four microphones built into it.

1466
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Actually, I don't know why it has four microphones built into it.

1467
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Maybe for such a thing.

1468
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But the way they're going to do it is the camera will track the X and Y movements.

1469
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Whereas the ultrasonic part of it will detect how far away the controller is from the camera.

1470
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So that will control the Z axis.

1471
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
So with that, you could have a 3D controller much like the Wii remote is.

1472
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Which is kind of neat.

1473
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And that would be the way to integrate it, I guess, now with the current technology that they have on the system.

1474
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Hmm.

1475
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So maybe sometime soon, maybe we'll see a new controller or something.

1476
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Do you think this is something for Sony's next system?

1477
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Or do you think this is something Sony wants to implement with their current one?

1478
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I think it's their current one because on the actual patent, it says PS3 on it.

1479
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And it's showing the Wi-Fi and the PlayStation Eye camera and stuff like that.

1480
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Hmm.

1481
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I mean, it makes sense if they want to expand out.

1482
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Because right now, I think the only thing they're lacking right now is good family games.

1483
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I mean, they do have LittleBigPlanet, but there's nothing that's really like get in and just play.

1484
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Even the Xbox 360 doesn't have a lot of stuff.

1485
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
They have a little bit more than Sony.

1486
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
But I mean, the Wii's got to be big time with casual, more family friendly just play type of stuff.

1487
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
You know, like tennis or something.

1488
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Is it the same thing as this that I have on my monitor here right now?

1489
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
No.

1490
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Okay.

1491
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Alright, I look like a sex toy.

1492
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:00,000
No, it's something that was posted in chat there saying it was a hoax, this other one.

1493
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I just want to make sure it wasn't the same thing you were talking about, but it's something completely different.

1494
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
No.

1495
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Alright, something else completely different from Sony games and LittleBigPlanet.

1496
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Sega!

1497
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Who doesn't love Sega, right DarkSakura?

1498
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Sony.

1499
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But here's...

1500
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, Sega makes games for Sony now, so I would hope they like them now.

1501
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But, you know, the thing about Sega is, boy, do they know how to whore their 16-bit nostalgia.

1502
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And guess what?

1503
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
They're going to whore it all over again.

1504
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Sega has announced this week the Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection.

1505
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It's 40 titles that were on the Genesis for next gen systems.

1506
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This is a $30 game coming out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1507
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It's 40 titles, everything from Alex Kidd and the Enchanted Castle to Vectorman 2 and everything in between,

1508
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:01,000
including Golden Axe, all three of them, Fantasy Star 2, 3, and 4, Kidd Chameleon, Echo One, Echo Two,

1509
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Shinobi 3, Sonic, Sonic, Sonic, Streets of Rage, pretty much all your...

1510
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I think Spinball is in there, too.

1511
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Was Sonic Spinball in there?

1512
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Yes, it was.

1513
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
All your definitive Sega Genesis games are in this collection, pretty much, that were first party.

1514
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
They're going to be releasing in Spring 2009.

1515
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
But here's the interesting thing.

1516
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
You might be thinking, well, why am I going to buy this shit all over again?

1517
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Because it seems like they're always releasing Sonic.

1518
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
They've released it as a download.

1519
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Here's the thing.

1520
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
It's going to output in 720p.

1521
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And that's the big thing that's making people's eyebrows go, really?

1522
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
720p for my Genesis game.

1523
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, that doesn't mean they went back and redid all the graphics.

1524
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But just kind of an interesting little addition.

1525
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It seems like it's a little more than just a Genesis emulator.

1526
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Does that make sense?

1527
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yeah, I think they're going to do it kind of similar to how the Sonic games are,

1528
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,000
where you can set it so that the edges are smoothed out, I guess, a little bit, and it's kind of blurry.

1529
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Or you can just do it where it just scales everything up, and it's not necessarily blurry or smooth.

1530
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's just larger pixels, I guess.

1531
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Now add in the whole achievement and trophy whoring into the mix,

1532
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
and I think a lot of folks are going to have fun with this.

1533
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Because if they're releasing this for 360, 360 games have to have achievements, right?

1534
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yes.

1535
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It's part of the mandate.

1536
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Now, PlayStation 3 games don't have to have trophies,

1537
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
but you assume at this point if they're going to go to trouble to put the achievements in there,

1538
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
they might as well do the trophies.

1539
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So these games, these 40 games, that's going to be 40 achievements probably for beating all 40 games.

1540
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It's going to be interesting for the achievement horse.

1541
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And, you know, what's funny is there's no Wii version, which makes sense because...

1542
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Well, they can't do 720p.

1543
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Also, virtual console.

1544
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yes, exactly.

1545
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So, hmm, I could pay $8 a pop for the old games, or I could pay $30 for 40.

1546
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That means, like, 75 cents a game.

1547
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
$8, 75 cents.

1548
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Granted, I get to pick them at $8 a pop.

1549
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I get 40 of the pretty good ones at 75 cents a pop.

1550
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Hmm, interesting.

1551
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Frisbee in chat says, who in the freaking hell cares about achievements that much?

1552
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
He'd be surprised.

1553
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
He would be surprised.

1554
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Alright, let's move on.

1555
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Remember, they also have the Namco collection that came out last week as well.

1556
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
True statement.

1557
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And that's supposed to be pretty nice, too.

1558
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
They have, like, 30-some games in there as well.

1559
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So, nice.

1560
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Alright, well, with the brand new DSi system out in Japan, of course, you know,

1561
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
it's about this time that they need to announce some more WarioWare games.

1562
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And not to be su- no, not too surprising that they're going to actually have some WarioWare games.

1563
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Now, I'm not sure if these are actually going to be downloadable games,

1564
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
because it sort of sounds like they might be.

1565
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
One of the games they have is called WarioWare Myself.

1566
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And I guess it's supposedly some sort of game where you can actually use user-created content as well.

1567
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Players will be able to reportedly create their own frantic minigames and share them with others.

1568
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
So that kind of sounds cool.

1569
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
There's also talks of, like, a WiiWare application that allows these creations to be played,

1570
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
though not designed on the Wii.

1571
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So now that'd be pretty awesome.

1572
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:33,000
The DSi is getting a WarioWare photograph that's a camera-enabled gesture-based game,

1573
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
as well as several WarioWare minigames that'll be available to download on the system's online store.

1574
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So that's very interesting that they're going to go that route and actually offer each game individually.

1575
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I don't know.

1576
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Interesting.

1577
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Well, but I do love me some WarioWare, so they're always pretty innovative with what they do,

1578
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
with whatever new piece of thing.

1579
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I think WarioWare Myself sounds pretty awesome.

1580
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That'd be very interesting.

1581
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Well, hey, you know what else sounds awesome?

1582
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
A remake of Press Your Luck.

1583
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And I'm not talking about that shatacious show on Game Show Network, Whammy.

1584
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm talking old-school 80s Press Your Luck.

1585
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
You remember this game show? It was one of the best.

1586
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Oh, hell yeah!

1587
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
No Whammies! No Whammies! Stop!

1588
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
You remember that whole thing?

1589
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I remember the guy who memorized the screens with all that money.

1590
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Yeah, they did a whole little thing on Game Show Network about him,

1591
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and sadly I missed it, which kind of sucks.

1592
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
But, you know, they had this whole thing,

1593
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:39,000
and apparently they are actually going to be making new computer games for Press Your Luck.

1594
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And it's the same people that did the new Price is Right game.

1595
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And it's not just for PC.

1596
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's going to be coming for iPods, iPhones, and apparently, consoles.

1597
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
So the people that got the Price is Right,

1598
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
now unfortunately I haven't played the Price is Right game,

1599
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
so I don't know if it's any good or not,

1600
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
but what's kind of exciting about it is that it's got, you know,

1601
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
if it's a new game, it's going to have new Whammy animations and all that fun stuff.

1602
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
This is going to be an awesome party game.

1603
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It has to have the music, the sound, wah wah.

1604
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I used to have the actual theme song somewhere around here.

1605
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I'm trying to dig for it right now.

1606
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
But man, Press Your Luck was awesome.

1607
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I should have more games that are like game show based,

1608
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
because I think that'd be fun.

1609
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Everyone likes watching game shows.

1610
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I actually have them like, so that they're literally a half an hour long or something like that.

1611
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Well isn't that what they're kind of trying to do with the whole Xbox,

1612
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
the new thing they're doing on Xbox?

1613
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I forget what they officially call it, but as part of the NXC, you know what I'm talking about, right?

1614
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1615
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So yeah, I know exactly. Who doesn't love game shows?

1616
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Game shows are awesome.

1617
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Exactly.

1618
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
There you go.

1619
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Something not so awesome though is two class action lawsuits.

1620
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Both of these of course have to do with the whole digital rights management

1621
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
that EA sort of secretly slipped in there on a few games.

1622
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Although you'd be surprised though, Spore is not one of the games that's mentioned in the lawsuits.

1623
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The trial version of Spore Creature Creator was, and the full version of The Sims.

1624
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Apparently they say that it constitutes unlawful and deceptive business practices.

1625
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And both suits, I guess, seek class action status.

1626
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And I guess there was also a third lawsuit that was filed back in September for the digital rights management for Spore.

1627
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And, you know, interesting.

1628
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
The first suit, I guess, says it was lodged by a Pennsylvania man who installed the Spore trial.

1629
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It says that the installation of DRM on a freely distributed program constitute a major violation of the computer's owners' absolute right to control what does and what does not get loaded onto their computers and how their computers shall be used.

1630
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I mean, that kind of is like spyware.

1631
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And it says apparently the trial made no mention of any technical protection measures, digital rights management, or secure arm whatsoever.

1632
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:15,000
And then the second suit was filed from a woman in Missouri saying that after installing the DRM protected The Sims 2 Bon Voyage, she began experiencing problems with her PC.

1633
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Backup CDs with Sims 2 game content were no longer recognized by her computer.

1634
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Neither were files saved on her USB drive or the iPod.

1635
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:39,000
She rid herself of the DRM and the problems only by reformatting her PC and she accuses EA of engaging in unfair business practices as well as conducting immoral, unethical, and oppressive, and unscrupulous behavior.

1636
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So, in other words, EA got sued over secure arm. Nobody's surprised.

1637
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But is it going to hold up? What do you think?

1638
01:27:47,000 --> 01:28:06,000
If they came out and disclosed that secure arm was in there, and if they made sure that there weren't any side effects, that it interferes with your CD burning software or whatever, then I don't think people have a problem.

1639
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Because it should be displayed on the box saying that this contains this, if you install this, this is what's going to happen.

1640
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,000
If they don't say that it's in there and it just installs without telling anybody anything, I don't think that's right.

1641
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Especially on these demos. That's the real tricky part. I mean, if you buy the game...

1642
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Well, who cares? It's a demo. I don't understand, you know. I don't get it.

1643
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens.

1644
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Well, we're going to get to tonight's mailbag, but I thought tonight maybe DarkSakura's taking a break from the mailbag because she wasn't even supposed to be here until part B.

1645
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I thought maybe we could change up the theme a little bit for tonight's mailbag.

1646
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
There you go.

1647
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Oh my god, that spore level is so getting pulled off there.

1648
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
What? There's a spore level now?

1649
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That'd be funny. They should do that.

1650
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Hold on, we need to continue the theme music here for tonight's mailbag.

1651
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Alright, I could go on and on. Apparently tonight's...

1652
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I love that sound.

1653
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah, that's the best sound ever.

1654
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I'll have to get that for the show. We can use that a little later on.

1655
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Anyhow, I think the whammies hit our mailbag this week because there's not a lot available in tonight's mailbag.

1656
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
But if you want to send us an email, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to do it.

1657
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
We do have a few emails we'll get into, starting off with an email about LittleBigPlanet from RobWithTwoBees.

1658
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I think Jamie will appreciate this a lot.

1659
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
This article has a video of a Gradius level in LittleBigPlanet.

1660
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I wonder if it's accessible on American servers.

1661
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
To answer your question, yes it is.

1662
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
In fact, it's on page one right now of the American servers of the favorite levels.

1663
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And it's not exact like Gradius, but they did a pretty darn good job with the remake there.

1664
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Now obviously we've already talked about these remakes earlier in the show,

1665
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
but I wanted to mention this from Rob's email that's pretty awesome.

1666
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
The quote here at the end.

1667
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:39,000
This just goes to show you, sometimes the best way to make something behave differently is to circumvent the pre-programmed behavior.

1668
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Interesting.

1669
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
An email from, well it's not signed.

1670
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It was something forwarded to us from the BBC News website from NIJ.

1671
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
We'll leave it at that.

1672
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Sent us something this, but I thought this was an interesting story.

1673
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Gamers dressing up as their favorite hero for a record.

1674
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And this is a story from the official BBC website from the 26th of October.

1675
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So it looks like the same day as our last show.

1676
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But apparently it was like this giant, like, cosplay record type thing.

1677
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
342 people posed.

1678
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Final Fantasy, Zelda, so on.

1679
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Part of the London Games Festival.

1680
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And the funny thing is, they were out there to top the record of.337 set the week before in Germany.

1681
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Who knew that World War III would be fought with cosplay?

1682
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Who knew?

1683
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But there you go.

1684
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
A whole little article there on the BBC website if you want to see it.

1685
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh yeah, are you looking at the video of the level that Rob sent?

1686
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, well not the one that he sent, I just happened to find one on YouTube.

1687
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And you can get that in LittleBigPlanet still right now.

1688
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
That's fantastic.

1689
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I don't know if we learned this.

1690
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Can you actually save levels from online to like your planet and stuff?

1691
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I believe the phone call we had with Bobby at the end of the show, he was telling us that there's an option you can.

1692
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
God, I hope so.

1693
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I need to go save that one.

1694
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Alright, anyhow, we got another email here, one last email.

1695
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
It's a little bit lengthy, but that's alright since we didn't have a whole lot of emails tonight.

1696
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
And it's from Spaznator.

1697
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Hi folks, I'm sending you this within a few minutes of finishing watching episode 300 live on Justin TV.

1698
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
This is the first time I saw OLR on Justin TV live rather than listening on my PSP.

1699
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I would have called in, but unfortunately I could not get through tonight.

1700
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Oh well, as they say, shit happens.

1701
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Firstly, I'd like to relay to you a now belated happy 300th episode.

1702
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It was a pretty good show.

1703
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I particularly liked the Justin TV feed.

1704
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Perhaps I'll listen and watch that way from now on rather than the all games radio feed on shoutcast on my PSP.

1705
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Well, now our all games friends wouldn't like that very much.

1706
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You should do both. Ideally you do both.

1707
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
You turn on the Justin TV and mute it and then listen on the all games feed.

1708
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Because the Justin TV unfortunately has shitty audio.

1709
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
One of these days we'll fix it, I promise, but for right now.

1710
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Secondly to Rob, congrats on getting yourself a Playstation 3.

1711
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Welcome to the dark side.

1712
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Just out of sheer, stupid curiosity, what model did you end up getting?

1713
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I know that ideally the 60GB is the best to get, but they're impossible to find new and even a used one is a pain in the arse to find.

1714
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And you're right.

1715
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It was kind of one of those things where beggars can't be choosers.

1716
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I just bought the 80GB, the new one.

1717
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And it doesn't play Playstation 2 games, which does suck, but at least I have a Playstation 2.

1718
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And it does play Blu-rays and all that stuff.

1719
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Whoa. Hello. Hey. No, we're not ready for one gun music yet.

1720
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
That's our break music tonight.

1721
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Anyway, speaking of Playstation 3 and whatnot, I'd like to put something out there for you and the other listeners.

1722
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Mind you, this is not fact, merely speculation with a certain amount of logic supporting this.

1723
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And it may or may not be proven wrong by the time you're out with episode 301.

1724
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I'm speculating that Playstation 3's home will most likely be out by no later than November 19th.

1725
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
The reasoning behind this is simple.

1726
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,000
On November 19th, Microsoft, as we all know, is releasing the NXT, the new Xbox experience,

1727
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
which includes, among other things, avatars, a revamped menu interface, Netflix support, and so on.

1728
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
If Sony is smart and wants to stay competitive as well as not lose any more ground to the 360,

1729
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
they'll have home out by then.

1730
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Like I said, this is just speculation on my end, and I have no inside sources or anything.

1731
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I'm just trying to invoke logic into this and look at it from a business point of view.

1732
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I may be proven wrong on this.

1733
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I've never been wrong in my life, but I suppose in theory it could conceivably happen.

1734
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Before I close my email, I'd just like to add that if you'd like,

1735
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
you can send me your friend request on Playstation Network.

1736
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
As my Xbox Live gamertag suggests, my Playstation Network handle is Spazinator.

1737
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
You'll often find me on LittleBigPlanet.

1738
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Currently, I'm making a level with flaming boobs and electric nipples.

1739
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Well, that won't get pulled or anything.

1740
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
There you go, an email from Spazinator.

1741
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
The Gradius level is well done.

1742
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It's fucking fantastic, isn't it?

1743
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I think after the show, I think we should run in the house and download the level before it's gone.

1744
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Who knows? It might be gone in a couple hours because it was on page one.

1745
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But then again, it is Sunday.

1746
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But not in Europe. Shit.

1747
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's going to be Monday morning.

1748
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I just found LittleBigMacross.

1749
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Well, you're assuming that it's Media Monocle doing this stuff.

1750
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I think it might actually be Sony.

1751
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Interesting.

1752
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You're right, I am assuming that.

1753
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I don't know.

1754
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
All right.

1755
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Well, we have a little more news to get to.

1756
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
If you want to get your emails in for next week, Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com is the place to send those emails.

1757
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:22,000
As far as that previous email and the whole release date, you know,

1758
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I'm sure it's one of those things where Sony would like to do it, but they're really going to try to not release something that's broken.

1759
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So if it's broken, they're going to take the time to fix it.

1760
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
That's what they've been doing for the past year and a half.

1761
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So, you know, if they could one-up Microsoft by making their thing better, they'll wait.

1762
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
But they'll have it out by Christmas.

1763
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Which doesn't leave a lot of time, because I would think they'd want to have the buzz starting right before, you know, the Thanksgiving rush.

1764
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But I don't work for Sony.

1765
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I don't know what they think sometimes.

1766
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
We'll see.

1767
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
That's awesome. I was watching a video.

1768
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
They have SAC to the future.

1769
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I'm sure that level got pulled off.

1770
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Oh, this is sweet.

1771
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I'm telling you, Jimmy, best game I've played in years.

1772
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I'm looking at the Macross level.

1773
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
It's an amazing game. Amazing.

1774
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So anyways, something that's come actually a trend and is now actually happening with almost every single PS3 game that comes out.

1775
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
You know, installs.

1776
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Well, now they have an...

1777
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
No, it is an optional install, but it is an install nonetheless.

1778
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Final Fantasy Dissida, or whatever, on the PSP now has a data install option that will allow you to install a portion of the game onto your memory unit so that you can load faster.

1779
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
That's kind of interesting that they have the memory stick install function on there.

1780
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Interesting that they're admitting the load times are going to suck.

1781
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Well, that too.

1782
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I don't know.

1783
01:36:50,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And it says they have different install options. You can take as little as 245 megabytes and as much as 528 megabytes.

1784
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Alright.

1785
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So, very interesting.

1786
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Indeed, very interesting.

1787
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Or just overclock your system with a custom firmware.

1788
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
That's my option.

1789
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Alright, or just run the whole game off of a memory stick.

1790
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Retertainment asks a good question in chat. Does this further facilitate piracy? I don't think so.

1791
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It's so rampant anyways.

1792
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And you're not installing the whole game to the memory card.

1793
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And besides, they're going to start offering their first party games as downloads anyways.

1794
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
True.

1795
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Very true.

1796
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Alright, well we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back though. There's plenty more to come in Part B.

1797
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,000
We're going to talk the latest in gaming news and we're finally going to talk about where Jamie was at at the start of the next episode.

1798
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Not episode, the start of the next segment.

1799
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
We.

1800
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So, alright.

1801
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1802
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio for this Part B of our podcast.

1803
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We're taping live on November 9th, 2008.

1804
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And Dark Sakura joined us in the middle of Part A.

1805
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And we want to talk about something.

1806
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I hate to kind of get away from the topic of games for a minute, but remember that Orange Lounge Radio was-

1807
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Oh shit, we always talk about leather stuff.

1808
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
If we can talk about sandwiches and check food, we can talk about this too.

1809
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Because it's a topic that's come up on our show before.

1810
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And, you know, Orange Lounge Radio started with this whole concept of, it was kind of inspired by two different things.

1811
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It was inspired by the previous show I was on before, Understation Live, which is obviously, as you know, still kicking on the All Games Network in its new form.

1812
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And also in part from the conversations that we would have after a long night of DDR at the restaurant that was in the arcade parking lot practically.

1813
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
You know, just kind of the topics that would come up, games and other things.

1814
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So, obviously one thing that's been on my mind weighing a little heavy this week is Proposition 8.

1815
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Which is, you know, we did great things in this country this week.

1816
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:24,000
No matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, you know, just the fact that we have elected a president that I think 40 years ago no one would have ever imagined would have been the type of person this nation would elect is really outstanding.

1817
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And, you know, I thought McCain was very gracious in his speech.

1818
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
And it's really great things are going to happen here in America, I think, on that front.

1819
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:42,000
But it was really hard to kind of watch all that go on and see people celebrating and say the civil rights glass ceilings have been shattered and so on and so on.

1820
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
And then to watch Proposition 8 pass by four points, 52 to 48.

1821
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And if you're not familiar with Proposition 8 and you've been listening to this show, you know, Proposition 8 took away the right here in America, not America, sorry, in California of same-sex couples to marry.

1822
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And what makes this different from the similar propositions in Arizona, Florida, and the other states that have all passed laws like this is that this time in California you took something away by passing Proposition 8.

1823
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Gay couples were allowed to marry in this state from period of June till now.

1824
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And you took that away by passing Proposition 8.

1825
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And it's been difficult for me, you know, as an openly gay gamer here on this show, which, you know, obviously that topic comes up once in a while.

1826
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And I'm pretty sure I gave a pretty angry rant about it in previous episodes.

1827
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So I've just been kind of trying to think about it.

1828
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
That's one other thing that's kind of been weighing on my mind this time that we've had off here.

1829
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And what really surprised me in a very positive way was a lot of the emails that I got from listeners.

1830
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And it was not just one, I'm talking several emails from listeners that were kind of like apologizing even though it's not their fault.

1831
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And I got a really interesting message from somebody on Facebook from a friend who was apologizing because it was their fault.

1832
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And, I don't know, I have a lot to think about about this whole thing.

1833
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And it's disappointing, obviously, because my question to those out there is, what are you so afraid of?

1834
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
What is the big deal?

1835
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
If people you don't even know, aren't required to associate with, get married.

1836
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And don't give me this crap that civil unions are the same thing as marriage, that is not true.

1837
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I'll give you one example of how they're different and one's enough.

1838
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:54,000
In a civil union, if I pass away, my partner would not be able to stake legal claims to my possessions before my immediate relatives.

1839
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:00,000
If I'm estranged from my relatives, which one of my relatives in my family I'm estranged from,

1840
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and unfortunately because people are afraid of gayness for whatever reason, they're estranged in their own families,

1841
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
that could be a real issue in a lot of families.

1842
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
So there's one, one's enough, there's a difference.

1843
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
There's more than just the one, but one's enough.

1844
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
So it's not the same thing as civil unions.

1845
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
You're not protected, all this BS.

1846
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And then, you know, how did Proposition 8, how did these people win the campaign?

1847
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
By using children and this whole schools thing.

1848
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
If we don't pass this proposition, they're going to teach it in schools.

1849
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Logic tells you they were lying.

1850
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Here's the logic.

1851
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Gay marriage was already legal.

1852
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
So if what they were saying is true, they would already be teaching it in schools.

1853
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
And here's my other question.

1854
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
So what?

1855
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
If they teach it in schools, so what?

1856
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I know that might strike a lot of people a little weird,

1857
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
but when it's appropriate to talk about marriage and relationship,

1858
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
do you think they're not going to hear it anyway?

1859
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Trust me, folks, these kids are going to hear it.

1860
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I got called a fag for 18 years growing up.

1861
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That was the hardest part for me to come out of the closet,

1862
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
was having to admit that all these assholes who gave me such a hard time

1863
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
in very difficult parts of my life were right.

1864
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And do you think it's something I chose?

1865
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I mean, God, that's something that pisses me off more than anything,

1866
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
is hearing this whole being gay is a choice.

1867
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I assure you, I am not being paid off by anybody to say this.

1868
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It was not a choice.

1869
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
This is the way I was born.

1870
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:43,000
This is the way God, Mother Nature, whatever you believe in, made me.

1871
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So I ask again, what are these people so afraid of?

1872
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
DarkSakura, where were you today?

1873
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I was at the Repeal Proposition 8 rally on the Capitol steps,

1874
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
and it was amazing.

1875
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
What kind of things were going on?

1876
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
There were just a lot of speakers.

1877
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I actually was in a place where it was very difficult to hear anybody

1878
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
until I got closer.

1879
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:16,000
One of my good friends, Becky, her choir sang on the steps during the rally.

1880
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
They were all very good.

1881
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
There were a couple speakers there.

1882
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
One of them was a school commissioner.

1883
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
She was there with her family, and they managed to get in

1884
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
right before they weren't doing any more weddings.

1885
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So she was there with her family.

1886
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,000
A big thing that she said is there's not going to be any teaching

1887
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
of gay marriage in school because we don't teach marriage in school.

1888
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
If the superintendent is on my television saying they don't have to teach it

1889
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
in schools, I don't know. I believe them.

1890
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Well, another one.

1891
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I forgot what she did in San Francisco, but one of the elected officials there.

1892
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:10,000
She was just saying that she gave this really great speech

1893
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
just talking about going into debates against the Mormon representatives,

1894
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
and that was pretty crazy to hear about.

1895
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
There was just a lot of really good energy there today.

1896
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Everybody was on the same page, it seemed.

1897
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'll tell you what else was really kind of interesting is how many people were.

1898
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:39,000
This is an idea that I've been working on with some friends of mine.

1899
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
We're saying that it was basically a popularity contest, a simple majority.

1900
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
This has been said for the past, at least as long as I've been in California,

1901
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
and I don't see anyone really offering anything about it,

1902
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
that any amendment to our Constitution basically only takes a simple majority

1903
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
when our budget takes a two-thirds majority.

1904
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You know Prop 2 passed, right?

1905
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Yeah, the chicken thing.

1906
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
If chickens have more rights than people, what does that say?

1907
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I don't want to belittle Prop 2 because it was important in its own way.

1908
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Prop 2 is a waste of money.

1909
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It's a funny contradiction, you know what I mean?

1910
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Well, Prop 2 is also a massive waste of money.

1911
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I'm sorry for being so political, but damn it, I've put in six and a half years on this show.

1912
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I can take ten minutes to get political.

1913
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm so angry mostly at the people who shed tears for civil rights being broken in this country on one hand,

1914
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,000
and then on the other hand, deny me something I might want someday.

1915
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
You think some people would know better.

1916
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It's just disgusting.

1917
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And you can say this whole, well, can't the majority talk?

1918
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Is this the way it's going to be?

1919
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
No, because you know what?

1920
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
The majority isn't always right, and that's what's happened in the past.

1921
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
What we've seen happen in the past is that...

1922
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
The majority is uninformed and lied to.

1923
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
That's why we have the Supreme Court and the courts in California

1924
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
to point out the flaws of the majority when they're wrong.

1925
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
But what this has really done for this community,

1926
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and I'm not talking just the gay community,

1927
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I'm talking the people who are not going to stand up for treating people differently community,

1928
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
is it's really mobilized it.

1929
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And I think in a way, especially on the tail end of what you see happening with the whole Obama,

1930
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
yes we can, rah rah rah, I think you're really going to see a movement happen here.

1931
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
But as one email said that I got and that I tend to agree with just in general things I say,

1932
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I think this is an issue destined for the Supreme Court eventually anyway.

1933
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I just hope they're on the right side.

1934
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
History says they will be, but I don't know, maybe the pessimist in me starts to worry.

1935
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
But what can we do? What do I bring it up?

1936
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Why do I bring it up on this program related to video games?

1937
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Well folks, you've been on Xbox Live, you've been on these things,

1938
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
you've heard gay, gay, gay, fag, fag, fag.

1939
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
This week, 48 hours ago, I am not making this up, on World of Warcraft,

1940
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I ganked some level 3 gnome who is flagged outside of Orgrimmar,

1941
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
why you would flag yourself on a PvE server when you're level 3, you're just begging for it.

1942
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I ganked him right outside of Orgrimmar, he signed onto his Horde character,

1943
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and said, what's your problem, fag?

1944
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So this is an issue that kind of goes into video games, because you know what?

1945
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:49,000
When that shit happens, gay, straight, black, white, brown, Martian,

1946
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I don't give a shit who you are, stop it.

1947
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
There is nothing to be afraid of, and when you say that stuff,

1948
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,000
you're trying to throw it out there that somehow you're belittling it, it's different.

1949
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Because this is where this all stems from.

1950
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
You deny gays the right to marry because you're afraid of people who are different.

1951
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
So just knock it off.

1952
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And I guess that's all I have to say.

1953
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Well, it's ridiculous anyway.

1954
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Alright, but when the real world sucks, we turn to video games to escape,

1955
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
and go to a happier place where I rule things, like in populace, yeah.

1956
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
One more politically?

1957
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Sure, sure, sure.

1958
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Fuck you, majority voters of Arkansas.

1959
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That's a whole other issue that, oh my god, I could spend another episode on that.

1960
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That earned its own F.U. too.

1961
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Say what?

1962
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
You know what happened in Arkansas?

1963
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Only married couples can adopt.

1964
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And because gay people can't get married, they can't adopt.

1965
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
But what about, I don't know, what about-

1966
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
How many more children does that put into the system?

1967
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
They can't even foster children.

1968
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It's not just adoption.

1969
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Grandma wants to adopt the kids because the parents died,

1970
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and grandma's husband died.

1971
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
It makes no sense. It's so flawed.

1972
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
This all spurns from people's-

1973
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,000
It's ignorance and stupidity and hate and people just need to learn to shut up.

1974
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And I hope the listeners of the show are smarter than that.

1975
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
One would hope.

1976
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
But I got an email this week telling me maybe not.

1977
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
So I think a lot of people have a lot of thinking to do.

1978
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:44,000
But I am not going to stand by and let you take my rights away.

1979
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Because that's what you did this week.

1980
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Back to video games.

1981
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Alright.

1982
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Activision has taken away some songs that people have put up on Guitar Hero World Tour's servers.

1983
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:06,000
The GH-Toon service that they have available basically, of course, is not a big surprise.

1984
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:14,000
It's stuff that's sort of copyrighted Zelda tracks, Mario themed stuff.

1985
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So basically those have come offline as well as any other tracks that sort of sound like mainstream songs and that kind of thing.

1986
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
So they only want your original stuff on there.

1987
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,000
And they're going to promise to delete any copyright unfriendly material.

1988
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I've heard that this track editor thing in Guitar Hero is kind of a bitch to use, too.

1989
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:54,000
So, again, just like LittleBigPlanet, we have a case where we have a lot of people that put in a lot of time into this stuff to copy something else that's out there, I guess.

1990
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
To emulate it or what have you.

1991
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Only to end up having it deleted.

1992
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
So are people kind of getting pissed off about it?

1993
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yeah, people aren't too happy about it.

1994
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:09,000
And one of the things though, at least with this, is you can download those tracks and then save them to your system.

1995
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So if you happen to have gotten one of these songs, better not delete it because you're not going to be able to get it again.

1996
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Unless someone else throws it up there.

1997
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:22,000
But maybe, I don't know, you should throw it up there and not name it Zelda theme or something like that.

1998
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
That would not have been a good idea.

1999
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So, I don't know.

2000
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Pretty soon, if it expands to stay there, it's going to be really hard to monitor it.

2001
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Out of curiosity, and sorry, I'm being distracted by all the chat stemming from the last ten minutes of the show in chat room right now.

2002
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
So sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now.

2003
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But has there been any really good original works to come out of this, too?

2004
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
All I hear about, at least in LittleBigPlanet, I've heard something about there's these really good original levels, too.

2005
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
But I haven't heard so much about it in Guitar Hero.

2006
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I haven't heard a lot about the original songs to come out of it.

2007
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I wonder if there's bands out there that are putting...

2008
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Here's what I'd be curious about. A little indie band, the type that's trying to publicize through MySpace,

2009
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
putting their own song in Guitar Hero, if it's even possible.

2010
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I don't know to what extent you can even do it.

2011
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But would that be okay?

2012
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I'm sure it'd be okay if it's like that, because it's their own stuff.

2013
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
And probably if they're in a little indie band like that anyways.

2014
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I'm sure Activision or whomever has not heard of them and wouldn't even know that it's copyright material.

2015
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And Bobby's in chat right now and says,

2016
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Most people who write original songs gave up on the stupid Music Creator mode like me.

2017
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Yeah, and we're going to get into some other stuff about the Music Creator mode and the Guitar Hero tunes thing and stuff.

2018
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
It just sounds less and less appealing as time goes on.

2019
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Alright, let's talk about Rock Band, the other music game that's still out there, still kicking and still releasing new expansions.

2020
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And there is a download pack coming out very soon.

2021
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It's the Foo Fighters Color and the Shape album.

2022
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
And you know the song Everlong is from that album. It's already in the game.

2023
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
And it's a lot of fun to play, even if it's a bitch.

2024
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But there's some other great songs that are going to be available as a part of this.

2025
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Monkey Wrench, I believe, was one of the singles there.

2026
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
My Hero, of course, is another big song from that album.

2027
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
So the Color and the Shape, definitely a landmark album by the Foo Fighters, is the next release.

2028
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Also, just wanted to say real quick, apparently some of the free Rock Band songs have started to hit as well.

2029
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Yes, I downloaded those. I haven't played any of them by downloading them.

2030
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I still haven't even redeemed my dang code.

2031
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
That's awesome.

2032
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,000
My friend has been playing my copy of Rock Band 2. Our band now is in the top 500.

2033
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Interesting. Wow.

2034
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
That's awesome for me not playing the game at all.

2035
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Dang, he must be really good.

2036
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
He is really good.

2037
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
That's cool. Good for him.

2038
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I distracted him, though. I got a free copy of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, so he's been playing that.

2039
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I need to go back to Xbox, though, and go back to Rock Band for one reason.

2040
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And it's the reason we talked about two weeks ago.

2041
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I still haven't gotten my Susie and the Banshee songs.

2042
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Here's the thing.

2043
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I really need to do that.

2044
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I have a new drum set I bought. I bought the Rock Band 2 drum set that's been sitting in my Rock Band drum bag.

2045
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:19,000
And I'm not playing it until I get my Rock Band symbols for it, which supposedly are coming in tomorrow.

2046
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Cross our fingers.

2047
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So hopefully, once I get the symbols, I'll start playing my new drum set.

2048
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
But until then, I'm not touching it.

2049
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Alright, we'll see what happens.

2050
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But there's other Rock Band news, yes?

2051
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
There is. Actually, Song Pack 2 has been confirmed, and there's a list up here if anyone wants to hear it.

2052
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:46,000
First of all, by the way, though, the one song costs 160 Microsoft points.

2053
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,000
But, you know, I think they're supposed to have some sort of deal on buying the whole thing.

2054
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
But here's what's going up.

2055
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:03,000
It's Afterlife by Avenged Sevenfold, Call Me by Blondie, El Scorcho Weezer, Girl You Want by Devo.

2056
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
That's a cool song.

2057
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Girls Who Play Guitars by Maxima Park, Indestructible by Disturbed, It Hurts Angels and Airwaves, Just When I Needed the Cars, Message in a Bottle, Yes Finally.

2058
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Dude, I downloaded that song a long time ago.

2059
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
You know what?

2060
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
See?

2061
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
These are all...

2062
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,000
No, I know, I know, I know, they're already download songs that are on the CD, but I'm just saying, that song does rock.

2063
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I've played it.

2064
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
It needs to be in... anyway.

2065
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
This one, it's like my favorite Police song.

2066
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Monkey Gone to Heaven by The Pixies, yay.

2067
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Rio Duran Duran, Saints of Los Angeles by Motley Crue, Simple Man, Leonard Skynyrd, Snow Hayo by Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Perfect Drug, Nine Inch Nails, This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race by Fall Out Boy, which I like that song too.

2068
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Time Is Running Out by Papa Roach, Why Do You Love Me Garbage, You've Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Zero Smashing Pumpkins.

2069
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Not a bad track list.

2070
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Not at all.

2071
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:03,000
What's kind of neat about that though, or different, is that I noticed that some of the things they pulled for that game come from the album releases.

2072
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Like the Pixies track was from the album release, the Hayo Red Hot Chili Peppers was from the album release.

2073
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:19,000
It's kind of interesting, it's not just single track releases they picked from, it's really a smorgasbord of the different things they've released for Rock Band, which I think is interesting.

2074
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Yeah, and what's also cool about that too is once again, with this, you can actually import those songs into Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1.

2075
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Or you can play the game as a standalone game if you want.

2076
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Oh, that's kind of neat.

2077
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Yeah.

2078
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
How would that work on the Wii though?

2079
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
On the Wii? I'm not sure how they're going to, I don't know if you can import them on the Wii.

2080
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:49,000
It might just be like a standalone thing, although they may be adding that later on because now they're going to have actual download songs for the Wii stuff.

2081
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
So, I don't know, soon I guess.

2082
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,000
This is just like printing money though for Harmonix and EA and MTV and the folks behind this game though.

2083
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I mean, you're really repackaging the same shit and putting it out there, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing, this thing's going to end up under a lot of little Timmy Christmas trees.

2084
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
But, it's just, you know.

2085
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:23,000
And if you think about it, if you're looking for a really cheap guitar game, like you just want something to play, I mean, you literally can go out there and buy a used, I saw a used Rock Band guitars for like 12 bucks.

2086
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And then this game for like 20 or like 30 bucks, here you go, for less than 50 bucks you can have like a Guitar Hero type of thing.

2087
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
That's a nice way of getting around it, I like the way you think.

2088
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Actually it's funny, through the Microsoft training site that I'm a part of, they had Guitar Hero Aerosmith guitars for 99 cents.

2089
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Really? I need one of those.

2090
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Well, they're not available now apparently. They put them up on the old site because they're revamping it and they're doing a new site or something.

2091
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
But they're like, these won't be available until the new site comes out.

2092
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I'm still using my Guitar Hero 2 controller. Still.

2093
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Hey, that's, you know, that top 500 bands? Yeah, that's with the old Guitar Hero 2 controller.

2094
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:16,000
You know, I was thinking about getting Guitar Hero World Tour, the little guitar in game bundle, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll just, because the Guitar Hero Aerosmith got a price reduction because of World Tour.

2095
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I might just go back and pick that up instead. I don't know.

2096
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Those guitars are dirt cheap, especially like game solving stuff. Interesting, really cheap.

2097
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Anyways, so Guitar Freaks Drummania, you know, that spawned the whole guitar music game thing anyways.

2098
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Well, there's a new arcade release in Japan, Guitar Freaks V6.

2099
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:42,000
And of course the subtitle on this is Blazing! With four exclamation points. That's so awesome.

2100
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
And, you know, it seems to be like fire themed, so that's kind of cool.

2101
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And no word exactly on what songs are in it, but so far they said that the expected song count, if you could believe it or not,

2102
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:10,000
570 plus, I guess, in all. That's freaking crazy. Over 570 songs?

2103
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It's not like almost every single song that's been in Guitar Freaks.

2104
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
It must be. My god, that's huge.

2105
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
How would you scroll through that damn list?

2106
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I don't know. Location testing soon, I guess. And supposedly, I don't know, it's the 16th installment for Drummania, 17th for Guitar Freaks.

2107
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That's nuts.

2108
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
That is a lot.

2109
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And you know what? I'm sure Guitar Hero will be catching up to that number in a couple years with the amount of tracks that they're talking about putting out.

2110
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Alright, the chat room is finally calming down from our little political talk earlier, which, by the way, I just wanted to say, quickly, sorry to kind of go back to it,

2111
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,000
but I just wanted to say, I don't blame any one group or any one thing for what happened.

2112
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I just, to go back to what I said, I blame society's lack of knowledge for the whole thing.

2113
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:18,000
But if I were to target one whole group or one whole cluster of people for what happened, that would be no better than them targeting me.

2114
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:25,000
So, anyhow, just kind of wondering, because that's responding to a lot of things I'm seeing in chat, that's just kind of what I wanted to say.

2115
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:31,000
But, I want to say, regarding games, SSG100Matt says, the Microsoft employee store has Gears of War 2 for $25.

2116
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Which would mean that employee stores always have games that are cheap. In fact, I used to get some hookups from EA thanks to that.

2117
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I stole a copy of Boom Blocks I barely touched.

2118
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Well, this is a little different than the employee store. This is their training site where you take tests and you earn points and you use those points to buy games.

2119
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Like, you can get games for the 360 or the first party set for 9 bucks. It's basically $9 is the shipping on it.

2120
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,000
But, you know, they're revamping it. They're redoing it because, I don't know, I guess it needs it.

2121
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
And SonicM88 says, the Explorer is still the best, Rob.

2122
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,000
And Act F says, Explorer, then the Stratocaster for Rock Band 2, then the rest.

2123
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So maybe the Explorer really is the best, but my yellow thing is sticking. Which sucks.

2124
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
8 bucks will buy you-

2125
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Controller surgery!

2126
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
No seriously, 8 bucks will buy you a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

2127
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Really? Maybe I'll just get a new Guitar Hero 2 controller.

2128
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Seriously, just take a trip to one of your game stores that sells you stuff.

2129
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

2130
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Oh, I forgot to mention that-

2131
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
We're all over the place today.

2132
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Yeah, that's cool. In my game week, I actually played DDR this week.

2133
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Really?

2134
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I played Supernova at that one game store.

2135
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Oh yeah, I gotta go check that out. I can't exercise still for another week and a half. It's another reason I didn't go out today.

2136
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Just because of the timing of what was going on today.

2137
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,000
And just, I still can't be packed in with people because I'm still really sensitive in some areas.

2138
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And so I can't do a lot of physical activity, walking for long distances and things.

2139
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
It was fun. It was fun, but I mean, I'm totally out of shape for DDR anymore.

2140
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:15,000
But I still play doubles, so I don't know if, you know, I could probably go back to singles and do that a little bit more.

2141
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
But still fun. I don't know. Supernova was fun.

2142
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Anyhow, let's talk crazy. Let's talk real crazy.

2143
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Crazier than anything I've brought up so far on this show. Very fucking crazy, okay?

2144
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
It's this guy, in fact, so crazy that I have to bring in the background music.

2145
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,000
This guy is Jonathan Lee Riches, and apparently he's spending his time in South California.

2146
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Or, sorry, South California, which pretty soon might happen, who knows.

2147
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:52,000
South Carolina, he's spending his time in a South Carolina prison suing people.

2148
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
He sues a lot of people.

2149
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:00,000
But one kind of particular interest of note that he's been suing, he sued Blizzard.

2150
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
That's right, he sued Blizzard over World of Warcraft.

2151
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
And what's his beef with World of Warcraft?

2152
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Well, it has caused him to live in a virtual universe where he committed identity theft

2153
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
and fought cyber monster gangs.

2154
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
And he was addicted to video games and lost touch with reality because of Blizzard.

2155
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
So in other words, here's somebody saying,

2156
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,000
it's Blizzard's fault that I can't separate game from reality.

2157
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,000
No. That's called, um, he's stupid.

2158
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:44,000
There's no such thing as video game addiction.

2159
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
There are addictive personalities that happen to play video games.

2160
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
There are OCD people out there. This guy is just stupid.

2161
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Now, the fact that he kind of sues a lot of people just kind of, you know,

2162
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,000
dumbs down the whole thing. But it's crazy to think that there are people out there

2163
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
that rationalize this like his lawyer.

2164
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Or better yet, why are we letting inmates sue?

2165
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The lawyer's getting paid if he wins or not.

2166
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Why are we letting these inmates sue everybody? That's just retarded.

2167
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
What else are you going to do when you're in prison?

2168
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
I swear they need to do some sort of federal lawsuit act.

2169
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
So that, you know, we don't have this shit.

2170
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
You only get three.

2171
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
GS68 says that we should take him to the Tyra Banks show.

2172
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Oh, sure. Tyra will solve everything.

2173
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
She can give him a stern talking to.

2174
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
There's no Oprah to deal with him.

2175
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And I want to point out, it's a hand written.

2176
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Oh my god.

2177
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I'm actually looking at the text and this is a hand written testimony there.

2178
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
And it all fits on one page. My god.

2179
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Pertainment asks, can I sue Fanta for being awesome?

2180
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Seriously, that's retarded.

2181
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And the fact that it's hand written, that's also retarded.

2182
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I mean, dude, get a typewriter. At least.

2183
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't let you have typewriters in prison.

2184
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
This caused Riches to commit fraud to buy defendants' video games.

2185
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Riches chose World of Warcraft over working a legit job.

2186
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Riches' mind became a living video game.

2187
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I hold defendants liable and support plaintiffs.

2188
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Why is he referring to himself in the third person?

2189
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I think it's like a lawyer or something. I don't know, but anyway.

2190
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Why did the lawyer then hand write all that?

2191
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You know what? Obviously they gave Jack Thompson a license, so you know.

2192
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Yeah, but eventually people got their brains straight and took away his license.

2193
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Anyhow, if you're any fan of Orange Lounge Radio and you've been listening for the past 300-some-odd episodes,

2194
02:06:47,000 --> 02:07:03,000
you know what segment's coming next.

2195
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I just want to interject one quick thing before we start.

2196
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
It's a comment from Marissa in chat.

2197
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
The lovely Marissa who hasn't been here forever, who needs to come back, by the way.

2198
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
You learn something new every day on Orange Lounge Radio.

2199
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Marissa says, I work in law. I've seen hand-written pleadings. They're so funny.

2200
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Apparently this is not uncommon.

2201
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Anyhow, sorry. F.U.'s of the week time.

2202
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,000
F.U. to everyone who voted yes on Prop 8.

2203
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
And Prop 2.

2204
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,000
And for... because Prop 2 is stupid, first of all.

2205
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Okay, I understand we love the animals, but for the majority to vote yes on Prop 2 and no on Prop...

2206
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:51,000
and sorry, to vote in Prop 2 to give rights to chickens and then not, you know, and then take away rights with Prop 8 is just stupid.

2207
02:07:51,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Also to the majority voters of Arkansas and Florida and anyone else with your head up your ass.

2208
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
You know, that's why you've got your nose turned up because all you can smell is your own shit.

2209
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And it don't smell good.

2210
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I voted yes on Prop 2 because I thought chickens that got to stand up would taste better.

2211
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Which actually is partially true, in a way. It really is.

2212
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Chickens that get the space to breathe are going to taste better.

2213
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,000
This is what people are ignoring with this. First of all, chickens are stupid.

2214
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Well, yeah.

2215
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
But let me finish what I'm saying.

2216
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Second of all, for however many farms are going to have to put the money and time into making up these, you know, getting up to these new standards,

2217
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
it's going to increase the cost of food that is already expensive.

2218
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And for people who are, you know, especially with the job market being the way it is,

2219
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:52,000
for people losing their homes left and right, who is going to be able to afford more money for food that's already hard to afford?

2220
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:59,000
There's already a problem going on across the country, and I can't believe people are so selfish that they want to ignore the simple, you know,

2221
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:06,000
financial impact this is going to have on everybody, you know, just for a few stupid chickens who don't care.

2222
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Well, those are the eggs from outside of California.

2223
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It's just stupid.

2224
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Get those Nevada chickens.

2225
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
It's a frivolous waste of money because people...

2226
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I blame liberals.

2227
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
All right, let's move on.

2228
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I also want to say, F.U., the people that voted yes on eight, but not necessarily...

2229
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
They had the whole, like, you know, they were following the polls and everything, and they were showing...

2230
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
They were getting a response from someone that was part of the yes on eight party or whatever,

2231
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
and it just sounded like a total Christian agenda or something.

2232
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I'd like to actually add another F.U. then.

2233
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,000
To the Mormon Church, F.U. on boycotting all your businesses.

2234
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I don't know. It just, you know, I'm so anti-religion, but that's all right, you know.

2235
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
So, F.U. that, I guess.

2236
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And F.U. the fact that there was another proposition that has passed that allows veterans to get even more money for housing,

2237
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,000
when, you know, people like me can't get any money for housing, and these people...

2238
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:18,000
It was funny, the proposition, they don't even have to actually serve in, like, you know, time of war or something like that.

2239
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
They just have to be enlisted in the military to get these extra benefits,

2240
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,000
and trust me, they get plenty of benefits as it is already, so F.U. that.

2241
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
And the chickens, well, I just vote on that because it tastes.

2242
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I think that it's just supposed to be reparations for having to smell their, you know, drill sergeant's breath.

2243
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Believe it or not, I'm not going to use the same F.U. I'm just going to say F.U. to intolerance.

2244
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:50,000
And I was really surprised to learn this week, in all walks of life, in all places in my life,

2245
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
wherein there is still intolerance, and we have a lot of work to do.

2246
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
That's it.

2247
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
All right.

2248
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Moving on, gaming news, gaming deals, games that are steel.

2249
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Well, how about a game that is a blank slate?

2250
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
What do you mean?

2251
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Tabula Rasa.

2252
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
But I'm bummed.

2253
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Yeah, Amazon's selling it for 96 cents.

2254
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Really?

2255
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Yes.

2256
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Amazon.com is selling Tabula Rasa for 96 cents?

2257
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yes, I checked.

2258
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Or if you want to translate that into a...

2259
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Is that with free shipping?

2260
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
No.

2261
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Damn.

2262
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It's also, it would translate to 61 pence, by the way.

2263
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
So, yeah, they're trying to get rid of it.

2264
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Of course, you know, NCSoft laid off a lot of people.

2265
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
But they're thinking that Tabula Rasa is going to be able to actually pull a future out of

2266
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:50,000
hammer space, I guess, with an expansion coming out for the game that's going to have a revamped

2267
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,000
first-person camera, scope and cockpit views, new weapons, rocket launchers!

2268
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
You can find all that out from the Tabula Rasa website.

2269
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,000
But for right now, if you want to pick up it, pick up it, yeah.

2270
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
If you want to pick it up, 96 cents.

2271
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
You pay more for shipping than you do for the damn game.

2272
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I'm actually half-tempted.

2273
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Tabula Rasa was not terrible.

2274
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I'm thinking about it too.

2275
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:22,000
It's a month of play for five bucks.

2276
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Why not?

2277
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It might be worth a look.

2278
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I'm kind of curious.

2279
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I honestly do think this is the tactic.

2280
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I mean...

2281
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
It is a very interesting way to get people on board, because that's what they'll make

2282
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
their...

2283
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
They're not going to make their money off the sale of the game, because the retailer

2284
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
gets screwed there.

2285
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
They're going to make their money off the subscription if I forget to cancel it or something,

2286
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
which I won't do.

2287
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
If the game sucks, it sucks.

2288
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I'm not all that interested in actually playing it.

2289
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I'm just thinking about buying it.

2290
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Just to have.

2291
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Yeah, to go in the collection.

2292
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
It is a Lord British game.

2293
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Or what do they call him now in Tabula Rasa?

2294
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Commander British or whatever his name is.

2295
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I do have a soft spot in my heart for Ultima.

2296
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
It's a very tiny, soft, squishy spot, but it's there.

2297
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
But you say that and I still think of Salamander.

2298
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
You know my friend was trying to get me to come back to Final Fantasy XI?

2299
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Who?

2300
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Oh, one of my online friends.

2301
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
But...

2302
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
You know what?

2303
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
There's two words to say.

2304
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
What?

2305
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Hell no!

2306
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That's kind of sadly what I had to say.

2307
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I was like, Wrath of the Lich King's coming out.

2308
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Rob, buy life.

2309
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Rob?

2310
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
What?

2311
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
What?

2312
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Are you going out at midnight for Wrath of the Lich King with me?

2313
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
When?

2314
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Thursday?

2315
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
No, I probably won't go by at midnight.

2316
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Do you know how crazy it's going to be on WoW that night?

2317
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Everybody's E-peen is going to make them go on there first.

2318
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I like Ragnarok.

2319
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It's free.

2320
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
You go girl.

2321
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Alright, let's move on.

2322
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
You go!

2323
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
You keep going!

2324
02:13:50,000 --> 02:14:05,000
So, the DSI just was released, and it's apparently allowed the R4 carts and any sort of homebrew

2325
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
slash hacking carts, it's prevented them from working.

2326
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Well, sure enough, it only took about a week, but the DSI has already been hacked.

2327
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,000
We've already got, yes, there is a YouTube video out there already showing one, I guess,

2328
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:30,000
developer, Yasusoft, created, of course, the typical Hello World program, and apparently

2329
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
it was done also with something that has been exploited on, I'd like to, for once, on this

2330
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Hello World program, I'd like to, which, if you don't know, the Hello World program is

2331
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
to simply print Hello World on the screen.

2332
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,000
In Commodore BASIC, that would be 10, print, quote, Hello World, end quote.

2333
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
20, go to 10.

2334
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,000
If you would put Hello Piracy in these programs.

2335
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Hello Piracy!

2336
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,000
But it's supposedly done with some sort of modified TIFF image buffer overflow thing,

2337
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:08,000
which, for people that know, the PSP was done the same way, and it seems to be something

2338
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
that's pretty typical, so, surprise!

2339
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:19,000
You know, where you may have thwarted one thing, it won't stay thwarted for long.

2340
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
And by the time I'm sure it comes out in the US, it will already be hacked wide open.

2341
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Especially now with SD card support, man, that's gonna make things even easier, because

2342
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
you know what that means?

2343
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I know, we kinda knew this was gonna happen when they announced that SD card slot was

2344
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
gonna be on there, right?

2345
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Yeah, can you imagine that, though?

2346
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
With SD card support, all you're really gonna need to do is load a program, and then you're

2347
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
gonna be able to modify the firmware just like you can with the PSP.

2348
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
You won't even need a cart!

2349
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
It'll be even easier to hack open!

2350
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Woohoo!

2351
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Alrighty, well, guess what?

2352
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Speaking of hacked, apparently, something has been hacked out of the Xbox Live Marketplace.

2353
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
You remember how a while ago, Xbox, they were threatening to delist games based on a Metacritic

2354
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
score and or sales, basically, was the thing?

2355
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:10,000
It apparently appears the first casualty may have disappeared, the game is gone, Yaris

2356
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
is no longer on Xbox Live Arcade.

2357
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:19,000
But, here's the question, and by the way, you can't even find it on Xbox.com now.

2358
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:25,000
What's interesting about this, I mean, it's completely gone, but the question is, is it

2359
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:31,000
something that they were purposely getting rid of for this whole delisting of games thing?

2360
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Or, you know, this game did come out about one year ago exactly, is it some type of contractual

2361
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:44,000
thing going on where, you know, it was a Toyota promotion, it was basically a game advertisement,

2362
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
did the ad run out?

2363
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
It probably did.

2364
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:55,000
And Bobby Blackwell swears up and down in our chat right now that's exactly what happened.

2365
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And I wouldn't be surprised at all.

2366
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
But it's just kind of funny because a lot of people are going, oh, the delisting demon's

2367
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
coming for you?

2368
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
No, it was just, it was a big advertisement game, that's why it probably sucked in the

2369
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
first place.

2370
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Who puts that much effort into an ad game?

2371
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I hope I don't lose those achievements, though.

2372
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Citar Hero was cool.

2373
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Yeah, Citar Hero was kind of cool.

2374
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
But I hope I don't lose those achievements, that'll piss me off.

2375
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Probably not.

2376
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
That's good.

2377
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
It just will mean that they won't sell it anymore online.

2378
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Well, how about something cool?

2379
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Alright, how about it?

2380
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Well, the developer Blue Castle is working on something.

2381
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Dead Rising 2.

2382
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Oh, hey, cool.

2383
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Yep.

2384
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:42,000
They're supposed to be, well, they haven't really confirmed anything, but it's been stated

2385
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,000
by a good source that they were working on it for Capcom.

2386
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Insider info.

2387
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Yep.

2388
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
No details, no nothing else about it, and no one has confirmed anything, but hey, maybe

2389
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
it'll be.

2390
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:59,000
To be honest, is it any real surprise that we're getting a Dead Rising 2?

2391
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I mean, no.

2392
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Zombies!

2393
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Exactly.

2394
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,000
And malls.

2395
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
What if this one's somewhere different, not a mall, Rob?

2396
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I guess that's true, it might not be a mall.

2397
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Oh, how about an airport?

2398
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Where do you think the zombie outbreak's gonna happen next?

2399
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
An office building.

2400
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Hmm.

2401
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
During the lunch hour.

2402
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Mmm, brains.

2403
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
It's what's for lunch.

2404
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Brains and that sandwich on the table back there.

2405
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Rob, you need to play the song.

2406
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
What?

2407
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
This is a Jonathan Coulton song.

2408
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Ah, later.

2409
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't have it right now.

2410
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
But Dead Rising 2's, Loki, you were a big fan of Dead Rising 1.

2411
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
What could be the best thing they could do for Dead Rising 2?

2412
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Fix the saving.

2413
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Fix the saving.

2414
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Fix the saving.

2415
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
There you go.

2416
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And rocket launchers.

2417
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Or rocket launchers.

2418
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Or rocket launcher save guns.

2419
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Rocket launcher save guns.

2420
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Could be awesome.

2421
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Another thing that could be awesome is some more stuff that could be coming out.

2422
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
And Hudson's got a new lineup of WiiWare games.

2423
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Some sound ordinary, one sounds really weird.

2424
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Of course, they just put out Alien Crush Returns, which is really awesome.

2425
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But they have announced three more WiiWare games that are coming to the Powell Wii shop.

2426
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And probably coming over here at some point as well.

2427
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:34,000
First they've got Snooker vs. Billiards Q Sports, which is a pool game.

2428
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
That's not QQ Sports when you lose.

2429
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Not QQ.

2430
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
It features online play for one of the four players.

2431
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
And allows you to either do motion control or button based play.

2432
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:51,000
The second one is Snowboard Riot, which is a snowboarding game with combat.

2433
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Sort of like Road Rash down a mountain.

2434
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
That sounds kind of cool.

2435
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
The last game is called Pit Crew Panic.

2436
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
And it's weird.

2437
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:08,000
It's sort of like a racing game, but you play a pit crew that fixes different things.

2438
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:14,000
From fixing cakes to flower beds and even toilets.

2439
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Well, how exciting.

2440
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
What did you do on your Wii today?

2441
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I fixed a toilet.

2442
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Awesome.

2443
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
You did what Wii with your toilet?

2444
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Besides a toilet fixing game and a hot dog eating game.

2445
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And boy, we've got a lot of winning stuff on the Wii.

2446
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Beer Pong?

2447
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
No, it's not Beer Pong.

2448
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
They changed the name, remember?

2449
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Pong Toss or something like that. Wasn't that what they called it?

2450
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Something like that, yeah.

2451
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Anyhow, Burnout Paradise.

2452
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Man, they just keep trying to make this game better.

2453
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
And to some extent, they're succeeding.

2454
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Because this is very, very cool.

2455
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
It's something coming out from, of course, Criterion Games.

2456
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
The folks behind Burnout Paradise.

2457
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
It is actually...

2458
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Now, they don't say it's a DeLorean, but it looks a lot like one.

2459
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yeah, there's no licensed cars in this game.

2460
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
But it's the Legendary Cars Pack.

2461
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
And they call this the Jansen 88 Special.

2462
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Well, who was the creator of the DeLorean?

2463
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Exactly. So that's what it is there.

2464
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Seriously.

2465
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
That's pretty awesome that that's coming out.

2466
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Dude, is there a McLaren clone in there?

2467
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:37,000
They also have cars called the Cavalry Bootlegger, Manhattan Spirit, and GT Nighthawk.

2468
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Okay, so what's awesome about the DeLorean one, or the not so DeLorean,

2469
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,000
is when you do the boost, it does make flame trails behind it.

2470
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And if you push the L3 button, it will hover.

2471
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I'm looking at that in the screenshot.

2472
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I'm like, it looks like this car is jumping.

2473
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
It's hovering.

2474
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
It will go in the hover mode.

2475
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
You know what those other ones are? The Bootlegger.

2476
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
That, of course, is the General Lee.

2477
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
The other two that were in there, one is the Ecto-1.

2478
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And the other one, Kit.

2479
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Sweet!

2480
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
What do they call it, a car?

2481
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Oh, that's what these other ones are.

2482
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
That's what the other ones are.

2483
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
GT Nighthawk.

2484
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
GT Nighthawk, yeah.

2485
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I get it.

2486
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Well, that's pretty awesome.

2487
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
And bless those folks at Criterion Games,

2488
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
because I think a lot of us kind of wrote off Bird Out Paradise.

2489
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
They're doing a lot of free stuff, like add-ons and stuff.

2490
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
They are really letting us have our money's worth for this game,

2491
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
so good for them, even if some of us razzed the game.

2492
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Plus, they didn't make the show roll.

2493
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
They have a new party thing.

2494
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
It's like Burnout Party or something like that,

2495
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
that's coming out in February, I think.

2496
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:49,000
And it's basically the game with all the updates that they've added so far,

2497
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
and I think some of the download content.

2498
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
But they are having a new party mode that will be downloadable as well,

2499
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
that they're going to add some different Pass the Controller games and stuff.

2500
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
So that's kind of cool.

2501
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,000
They're adding, I think instead of putting it on another Burnout game,

2502
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
they'll just keep adding to this one.

2503
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

2504
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I'm going to rebuy this game just for this download.

2505
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I'm really upset with myself that I traded away this game.

2506
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Yeah.

2507
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I'm glad I kept it now.

2508
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I think I still kept mine.

2509
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I'm not sure, but either way, I can rebuy it if I have it,

2510
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,000
and also if you own the PlayStation 3, you can just download it.

2511
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
That's true.

2512
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
You can't always just download it on the PlayStation 3.

2513
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
It's in their little store.

2514
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
That's pretty cool.

2515
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Yeah.

2516
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Good for them.

2517
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Good for them, giving us our money's worth.

2518
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Well, here's something that's very interesting, speaking of money,

2519
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
actually referring to economy,

2520
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:44,000
is that CCP is stating that there's new online content for the players

2521
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:50,000
where you'll be able to open your own bar, sort of.

2522
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,000
You basically will be able to take empty space station areas

2523
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:00,000
and put in stores, put in shops, customize them however you want to,

2524
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,000
make your own rules, products, hire NPCs, custom dialogue.

2525
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
You can just hang out and sell stuff, create in-game currency,

2526
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
you know, that type of thing.

2527
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So it sounds pretty cool.

2528
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
What is this, Quark the Game?

2529
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:20,000
But you'll even be able to have a captain's quarters later on

2530
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
where you can take command of a ship.

2531
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
So that's kind of cool.

2532
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Hmm.

2533
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I wonder if these folks are getting a little worried

2534
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
about that Star Trek MMO that's looming.

2535
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Maybe.

2536
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Maybe.

2537
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
A bit.

2538
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Eve definitely has its following, though.

2539
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Oh, come on.

2540
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:39,000
They're making a chess-like strategy board game with a hexagonal layout.

2541
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I'd prefer the chess game.

2542
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
But it's kind of neat.

2543
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,000
You know, Eve's still expanding, and I hear it's a pretty difficult MMO,

2544
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
but a lot of folks really get rewards out of that.

2545
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I've never played it myself.

2546
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I don't have time to play everything, but it definitely has its community.

2547
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Mm-hmm.

2548
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
So speaking of community, there's, of course,

2549
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
the whole Guitar Hero songs that are available online,

2550
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
lots of community-made stuff.

2551
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Well, Activision wants to expand that.

2552
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
They figure, you know, hey, this service is so awesome

2553
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:21,000
because we're so awesome for coming up with such an original idea.

2554
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
They said that so far, just in ten days,

2555
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,000
that Guitar Hero Tunes has attracted over 25,000 user-generated songs,

2556
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
probably many less now that they've taken them all down,

2557
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
and will likely have up to 100,000 songs by year's end.

2558
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
These songs are easily downloaded by consumers,

2559
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and the ability to offer these songs on a subscription basis

2560
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:50,000
may very well result in the newest subscription opportunities in our portfolio.

2561
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
That's an awesome idea.

2562
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Let's take something that was available for free that came with the game

2563
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
and decide, oh, guess what?

2564
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
You're going to have to pay for it now.

2565
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Nice.

2566
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
And it's not going to have any songs that are actually based on other things.

2567
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
It's just all original stuff.

2568
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Yeah, that'll fly.

2569
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
The other thing that you should know, too,

2570
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,000
is that they have plenty more Guitar Hero games coming out.

2571
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:18,000
In fact, they said that Activision's 09 lineup is 40% larger,

2572
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
and of course, with that are multiple Call of Duty

2573
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
and multiple Guitar Hero releases

2574
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,000
because those are their two biggest franchises, obviously.

2575
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Interesting.

2576
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
You want to hear something else that's also interesting?

2577
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Remember when they purchased them

2578
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,000
and know how they got rid of Ghostbusters and all those other ones?

2579
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
You know why they got rid of them?

2580
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Because they can't keep making sequels for them.

2581
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
That's why.

2582
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Because they wanted games that they can make constant sequels for.

2583
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
They even came out and said that.

2584
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
That's why they didn't pick up those original games,

2585
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
because they only want games that they can make sequels for.

2586
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Who said you can't make a sequel to Ghostbusters?

2587
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
There's been many Ghostbusters games.

2588
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Well, you can only make so many.

2589
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
That's not true.

2590
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
They had the old-ass one on the Commodore 64, Atari 2600.

2591
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Then there was a later one based off of Ghostbusters II.

2592
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I remember that game distinctly on the old PC.

2593
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
That was one of those 386 SX games.

2594
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Would that be something that would be easily...

2595
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Would they be able to convince the writers and the actors and stuff

2596
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
to be able to continue doing it?

2597
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
They don't need them if they have the IP.

2598
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Just saying.

2599
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I don't know.

2600
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
I don't think that would work.

2601
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
That's why.

2602
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
We're going to get a bunch of Call of Duty and a bunch of Guitar Hero.

2603
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Remember, there's maybe a World War II and a Modern and Future War.

2604
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I think this guitar whoring thing is going to really blow up in their faces

2605
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
if they don't start playing it smarter.

2606
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
They've got to innovate these franchises or they're going to disappear.

2607
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,000
But then again, DDR games are still selling, aren't they?

2608
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Yeah, but DDR, though, they only do...

2609
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
It's only one game a year, but it's one game on each platform.

2610
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I mean, if they just decided, hey, let's just release one...

2611
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I think they should just do that with one title

2612
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
and release it on all the platforms.

2613
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Just make it, you know, downscale the videos or something like that

2614
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
for the PlayStation 2 and Wii or something.

2615
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I think they should do that.

2616
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I'm going to get Universe 3. That's out there in the wild now, isn't it?

2617
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Yeah, Universe 3 is out there on 360.

2618
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
So many games.

2619
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:20,000
It's just, you know, they don't do it right, I don't think.

2620
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,000
They basically give away the full song list.

2621
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:27,000
They don't leave anything secret, so there's no joy in unlocking stuff.

2622
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And it's just, you know, each title is kind of hokey in its own way.

2623
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
All right.

2624
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
But Guitar Hero is going to get the same way.

2625
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,000
They're going to have, you know, each one is going to be for a different band.

2626
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And they're going to make it...

2627
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I don't think they're going to be smart and actually have it where you can import them into, say,

2628
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Guitar Hero World Tour.

2629
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I don't think they're going to do that.

2630
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I think Rock Band will, because they've been doing that so far.

2631
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
But I don't think it's going to happen with Guitar Hero.

2632
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I think they're going to make you buy a new game every time.

2633
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Well, hey, look, if you're a music game fan looking for something new,

2634
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I bet there's a few cult fans of this franchise that would try to push you towards

2635
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
DJ Maxx on the PSP.

2636
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I don't know how many of you guys have actually had your hands on this,

2637
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
because until now you've had to import this game.

2638
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,000
But there is a version of this game that is slated for US release.

2639
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
It's DJ Maxx Fever.

2640
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
DJ Maxx Fever, now, it was going to come out in November,

2641
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
but sadly the game got delayed.

2642
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
It is delayed a couple months.

2643
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,000
It's now going to come out probably January-ish, is what they're looking at.

2644
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
But the good news is they're supposed to be going back to make it actually

2645
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
compatible with the PSP 3000.

2646
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Remember, it kind of had its own issues going on there with the PSP 3000,

2647
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:34,000
with the whole scan lines and all that stuff.

2648
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
So they're going to go back and fix that to make sure everything works with all

2649
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,000
the PSPs, and they're going to put in new gear, new items,

2650
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
and apparently some extra hidden content.

2651
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So apparently the wait won't be all bad for fans of DJ Maxx.

2652
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,000
And also, the PSP sounds like it's not going to be the only place

2653
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
to catch DJ Maxx Fever.

2654
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Apparently DJ Maxx Technica is coming to arcades,

2655
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
and that's not DJ Maxx coming to special Korean arcades

2656
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
that you can only find in very limited places in America.

2657
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Nope, this is actually being licensed to come out in America this December.

2658
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Here's the interesting thing about the game, though,

2659
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
and how it's different from Beatmania.

2660
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
It uses a touch screen.

2661
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
You actually touch the screen to hit the notes as the notes go across the line,

2662
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,000
which is way different than the way this thing plays on the PSP.

2663
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:23,000
But you still can expect all the same musicians that you see from DJ Maxx.

2664
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
After all, half of the charm in these games is the music.

2665
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:28,000
You know, this game almost reminds me that they're...

2666
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
It's almost like they're trying to compete with Jubeet on this.

2667
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

2668
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
It is very interesting.

2669
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Well, PM Studios is the folks that are bringing it to you in the US,

2670
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:41,000
and very interesting because between this, Street Fighter IV, Tekken 6,

2671
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
arcades are slowly getting a little love again.

2672
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Let's just see if this trend continues because I do miss arcades.

2673
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I also want to point out some of the cool features about this.

2674
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Technica is going to plug into the internet for global leaderboards,

2675
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,000
internet updates to the game, which I think is very cool

2676
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
because that means you can get new songs right on the internet,

2677
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
and little cards that are actually going to track the player progress.

2678
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
And I believe there's some type of DJ Maxx soundtrack

2679
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
that you can get that comes with one of these cards,

2680
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
so you can get started.

2681
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
There you have it. And by the way, and GS68 wants to correct you,

2682
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
it's U-Beat.

2683
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
That's why I said I should be U-Beat. I corrected myself.

2684
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Oh, there you go.

2685
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Sorry.

2686
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,000
There you go, and apparently some test locations for DJ Maxx Technica

2687
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:28,000
are going to be released soon, so some folks that have been playing this game

2688
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,000
on a more cult, unknown level, this game might explode in the next year,

2689
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
in 2009, or it might not. We'll see.

2690
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
But I don't know. I'm kind of interested how the touchscreen thing plays.

2691
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I would worry that after hours and hours and hours of use

2692
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
and little kids with sticky hands in a place like Golf Land

2693
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
that that touchscreen is going to turn to shit,

2694
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,000
but it sounds cool.

2695
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Sounds like it might work.

2696
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:58,000
All right. Well, hey, those of you guys that were listening to the program tonight

2697
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
were probably thinking towards the end of Part A,

2698
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
hey, where's Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week?

2699
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,000
We tune in every week to hear Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week.

2700
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
And we didn't hear it tonight during Part A.

2701
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Well, that's because Dark Soccer got here a little earlier than anticipated.

2702
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
We didn't schedule her to do the Classic Game of the Week until right now.

2703
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Yep.

2704
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:21,000
So get ready to experience a game from gaming's history

2705
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
as Dark Soccer goes through her archives and picks a game

2706
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:26,000
that you all should be playing right now.

2707
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Absolutely. The game of the week is Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

2708
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
which-

2709
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And what a choice.

2710
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Yeah, because it's a freaking rad game.

2711
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
And I love the intro to it, okay?

2712
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:53,000
But I picked this particular clip so that we could get to the cornball American voice actor.

2713
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Yes, this is actually the direct sequel to Dracula X,

2714
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
which is my favorite Castlevania game,

2715
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
where you start off the game actually finishing the end of Dracula X.

2716
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
You're playing as Richter, and then you go through the game playing as Alucard,

2717
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:14,000
trying to hunt down Richter, who has gone into the castle and vanished.

2718
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:20,000
The interesting thing about this game is that it actually took a very Metroid-like quality to it,

2719
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
where you have different areas that you're exploring,

2720
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
and you have to move through the different areas.

2721
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,000
You hear different weapons on the way.

2722
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Really, it's just a lot of-

2723
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
This game is just completely unique,

2724
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
as far as bringing something into the Castlevania world when it first showed up.

2725
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:44,000
We've also had various other releases.

2726
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I've got the Saturn version, which is actually graphically not my favorite,

2727
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
because the Saturn did the other 3D as well.

2728
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
You can play as Maria, and that was freaking cool.

2729
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:59,000
You can also, of course, if you put in your name as Richter on the game,

2730
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
you can play as Richter, which is really cool.

2731
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:08,000
He's got his own attacks and everything.

2732
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:15,000
But basically, through the game, you have an RPG element to the game,

2733
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:22,000
where you've got your familiars with you.

2734
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I love the sword familiar. The sword familiar was my favorite.

2735
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:30,000
But you've also got interactions between characters that go in.

2736
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,000
You can even choose your path through the game,

2737
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
and it determines the kind of ending you'll receive,

2738
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
because I'm sure we all know what the bad ending is.

2739
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Plus, oh my god, the art in it was gorgeous.

2740
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
It was done by-

2741
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Wait, wait, here comes the best part.

2742
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Okay.

2743
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Dime monster, you don't belong in this world.

2744
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh.

2745
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.

2746
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Tribute? You steal men's souls and make them your slaves.

2747
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.

2748
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Your words are as empty as your soul.

2749
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Mankind ill needs a savior such as you.

2750
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
What is a man?

2751
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,000
A miserable little pile of secrets.

2752
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Fucking love the dramatic wine glass toss.

2753
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Have at you!

2754
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It is just this cornball in Japanese, just to let you know.

2755
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,000
One of the best gaming moments ever.

2756
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
This person though, it's painful to watch this particular person playing,

2757
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
because they wait.

2758
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
When you're fighting Dracula the first time around as Richter,

2759
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:45,000
if you let yourself die, then Maria comes out and says,

2760
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:49,000
all my little animal buddies, help Richter not suck!

2761
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Or something like that.

2762
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:55,000
But I never needed her help.

2763
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Anyway, with the development of this game,

2764
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:05,000
actually there's a lot of really cool, cool stuff.

2765
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Actually, there's a thing that was called Castlevania the Bloodletting,

2766
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:17,000
which was a 32X game that was supposed to be in development.

2767
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:24,000
But the art design in the game was done by Ayami Kojima,

2768
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,000
doing a lot of the concept art and designs for the games.

2769
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Very, very pretty, pretty artwork.

2770
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Most of the game is 2D, but you've got some rotational and 3D effects in the background.

2771
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I had to up the volume just so you'd hear that part.

2772
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
But there are certain things that are rendered in 3D,

2773
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:54,000
like the clouds in certain areas, parts of the clock tower.

2774
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:00,000
There's even some full motion video that goes through different areas.

2775
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
It's actually pretty cool.

2776
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,000
However, one thing that's noted on this is that they don't appear in the Xbox Live Arcade version,

2777
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
which, you know, we've covered this and it did recently come to Xbox Live Arcade.

2778
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
If you haven't downloaded it by now, shame on you.

2779
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Unless you're a PlayStation owner, then just go get it there.

2780
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:24,000
It's a greatest hits game, I mean, jeez.

2781
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:30,000
But I'd say, honestly though, with all the other versions to come out,

2782
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:39,000
and also there was the PSP version, this also has the Dart Priest's shaft.

2783
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Which is right up on the screen right now.

2784
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Which I just think is the greatest bad guy ever.

2785
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Yeah, it's the same shaft who was in Gameplay.

2786
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:00,000
This was just an epic game when it first came out on PlayStation.

2787
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I think the only problem I have with this game now is that every DS game has been a copy of it.

2788
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
You know what I mean?

2789
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:14,000
This was also the first one I think that Igarashi was in development on,

2790
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,000
so I think that it's his input that specifically brought this style about.

2791
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I got to meet him, that was so cool.

2792
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Anyway, there are some particular differences.

2793
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,000
The original name for this...

2794
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Actually, I'll tell you what, my husband, this was before I was with him,

2795
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:43,000
he imported this game when it first came out, because he was that anxious to play it.

2796
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
The original name of it was Akumajo-Jakula X Geka no Yasukyoku,

2797
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:54,000
which is not Turn in the Moonlight, pretty much.

2798
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Which is why you've seen it referred to as both names.

2799
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
There are several differences.

2800
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,000
First of all, in the Japanese version it has two extra familiars.

2801
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
There's the Sprite Familiar and the Nose Devil Familiar.

2802
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Basically the Sprite is a palette swap,

2803
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,000
the Nose Devil basically is the demon one with a Tengu mask.

2804
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I will not.

2805
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Sorry, the guy who did Alucard's voice acting does have a sexy voice.

2806
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
The game actually had an art book, a soundtrack, and a short manga

2807
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:31,000
that came with the Japanese version.

2808
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,000
I can tell you it's pretty sweet, it's actually really, really cool.

2809
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,000
It's sort of like just a little behind the scenes thing of Alucard waking up

2810
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
and going off and kicking ass.

2811
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:52,000
There's also different versions of the last stage.

2812
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Basically, in the US version you saw it was called Bloodlines

2813
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
when Richter's chapter started up,

2814
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:07,000
and in the Japanese one it was called Rondo of Blood, which was the end of Rondo of Blood.

2815
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I don't know if there's something related to YouTube that shows up

2816
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
towards the end of the game boss fight.

2817
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Also, for the Saturn version, there's another reason why I like it.

2818
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
I love playing as Maria.

2819
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Maria is just freaking hardcore awesome in that game.

2820
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,000
She just has some of her attacks are really hard to do.

2821
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:34,000
But there's different remixes that play of old Castlevania music,

2822
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
depending on if you play as Richter or Maria,

2823
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
and you get either Vampire Killer or Bloody Tears.

2824
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,000
There are actually really good mixes of them, too.

2825
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
The load times are longer, the transparencies are not that fantastic.

2826
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Oh, that's not the game, sorry. This is somebody's spear run.

2827
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I'm looking at it.

2828
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Sorry.

2829
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:58,000
It actually has distorted sprites.

2830
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Really, there was a lot that the Saturn could have done better,

2831
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
and they just didn't take advantage of it.

2832
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:07,000
It was very rushed.

2833
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
But it did have two extra levels in the game.

2834
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
This is me being a nerd.

2835
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
For anyone who has ever done this,

2836
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:21,000
when you're in the first level, you'll find a trapdoor that closes

2837
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:25,000
when you come through the main drawbridge door, right?

2838
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:30,000
There is a way to sort of trick it into letting you go through the trapdoor,

2839
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
and it's a series of, it's just like going into a cave,

2840
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
and then you go into another room down there,

2841
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,000
and in the PlayStation 1, it's just a save room, that's all it is.

2842
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
In the Saturn 1, you go down that same series of cave, you know, there,

2843
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
and it takes you into the underground garden, or whatever they called it,

2844
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
and that was really cool. It was also kind of a difficult place to get through.

2845
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:58,000
But I don't know if this is true or not,

2846
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:03,000
but I think that the Saturn version was things that they had wanted to put

2847
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
in the original release and didn't,

2848
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:12,000
because a lot of the areas there, you can see where it would have fit to begin with.

2849
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I mean, they clearly had to have had an intention to put something there

2850
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:18,000
if there was that little, you know, area.

2851
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
There's also another trick, though.

2852
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I haven't been able to get it to work in the Saturn version.

2853
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
I know it works in the PlayStation version,

2854
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,000
where you can do like some little glitch as the wolf and then the bat,

2855
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
and then fly outside of the castle and fill in more area,

2856
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
which is really useful if you have the walk armor,

2857
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
because the walk armor, the more you've explored the castle,

2858
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
the better defense you have.

2859
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I know a lot about this game. I also know that it's a pain in the ass

2860
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
trying to get the Yatsusuna, but that is the best weapon in the game,

2861
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:46,000
in my opinion.

2862
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
But it's a freaking awesome game, and everyone should be playing it.

2863
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,000
It was voted in 1998.

2864
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
It was the Game of the Year by EGM

2865
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,000
and ranked number four in their top 100 list of games since.

2866
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Which was a bit controversial that year,

2867
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,000
because it was the same year that Final Fantasy VII came out.

2868
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I think this was better than Final Fantasy VII.

2869
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,000
This game got more play from me than Final Fantasy VII did.

2870
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I played this game for hours at a time.

2871
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Me too, I love this game. I love it.

2872
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Did you bother getting your walk armor?

2873
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:23,000
No, this came out during that period where I wasn't like hardcore into games,

2874
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
because I was like in school.

2875
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
But I still played a lot of this game.

2876
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
We need to just sit down and play through it.

2877
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
It would be fun.

2878
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,000
It's an all-day thing, but you can get through most of the game in one day.

2879
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
I'm looking at some guy doing a speed run.

2880
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Speed runs for Symphony of the Night are freaking easy.

2881
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
They are easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy,

2882
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
because if you really want to beat the game quickly,

2883
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:52,000
you just run through there, whack Richter, and you're done.

2884
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:57,000
However, if you want the good ending, you have to go find Shaft,

2885
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,000
call him a big dumbass with a skullcap, and then go beat Richter.

2886
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Nice.

2887
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
So that earns the whatever reward.

2888
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
By the way, I just want to say also the great thing about this game,

2889
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,000
speaking of the alternate ways you can do things,

2890
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:17,000
what a surprise when you might think you're done with the game,

2891
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
but then you find out, wow, I'm really not done with this game.

2892
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Oh, no, it really was such a surprise.

2893
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,000
It was crazy.

2894
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,000
It was awesome.

2895
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I don't want to give too much away for those that actually haven't seen it,

2896
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
which I would hope is not that many people at this point,

2897
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
but if you've never seen it, it's one of those moments where you're like,

2898
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
ah, goddamn.

2899
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Even more, this is a game that really does just transcend.

2900
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:43,000
I mean, it really is fantastic.

2901
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:51,000
There's stuff about this game that I have still just found out.

2902
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I uncovered quite a bit of this myself.

2903
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,000
There's also a really fun trick where if you go in the library

2904
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
and you do your double jump in one particular place,

2905
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:02,000
you can actually pop up under the librarian

2906
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
and knock him into the ceiling.

2907
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Nice.

2908
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And he raises his hands in the air like he's going, whee!

2909
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
It's true.

2910
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
You can.

2911
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
That's awesome.

2912
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I'd like to see that.

2913
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
And then there's the little chats with Maria,

2914
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
and Maria's kind of ickter.

2915
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I think she says ickter.

2916
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Like she's going to spit out acid in your eye.

2917
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,000
All right.

2918
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Anyway.

2919
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Well, what a wonderful game for the week.

2920
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night, if you haven't checked it out,

2921
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
it's so easy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

2922
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Unlike some of these other super rare Japanese games

2923
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
that Dark Soccer brings up once in a while,

2924
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
like games that were never released here or never will be,

2925
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Symphony of the Night, any idiot can find it.

2926
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
So you've got to go play it.

2927
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
All right.

2928
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Let's do a couple more stories,

2929
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,000
then we're going to do a brief Skypline segment tonight.

2930
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
We've been running a little long

2931
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,000
because of everything else we've been talking about,

2932
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,000
but we will get to Skypline.

2933
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
We do want to take at least two calls

2934
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
and then probably wrap up because it's almost 9.30 here on the West Coast.

2935
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
We want to finish at a decent hour tonight.

2936
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Loki, more news.

2937
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Yes.

2938
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Well, there's some pretty interesting stuff.

2939
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Of course, you know, I just made my costume and, yeah, that's cool.

2940
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,000
But if you want to make some other costumes,

2941
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Indie Mogul, they have a...

2942
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I guess it's like a podcast or video cast that they do.

2943
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
It's Backyard FX.

2944
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:25,000
And one of the segments that they just did

2945
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:28,000
was how to build your own Halo 3 armor,

2946
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
or your own Halo armor, I guess,

2947
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
for under $100.

2948
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
And they actually have instructions on how to do it.

2949
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
It's done with paper.

2950
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
You actually kind of do a little bit of paper craft

2951
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,000
and then you also paint over it with some clear coat acrylic stuff

2952
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
and then build it up with fiberglass and whatnot.

2953
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
But it can come out looking really cool

2954
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
if you put the time and effort into it

2955
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:54,000
and the videos are available online.

2956
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
And it's pretty awesome.

2957
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
If you want to check it out,

2958
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
visit indymogul.com.

2959
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,000
I-N-D-Y-M-O-G-U-L.

2960
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:06,000
All right.

2961
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:09,000
It's interesting because, you know, Halloween,

2962
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
we had all the official Master Chief costumes,

2963
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
which, granted, were a lot cheaper

2964
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
because they were, you know...

2965
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
They looked like crap.

2966
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
They were like a hefty bag and a helmet.

2967
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,000
But, you know, it's kind of interesting that you can do this

2968
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
whole little fancy thing for relatively inexpensive.

2969
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Yeah, and this isn't just for, you know, Halo either.

2970
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,000
I mean, you can use this and apply it to any sort of armor

2971
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,000
or whatever cosplay stuff you want to, you know, use it for.

2972
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Very cool.

2973
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Well, one more story before we get to the Skype line tonight,

2974
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
and it has to do with China

2975
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:42,000
and something very interesting that they are thinking about doing on...

2976
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Actually, or they are going to be doing on real money trades.

2977
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
You know what that is?

2978
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:49,000
That whole MMO thing, you know, where you basically trade money

2979
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,000
for gold in the game.

2980
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Guess what?

2981
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
China, the government in China,

2982
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:57,000
they have now instituted a tax on real money transactions,

2983
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
which, you know, if you think it's a big industry here in China...

2984
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
I mean, you know, if you play any MMO at length,

2985
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:07,000
then you will hear the mandatory Chinese gold farmer joke in the game.

2986
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:10,000
You know, it's a huge industry in China,

2987
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:13,000
and they've decided to tax it over there,

2988
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
which is, you know, the government has done this out of concern

2989
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
for, you know, kind of money under the table,

2990
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
laundering, inflation, da-da-da-da-da.

2991
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
They have just taxed it.

2992
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Twenty percent is the tax,

2993
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
and this announcement just came out.

2994
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
It was distributed to local tax bureaus,

2995
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:34,000
and it specifically will target those who buy virtual currency

2996
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:38,000
from gamers and surfers to sell it to others at a markup.

2997
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Taxation officials are granted the right

2998
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,000
to determine the original price of the online virtual currency

2999
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:48,000
if the individual fails to provide proof of an original price.

3000
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Interesting.

3001
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Do you think we might be next here in America

3002
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
to tax this kind of stuff?

3003
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
We'll try, but I don't know if there's much, you know,

3004
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
that they'll want to admit real money transfer.

3005
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
And it goes through these Chinese companies

3006
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
and, like, foreign companies anyways.

3007
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
I think on some of these big companies they could do a sales tax,

3008
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
but, you know, I don't know.

3009
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
It would be very hard to police everything.

3010
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:16,000
That's what's kind of interesting about this whole law,

3011
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
if you ask me.

3012
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line,

3013
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

3014
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3015
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,000
We're going to go ahead and take a couple quick phone calls.

3016
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Loki, while we wait for some calls,

3017
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
do you have any last-minute stories for us?

3018
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Yeah, just some small stuff real quick.

3019
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
One I was going to mention,

3020
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I don't know if this is out here anywhere,

3021
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,000
there was a game that they showed off,

3022
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I want to say it was a Tokyo game show,

3023
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,000
and it was teased in Famitsu magazine,

3024
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:50,000
a Japanese role-playing game called X-Edge or Cross Edge.

3025
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:54,000
You may remember such similar games as Namco X Capcom

3026
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
or Namco Cross Capcom.

3027
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Yep.

3028
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Well, this game right here, which is out on the PS3,

3029
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,000
combines a bunch of things.

3030
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
So far, the ones that they've announced,

3031
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,000
all sorts of different companies are involved.

3032
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Idea Factory, Gus, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Nippon Ichi, Compile Heart.

3033
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
It's a gaming orgy.

3034
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:16,000
It's seriously a gaming orgy.

3035
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:21,000
It features characters from Darkstalkers.

3036
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,000
They have Morgan, Felicia and Dimitri,

3037
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:29,000
R. Tonolico, Orica, Misha, and Shirelia.

3038
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Wow.

3039
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
They've got Atona and Prina, Spectral Souls.

3040
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Pretty dude.

3041
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Monokimia 2.

3042
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:40,000
They've got Lilia, Rose, and Marie.

3043
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
They have Kitchen Sink.

3044
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
They have everything.

3045
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
And you want to know what the best part about this is?

3046
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:49,000
It's coming out to the U.S. spring of next year.

3047
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Very nice.

3048
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Hey, I got a caller on hold.

3049
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Let's go to the phones.

3050
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3051
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,000
Who's this?

3052
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Solid Goomba.

3053
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Solid Goomba.

3054
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
What's on your mind, my friend?

3055
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:03,000
I just kind of want to weigh in on the whole copyright ban hammer on LittleBigPlanet.

3056
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Yes, please.

3057
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Speak away.

3058
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I haven't played the game yet.

3059
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
I just bought PlayStation 3, but I don't get it until tomorrow.

3060
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,000
But I kind of think that it's a little ridiculous.

3061
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I see it as a homage to the original IP,

3062
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
like making the Super Mario level and that kind of stuff.

3063
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I think that's perfectly acceptable.

3064
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:30,000
And I think if the companies are going to go after people trying to recreate levels and such,

3065
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:36,000
then they should also be going after DV and art users for making fan images.

3066
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Interesting.

3067
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
I can kind of understand where they're coming from in terms of...

3068
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
You mentioned the Dirty Harry video.

3069
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:51,000
I can understand that, but I think if it's something that they're creating within the confines of the...

3070
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Oh, crap.

3071
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
The confines of the game, yeah?

3072
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Yeah.

3073
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I think that there's no reason that it should be taken off.

3074
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:03,000
But, I mean, just to be devil's advocate a little bit, I think some of these levels are pushing it.

3075
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Like Gears of War-inspired levels is kind of pushing it.

3076
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I mean, maybe it isn't even an IP thing at that point.

3077
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Sony just doesn't want that crap out there.

3078
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:16,000
They don't want free advertising for Gears of War.

3079
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Yeah, but at the same time, no one's making money off of it.

3080
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I guess that's true.

3081
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,000
But it's brand recognition when they could have the resistance levels.

3082
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:29,000
But then again, as I understand it, Sony has been pulling levels about the PlayStation 3.

3083
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Right.

3084
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:43,000
But these guys having an itchy trigger finger should not be that big of a surprise when you consider that these are the same guys that kind of, some would say, overreacted over the whole lyrics in the one song.

3085
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
And right now, Loki's showing me, what's this, a Galaga level.

3086
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Yes.

3087
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
You know who made this one?

3088
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Same guy did the Gradius level.

3089
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Did it just come out or something?

3090
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,000
No, he's got a bunch of videos.

3091
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
He also did a Tetris level.

3092
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,000
That's even better than the other one.

3093
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Oh my god.

3094
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
That's crazy.

3095
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
But yeah, his levels aren't disappearing.

3096
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Because they're in Japanese.

3097
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
And the company is a European company.

3098
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
They probably can't read what his level says.

3099
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Now, a comment from Chatroom, and I apologize if I mispronounced this name.

3100
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
It's a new name I haven't seen before.

3101
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Sunchez? Sunchez? Sunchez?

3102
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:14,000
I like cheese.

3103
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
So Sunchez says, uh, that's Two Zs.

3104
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
It says Two Zs, not Two Es.

3105
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
So Sunchez, maybe.

3106
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I'm tired of playing Super Mario Brothers 1-1 again and again.

3107
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,000
It seems like every game that you can create something in, we see Mario Brothers level 1-1.

3108
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:36,000
But even though, yeah, I'm sick of playing it too, there is that moment of, hey, cool.

3109
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
When you first see it, right?

3110
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I don't know.

3111
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
So if you had this game, or you're going to be getting this game soon enough, Solid Goomba,

3112
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
what kind of level are you going to make?

3113
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Are you going to go and just make something original?

3114
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Or are you going to just infringe the IP and hope you don't get caught?

3115
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Oh, I'm going to infringe.

3116
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
I'm not creative enough to create my own stuff.

3117
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
There you go.

3118
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Awesome.

3119
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Hey, anything else you're going to be looking for on the PlayStation 3 besides, you know,

3120
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
because you're just now picking one up?

3121
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Anything else you're looking for besides LittleBigPlanet?

3122
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:10,000
I'll probably be picking up some stuff that's come out in the past.

3123
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
One more thought on the whole user-created content.

3124
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Please.

3125
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:18,000
I'm just wondering if it will ever match for the, like, you know, the PC.

3126
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Look at the modding community on the PC and how open that is to everyone.

3127
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Do you think consoles will ever reach that point?

3128
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:30,000
And if we'll see it any time soon?

3129
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Well, you know, they say the PlayStation 3 is just a computer after all.

3130
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:37,000
So who knows?

3131
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
In a way, yes, I think so.

3132
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:45,000
It's funny how these things have come full circle because I remember ten years ago,

3133
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
the Commodore 64 was a computer and its big selling point,

3134
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:53,000
and the reason why the Commodore 64 outsold most other computer systems,

3135
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
you didn't have to have a monitor.

3136
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
You could hook it up to your TV.

3137
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:59,000
So it's very interesting now that we've kind of come full circle now

3138
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:05,000
and we're blurring this line between computers and your televisions in your living room.

3139
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Kind of a very open thought there, but there you have it.

3140
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Well, Solid Goomba, thanks so much for the call and enjoy the PlayStation 3.

3141
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
All right, thanks, man. Have a good one.

3142
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
You too, buddy. Take care.

3143
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
It's very interesting, you know.

3144
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:22,000
So much joking and funny things at Sony's expense,

3145
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:28,000
but LittleBigPlanet's really starting to single-handedly in some ways turn around people's opinions.

3146
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3147
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

3148
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind?

3149
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Just that I got onto the new Xbox Experience preview.

3150
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:45,000
I heard, you lucky bastard. How is it? Are you enjoying it?

3151
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
It's pretty cool.

3152
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:58,000
It's a complete upgrade or a new experience like the title says of the Xbox.

3153
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Tell us like three things that are awesome in it that you can't do now.

3154
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Basically, the parties, the photo and movie parties are pretty awesome.

3155
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I haven't tried it yet, but I have seen other people do it and it's pretty good.

3156
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:23,000
The interface, it's totally revamped. It's easier to use than the old one.

3157
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:33,000
I have still to get accustomed to it, but like I said, it's pretty easy to use the whole interface.

3158
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Huh. Very cool. Have you been able to try the Netflix? I don't know if you do Netflix.

3159
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:44,000
No, because they wouldn't have that in your region, huh? Do they have the Netflix thing?

3160
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Yeah, we don't have Netflix. Heck, we don't have even a video marketplace for that, so I cannot try that.

3161
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:54,000
But I heard it's pretty cool.

3162
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:59,000
I imagine you spend a little time building an avatar. How comprehensive was the avatar system in it?

3163
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:04,000
It's pretty easy to use. It's pretty easy to create an avatar, though.

3164
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:11,000
What I didn't like is the comparison to the Nintendo Miis.

3165
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:19,000
You don't have a whole wide variety to create a personal avatar.

3166
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:35,000
You have predefined or pre-made avatars, and you have to choose the most according to what you want to appear.

3167
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:41,000
So kind of like on the Nintendo Wii, it was really all about the face of the Miis, and you could really customize that.

3168
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:50,000
But because the Xbox avatars are more about the clothes and the accessories, then the faces are limited is kind of the impression I'm getting.

3169
02:57:50,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Yeah, it's kind of limited. You can change the face a little, like glasses, a hat, the hair even, and some stuff.

3170
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:14,000
But not like on the Wii that you have more choices to make.

3171
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Hey, quick question from SSJ100Matt in chat, and I don't know if you'd have the answer to this, but do you know if they increased the friendless limit in it?

3172
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
I don't think they did.

3173
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:30,000
I really don't know. I'm gonna search that, but I think they haven't.

3174
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:37,000
I don't think they have either based on what I heard, but I was just curious. Maybe that's on that list of half the things that got cut. I don't know.

3175
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Well, Akdeft, anything else you want to say about the sneak peek you're getting at the experience?

3176
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Well, it's pretty good. Like I said, I hope we Mexicans could get the Netflix and all the media marketplace things, because that would be pretty awesome.

3177
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:07,000
From what I have seen and what I have played with, it's pretty good. It's a whole new experience for the Xbox.

3178
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Alright, well we'll be pulling for you and hope those features come to Mexico, even though, I don't know, I don't think Netflix does business in Mexico, but at least something equivalent, I don't know, so be nice.

3179
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:17,000
I hope so.

3180
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Alright, well, Akdeft, have a good one, buddy. And have fun playing that experience I can't have right now, because I was too slow to fill out that form before they closed it off, because I'd have surgery.

3181
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Boohoo, QQ, cry cry. One more call. Well, I said two, but I'm feeling nice. Do one more call.

3182
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:43,000
1877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3183
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Do you have any other quick last minute stories for us, Loki?

3184
02:59:46,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Yeah, there's one that was sent in to me. Apparently the Melger Solid technical advisor has been jailed for using his military address to order parts and ship them to foreign nations.

3185
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Interesting. Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3186
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Oh, it's Spazinator.

3187
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:10,000
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

3188
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Yeah, I had a couple questions to you and one comment. In terms of my questions, I was wondering, do you know of any websites that sell like video game soundtracks?

3189
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:40,000
The reason I ask is because all the stores near me very rarely, if ever, have soundtracks and I'm kind of a soundtrack nerd.

3190
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Video game soundtracks. CD Japan still in business? It's been years since I bought one.

3191
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
I'm sure they are.

3192
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Yeah, that would be one. There's other Japanese based sites too. I'm kind of looking at the chat to help fill things in there.

3193
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Amazon Japan, I've ordered CD's from them before.

3194
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Playasia, that's right. Playasia soundtracks. Definitely Playasia, check them out. Because they sell games too if you want to get import games and all that stuff.

3195
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
So they specialize in that stuff.

3196
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
And toys.

3197
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:18,000
There you go. So there's some sites to check out. And keep an eye on our chat room because they're spitting out a bunch of others too.

3198
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Also, as far as Guitar Hero will tour, I don't know if you have the PlayStation 3 version or not. Have you noticed any issues with the main menu at all where the graphics and the menu would essentially glitch out?

3199
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:52,000
No, I don't even own the game at all yet. And when I do get it, I'll probably get it on 360 because that's where I have all my rock band games and I want the guitar to be compatible with everything.

3200
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:59,000
But I haven't heard anything of that specifically. I've been hearing of bugs left and right in Guitar Hero.

3201
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:08,000
But not anything with the menu. Although, something about I'm hearing band mode. Are you seeing this most often when you're playing as a full band or by yourself?

3202
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Well, so far just myself. One thing I noticed is that the initial logos and loading screen and whatnot will appear normal.

3203
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:39,000
But as soon as you get into the actual menu where there's solo play, options, so on and so forth, that's when the background gets all wonky. You can't even see what you're selecting. Stuff like that.

3204
03:02:39,000 --> 03:03:00,000
You know, I haven't heard of anything. I would say my best suggestion would be go look on the Guitar Hero forums and see if there's others that are having similar problems to you. I don't know if that's a defect on the disc or if it's a defect in the game that has to be patched. Frankly, that scenario wouldn't surprise me at all, sadly, in this day and age of, oh, we'll just patch it to fix it.

3205
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:04,000
And you said you had a comment or another question?

3206
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Yeah, also on the new guitar and the old guitar from Guitar Hero 3, I noticed that there was some kind of jack or port towards the bottom of the guitar. Do you know what that's for?

3207
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:36,000
I think initially they were going to put in some type of pedal. Didn't we talk about this on the show a long time ago? You know that expansion port on the bottom of the Explorer controller? They never used it. Wasn't it going to be for an Effector pedal at one point?

3208
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Yeah, and they even set it in the Guitar Hero 2 manual.

3209
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:49,000
But it just never happened. Never materialized. They opted for the fog machines instead. Which, by the way, whatever happened to our rock band fog machine?

3210
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:56,000
It came out, I think. Did it really? I think it did. Why are we not in possession of one? Because they're a hundred bucks. So? And I haven't thought about buying it yet.

3211
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:06,000
I want a rock band fog machine so when we start Orange Lounge Radio, I come through a mist of fog. It's going to fuck up your computer, but we can do it if you want. Maybe not.

3212
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Yeah, actually, I see it mentioned, the fog machine mentioned, and I think it was either Game Informer or official Xbox magazine, I forget which. And this was maybe a month, maybe two months ago. And I think they may list a website where you can buy it. I can look it up and email you a link or something.

3213
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:53,000
It got really good reviews, too, because they actually made it. It's not just something that randomly does it with sound or whatever. They programmed in triggers in Rock Band 1 and 2 that will trigger different lighting and smoke effects based on what's going on in the game.

3214
03:04:53,000 --> 03:05:05,000
That's so rad. It will actually sync up with it, and it's pretty awesome. I think they are available now. In fact, I should probably get one when I get my bonus. That'd be funny.

3215
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:11,000
First thing that comes up, Rock Band Stage Kid, available right now on GameStop.com. It will cost you twenty bucks to ship it, though.

3216
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Why do we need this? Because, spoken lights! If you want me to gag, then get one. I just won't be here for whatever episode that's here for.

3217
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:47,000
I just want one in my house. No, I'm just kidding. We're not gonna waste the money on this. Loki, do not waste money on this. Ooh, alright. He's gonna do it. Hey, Spaznator, we gotta go and wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Take care, buddy.

3218
03:05:47,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Alright, sorry to those that didn't get through. I know there were a lot of people still trying to get through. It happens. Alright, yeah, you're right. You don't need it. Alright, any more last minute stories? I'm sorry, Loki. Or Dark Soccer. I don't know if you have any that you found.

3219
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Five. Is your last minute story? Yes. Awesome. There's also a glitch in Little Big Planet that will ruin your game.

3220
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Apparently, if you make a spinning wheel that's set at max speed, and you get hit by it, it can possibly cause you to get stuck in a death loop where you'll keep dying. Even if you exit out of that level, you'll keep dying in the pod, and you'll have to delete your save game for it to fix.

3221
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Oh man, that sucks. So, remember, once again, because- Oh god, and people are gonna put that shit on the internet. There'll be those custom levels. Hold on, hold on. Just remember, your PS3, it's so easy to back up saves on there just to a USB memory card or something like that. Just back up your save. That's all you gotta do.

3222
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Yes, people could- Well, here's the thing. If you spawn in the level, and you see a giant death wheel, don't walk into it. Just quit the game and say, fuck this. So wheels at max speed could be a bad thing. A giant death wheel. Don't make a towering death a wheel.

3223
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:14,000
There were some pretty evil levels on LittleBigPlanet. There was a ninja level I was playing today that just tries its hardest. It was as hard as those crazy games online that I want to be the guy and all that stuff that are just crazy fucking hard.

3224
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:35,000
I was watching some of the levels on YouTube here. I'm just kinda going through some of them. One of them, of course, anybody would do this since it's insensitive, so obviously they're gonna do it. There's a 9-11 level where the guy flings a thing through buildings and I think he's dressed up like an Arab as well.

3225
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:47,000
The guy that did the Gradius level, he also did a Kaneda bike from Akira that looks pretty awesome. He also did a Tetris level that looks really awesome.

3226
03:07:47,000 --> 03:08:04,000
And a BeatMania level. No, no BeatMania level. No, Bobby said on his show he did a BeatMania level as well. Really? Yeah. It's kinda crap, but it's supposedly BeatMania inspired. There's a good way to put it. But he says you won't find it on YouTube, it's in the game.

3227
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:16,000
I was gonna show you this one real quick here, Rob. It's got poops in it and a butt that poops out those little Japanese cute little doody things.

3228
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Oh please, please, I really want to see this. Hold on, I gotta find the part where it's at here. Please put this radio show completely on hold so I can look at a video of pooping in LittleBigPlanet.

3229
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Okay, as you can see the butt right there. Can I just start it? Yeah, just start it. Okay. Did I hit it? Start. Oh. Little turds fall out.

3230
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Wow, that's... And it's a poo monster! That's amazing. Oh yeah. What will they think of next? I'm so glad that LittleBigPlanet will...

3231
03:08:53,000 --> 03:09:05,000
And then they have this other one that some guy made. It's like K-Truck Race that looks pretty awesome. It's a bunch of trucks that you get in and have a little off-road race. It's like Excite Truck, but not.

3232
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:15,000
Alright, we're gonna get out of here. We gotta wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts before we're out of here. DarkSoccer, your final thought is poop. Loki, your final thought?

3233
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,000
My final thought is I actually gotta start messing with this editor now. Looks awesome.

3234
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:32,000
My final thought is pie. And for those of you guys that have listened to us, be it on the podcast or the live feed, staying up or staying awake with us for the past three hours to listen to the show, thanks a lot.

3235
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:44,000
You know, all we ask is just tell two friends about the show because that's how we spread the word of our show is through word of mouth. And through such awesome iTunes reviews, five-star iTunes reviews, BocoFett wrote a really nice one this week.

3236
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:58,000
The hosts are true gamers who are active in the gaming world. The radio show involves the listeners through multiple avenues and give a distinct wide range of opinion, especially from those in chat who act as the fourth host.

3237
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:08,000
Overall, the show feels like a family who you may have never met but you know well. Aww. Almost makes you want to barf. It's so nice. No, but thank you very much for that nice review. Hope to see you soon.

3238
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I feel squishy, Rob. I need to go to the bathroom now.

3239
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:24,000
All right. You need to open up your poppet and hit the explode button. Little big planet joke. Anyhow, until next week, God, we've told you about 50 games you need to go out and play right now. Everything from Symphony of the Night to Little Big Planet.

3240
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:31,000
So go play some games and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
